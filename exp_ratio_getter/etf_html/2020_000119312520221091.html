<div>The iShares Core International Aggregate Bond ETF (the
“Fund”) seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of global non-U.S. dollar-denominated investment-grade bonds that mitigates exposure to fluctuations between the value of the component currencies and the U.S.
dollar.</div> <div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you
will incur if you buy, hold and sell shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides
that BFA will pay all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions,
including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses.</div>
<div>You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and other
fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the tables and examples below.</div> <div>

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund
may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are
held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 12% of the
average value of its portfolio.</font></div> <div>Principal
Investment Strategies</div> <div>The Fund seeks to track the
investment results of the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate ex USD 10% Issuer Capped (Hedged) Index (the “Underlying Index”), which measures the performance of the global investment-grade (as determined by Bloomberg Index Services
Limited (the “Index Provider” or “Bloomberg”)) bond market. As of October 31, 2019, there were 10,978 issues in the Underlying Index. The Underlying Index includes investment-grade fixed-rate sovereign and government-related
debt, corporate and securitized bonds from both developed and emerging market issuers. Securities included in the Underlying Index are issued in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, must have maturities of at least one year and are required to
meet minimum outstanding issue size criteria. The Underlying Index is market capitalization-weighted with a cap on each issuer of 10%. Debt that is publicly issued in the global and regional markets is included in the Underlying Index. Certain types
of securities, such</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>as USD-denominated bonds, contingent capital securities, inflation-linked
bonds, floating-rate issues, fixed-rate perpetuals, retail bonds, structured notes, pass-through certificates, private placements (other than those offered pursuant to Rule 144A or Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the “1933 Act”)), sinkable Russian OFZ bonds issued prior to 2009 and securities where reliable pricing is unavailable are excluded from the Underlying Index. The securities in the Underlying Index are updated on the last
business day of each month, and the currency risk of the securities in the Underlying Index are hedged to the U.S. dollar on a monthly basis. As of October 31, 2019, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by non-U.S.
government-related bonds and non-U.S. corporate bonds. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index was comprised of securities issued by
governments in 59 countries or regions as well as securities issued or guaranteed by supranational entities as of October 31, 2019.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio</div>

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities or other instruments comprising an applicable underlying index. The securities selected are expected to have, in
the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market value and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability, duration, maturity, credit ratings and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those
of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities and other components of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its assets in
the component securities and other instruments of the Underlying Index and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its
affiliates (“BlackRock Cash Funds”), as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. From time to time when conditions warrant, however, the Fund may
invest at least 80% of its assets in the component securities and other instruments of the Underlying Index and may invest up to 20% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of
BlackRock Cash Funds, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index.</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Components of the Underlying Index include fixed-income securities and foreign
currency forward contracts (both deliverable and non-deliverable) designed to hedge non-U.S. currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. The notional exposure to foreign currency forward contracts (both deliverable and non-deliverable) generally
will be a short position that hedges the currency risk of the fixed-income portfolio. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index sells forward the total value of the
underlying non-U.S. dollar currencies at a one-month forward rate to hedge against fluctuations in the relative value of the non-U.S. dollar component currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar. The hedge is reset on a monthly basis. The Underlying
Index is designed to have higher returns than an equivalent unhedged investment when the non-U.S. dollar component currencies are weakening relative to the U.S. dollar and appreciation in some of the non-U.S. dollar component currencies does not
exceed the aggregate depreciation of the others. Conversely, the Underlying Index is designed to have lower returns than an equivalent unhedged investment when the non-U.S. dollar component currencies, on a net basis, are rising relative to the U.S.
dollar.</div> <div>In order to track the “hedging”
component of the Underlying Index, the Fund enters into foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the Fund’s exposure to the non-U.S. dollar component currencies. A foreign currency forward contract is a contract between two
parties to buy or sell a specified amount of a specific currency</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-3</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>in the future at an agreed-upon exchange rate. The Fund's exposure to foreign
currency forward contracts is based on the aggregate exposure of the Fund to the non-U.S. dollar component currencies. While this approach is designed to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations on Fund returns, it does not necessarily eliminate
the Fund’s exposure to the non-U.S. dollar component currencies. The return of the foreign currency forward contracts may not perfectly offset the actual fluctuations in value between the non-U.S. dollar component currencies and the U.S.
dollar.</div> <div>The Fund may also use non-deliverable forward
(“NDF”) contracts to execute its hedging transactions. An NDF is a contract where there is no physical settlement of two currencies at maturity. Rather, based on the movement of the currencies and the contractually agreed upon exchange
rate, a net cash settlement will be made by one party to the other in U.S. dollars.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by Bloomberg, which
is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities), repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government
securities, and securities of</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>state or municipal governments and their political subdivisions are not
considered to be issued by members of any industry.</div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share
(“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or other asset
classes.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this
prospectus (the “Prospectus”)) may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption transactions. The Fund has a limited
number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that
Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, Fund shares may be more likely to trade
at a</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-4</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting.
Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened for exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that have lower trading
volumes.</div> <div>Call Risk<font>.
</font><font>During periods of falling interest rates, an issuer of a callable bond held by the Fund may “call” or repay the security before its stated maturity, and the Fund may have to
reinvest the proceeds in securities with lower yields, which would result in a decline in the Fund's income, or in securities with greater risks or with other less favorable features.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, project types, group of project types, sector or asset
class.</font></div> <div>Credit
Risk<font>.</font><font> Debt issuers and other counterparties may be unable or unwilling to make timely interest and/or principal payments when due or otherwise honor their
obligations. Changes in an issuer’s credit rating or the market’s perception of an issuer’s creditworthiness may also adversely affect the value of the Fund’s investment in that issuer. The degree of credit risk depends on an
issuer's or counterparty's financial condition and on the terms of an obligation.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Currency Hedging Risk.<font> In seeking to track the “hedging” component of the Underlying Index, the Fund invests in currency forward contracts (which may include both physically-settled forward contracts and NDFs)
designed to hedge the currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in its portfolio. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between
the derivative and its reference asset, and there can be no assurance that the Fund’s hedging transactions will be effective.</font></div>
<div>Exchange rates may be volatile and may change quickly and
unpredictably in response to both global economic developments and economic conditions in a geographic region in which the Fund invests. In addition, in order to minimize transaction costs, or for other reasons, the Fund’s exposure to the
non-U.S. dollar component currencies may not be fully hedged at all times. At certain times, the Fund may use an optimized hedging strategy and will hedge a smaller number of non-U.S. dollar component currencies to reduce hedging costs. Because
currency forwards are over-the-counter instruments, the Fund is subject to counterparty risk as well as market or liquidity risk with respect to the hedging transactions the Fund enters into.</div>
<div>The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy
will in general be affected by the volatility of both the Underlying Index and the volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies to be hedged, measured on an aggregate basis. Increased volatility in either or both of the Underlying Index
and the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies to be hedged will generally reduce the</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-5</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy. In addition,
volatility in one or more of the currencies may offset stability in another currency and reduce the overall effectiveness of the hedges. The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy may also in general be affected by interest
rates. Significant differences between U.S. dollar interest rates and some or all of the applicable foreign currency interest rates may impact the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy.</div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if one or more of the currencies of the non-U.S. markets in which the Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar
and the depreciation of one currency is not offset by appreciation in another currency and/or the Fund's attempt to hedge currency exposure to the depreciating currency or currencies is unsuccessful. Generally, an increase in the value of the U.S.
dollar against the non-U.S. dollar component currencies will reduce the value of a security denominated in such currencies, as applicable. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rates between currencies could affect the economy or particular
business operations of companies in a geographic region, including securities in which the Fund invests, causing an adverse impact on the Fund’s investments in the affected region and the U.S. As a result, investors have the potential for
losses regardless of the length of time they intend to hold Fund shares. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may change quickly and without warning.</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Cybersecurity Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, the Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of
securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established
business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems of the
Fund’s Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>Derivatives Risk. <font>The Fund will use currency forwards and NDFs to hedge the currency exposure resulting from investments in the foreign currency-denominated securities held by the Fund. The Fund’s use of these
instruments, like investments in other derivatives, may reduce the Fund’s returns, increase volatility and/or result in losses due to credit risk or ineffective hedging strategies. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, a
currency, an index or a market, to fluctuate significantly in price within a defined time period. Currency forwards, like other derivatives, are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not
fulfill its contractual obligation.</font></div> <div>A risk of the
Fund’s use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the value of the currency or currencies being</div> </div> <div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>S-6</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>hedged as compared to that of the U.S. dollar. The possible lack of a liquid
secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund to value accurately. The Fund could
also suffer losses related to its derivatives positions as a result of unanticipated market movements, which losses are potentially unlimited. BFA’s use of derivatives is not intended to predict the direction of securities prices, currency
exchange rates, interest rates and other economic factors, which could cause the Fund’s derivatives positions to lose value. Derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs.
Regulatory requirements may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, and may delay or restrict the exercise of remedies by the Fund upon a counterparty default under derivatives held by the Fund (which could result in
losses), remedies or termination rights by the Fund, and may otherwise adversely affect the value and performance of derivatives.</div>
<div>Extension Risk. <font>During periods of rising interest rates, certain debt obligations may be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated and the value of those securities may fall sharply, resulting in a
decline in the Fund’s income and potentially in the value of the Fund’s investments.</font></div>
<div>Geographic Risk<font>.</font><font> A natural disaster could occur in a geographic region in which the Fund invests, which could adversely affect the economy or the business operations of companies in the specific geographic region,
causing an adverse impact on the Fund's</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>investments in, or which are exposed to, the affected region.</div>
<div>Illiquid Investments
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may invest up to an aggregate amount of 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the Fund
reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the investment. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid
investments may reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be unable to transact at advantageous times or prices. During periods of market volatility, liquidity in the market for the Fund’s shares may be impacted by the liquidity in
the market for the underlying securities or instruments held by the Fund, which could lead to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to the Fund’s NAV.</font></div>
<div>Income Risk.
<font>The Fund's income may decline if interest rates fall. This decline in income can occur because the Fund may subsequently invest in lower-yielding bonds as bonds in its portfolio mature, are near
maturity or are called, bonds in the Underlying Index are substituted, or the Fund otherwise needs to purchase additional bonds.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data,</font></div> </div>

<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>index computations or the construction of the Underlying Index in accordance
with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market conditions may cause the
Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance, which could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition.</div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk.<font> An outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus has resulted in travel restrictions, disruption of healthcare systems, prolonged quarantines, cancellations,
supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings downgrades, defaults and other significant economic impacts. Certain markets have experienced temporary closures, extreme volatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity and increased
trading costs. These events will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and could impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities or cause elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV.
Other infectious illness outbreaks in the future may result in similar impacts.</font></div>
<div>Interest Rate Risk<font>.</font><font> During periods of very low or negative interest rates, the Fund may be unable to maintain positive returns or pay dividends to Fund shareholders. Very low or negative interest rates may magnify
interest rate risk. Changing interest rates, including rates that fall below zero, may have unpredictable effects on markets, result in heightened market volatility and detract from the Fund’s performance to the extent the Fund is exposed to
such</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>interest rates. Additionally, under certain market conditions in which
interest rates are low and the market prices for portfolio securities have increased, the Fund may have a very low, or even negative yield. A low or negative yield would cause the Fund to lose money in certain conditions and over certain time
periods. An increase in interest rates will generally cause the value of securities held by the Fund to decline, may lead to heightened volatility in the fixed-income markets and may adversely affect the liquidity of certain fixed-income
investments, including those held by the Fund. The historically low interest rate environment heightens the risks associated with rising interest rates.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities and other instruments to which the Fund has exposure.The Fund may be adversely affected if an issuer of underlying
securities held by the Fund is unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities or counterparty on other instruments may cause the value of the
securities or instruments to decline.</font></div> <div>Management
Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended
results.</font></div> <div>Market
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Local,
regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>illness or other public health issue, recessions, or other events could have a
significant impact on the Fund and its investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV.</div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, losses due to ineffective currency hedges,
periods of high volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>Non-Diversification Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may invest a large percentage of its assets in securities issued by or representing a small number of issuers. As a result, the Fund's performance may depend on the performance of a small
number of issuers.</font></div> <div>Non-U.S. Issuers Risk. <font>Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers carry different risks from securities issued by U.S. issuers. These risks include differences in accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards, the
possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation, adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations, political instability, regulatory and economic differences, and potential restrictions on the flow of international capital. The
Fund is specifically exposed to</font><font> Asian Economic Risk </font><font>and </font><font>European Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>communication errors, errors of the Fund’s service providers,
counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible
risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Privately Issued Securities Risk. <font>The Fund may invest in privately issued securities, including those that are normally purchased pursuant to Rule 144A or Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“1933 Act”). Privately issued securities are securities that have not been registered under the 1933 Act and as a result may be subject to legal restrictions on resale. Privately issued securities are generally not traded on established
markets. As a result of the absence of a public trading market, privately issued securities may be deemed to be illiquid investments, may be more difficult to value than publicly traded securities and may be subject to wide fluctuations in value.
Delay or difficulty in selling such securities may result in a loss to the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund invests in countries or regions whose economies are heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in this trading may have
an adverse impact on the Fund's investments. Through its</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>holdings of securities of certain issuers, the Fund is specifically exposed to
<font>Asian Economic Risk, European Economic Risk and North American Economic Risk.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries<font>. </font><font>The Fund’s investment in developed country issuers may subject the Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and other risks associated
with developed countries. Developed countries tend to represent a significant portion of the global economy and have generally experienced slower economic growth than some less developed countries. Certain developed countries have experienced
security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents involving a country’s or region’s security may cause uncertainty in its markets and may adversely affect its economy and the Fund’s investments.
In addition, developed countries may be adversely impacted by changes to the economic conditions of certain key trading partners, regulatory burdens, debt burdens and the price or availability of certain commodities.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Russia. <font>Investing in Russian securities involves significant risks, including legal, regulatory and economic risks that are specific to Russia. In addition, investing in Russian securities involves risks
associated with the settlement of portfolio transactions and loss of the Fund’s ownership rights in its portfolio securities as a result of the system of share registration and custody in Russia. A number of jurisdictions, including the U.S.,
Canada and the European Union (the “EU”), have imposed economic sanctions on certain Russian individuals and Russian corporate entities. Additionally, Russia</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>is alleged to have participated in state-sponsored cyberattacks against
foreign companies and foreign governments. Actual and threatened responses to such activity, including purchasing restrictions, sanctions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Russian government or Russian companies, may impact Russia’s economy and
Russian issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</div>
<div>Sovereign and Quasi-Sovereign Obligations Risk. <font>The Fund invests in securities issued by or guaranteed by non-U.S. sovereign governments and by entities affiliated with or backed by non-U.S. sovereign governments, which may be unable or unwilling to
repay principal or interest when due. In times of economic uncertainty, the prices of these securities may be more volatile than those of corporate debt obligations or of other government debt obligations.</font></div>
<div>Structural Risk<font>.</font><font> The countries in which the Fund invests may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability.</font></div>
<div>Tax Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund invests in derivatives. The federal income tax treatment of a derivative may not be as favorable as a direct investment in an underlying asset. Derivatives may produce taxable income and
taxable realized gain. Derivatives may adversely affect the timing, character and amount of income the Fund realizes from its investments. As a result, a larger portion of the Fund’s distributions may be treated as ordinary income rather than
as capital gains. In addition, certain derivatives are subject to mark-to-market or straddle provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”).</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>If such provisions are applicable, there could be an increase (or decrease) in
the amount of taxable dividends paid by the Fund. Income from swaps is generally taxable. In addition, the tax treatment of certain derivatives, such as swaps, is unsettled and may be subject to future legislation, regulation or administrative
pronouncements issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”).</div>
<div>As part of the Fund's currency hedging strategy, the Fund may
match foreign currency forward contracts with the non-U.S. dollar denominated securities whose currency risk is intended to be hedged wholly or partially by such contracts. If the Fund were to perform such matching for income tax purposes, this
matching would potentially result in the Fund’s deferral for U.S. federal income tax purposes of the realized gains or losses attributable to foreign currency forward contracts until such gains or losses offset the currency-related losses on
the matched non-U.S. dollar denominated securities. If the IRS were to disagree with such deferral treatment or the matching methodology used, the Fund's income could become undistributed and incur tax liabilities. The Fund may reevaluate, adjust,
begin, or discontinue the matching of such contracts in the future.</div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the
Fund’s valuation</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund’s NAV), transaction
and hedging costs incurred and forward rates achieved by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or other distributions, interest, the requirements to maintain
pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, changes to the Underlying Index and the cost to the Fund of complying with various new or
existing regulatory requirements. These risks may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions in the affected securities and/or foreign exchange markets. In addition, tracking error may result because
the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not, and because the Fund accepts creations and redemptions during time periods between which it is able to adjust its currency hedges, whereas the Underlying Index does not adjust
its hedging during these periods.</div> <div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or unwind of a financial instrument or other asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the
security, instrument or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other instruments that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade
suspensions or for other reasons. In addition, the value of the securities or other instruments in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

those shown, and after-tax returns shown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors or investors who hold shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”). Fund returns after taxes
on distributions and sales of Fund shares are calculated assuming that an investor has sufficient capital gains of the same character from other investments to offset any capital losses from the sale of Fund shares. As a result, Fund returns after

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only be
bought and sold in the secondary market through a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An investor may incur costs
attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for shares of the Fund (ask) when buying or selling shares in the secondary
market (the “bid-ask spread”).<br/> </div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make distributions that may be taxable to
you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA, in which case, your distributions generally will be taxed when withdrawn.</div>
<div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial
Intermediaries</div> <div>If you purchase shares of the Fund through
a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms
and reporting systems or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another
investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.<br/> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
