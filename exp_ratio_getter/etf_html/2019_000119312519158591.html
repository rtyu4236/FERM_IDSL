“General Considerations and Risks” </i></b></font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>The section of the SAI entitled “General Considerations and Risks” is amended to add
the following: </b></font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>Risk of Investing in Saudi Arabia. </b>As of May 29, 2019, certain of the Fund’s Underlying Indexes include Saudi
Arabian equity securities. The ability of foreign investors (such as the Funds) to invest in Saudi Arabian issuers relatively untested. Such ability could be restricted or revoked by the Saudi Arabian government at any time, and unforeseen risks
could materialize due to foreign ownership in such securities. In addition, the Capital Market Authority (“CMA”) places investment limitations on the ownership of Saudi Arabian issuers by foreign investors, including a limitation on a
Fund’s ownership of any single issuer listed on the Saudi Arabian Stock Exchange, which may prevent a Fund from investing in accordance with its strategy and contribute to tracking error against the Underlying Index. These restrictions may be
changed or new restrictions, such as licensing requirements, special approvals or additional foreign taxes, may be instituted at any time. A Fund may not be able to obtain or maintain any such licenses or approvals and may not be able to buy and
sell securities at full value. Major disruptions or regulatory changes could occur in the Saudi Arabian market, any of which could negatively impact a Fund. These risks may be exacerbated, compared to more developed markets, given the limited
history of foreign investment in the Saudi Arabian market. Investments in Saudi Arabia may also be subject to loss due to expropriation or nationalization of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on additional foreign investments and
repatriation of capital. Such heightened risks may include, among others, restrictions on and government intervention in international trade, confiscatory taxation, political instability, including authoritarian and/or military involvement in
governmental decision making, armed conflict, crime and instability as a result of religious, ethnic and/or socioeconomic unrest. Saudi Arabia has privatized, or has begun the process of privatizing, certain entities and industries. Newly privatized
companies may face strong competition from government-sponsored competitors that have not been privatized. In some instances, investors in newly privatized entities have suffered losses due to the inability of the newly privatized entities to adjust
quickly to a competitive environment or changing regulatory and legal standards or, in some cases, due to <font>re-nationalization</font> of such privatized entities. There is no assurance that similar losses will not
recur. Further, under income tax laws imposed by the General Authority of Zakat Tax, dividends paid by a Saudi Arabian company to foreign stockholders are generally subject to a 5% withholding tax (different tax rates may apply pursuant to an
applicable treaty). Saudi Arabia is highly reliant on income from the sale of petroleum and trade with other countries involved in the sale of petroleum, and its economy is therefore vulnerable to changes in foreign currency values and the market
for petroleum. As global demand for petroleum fluctuates, Saudi Arabia may be significantly impacted. In the recent past, the Saudi Arabian government has explored privatization and diversification of the economy in the wake of a diminished
petroleum market. </font></p> <p><font size="2">Like most Middle Eastern governments, the government of Saudi Arabia exercises substantial influence over many aspects of the private
sector. Although liberalization in the wider economy is underway, in many areas it has lagged significantly: restrictions on foreign ownership persists, and the government has an ownership stake in many key industries. The situation is exacerbated
by the fact that Saudi Arabia is governed by an absolute monarchy. Saudi Arabia has historically experienced strained relations with economic partners worldwide, including other countries in the Middle East, due to geopolitical events. Incidents
involving a Middle Eastern country’s or the region’s security, including terrorism, may cause </font></p>

<p><font size="2">
uncertainty in their markets and may adversely affect its economy and a Fund’s investments. Governmental actions in the future could have a significant effect on economic conditions in Saudi
Arabia, which could affect private sector companies and a Fund, as well as the value of securities in a Fund’s portfolio. Any economic sanctions on Saudi Arabian individuals or Saudi Arabian corporate entities, or even the threat of sanctions,
may result in the decline of the value and liquidity of Saudi Arabian securities, a weakening of the Saudi riyal or other adverse consequences to the Saudi Arabian economy. Any sanctions could also result in the immediate freeze of Saudi Arabian
securities and/or funds investing in prohibited assets, impairing the ability of a Fund to buy, sell, receive or deliver those securities and/or assets. In addition, Saudi Arabia’s economy relies heavily on cheap, foreign labor, and changes in
the availability of this labor supply could have an adverse effect on the economy. </font></p> <p><font size="2">The securities markets in Saudi Arabia may not be as developed as
those in other countries. As a result, securities markets in Saudi Arabia are subject to greater risks associated with market volatility, lower market capitalization, lower trading volume, illiquidity, inflation, greater price fluctuations,
uncertainty regarding the existence of trading markets, governmental control and heavy regulation of labor and industry. Shares of certain Saudi Arabian companies tend to trade less frequently than those of companies on exchanges in more developed
markets. Such infrequent trading may adversely affect the pricing of these securities and a Fund’s ability to sell these securities in the future. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">Although the political situation in Saudi Arabia is largely stable, Saudi Arabia has historically experienced political instability, and there remains the
possibility that the stability will not hold in the future or that instability in the larger Middle East region could adversely impact the economy of Saudi Arabia. Instability may be caused by military developments, government interventions in the
marketplace, terrorism, extremist attitudes, attempted social or political reforms, religious differences, or other factors. Additionally, anti-Western views held by certain groups in the Middle East may influence government policies regarding
foreign investment. Further developments in U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia and other Middle-Eastern countries may affect these attitudes and policies. The U.S. is a significant trading partner of, or foreign investor in, Saudi Arabia. As a result,
economic conditions of Saudi Arabia may be particularly affected by changes in the U.S. economy. A decrease in U.S. imports or exports, new trade and financial regulations or tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate or an economic slowdown
in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on the economic conditions of Saudi Arabia and, as a result, securities to which the Fund has exposure. Political instability in North Africa and the larger Middle East region has caused significant
disruptions to many industries. Continued political and social unrest in these areas may negatively affect the value of securities in a Fund’s portfolio. </font></p> <p><font size="2">Certain issuers located in Saudi Arabia may operate in, or have dealings with, countries subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations and/or countries identified by
the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer may sustain damage to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer which operates in, or has dealings with, such countries. A Fund, as an investor in such issuers, will be
indirectly subject to those risks. </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b><i>Change in the Fund’s “Construction and Maintenance of the Underlying Indexes”
