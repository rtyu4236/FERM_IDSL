<div>Investment Objective</div>
<div>The iShares Global Green Bond ETF
        (the “Fund”) seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of global investment-grade green bonds that are issued to fund environmental projects, while mitigating exposure to currency
        fluctuations versus the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the
        fees and expenses that you will incur if you own shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the
        “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides that BFA will pay all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and
        disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses. BFA, the investment
        adviser to the Fund, has contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fee such that the Fund’s total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver will not exceed 0.20% through March 1, 2021. The
        contractual waiver may be terminated prior to March 1, 2021 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA.</div>
<div>You may also incur usual and
        customary brokerage commissions and other charges when buying or selling shares of the Fund, which are not reflected in the Example that follows:</div>

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher
        transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s
        performance. From inception (November 13, 2018) to the most recent fiscal year end, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 21% of the average value of its portfolio.</font></div>
<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the
        investment results of the Bloomberg Barclays MSCI Global Green Bond Select (USD Hedged) Index (the “Underlying Index”), which measures the performance of global investment-grade (as determined by Bloomberg
        Index Services Limited, a subsidiary of Bloomberg Barclays Capital, Inc. (the “Index Provider” or “Bloomberg Barclays”)) green bonds issued to fund projects with direct environmental
        benefits.</div>
<div>Green bonds are fixed income
        securities, the proceeds of which are exclusively and formally applied to</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>projects or activities that promote climate or
        other environmental sustainability purposes. For inclusion in the Underlying Index, securities are independently evaluated by MSCI ESG Research LLC (“MSCI ESG Research”), pursuant to an agreement between
        MSCI ESG Research and Bloomberg Index Services Limited (or an affiliate), based on four criteria specified in the Green Bond Principles published by MSCI ESG Research (“Green Bond Principles”). The first
        criterion for bond eligibility in the Underlying Index is an evaluation of whether the use of proceeds falls within at least one of six eligible environmental categories defined by MSCI ESG Research (<font>i.e.</font>, alternative energy, energy efficiency, pollution prevention and control, sustainable water, green building, and climate adaption). The remaining three criteria for evaluation
        and inclusion in the Underlying Index are the existence of processes for green project evaluation and selection, the existence of processes for management of proceeds, and the existence of a commitment to ongoing
        reporting of the environmental impact.</div>
<div>Both self-labeled green bonds and
        unlabeled bonds are evaluated using these criteria for potential inclusion in the Underlying Index. So long as</div>

<p> </p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>projects fall within an eligible MSCI ESG Research
        green bond category and there is sufficient transparency on the use of proceeds, a bond is considered for the Underlying Index even if it is not explicitly marketed as a green bond. Meeting all four criteria is
        required for bonds issued after the publication of the Green Bond Principles in January 2014. Green bonds issued prior to 2014 that are widely accepted by investors as green bonds may still qualify for the Underlying
        Index, even if not all four principles are satisfied, since no formal guidelines were available to issuers at the time of issuance.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index includes
        sovereign and government-related debt, corporate bonds and securitized bonds denominated in currencies determined by the Index Provider from both developed and emerging market issuers. As of October 31, 2019, the
        Underlying Index was comprised of securities issued by entities in the following 30 countries as well as securities issued or guaranteed by supranational entities: Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China,
        Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia, South Africa, South Korea,
        Spain, the United Arab Emirates and the U.S. As of October 31, 2019, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by sovereign and quasi-sovereign debt obligations and non-U.S. agency debt securities.
        The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index includes
        fixed-rate coupon bonds and bonds that convert from fixed to floating rate, including</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>fixed-to-float perpetuals. Fixed-to-floating rate
        bonds are eligible during their fixed-rate term only. Certain types of securities, such as bonds with equity type features (<font>e.g.</font>, warrants, convertibles, and preferreds), inflation-linked bonds, floating-rate issues, fixed-rate perpetuals, tax-exempt municipal securities, private placements (other than
        those offered pursuant to Rule 144A or Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”)) and retail bonds, are excluded from the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index will hold bonds
        until final maturity. As of October 31, 2019, the weighted average duration of the securities in the Underlying Index was 7.61 years and the weighted average maturity of the securities in the Underlying Index was 9.39
        years. The securities in the Underlying Index are updated on the last business day of each month (the rebalancing date), and the currency risk of the securities in the Underlying Index is hedged to the U.S. dollar on
        a monthly basis.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or
        indexing approach to try to achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive
        positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance
        that the Fund will substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax
        performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>

<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling
        indexing strategy to manage the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities or other instruments comprising an applicable
        underlying index. The securities selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market value and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return
        variability, duration, maturity, credit ratings and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities and other components of the
        Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at
        least 90% of its assets in the component securities and other instruments of the Underlying Index and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,
        including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates (“BlackRock Cash Funds”), as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund
        track the Underlying Index. From time to time when conditions warrant, however, the Fund may invest at least 80% of its assets in the component securities and other instruments of the Underlying Index and may invest
        up to 20% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of BlackRock Cash Funds, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA
        believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Components of the Underlying Index
        include fixed-income securities and</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>foreign currency forward contracts (both
        deliverable and non-deliverable) designed to hedge non-U.S. currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. The notional exposure to foreign currency forward contracts (both deliverable and non-deliverable) generally
        will be a short position that hedges the currency risk of the fixed-income portfolio. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index sells forward
        the total value of the underlying non-U.S. dollar currencies at a one-month forward rate to hedge against fluctuations in the relative value of the non-U.S. dollar component currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar.
        The hedge is reset on a monthly basis. The Underlying Index is designed to have higher returns than an equivalent unhedged investment when the non-U.S. dollar component currencies are weakening relative to the U.S.
        dollar and appreciation in some of the non-U.S. dollar component currencies does not exceed the aggregate depreciation of the others. Conversely, the Underlying Index is designed to have lower returns than an
        equivalent unhedged investment when the non-U.S. dollar component currencies, on a net basis, are rising relative to the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>In order to track the
        “hedging” component of the Underlying Index, the Fund enters into foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the Fund’s exposure to the non-U.S. dollar component currencies. A currency
        forward contract is a contract between two parties to buy or sell a specified amount of a specific currency in the future at an agreed-upon exchange rate. The Fund’s exposure to foreign currency</div>

<p> </p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>forward contracts is based on the aggregate
        exposure of the Fund to the non-U.S. dollar component currencies. While this approach is designed to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations on Fund returns, it does not necessarily eliminate the Fund’s
        exposure to the non-U.S. dollar component currencies. The return of the currency forward contracts may not perfectly offset the actual fluctuations in value between the non-U.S. dollar component currencies and the
        U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>The Fund may also use
        non-deliverable forward (“NDF”) contracts to execute its hedging transactions. An NDF is a contract where there is no physical settlement of two currencies at maturity. Rather, based on the movement of the
        currencies and the contractually agreed-upon exchange rate, a net cash settlement will be made by one party to the other in U.S. dollars.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities
        representing up to one-third of the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by
        Bloomberg Barclays, MSCI ESG Research, or their affiliates, which are independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying
        Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font> The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of
        this</font></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>limitation, securities of the U.S. government
        (including its agencies and instrumentalities), repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities, and securities of state or municipal governments and their political subdivisions are not considered
        to be issued by members of any industry.</div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could
        lose all or part of your investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may
        adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share (“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the
        significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial
        market or other asset classes.</font></div>
<div>Assets Under Management (AUM)
        Risk<font>.</font><font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this prospectus (the “Prospectus”)), a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may
        invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a specific period of time to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</font><font> </font><font>can be no assurance that any such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the
        Fund.</font></div>

<div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration
        Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage
        in creation and/or redemption transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with
        respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units (as defined in the </font><font>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</font><font> section of the Prospectus), Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant
        concentration risk may be heightened for exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that have lower trading
        volumes.</font></div>
<div>Call Risk<font>. </font><font>During periods of falling interest rates, an issuer of a callable bond held by the Fund may “call” or repay the security before its stated maturity, and the
        Fund may have to reinvest the proceeds in securities with lower yields, which would result in a decline in the Fund's income, or in securities with greater risks or with other less favorable features.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole,
        to the extent that the Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities and/or</font></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>other assets of a particular issuer or issuers,
        country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, project types, group of project types, sector or asset class.</div>
<div>Credit Risk<font>.</font><font> Debt issuers and other counterparties may be unable or unwilling to make timely interest and/or principal payments when due or otherwise honor their obligations. Changes
        in an issuer’s credit rating or the market’s perception of an issuer’s creditworthiness may also adversely affect the value of the Fund’s investment in that issuer. The degree of credit risk
        depends on an issuer's or counterparty's financial condition and on the terms of an obligation.</font></div>
<div>Currency Hedging Risk.<font> In seeking to track the “hedging” component of the Underlying Index, the Fund invests in currency forward contracts (which may include both physically-settled
        forward contracts and NDFs) designed to hedge the currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in its portfolio. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains.
        Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and its reference asset, and there can be no assurance that the Fund’s hedging transactions will be effective.</font></div>
<div>Exchange rates may be volatile and
        may change quickly and unpredictably in response to both global economic developments and economic conditions in a geographic region in which the Fund invests. In addition, in order to minimize transaction costs, or
        for other reasons, the Fund’s exposure to the non-U.S. dollar component currencies may not be fully hedged at all times. At certain times, the Fund may use an optimized</div>

<div>hedging strategy and will hedge a smaller number of
        non-U.S. dollar component currencies to reduce hedging costs. Because currency forwards are over-the-counter instruments, the Fund is subject to counterparty risk as well as market or liquidity risk with respect to
        the hedging transactions the Fund enters into.</div>

        Fund’s currency hedging strategy will in general be affected by the volatility of both the Underlying Index and the volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies to be hedged, measured on an aggregate
        basis. Increased volatility in either or both of the Underlying Index and the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies to be hedged will generally reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy.
        In addition, volatility in one or more of the currencies may offset stability in another currency and reduce the overall effectiveness of the hedges. The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy may
        also in general be affected by interest rates. Significant differences between U.S. dollar interest rates and some or all of the applicable foreign currency interest rates may impact the effectiveness of the
        Fund’s currency hedging strategy.</div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if one or more of the currencies of the non-U.S. markets in which the Fund invests
        depreciates against the U.S. dollar and the depreciation of one currency is not offset by appreciation in another currency and/or the Fund's attempt to hedge currency exposure to the depreciating currency or
        currencies is unsuccessful. Generally, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against the non-U.S. dollar component currencies</font></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>will reduce the value of a security denominated in
        such currencies, as applicable. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rates between currencies could affect the economy or particular business operations of companies in a geographic region, including securities
        in which the Fund invests, causing an adverse impact on the Fund’s investments in the affected region and the U.S. As a result, investors have the potential for losses regardless of the length of time they
        intend to hold Fund shares. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may change quickly and without warning.</div>
<div>Cybersecurity Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, the Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized
        Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the
        Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems.
        Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems of the Fund’s Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the
        Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>Derivatives Risk. <font>The Fund’s use of derivatives may reduce the Fund’s returns or increase volatility. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, a currency, an
        index or a</font></div>

<div>
<div>
<div>market to fluctuate significantly in price within a
        short time period. Derivatives may also be subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. Counterparty risk for OTC derivatives is
        generally higher than that for derivatives traded on an exchange or through a clearing house. A risk of the Fund’s use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the
        value of the underlying asset, the performance of the asset class to which the Fund seeks exposure or the performance of the overall markets. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the
        resulting inability of the Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund to value accurately. The Fund could also suffer
        losses related to its derivatives positions as a result of unanticipated market movements, or movements between the time of periodic reallocations of Fund assets, which losses are potentially unlimited. Certain
        derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. To the extent that the Fund invests in rolling futures contracts, it may be subject to additional
        risk. The impact of U.S. and global regulation of derivatives may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, may delay or restrict the exercise by the Fund of termination rights or
        remedies upon a counterparty default under derivatives held by the Fund (which could result in losses), or may otherwise adversely affect the value or performance of derivatives.</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Extension Risk. <font>During periods of rising interest rates, certain debt obligations may be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated and the value of those securities
        may fall sharply, resulting in a decline in the Fund’s income and potentially in the value of the Fund’s investments.</font></div>
<div>Geographic Risk<font>.</font><font> A natural disaster could occur in a geographic region in which the Fund invests, which could affect the economy or particular business operations of companies in the
        specific geographic region, causing an adverse impact on the Fund's investments in, or which are exposed to, the affected region.</font></div>
<div>Green Bond Investment Strategy
        Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund’s investment strategy of investing in green bonds limits the types and number of investment opportunities available to the Fund and, as a result, the Fund
        may underperform other funds that do not have a green bond focus. The Fund’s green bond investment strategy may result in the Fund investing in securities or industry sectors that underperform the market as a
        whole or underperform other funds with a green bond focus. In addition, projects funded by green bonds selected by the Index Provider may not result in direct environmental benefits.</font></div>
<div>Illiquid Investments Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may invest up to an aggregate amount of 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the Fund reasonably expects
        cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the investment. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the
        illiquid investments</font></div>

<div>
<div>
<div>may reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund
        may be unable to transact at advantageous times or prices. During periods of market volatility, liquidity in the market for the Fund’s shares may be impacted by the liquidity in the market for the underlying
        securities or instruments held by the Fund, which could lead to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to the Fund’s NAV.</div>
<div>Income Risk. <font>The Fund's income may decline if interest rates fall. This decline in income can occur because the Fund may subsequently invest in lower-yielding bonds as bonds in its
        portfolio mature, are near maturity or are called, bonds in the Underlying Index are substituted, or the Fund otherwise needs to purchase additional bonds.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its
        investment objective. Market disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index.
        Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a
        period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders.</font></div>
<div>Interest Rate Risk<font>.</font><font> An increase in interest rates may cause the value of securities held by the Fund to decline, may lead to heightened volatility in the fixed-income markets and may
        adversely affect the liquidity of certain</font></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>fixed-income investments. The historically low
        interest rate environment, together with recent modest rate increases, heightens the risks associated with rising interest rates.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities and other instruments to which the Fund has exposure.The Fund may be adversely affected if
        an issuer of underlying securities held by the Fund is unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities or
        counterparty on other instruments may cause the value of the securities or instruments to decline.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Local, regional or global
        events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issue, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments and could result in
        increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s net asset value.</font></div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, losses due to
        ineffective currency hedges, periods of high volatility and disruptions</font></div>

        FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading
        Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities and/or other assets held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities
        exchange on which the Fund’s shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the Fund’s quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV that may be greater than those
        experienced by other ETFs.</font></div>
<div>Non-Diversification Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may invest a large percentage of its assets in securities issued by or representing a small number of issuers. As a result, the Fund's performance may depend on
        the performance of a small number of issuers.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Agency Debt Risk.<font> The Fund invests in uncollateralized bonds issued by agencies, subdivisions or instrumentalities of foreign governments. Bonds issued by foreign government agencies,
        subdivisions or instrumentalities are generally backed only by the general creditworthiness and reputation of the entity issuing the bonds and may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the foreign government.
        Moreover, a foreign government that explicitly provides its full faith and credit to a particular entity may be, due to changed circumstances, unable or unwilling to provide that support. A non-U.S. agency’s
        operations</font></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>and financial condition are influenced by the
        foreign government’s economic and other policies.</div>
<div>Non-U.S. Issuers Risk. <font>Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers carry different risks from securities issued by U.S. issuers. These risks include differences in accounting, auditing and financial
        reporting standards, the possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation, adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations, political instability, regulatory and economic differences, and potential
        restrictions on the flow of international capital. The Fund is specifically exposed to </font><font>European Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the
        Fund’s service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and
        procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Privately Issued Securities Risk.
        <font>The Fund may invest in privately issued securities, including those that are normally purchased pursuant to Rule 144A or Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act
        of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”). Privately</font></div>

<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>issued securities are securities that have not been
        registered under the 1933 Act and as a result may be subject to legal restrictions on resale. Privately issued securities are generally not traded on established markets. As a result of the absence of a public trading
        market, privately issued securities may be deemed to be illiquid investments, may be more difficult to value than publicly traded securities and may be subject to wide fluctuations in value. Delay or difficulty in
        selling such securities may result in a loss to the Fund.</div>
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners
        Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund invests in countries or regions whose economies are heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in this trading may have an adverse impact on
        the Fund's investments. Through its holdings of securities of certain issuers, the Fund is specifically exposed to </font><font>Asian Economic Risk, European Economic Risk and North American Economic Risk.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Developed
        Countries<font>. </font><font>The Fund’s investment in developed country issuers may subject the Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and other risks associated with
        developed countries. Developed countries tend to represent a significant portion of the global economy and have generally experienced slower economic growth than some less developed countries. Certain developed
        countries have experienced security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents involving a country’s or region’s security may cause uncertainty in its markets and may
        adversely affect its economy and the Fund’s investments. In addition,</font></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>developed countries may be adversely impacted by
        changes to the economic conditions of certain key trading partners, regulatory burdens, debt burdens and the price or availability of certain commodities.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in France. <font>The Fund’s investment in French issuers subjects the Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, and economic risks specific to France. Recently, new
        concerns emerged with respect to the economic outlook for certain European Union (the “EU”) countries, including France. External demand for French exports is expected to be negatively impacted by the U.K.
        resolution to leave the EU. As a result, the French economy may experience adverse trends due to concerns about a prolonged economic downturn, potential weakness in exports, high rates of unemployment and rising
        government debt levels. The French economy is dependent on agricultural exports, and as a result, is susceptible to fluctuations in demand for agricultural products. France has experienced several terrorist attacks
        over the past several years, creating a climate of insecurity that has been detrimental to tourism.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return
        the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with
        cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund.</font></div>

<div>
<div>Small Fund Risk. <font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the
        Fund does not meet certain conditions of the listing exchange. Any resulting liquidation of the Fund could cause the Fund to incur elevated transaction costs for the Fund and negative tax consequences for its
        shareholders.</font></div>
<div>Sovereign and Quasi-Sovereign
        Obligations Risk. <font>The Fund invests in securities issued by or guaranteed by non-U.S. sovereign governments and by entities affiliated with or backed by non-U.S. sovereign governments, which
        may be unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due. In times of economic uncertainty, the prices of these securities may be more volatile than those of corporate debt obligations or of other government
        debt obligations.</font></div>
<div>Structural Risk<font>.</font><font> The countries in which the Fund invests may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability.</font></div>
<div>Tax Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund invests in derivatives. The federal income tax treatment of a derivative may not be as favorable as a direct investment in an underlying asset. Derivatives may
        produce taxable income and taxable realized gain. Derivatives may adversely affect the timing, character and amount of income the Fund realizes from its investments. As a result, a larger portion of the Fund’s
        distributions may be treated as ordinary income rather than as capital gains. In addition, certain derivatives are subject to mark-to-market or straddle provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
        “Internal Revenue Code”).</font></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>If such provisions are applicable, there could be
        an increase (or decrease) in the amount of taxable dividends paid by the Fund. Income from swaps is generally taxable. In addition, the tax treatment of certain derivatives, such as swaps, is unsettled and may be
        subject to future legislation, regulation or administrative pronouncements issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”).</div>
<div>As part of the Fund's currency
        hedging strategy, the Fund may match currency forward contracts with the non-U.S. dollar denominated securities whose currency risk is intended to be hedged wholly or partially by such contracts. If the Fund were to
        perform such matching for income tax purposes, this matching would potentially result in the Fund’s deferral for U.S. federal income tax purposes of the realized gains or losses attributable to foreign currency
        forward contracts until such gains or losses offset the currency-related losses on the matched non-U.S. dollar denominated securities. If the IRS were to disagree with such deferral treatment or the matching
        methodology used, the Fund's income could become undistributed and incur tax liabilities. The Fund may reevaluate, adjust, begin, or discontinue the matching of such contracts in the future.</div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of
        differences between the securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a
        security’s price at the local market close and the Fund’s valuation</font></div>

        other distributions, interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index
        and the cost to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. These risks may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions in the affected
        securities and/or foreign exchange markets. In addition, tracking error may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not, and because the Fund accepts creations and redemptions
        during time periods between which it is able to adjust its currency hedges, whereas the Underlying Index does not adjust its hedging during these periods. BFA EXPECTS THAT THE FUND MAY EXPERIENCE HIGHER TRACKING</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>ERROR THAN IS TYPICAL FOR SIMILAR INDEX ETFS.</div>
<div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or unwind of a financial instrument or other asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security,
        instrument or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other instruments that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value
        methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. In addition, the value of the securities or other instruments in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will
        not be able to purchase or sell the Fund's shares. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or
        higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s ability to value investments may be impacted by
        technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</font></div>

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual
        shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange. Most investors will buy and sell shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer. The price of Fund shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares
        trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund will only issue or redeem shares that have been aggregated into blocks of
        50,000 shares or multiples thereof (“Creation Units”) to Authorized Participants who have entered into agreements with the Fund's distributor. The Fund generally will issue or redeem Creation Units in
        return for a designated portfolio of securities (and an amount of cash) that the Fund specifies each day.</div>

<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make
        distributions that may be taxable to you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA, in which case, your distributions generally
        will be taxed when withdrawn.</div>
<div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other
        Financial Intermediaries</div>
<div>If you purchase shares of the Fund
        through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences,
        the development of technology platforms and reporting systems or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other
        intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.</div>
