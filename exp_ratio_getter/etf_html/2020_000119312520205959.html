<div>iShares<sup>®</sup></div>
<div>On March 19, 2014, in connection with the establishment of the
Fund, the Board of Trustees of the Trust approved the planned liquidation, dissolution and termination of the Fund. As a result, the last day of trading in the Fund on NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”) will be September 1, 2020. NYSE Arca
will suspend trading in the Fund before the open of trading on September 2, 2020 and shares of the Fund will no longer be available for new investments as of this date. Proceeds of the liquidation are currently scheduled to be sent to shareholders
on September 4, 2020. The Fund’s final net asset value, as calculated on September 1, 2020, will include any costs associated with the liquidation expected to be borne by the Fund.</div>
<div>Because shares of the Fund will not be traded on NYSE Arca
during the period between September 2, 2020 and September 4, 2020, we cannot assure you that there will be a trading market for your shares. Further, during this period, the Fund will be in the process of closing down and liquidating its portfolio,
which may result in the Fund not being able to track its Underlying Index (by September 2, 2020, the Underlying Index value will be represented almost entirely by cash as no securities will remain in the Underlying Index). After September 1, 2020,
shareholders that remain invested in the Fund will receive the entire amount of their pro rata share of the liquidation proceeds on or about September 4, 2020, subject to their brokerage firm’s processes.</div>
<div>Shareholders may sell their holdings of the Fund prior to
September 2, 2020 and may incur the usual and customary brokerage commissions associated with the sale of Fund shares. If you still hold shares of the Fund on September 4, 2020, the Fund will automatically redeem your shares for cash based on the
net asset value as of the close of business on September 1, 2020, which will include any dividends or distributions calculated as of that date.</div>
<div>If you are subject to federal income tax, the liquidation of
the Fund will result in one or more taxable events for you. A sale or exchange of Fund shares prior to the liquidation will generally give rise to a capital gain or loss to you for federal income tax purposes. In connection with the liquidation, the
Fund may declare tax exempt or taxable distributions of its investment income and/or taxable distributions of its net capital gain. Any liquidation proceeds paid to you should generally be treated as received by you in exchange for your shares and
will therefore generally give rise to a capital gain or loss depending on your tax basis. Please refer to the “Taxes” disclosure beginning on page 66 of the SAI and consult your own tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of the
Fund’s liquidation, including any state, local, foreign or other tax consequences.</div>

<div>The iShares iBonds Sep 2020 Term Muni Bond ETF (the
“Fund”) seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of investment-grade U.S. municipal bonds maturing after May 31 and before September 2, 2020.</div>
<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you
will incur if you own shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides that BFA will pay
all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage
commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses.</div>
<div>You may also incur usual and customary brokerage commissions
and other charges when buying or selling shares of the Fund, which are not reflected in the Example that follows:</div> <div>

then sell all of your shares at the end of those periods. Fund expenses are calculated only through September 1, 2020 because the Fund is scheduled to cease operations and liquidate on or around that date. The Example also assumes that your
investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund’s operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions, your costs would be:</font></div> <div>

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund
may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are
held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 4% of the
average value of its portfolio.</font></div> <div>Principal
Investment Strategies</div> <div>The Fund seeks to track the
investment results of the S&amp;P AMT-Free Municipal Series 2020 Index<sup>TM</sup> (the “Underlying Index”), which measures the performance of
investment-grade (as determined by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC (the “Index Provider” or “SPDJI”)), non-callable U.S. municipal bonds maturing after May 31, 2020 and before September 2, 2020. As of March 31, 2020, there were
4,585 issues in the Underlying Index.</div> <div>The Underlying
Index includes municipal bonds primarily from issuers that are state or local governments or agencies such that the interest on the bonds is exempt from U.S. federal income taxes. The Underlying Index does not include municipal issuers from U.S.
territories, such as Puerto Rico. Each bond must have a rating of at least BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings, Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody's”), or BBB- by Fitch Ratings, Inc. and must have a minimum maturity par
amount of $2 million to be eligible for inclusion in the Underlying Index. To remain in the Underlying Index, bonds must maintain</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>a minimum par amount greater than or equal to $2 million, and must not be
subject to the federal alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) as of each rebalancing date. When a bond in the Underlying Index matures or is pre-refunded, the bond does not accrue interest past the maturity or pre-refunded date. An amount
representing its value at the time of maturity or pre-refunding will be included in the Underlying Index throughout the remaining life of the Underlying Index, and any such amount will be assumed to earn a rate equal to the tax-exempt return of cash
and cash equivalents. The Underlying Index is a market value weighted index and is rebalanced after the market close on the last business day of each month.</div>
<div>The Fund is a series of the iShares iBonds<sup>®</sup> fixed maturity series of bond exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) sponsored by BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”). The iBonds<sup>®</sup> fixed maturity series do not invest in U.S. savings bonds or other U.S. government bonds (except to the extent the funds hold cash equivalent
instruments consistent with their investment objectives) and are not designed to provide protection against inflation.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve</div> </div> <div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>S-2</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio
turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to that of an applicable underlying index. The securities
selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market value and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability, duration, maturity, credit ratings and yield) and
liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its assets in
the component securities of the Underlying Index, except during the last months of the Fund's operations, as described below, and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including
shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates (“BlackRock Cash Funds”), as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. From time to
time when conditions warrant, however, the Fund may invest at least 80% of its assets in the component securities of the Underlying Index and may invest up to 20% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash
equivalents, including shares of BlackRock Cash Funds, as well as in</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will
help the Fund track the Underlying Index. The Fund will generally hold municipal bond securities issued by state and local municipalities whose interest payments are exempt from U.S. federal income tax, the federal AMT and the federal Medicare
contribution tax of 3.8% on “net investment income,” including dividends, interest and capital gains. In the last months of operation, as the bonds held by the Fund mature, the proceeds will not be reinvested in bonds but instead will be
held in cash and cash equivalents, including, without limitation, money market funds affiliated with BFA, AMT-free tax-exempt municipal notes, variable rate demand notes and obligations, tender option bonds and municipal commercial paper. These cash
equivalents may not be included in the Underlying Index. By September 1, 2020, the Underlying Index is expected to consist entirely of cash earned in this manner. Around the same time, the Fund will wind up and terminate, and its net assets will be
distributed to then-current shareholders. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is a product of SPDJI, which is
independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S.
government (including its agencies and instrumentalities), repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities, and securities of state or municipal governments and their political subdivisions are not considered to be issued by
members of any industry.</div> <div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share
(“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or other asset
classes.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this
prospectus (the “Prospectus”)) may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption transactions. The Fund has a limited
number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that
Authorized Participants exit the</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with
respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units (as defined in the <font>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</font> section of the Prospectus), Fund shares
may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting.</div>
<div>Cash Management Risk<font>. </font><font>If a significant amount of the Fund’s assets are invested in cash and cash equivalents, the Fund may underperform other funds that do not similarly invest in cash and cash equivalents for
investment purposes and/or to collateralize derivative instruments.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be susceptible to loss due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's investments are concentrated in the
securities and/or other assets of a particular state, region, municipality, market, project type, industry, group of industries, or asset class.</font></div>
<div>Credit Risk<font>.</font><font> Debt issuers and other counterparties may be unable or unwilling to make timely interest and/or principal payments when due or otherwise honor their obligations. Changes in an issuer’s credit
rating or the market’s perception of an issuer’s creditworthiness may also adversely affect the value of the Fund’s investment in that issuer. The degree of credit risk depends on an issuer's or counterparty's financial condition
and on the terms of an obligation.</font></div> <div>Cybersecurity
Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser,</font></div> </div> <div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>S-4</div> </div> </div> </div>

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>distributor, the Index Provider and other service providers, market makers,
Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the Fund and its
shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the
cybersecurity plans and systems of the Fund’s Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</div>
<div>Declining Yield Risk.<font> During the final three months prior to the Fund's planned termination date, its yield will generally tend to move toward prevailing money market rates, and may be lower than the yields of the bonds
previously held by the Fund and lower than prevailing yields for bonds in the market.</font></div>
<div>Fluctuation of Yield and Liquidation Amount Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund, unlike a direct investment in a municipal bond that has a level coupon payment and a fixed payment at maturity, will make distributions of income that
vary over time. It is expected that an investment in the Fund, if held through maturity, will produce aggregate returns comparable to a direct investment in a group of municipal bonds of similar credit quality and maturity. Unlike a direct
investment in municipal bonds, the breakdown of returns between Fund distributions and liquidation proceeds are not predictable at the time of your investment. For example, at times during the Fund's</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>existence it may make distributions at a greater (or lesser) rate than the
coupon payments received on the Fund's portfolio, which would result in the Fund returning a lesser (or greater) amount on liquidation than would otherwise be the case. The rate of Fund distribution payments may adversely affect the tax
characterization of your returns from an investment in the Fund relative to a direct investment in municipal bonds. If the amount you receive as liquidation proceeds upon the Fund's termination is higher or lower than your cost basis, you may
experience a gain or loss for tax purposes.</div> <div>Illiquid
Investments Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may invest up to an aggregate amount of 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment
that the Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the investment. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the
illiquid investments may reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be unable to transact at advantageous times or prices. During periods of market volatility, liquidity in the market for the Fund’s shares may be impacted by the
liquidity in the market for the underlying securities or instruments held by the Fund, which could lead to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to the Fund’s NAV.</font></div>
<div>Income Risk.
<font>The Fund's income may decline if interest rates fall. This decline in income can occur because the Fund may subsequently invest in lower-yielding bonds as bonds in its portfolio mature, or are near
maturity, bonds in the Underlying Index are substituted</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>with cash or cash equivalents, or the Fund otherwise needs to purchase
additional bonds.</div> <div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of
the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders.
Unusual market conditions may cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance, which could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition.</font></div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk. <font>An outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus has resulted in travel restrictions, disruption of healthcare systems, prolonged quarantines, cancellations,
supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings downgrades, defaults and other significant economic impacts. Certain markets have experienced temporary closures, extreme volatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity and increased
trading costs. These events will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and could impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities or cause elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV.
Other</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>infectious illness outbreaks in the future may result in similar
impacts.</div> <div>Interest Rate
Risk<font>.</font><font> During periods of very low or negative interest rates, the Fund may be unable to maintain positive returns or pay dividends to Fund shareholders. Very
low or negative interest rates may magnify interest rate risk. Changing interest rates, including rates that fall below zero, may have unpredictable effects on markets, result in heightened market volatility and detract from the Fund’s
performance to the extent the Fund is exposed to such interest rates. Additionally, under certain market conditions in which interest rates are low and the market prices for portfolio securities have increased, the Fund may have a very low, or even
negative yield. A low or negative yield would cause the Fund to lose money in certain conditions and over certain time periods. An increase in interest rates will generally cause the value of securities held by the Fund to decline, may lead to
heightened volatility in the fixed-income markets and may adversely affect the liquidity of certain fixed-income investments, including those held by the Fund. The historically low interest rate environment heightens the risks associated with rising
interest rates.</font></div> <div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. The Fund may be adversely affected if an issuer
of underlying securities held by the Fund is unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due. The Fund invests in municipal bonds of issuers that are primarily state or local governments or agencies. Changes to the financial condition or
credit rating of an issuer of</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-6</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>those securities may cause the value of the securities to decline.</div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of
terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issue, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s
NAV.</font></div> <div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets,
periods of high volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>Municipal Securities
Risk<font>.</font><font> Municipal securities can be significantly affected by political or economic changes, including changes made in the law after issuance of the
securities, as well as uncertainties in the municipal market related to taxation, legislative changes or the rights of municipal security holders, including in connection with an issuer insolvency. Municipal securities backed by current or
anticipated revenues from a specific project or specific assets can be negatively affected by the inability to collect</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>revenues from such projects or assets. Certain municipal securities are issued
by entities with limited taxing authority such as school districts, or dependent on revenue from a particular sector or industry, such as the utilities sector, infrastructure sector, or transportation industry.</div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund’s service providers,
counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible
risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the
U.S<font>.</font><font> Certain changes in the U.S. economy, such as when the U.S. economy weakens or when its financial markets decline, may have an adverse effect on the
securities to which the Fund has exposure.</font></div> <div>Tax Risk<font>.</font><font> There is no guarantee that the Fund's income will be exempt from U.S. federal income taxes, the federal AMT or the federal Medicare contribution tax of 3.8% on
“net investment income.”</font></div> <div>Tracking Error
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error
may occur because of differences between the securities and</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-7</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the
Underlying Index, pricing differences, transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest, the requirements to maintain pass-through
tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, use of custom baskets, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing
regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not.</div>
<div>Valuation Risk.<font> The sale price the Fund could receive for a security may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or assets
that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology. Because the bond market may be open on days or during time periods when the Fund does not price its shares, the value of the securities or other assets
in the Fund’s portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s shares.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<td>After-tax returns in the
table above are calculated using the historical highest individual U.S. federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state or local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor’s tax situation and may differ from
those shown, and after-tax returns shown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors or investors who hold shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”). Fund returns after taxes
on distributions and sales of Fund shares are calculated assuming that an investor has sufficient capital gains of the same character from other investments to offset any capital losses from the sale of Fund shares. As a result, Fund returns after
taxes on distributions and sales of Fund shares may exceed Fund returns before taxes and/or returns after taxes on distributions. </td></tr></table> </div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund are listed on
a national securities exchange. Most investors will buy and sell shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer. The price of Fund shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a
price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund will only issue or redeem shares that have been aggregated into blocks of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof (“Creation Units”) to Authorized Participants who
have entered into agreements with the Fund's distributor. The Fund generally issues Creation Units in exchange for cash and generally redeems (and reserves the right to issue) Creation Units in return for a designated portfolio of securities (and an
amount of cash) that the Fund specifies each day. As the planned termination date of the Fund approaches, and particularly as the bonds held by the Fund begin to mature, the Fund expects to effect both creations and redemptions increasingly for
cash.<br/> </div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make distributions primarily from net
tax-exempt income, although distributions of taxable capital gains may also occur.<font> The Fund is generally not an appropriate investment for a 401(k) plan or an IRA</font>. Please consult your personal tax
advisor.</div> <div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial
Intermediaries</div> <div>If you purchase shares of the Fund through
a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms
and reporting systems or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another
investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.<br/> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
