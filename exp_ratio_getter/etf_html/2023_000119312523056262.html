<div>The iShares Investment Grade Corporate Bond BuyWrite Strategy
ETF (the “Fund”) seeks to track the investment results of an index that reflects a strategy of holding the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF while writing (selling) one-month call options to generate income.</div>
<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you
will incur if you buy, hold and sell shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides
that BFA will pay all operating expenses of the Fund, except: (i) the management fees, (ii) interest expenses, (iii) taxes, (iv) expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio
transactions, including brokerage commissions, (v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi) litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses. The Fund may incur “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses.” Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses reflect
the Fund's <font>pro rata</font> share of the fees and expenses incurred indirectly by the Fund as a result of investing in other investment companies. The impact of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses is included in the total
returns of the Fund. Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses are not included in the calculation of the ratio of expenses to average net assets shown in the <font>Financial Highlights</font> section of the Fund's prospectus (the
“Prospectus”). BFA, the investment adviser to the Fund, has contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees so that the Fund’s total annual fund operating expenses after the fee waiver is equal to the Acquired Fund
Fees and Expenses attributable to the Fund’s investment in the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (“LQD” or the “Underlying Fund”), after taking into account any fee waivers by LQD, plus 0.20% through
February 29, 2028. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to February 29, 2028 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA.</div>
<div>You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and other
fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the tables and examples below.</div> <div>

<div>Example. <font>This Example is
intended to help you compare the cost of owning shares of the Fund with the cost of investing in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then sell all of your shares at the end of those
periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund’s operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions, your costs would

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund or the Underlying
Fund may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate for the Fund or the Underlying Fund may indicate higher transaction costs and may
cause the Fund or the Underlying Fund to incur increased expenses. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example (except costs to the Underlying Fund included as part of Acquired Fund Fees and
Expenses), affect the Fund’s performance. From inception (August 18, 2022) to the most recent fiscal year end, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 0% of the average value of its portfolio. To the extent the Underlying Fund incurs costs from
high portfolio turnover, such costs may have a negative effect on the performance of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Cboe LQD
BuyWrite Index (the “Underlying Index”), which is provided by Cboe Global Indices, LLC (the “Index Provider” or “Cboe”) and is designed to measure the performance of a strategy of holding the Underlying</div>
</div> <div type="Block">
<div>Fund while writing (selling) one-month call options on the Underlying Fund to
generate income. A strategy of holding a stock or basket of stocks and selling call options that reference the stock or basket of stocks is commonly known as a “covered call” or “buy-write” strategy. </div>
<div>The Underlying Index utilizes “European-style” call
options. Each call option in the Underlying Index has a strike price closest to 100% of the closing value of the Underlying Fund one day prior to the “roll date. The roll date is the day that the Underlying Index closes out open call option
positions by purchasing the offsetting call option positions and subsequently writes new call options that will expire the following month. The roll date is the business day preceding the expiration date of the options in the Underlying Index. The
Fund will write options that trade on national securities exchanges. Unlike American-style options, European-style options can only be exercised on the expiration date.</div>
<div>The Fund will seek to write call options up to (but not
exceeding) the full amount of shares of the Underlying Fund held in the Fund (<font>i.e.</font>, the short position in the call option is offset, or “covered,” by the long position the Fund holds in shares of
the Underlying Fund). By writing a call option, the Fund</div> </div> </div> <div>  </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-2</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>receives a premium and gives the purchaser of the option the right to purchase
shares of the Underlying Fund at the strike price of the option at expiration. However, the Fund does not expect to physically settle outstanding option positions as it will generally purchase offsetting call options on the roll date as necessary to
close out the open call position(s). By writing the call option(s), the Fund will not participate in market gains of the Underlying Fund above the strike price but will fully participate in any market losses if the Underlying Fund declines in
value.</div> <div>As of October 31, 2022, a significant portion of
the Underlying Index is indirectly represented through its holdings in the Underlying Fund by securities of companies in the consumer staples and financials industries or sectors.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover
low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund and the Underlying Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment
profile similar to that of an applicable underlying index. The securities selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market value and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such
as return variability, duration (<font>i.e.</font>, a security's price sensitivity to a change in interest rates), maturity or credit ratings and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying
index. The Fund and the Underlying Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the applicable Underlying Index. In addition, the Fund may write options on different dates than the Underlying Index’s roll date and may write different
options than those included in the Underlying Index but that have investment characteristics, fundamental characteristics and liquidity measures, in the aggregate, similar to those in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by Cboe and
is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government
securities are not</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share
(“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or other asset
classes.</font></div> <div>Assets Under Management (AUM) Risk<font>.</font><font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this Prospectus), a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a specific period
of time to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There can be no assurance that any such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the
Fund.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption
transactions. The Fund has</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an
agency basis (<font>i.e.,</font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund
and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be
heightened for exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that have lower trading volumes.</div>
<div>Calculation Methodology Risk. <font>The Index Provider relies on various sources of information to assess the criteria of components of the Underlying Index, including information that may be based on assumptions and estimates. Neither
the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances that the Index Provider’s calculation methodology or sources of information will provide an accurate assessment of included components.</font></div>
<div>Call Risk<font>. </font><font>During periods of falling interest rates, an issuer of a callable bond held by the Underlying Fund may “call” or repay the security before its stated maturity, and the Underlying Fund may
have to reinvest the proceeds in securities with lower yields, which would result in a decline in the Fund's or Underlying Fund's income, or in securities with greater risks or with other less favorable features.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events</font></div> </div> <div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>S-4</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to
the extent that the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector, market
segment or asset class.</div> <div>Consumer Staples Sector Risk.<font> The consumer staples sector may be affected by, among other things, marketing campaigns, changes in consumer demands, government regulations and changes in commodity prices.</font></div>
<div>Covered Call Option Risk. <font>By writing covered call options in return for the receipt of premiums, the Fund will give up the opportunity to benefit from potential increases in the value of the Underlying Fund above the exercise
prices of the written options, but will continue to bear the risk of declines in the value of the Underlying Fund. The premiums received from the options may not be sufficient to offset any losses sustained from the volatility of the Underlying Fund
over time. In addition, the Fund’s ability to sell shares of the Underlying Fund will be limited while the option is in effect unless the Fund extinguishes the option position through the purchase of an offsetting identical option prior to the
expiration of the written option.</font></div> <div>The covered call
strategy may be subject to imperfect matching or price correlation between the written options and the Underlying Fund, which could reduce the Fund’s returns. Exchanges may suspend the trading of options (for example due to volatile markets or
if trading in the Underlying Fund is halted). If trading is suspended, the</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Fund may be unable to write or purchase options at times that may be desirable
or advantageous to the Fund to do so. If the Fund is unable to extinguish the option position before exercise, the Fund may be required to deliver the corresponding shares of the Underlying Fund, resulting in increased transaction costs, tracking
error, underinvestment, and potentially the realization of capital gains. Further, this could lead to re-purchasing shares of the Underlying Fund or selling the corresponding options at a less favorable price than the fund might have received had
the options been extinguished. The Fund uses options which are struck once per month, and the timing of changes in the price of the Underlying Fund may affect the Fund’s performance. For example, if the Underlying Fund experiences a drop in
price followed by a quick rebound, the Fund may be unable to fully participate in the rebound if the rebound occurs immediately after the Fund’s roll date. In addition, if trading is suspended, the Fund may be unable to purchase an offsetting
option for purposes of closing out an existing written option at the originally scheduled time and date.</div>
<div>The Fund will be affected by movements in interest rates and
bond yields and the resulting share price of the Underlying Fund. In a falling interest rate environment and other environments in which credit spreads narrow, the Underlying Fund is generally expected to appreciate in price, and the Fund may
underperform the Underlying Fund as price appreciation for the Fund is limited to the exercise prices of the options written by the Fund.</div>
<div>Credit Risk<font>.</font><font> Debt issuers and other counterparties may be unable or unwilling to make timely interest and/or</font></div> </div> <div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>S-5</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>principal payments when due or otherwise honor their obligations. Changes in
an issuer’s credit rating or the market’s perception of an issuer’s creditworthiness may also adversely affect the value of the Fund’s or Underlying Fund's investment in that issuer. The degree of credit risk depends on an
issuer's or counterparty's financial condition and on the terms of an obligation.</div>
<div>Cybersecurity Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund or the Underlying Fund, the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's adviser, distributor, or other service providers, market makers, Authorized
Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the Fund and
its shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the
cybersecurity plans and systems of the Fund’s Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>Derivatives Risk<font>. The Fund will use covered calls, which are options, in seeking to achieve the Fund’s investment objective. The Fund’s use of options, like investment in other derivatives, may reduce the
Fund’s returns or increase volatility. A risk of the Fund’s use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate with the value of the underlying asset, the performance of</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>the asset class to which the Fund seeks exposure or to the performance of the
overall securities markets. Since the Fund’s covered call options are written on shares of the Underlying Fund, if the increase in the price of the Underlying Fund is significantly above the exercise price of a written option, the Fund would
likely substantially underperform the Underlying Fund. In addition, implied volatility is one of the primary inputs in options pricing. As volatility increases, the value of an option also increases (and vice-versa). Changes in the level of
volatility can affect the amount of premium the Fund will receive from writing options and increased volatility may increase the cost the Fund pays to close out an open option position. In addition, the Fund's use of derivatives may expose the Fund
to risks related to potential operational issues, such as documentation and settlement issues, systems failures, inadequate controls and human error. Derivatives may also involve legal risks, including insufficient documentation, insufficient
capacity or authority of a counterparty, and legality and enforceability of a contract.</div>
<div>Distribution Tax Risk.<font> The Fund currently expects to make distributions on a regular basis. While the Fund will normally pay its income as distributions, the Fund's distributions may exceed the Fund's income and gains for
the Fund's taxable year. The Fund may be required to reduce its distributions if it has insufficient income. Distributions in excess of the Fund's current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a return of capital. Distributions in
excess of the Fund's minimum distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund's earnings and profits, will be taxable to Fund shareholders and will not constitute</font></div> </div> <div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>S-6</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>nontaxable returns of capital. A return of capital distribution generally will
not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder's cost basis and will result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those Fund shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a Fund shareholder's cost basis is reduced to
zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the Fund shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets. Because the Fund's distributions may consist of return of capital, the Fund may not be an appropriate investment for
investors who do not want their principal investment in the Fund to decrease over time or who do not wish to receive return of capital in a given period.</div>
<div>Financials Sector Risk<font>.</font><font> Performance of companies in the financials sector may be adversely impacted by many factors, including, among others, changes in government regulations, economic conditions, and interest rates, credit
rating downgrades, and decreased liquidity in credit markets. The extent to which the Fund or the Underlying Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law. The impact of
changes in capital requirements and recent or future regulation of any individual financial company, or of the financials sector as a whole, cannot be predicted. Cybersecurity incidents and technology malfunctions and failures have become
increasingly frequent and have caused significant losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Geographic Risk<font>.</font><font> A natural disaster could occur in a geographic region in which the Fund or Underlying Fund invests, which could adversely affect the</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>economy or the business operations of companies in the specific geographic
region, causing an adverse impact on the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments in, or which are exposed to, the affected region.</div>
<div>Income Risk.
<font>The Fund's income may decline when yields fall or written option premiums decline. This decline can occur because the Underlying Fund may subsequently invest in lower-yielding bonds as bonds in its
portfolio mature, are near maturity or are called, bonds in the Underlying Fund's index are substituted, or the Underlying Fund otherwise needs to purchase additional bonds. Option premiums may fall due to changes in market conditions.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of
the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders.
Because the Index Provider is relatively new to the creation of securities indexes, there may be a greater risk that index errors will not be detected as quickly as they might be in the case of an index maintained by a long-standing index provider.
Unusual market conditions or other unforeseen circumstances (such as natural disasters, political unrest or war) may</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-7</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>impact the Index Provider or a third-party data provider, and could cause the
Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance. This could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition.</div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk. <font>A widespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in travel restrictions, disruption of healthcare services, prolonged quarantines, cancellations, supply chain
disruptions, business closures, lower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings downgrades, defaults and other significant economic, social and political impacts. Markets may experience temporary closures, extreme volatility, severe losses, reduced
liquidity and increased trading costs. Such events may adversely affect the Fund and its investments and may impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities or cause elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the
Fund's NAV. Despite the development of vaccines, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects cannot be predicted with certainty.</font></div>
<div>Interest Rate Risk<font>.</font><font> During periods of very low or negative interest rates, the Underlying Fund may be unable to maintain positive returns or pay dividends to Fund shareholders. Very low or negative interest rates may
magnify interest rate risk. Changing interest rates, including rates that fall below zero, may have unpredictable effects on markets, result in heightened market volatility and detract from the Underlying Fund’s performance to the extent the
Underlying Fund is exposed to such interest rates. Additionally, under certain market conditions in which interest rates are low and the market prices for portfolio securities</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>have increased, the Underlying Fund may have a very low or even negative
yield. A low or negative yield would cause the Underlying Fund to lose money in certain conditions and over certain time periods. An increase in interest rates will generally cause the value of fixed income securities held by the Fund or the
Underlying Fund to decline, may lead to heightened volatility in the fixed-income markets and may adversely affect the liquidity of certain investments, including those held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. Because rates on certain floating rate
debt securities typically reset only periodically, changes in prevailing interest rates (and particularly sudden and significant changes) can be expected to cause some fluctuations in the net asset value of the Underlying Fund to the extent that it
invests in floating rate debt securities. The historically low interest rate environment in recent years heightens the risks associated with rising interest rates.</div>
<div>Investment in the Underlying Fund Risk.<font> The Fund expects to invest a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying
Fund. The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other investments based on their market valuations. An investment in the Fund will entail more costs and expenses than a direct investment in the Underlying
Fund.</font></div> <div>As the Fund’s allocation to the
Underlying Fund changes from time to time, or to the extent that the total annual fund operating expenses of the Underlying Fund change, the weighted</div> </div> <div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>S-8</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>average operating expenses borne by the Fund may increase or decrease.</div>
<div>Through its investment in the Underlying Fund, the Fund is
exposed to <font>Management Risk</font>, <font>Market Risk</font>, and <font>Market Trading Risk</font>, among other risks.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund or the Underlying Fund has exposure. The Fund may be adversely affected if an issuer of underlying
securities held by the Fund or Underlying Fund is unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may cause the value of the securities to
decline.</font></div> <div>Large Shareholder and Large-Scale
Redemption Risk.<font> Certain shareholders, including an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, a market maker, or another
entity, may from time to time own or manage a substantial amount of Fund shares, or may invest in the Fund and hold their investment for a limited period of time. There can be no assurance that any large shareholder or large group of shareholders
would not redeem their investment. Redemptions of a large number of Fund shares could require the Fund to dispose of assets to meet the redemption requests, which can accelerate the realization of taxable income and/or capital gains and cause the
Fund to make taxable distributions to its shareholders earlier than the Fund otherwise would have. In addition, under certain circumstances, non-redeeming shareholders may be treated as receiving a disproportionately large taxable distribution
during or with</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>respect to such year. In some circumstances, the Fund may hold a relatively
large proportion of its assets in cash in anticipation of large redemptions, diluting its investment returns. These large redemptions may also force the Fund to sell portfolio securities when it might not otherwise do so, which may negatively impact
the Fund’s NAV, increase the Fund’s brokerage costs and/or have a material effect on the market price of the Fund shares.</div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results. The Fund is also subject to the risk that the
investment strategy of the Underlying Fund may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Local, regional or global
events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund, the Underlying Fund and their investments and could result in increased
premiums or discounts to the Fund’s or Underlying Fund's NAV.</font></div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund face numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for their shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high
volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. </font><font>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>FUND'S AND THE UNDERLYING FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO
NAV<font>.</font></div> <div>Non-U.S.
Issuers Risk. <font>Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers carry different risks from securities issued by U.S. issuers. These risks include differences in accounting, auditing and financial reporting
standards, the possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation, adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations, political instability, regulatory and economic differences, and potential restrictions on the flow of international
capital.</font></div> <div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund are exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and
communication errors, errors of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund, the Underlying Fund and BFA seek to
reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund are not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund or Underlying Fund invests in countries or regions whose economies are heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in this
trading may have an adverse impact on</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>the Fund's or Underlying Fund's investments.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries<font>. </font><font>The Fund’s and the Underlying Fund's investment in developed country issuers may subject the Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security,
economic and other risks associated with developed countries. Developed countries tend to represent a significant portion of the global economy and have generally experienced slower economic growth than some less developed countries. Certain
developed countries have experienced security concerns, such as war, terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents involving a country’s or region’s security may cause uncertainty in its markets and may adversely affect its
economy and the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's investments. In addition, developed countries may be adversely impacted by changes to the economic conditions of certain key trading partners, regulatory burdens, debt burdens and the price or
availability of certain commodities.</font></div> <div>Risk of
Investing in the U.S<font>.</font><font> Certain changes in the U.S. economy, such as when the U.S. economy weakens or when its financial markets decline, may have an adverse
effect on the securities to which the Fund or the Underlying Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Some countries and regions in which the Fund invests have experienced security concerns, such as war, terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents involving a country's or region's
security may cause uncertainty in its markets and may adversely affect its economy and the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Small Fund Risk. <font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain
conditions of the listing exchange. Any resulting liquidation of the Fund could cause the Fund to incur elevated transaction costs for the Fund and negative tax consequences for its shareholders.</font></div>
<div>Tax Risk<font>.</font><font> The tax rules and limitations that apply to the Fund will cause some or all of its income and gain to be taxable as ordinary income or at ordinary income rates, may accelerate its recognition of income
and gain, and may defer its use of losses, all of which are expected to have negative tax consequences for the Fund and Fund investors. Because the assets comprising the Underlying Index and held by the Underlying Fund will not consist of stock,
ordinary dividends from the Fund will not be eligible for the reduced rates applicable to “qualified dividend income” or eligible for the dividends-received deduction. The Fund expects that its ownership of shares of the Underlying Fund
and sale of call options thereon generally will constitute “straddles” (offsetting positions with respect to personal property) under section 1092 of the Internal Revenue Code. The straddle rules generally do not apply if all the
straddle’s offsetting positions consist of “qualified covered call options” and the stock to be purchased under the options, and the straddle is not part of a larger straddle. Unlike certain other funds that utilize covered call
strategies, the Fund does not anticipate that this exception will be available because, as a general matter, the call options it writes are not expected to be treated as “qualified</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>covered call options.” The straddle rules usually will terminate the
Fund’s holding periods for its shares of the Underlying Fund that become part of a straddle before the long-term capital gain holding period (more than one year) has been reached, which is expected to eliminate the Fund’s ability to
recognize long-term capital gains from a sale or other disposition of such shares. The straddle rules also usually will defer recognition of realized losses and require the capitalization of certain interest expenses and carrying charges. Similarly,
“wash sale” rules may apply to defer the recognition of loss by the Fund from the disposition of stock or securities at a loss in a case in which identical or substantially identical stock or securities (or an option to acquire such
property) is or has been acquired within a prescribed period. As a result of the foregoing, an investor may be subject to significantly greater amounts of tax as a result of the investment than would apply to an investment in a fund engaged in a
different investment strategy.</div> <div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to “tracking error,” which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking
error may occur because of differences between the securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a
security’s price at the local market close and the Fund's or an Underlying Fund's valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund's or Underlying Fund's NAV, respectively), transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the
Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>the accrual or the valuation of distributions, the requirements to maintain
pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, changes to the Underlying Index, the effect the Fund’s transactions would have on the
market for the securities in the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements, among other reasons. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other
unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not. <font>INDEX ETFs THAT TRACK INDICES WITH SIGNIFICANT WEIGHT IN OPTIONS MAY EXPERIENCE
HIGHER TRACKING ERROR THAN OTHER INDEX ETFs THAT DO NOT TRACK SUCH INDICES.</font></div>
<div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund or the Underlying Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or other asset may differ from the Fund's or the Underlying</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the value used by its
underlying index, particularly for securities or other assets that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. In addition, the value of the
securities or other assets in the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's shares. Authorized Participants who
purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund or the Underlying Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the securities not been fair
valued or been valued using a different methodology. The ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only be
bought and sold in the secondary market through a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An investor may incur costs
attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for shares of the Fund (ask) when buying or selling shares in the secondary
market (the “bid-ask spread”).<br/> </div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make distributions that may be taxable to
you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an individual retirement account (“IRA”), in which case, your distributions generally will be taxed when
withdrawn.</div> <div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial
Intermediaries</div> <div>If you purchase shares of the Fund through
a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms
and reporting systems or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another
investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.<br/> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
