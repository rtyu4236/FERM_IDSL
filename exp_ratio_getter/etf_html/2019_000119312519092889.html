<p><font size="2"><b>The first paragraph of the section of the Summary Prospectus and Prospectus entitled “Principal Investment Strategies” is deleted in its entirety and
replaced with the following: </b></font></p> <p><font size="2">The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the MSCI Indonesia IMI 25/50 Index (the “Underlying
Index”), which is designed to measure the performance of the large-, <font>mid-</font> and small-capitalization segments of the Indonesian equity market. A capping methodology is applied that limits the weight of any
single issuer to a maximum of 25% of the Underlying Index. Additionally, the sum of the issuer that individually constitute more than 5% of the weight of the Underlying Index cannot exceed a maximum of 50% of the weight of the Underlying Index in
the aggregate. As of February 28, 2019, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the consumer staples and financials industries or sectors. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to
change over time. </font></p>

<p><font size="2"><b></b><b><i>Change in the Fund’s “Summary of Principal Risks” </i></b></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b>The section of the Summary Prospectus and Prospectus entitled “Summary of Principal Risks” is amended to add the following: </b></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b><i>Consumer Staples Sector Risk.</i></b> The consumer staples sector may be affected by, among other things, marketing campaigns, changes in consumer demands,
government regulations and changes in commodity prices. </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b><i><font>Mid-Capitalization</font> Companies Risk</i></b><b>.</b>
Compared to large-capitalization companies, <font>mid-capitalization</font> companies may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse developments, and their securities may be more volatile and less liquid. </font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b><i>Small-Capitalization Companies Risk.</i></b> Compared to <font>mid-</font> and large-capitalization companies,
small-capitalization companies may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse developments, and their securities may be more volatile and less liquid. </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b></b><b><i>Change in the Fund’s “A Further Discussion of Principal Risks” </i></b></font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>The section of
the Prospectus entitled “A Further Discussion of Principal Risks” is amended to add the following: </b></font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>Consumer Staples Sector Risk.
</b>Companies in the consumer staples sector may be affected by the regulation of various product components and production methods, marketing campaigns and changes in the global economy, consumer spending and consumer demand. Tobacco companies, in
particular, may be adversely affected by new laws, regulations and litigation. Companies in the consumer staples sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. These
companies may be subject to severe competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability. </font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b><font>Mid-Capitalization</font> Companies Risk. </b>Stock prices of <font>mid-capitalization</font>
companies may be more volatile than those of large-capitalization companies and, therefore, the Fund’s share price may be more volatile than those of funds that invest a larger percentage of their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization
companies. Stock prices of <font>mid-capitalization</font> companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business or economic developments, and the stocks of <font>mid-capitalization</font> companies may be less liquid, making it difficult for the Fund to buy and sell shares of <font>mid-capitalization</font> companies. In addition, <font>mid-capitalization</font> companies </font></p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p><font size="2">
generally have less diverse product lines than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products. </font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b>Small-Capitalization Companies Risk.</b> Stock prices of small-capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of larger companies and, therefore, the
Fund’s share price may be more volatile than those of funds that invest a larger percentage of their assets in stocks issued by <font>mid-</font> or large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of small-capitalization
companies are generally more vulnerable than those of <font>mid-</font> or large-capitalization companies to adverse business and economic developments. Securities of small-capitalization companies may be thinly traded,
making it difficult for the Fund to buy and sell them. In addition, small-capitalization companies are typically less financially stable than larger, more established companies and may depend on a small number of essential personnel, making these
companies more vulnerable to experiencing adverse effects due to the loss of personnel. Small-capitalization companies also normally have less diverse product lines than those of <font>mid-</font> or large-capitalization
companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments concerning their products. </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b></b><b><i>Change in the Fund’s “A Further Discussion
of Other Risks” </i></b></font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>The section of the Prospectus entitled “A Further Discussion of Other Risks” is amended to delete
“Consumer Staples Sector Risk,” <font>“Mid-Capitalization</font> Companies Risk,” “Small-Capitalization Companies Risk” and “Telecommunications Sector Risk” and add the following:
</b></font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>Communication Services Sector Risk.</b> The communication services sector consists of both companies in the telecommunication services industry
as well as those in the media and entertainment industry. Examples of companies in the telecommunication services industry group include providers of fiber-optic, fixed-line, cellular and wireless telecommunications networks. Companies in the media
and entertainment industry group encompass a variety of services and products including television broadcasting, gaming products, social media, networking platforms, online classifieds, online review websites and Internet search engines. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">The communication services sector of a country’s economy is often subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with governmental

may negatively affect the business of communications companies. Government actions around the world, specifically in the area of <font>pre-marketing</font> clearance of
products and prices, can be arbitrary and unpredictable. Companies in the communication services sector may encounter distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition, particularly in developing new
products and services using new technology. Technological innovations may make the products and services of certain communications companies obsolete. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">Telecommunications providers are often required to obtain franchises or licenses in order to provide services in a given location. Licensing and franchise rights
in the telecommunications sector are limited, which may provide an advantage to certain participants. Limited availability of such rights, high barriers to market entry and regulatory oversight, among other factors, have led to consolidation of
companies within the sector, which could lead to further regulation or other negative effects in the future. </font></p> <p><font size="2">Companies in the media and entertainment
industries can be significantly affected by several factors, including competition, particularly in formulation of products and services using new technologies, cyclicality of revenues and earnings, a potential decrease in the discretionary income

important revenue source for media and entertainment companies. During economic downturns advertising spending typically decreases and, as a result, media and entertainment companies tend to generate less revenue. </font></p>

<p><font size="2"><b></b><b><i>Change in the Fund’s “Construction and Maintenance of the Underlying Indexes”
</i></b></font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>The section of the SAI entitled “MSCI Indonesia Investable Market Index (IMI)” on page 37 is deleted in its entirety and is
replaced by the following new section entitled “MSCI Indonesia IMI 25/50 Index”: </b></font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>MSCI Indonesia IMI 25/50 Index </b></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b><u>Number of Components: approximately 72</u> </b></font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>Index
Description. </b>The MSCI Indonesia IMI 25/50 Index is designed to measure the performance of the large-, mid- and small-capitalization segments of the Indonesian equity market. The Underlying Index is a free float-adjusted market
capitalization-weighted index with a capping methodology applied to issuer weights so that no single issuer of a component exceeds 25% of the Underlying Index weight and all issuers with a weight above 5% do not, in the aggregate, exceed 50% of the
Underlying Index weight. The Underlying Index covers approximately 99% of the free float-adjusted market capitalization in Indonesia. </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>Calculation
Methodology. </b>The Fund utilizes the Underlying Index calculated with net dividends reinvested. MSCI uses the index constituent companies’ country of incorporation to determine the relevant dividend withholding tax rates in calculating the
net dividends. The regular cash dividend is reinvested after deduction of withholding tax by applying the maximum rate of the company’s country of incorporation applicable to institutional investors. Net dividends means dividends after taxes
withheld at the rate applicable to <font>non-resident</font> institutional investors who do not benefit from double taxation treaties. Such withholding rates may differ from those applicable to U.S. residents. </font></p>
