<p><font size="2"><b>The first paragraph of the section of the Fund’s Summary Prospectus and Prospectus entitled “Principal Investment Strategies” shall be deleted in
its entirety and replaced with the following: </b></font></p> <p><font size="2">The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Morningstar<font size="1"><sup>®</sup></font> <font>US Large-Mid Cap</font> Broad Growth Index</font><font size="1"><sup>SM</sup></font><font size="2"> (the “Underlying Index”), which measures the performance of stocks issued
by <font>large-</font> mid capitalization companies that have exhibited above-average “growth” characteristics as determined by Morningstar, Inc.’s (“Morningstar” or the “Index
Provider”) proprietary index methodology. Underlying Index constituents are drawn from the pool of stocks issued by U.S. based companies that trade publicly on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), the NYSE Amex Equities or The NASDAQ
Stock Market. The Morningstar index methodology defines <font>“large-mid</font> capitalization” stocks as those stocks that form approximately the top 90% of the market capitalization of the stocks eligible to be
included in the Morningstar<font size="1"><sup>®</sup></font> US Market Extended Index</font><font size="1"><sup>SM</sup></font><font size="2"> (a diversified broad market index that represents approximately 99.5% of the market capitalization of publicly-traded U.S.
stocks and includes only those stocks in the top 75% of companies in the investable universe based on liquidity score). The Index Provider then designates stocks as “blend,” “growth” or “value” based on their style
orientations. The stocks in the Underlying Index are designated as “growth” because they are issued by companies that typically have higher than average historical and forecasted earnings, sales, equity and cash flow growth. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">The stocks in the Underlying Index are weighted according to the total value of shares that are publicly owned and available for trading. As of February 16,
2021, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the consumer cyclical and technology industries or sectors. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time. </font></p>

<p><font size="2"><b>The following shall be added immediately after the paragraph entitled “Market Trading Risk” on <font>page S-6 of</font> the Prospectus and Summary Prospectus. </b></font></p> <p><font size="2"><b><i>Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk.</i></b>
Compared to large-capitalization companies, mid-capitalization companies may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse developments. In addition, the securities of midcapitalization companies may be more volatile and less liquid than those of
large-capitalization companies. </font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b><i><font>Non-Diversification</font></i></b><b><i></i></b><b><i> Risk.</i></b> The Fund may invest a large percentage of its
assets in securities issued by or representing a small number of issuers. As a result, the Fund’s performance may depend on the performance of a small number of issuers. </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b><i><u>Change in the Fund’s “A Further Discussion of Principal Risks</u>” </i></b></font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>The section
entitled “Healthcare Sector Risk” on page 4 of the Prospectus shall be deleted in its entirety. </b></font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>The following shall be added
immediately after the paragraph entitled “Market Trading Risk” on <font>pages 7-8 of</font> the Prospectus. </b></font></p> <p><font size="2"><b><i>Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk.</i></b> Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of large-capitalization companies and, therefore, the Fund’s share price may be
more volatile than those of funds that invest a larger percentage of their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large capitalization companies
to adverse business or economic developments, and the stocks of mid-capitalization companies may be less liquid than those of large capitalization companies, making it difficult for the Fund to buy and sell shares of mid capitalization companies. In
addition, mid-capitalization companies generally have less diverse product lines than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products. </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b><i><font>Non-Diversification</font></i></b><b><i></i></b><b><i> Risk.</i></b> The Fund is classified
<font>as “non-diversified.” This</font> means that the Fund may invest a large percentage of its assets in securities issued by or representing a small number of issuers. As a result, the Fund may be
more susceptible to the risks associated with these particular issuers or to a single economic, political or regulatory occurrence affecting these issuers. </font></p>

<p><font size="2"><b>The following shall be added immediately after the paragraph entitled “Financials Sector Risk” on pages 12 of the Prospectus. </b></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b><i>Healthcare Sector Risk.</i></b> The profitability of companies in the healthcare sector may be adversely affected by the following factors, among regulations,
restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising costs of medical products and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, changes in the demand for medical products and services, a limited number
of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market developments. A number of issuers in the healthcare sector have recently merged or otherwise experienced consolidation. The effects of this trend toward consolidation are
unknown and may be far-reaching. Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent on patent protection. The expiration of a company’s patents may adversely affect that company’s profitability. Many healthcare companies are subject to
extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may result in price discounting. Many new products in the healthcare
sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The process of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, and such efforts ultimately may be unsuccessful. Companies in the healthcare sector may be thinly capitalized and may be susceptible to
product obsolescence. In addition, a number of legislative proposals concerning healthcare have been considered by the U.S. Congress in recent years. It is unclear what proposals will ultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect they may have on
companies in the healthcare sector. </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b><i><u>Change in the Fund’s “Diversification Status”</u> </i></b></font></p>

Morningstar<font size="1"><sup>®</sup></font> US Dividend and Buyback Index, Morningstar Dividend Yield Focus Index, and Morningstar US Dividend
Growth Index (as described below), each Underlying Index is a subset of the Morningstar<font size="1"><sup>®</sup></font> US Market Extended Index, a
broad market index representing the top 99.5% of U.S. equity market capitalization. To be eligible for inclusion in the Morningstar US Market Extended Index, a stock must be listed on the NYSE, the NYSE Amex Equities, or NASDAQ, domiciled in the
U.S. or have its primary stock market activities carried out in the U.S., have sufficient historical fundamental data available so that Morningstar can classify investment style, and be in the top 75% of companies in the investable universe based on
its liquidity score. A security’s liquidity score is based on its average monthly trading volume in U.S. dollars. American Depository Receipts (“ADRs), American Depositary Shares, fixed-dividend shares, convertible notes, warrants, rights,
limited partnerships, limited liability companies, bank holding companies and royalty and statutory trusts are not eligible for inclusion in the US Market Extended Index. </font></p> <p><font size="2">Except for Morningstar<font size="1"><sup>®</sup></font> US Dividend and Buyback Index, Morningstar Dividend Yield
Focus Index, and Morningstar US Dividend Growth Index, the Morningstar Underlying Indexes are part of the Morningstar US Style Index family, which is based on the same methodology as the well-known Morningstar Style Box</font><font size="1"><sup>™</sup></font><font size="2">. The Morningstar Style Box</font><font size="1"><sup>™</sup></font><font size="2"> classification of each stock relies on prospective financial performance metrics — expressed as a yield (i.e.,
revenue yield, cash flow yield, dividend yield, and book value yield) and the <font>per-share</font> growth rate of each such metric — as derived from Morningstar’s proprietary models, and (when available) the
Institutional Brokers Estimate System (“IBES”) forecast of each stock’s current year earnings per share and the IBES median long-term earnings growth forecast. The Morningstar Indexes are governed by transparent, objective rules for
security selection, exclusion, rebalancing, and adjustments for corporate actions. Morningstar, Inc. (“Morningstar”) makes no subjective determinations related to index composition. </font></p>
