<div>The iShares Paris-Aligned Climate MSCI USA ETF (the
“Fund”) seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of U.S. large- and mid-capitalization stocks that is designed to be compatible with the objectives of the Paris Agreement by, in aggregate, following a decarbonization
trajectory, reducing exposure to climate-related transition and physical risks and increasing exposure to companies favorably positioned for the transition to a low-carbon economy.</div>
<div>Fees and Expenses</div>

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund may pay
transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in
a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance. From inception (February 8, 2022) to the most recent fiscal year end, the Fund's portfolio turnover
rate was 6% of the average value of its portfolio.</font></div>
<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the MSCI USA
Climate Paris Aligned Benchmark Extended Select Index (the “Underlying Index”), which has been developed by MSCI Inc. (the “Index Provider” or “MSCI”). The Underlying Index is composed of U.S. large- and
mid-capitalization stocks that are selected and weighted so that, in the aggregate, the portfolio is compatible with the objectives of the Paris Agreement by following a decarbonization trajectory, reducing exposure to climate-related transition and
physical risks and increasing</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>exposure to companies favorably positioned for the transition to a low-carbon
economy. The Underlying Index aims to meet or exceed the minimum requirements for a “Paris-Aligned Benchmark” (“PAB”) under the European Union’s Low Carbon Benchmark Regulation. PABs are designed to align with the
principal objective of the Paris Agreement, which is to limit global warming in this century to well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, above pre-industrial levels.</div>
<div>The Index Provider begins with the MSCI USA Index (the
“Parent Index”) and excludes securities of companies involved in the business of tobacco, companies involved with controversial or nuclear weapons, producers and retailers of civilian firearms, and companies involved in certain climate
change-related activity such as thermal coal mining or sales, a wide range of oil- and gas-related activities, certain types of power generation and the extraction of oil sands. Certain exclusions (<font>e.g</font>.,
controversial and nuclear weapons) are categorical, and others are based on revenue or percentage of revenue thresholds. </div>
<div>In addition, the Index Provider excludes companies that it
determines are involved in “very severe” controversies</div> </div> </div> <div>  </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-2</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div>
<p>
<hr size="3"/> <div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>related to the environmental, social or governance (“ESG”) impact
of the company’s operations and/or products and services. To evaluate ESG controversies, the Index Provider monitors across five categories of ESG impact – environment, human rights and communities, labor rights and supply chain,
customers and governance – and 28 sub-categories. Companies that are involved in severe or very severe environmental controversies, as determined by the Index Provider, are also excluded. Environmental controversies can relate to, among other
things, toxic emissions and waste, water stress, biodiversity and supply chain management. </div>
<div>The Index Provider then uses an optimization process that
applies certain sustainability-related constraints to refine and determine weightings of the resulting portfolio, specifically addressing objectives related to transition and physical risks and transition opportunities as well as minimum and maximum
weightings relative to the Parent Index, as summarized below. In order to meet or exceed the minimum requirements for PABs, the Index Provider targets the following index-level constraints at each semi-annual rebalancing: (a) at least a 50%
reduction in greenhouse gas (“GHG”) intensity compared with the Parent Index, taking into account issuers’ Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions (<font>i.e.,</font> direct emissions from sources that an issuer owns
or controls and indirect emissions from the purchase of energy and a company’s value chain); (b) at least a 10% year-over-year reduction in the GHG intensity (or decarbonization rate) of the Underlying Index itself; and (c) a level of exposure
to sectors with a high impact on climate change (<font>i.e</font>.,</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>those sectors that are key to the low carbon transition) that is not less than
the exposure in the Parent Index, to ensure that such sectors are not underweighted in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Additional sustainability-related constraints that are applied
to the Underlying Index include, relative to the Parent Index, a reduction in overall potential carbon intensity, lower overall exposure to physical risk arising from extreme weather events, increased overall exposure to “green revenue”
(<font>i.e</font>., from alternative energy, energy efficiency, sustainable water, green building, pollution prevention and sustainable agriculture), increased overall exposure to companies setting credible emissions
targets, lower overall exposure to companies facing risks related to the low carbon transition and greater overall exposure to companies that may have transition-related opportunities. In addition, an index constituent's weight must be at least
0.01% and is restricted to the lower of +/- 2% or 20 times its weight in the Parent Index. The sector weights of the Underlying Index may not deviate more than +/- 5% from those of the Parent Index (except for the energy sector).</div>
<div>As of August 31, 2022, a significant portion of the Underlying
Index is represented by securities of companies in the healthcare and technology industries or sectors. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div> </div>
<div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-3</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div>
<p>
<hr size="3"/> <div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover
low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to that of an applicable underlying index. The securities
selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar
to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its assets in
the component securities of the Underlying Index and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as well as in
securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash equivalent investments associated with a derivative position will be treated as part of that position for the
purposes of calculating the percentage of investments included in the Underlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the
Fund.</div> <div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to
one-third of the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by MSCI, which is independent
of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government
securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</font></div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share
(“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div>
<p>
<hr size="3"/> <div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial
markets, a particular financial market or other asset classes. Securities of companies that have positive or favorable ESG characteristics may underperform other securities.</div>
<div>Assets Under Management (AUM) Risk<font>.</font><font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this prospectus (the “Prospectus”)), a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its
investment for a specific period of time to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. Therecan be no assurance that any such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could
negatively impact the Fund.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant
Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in
creation and/or redemption transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other
Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting.</font></div>
<div>Calculation Methodology Risk. <font>The Underlying Index relies on various sources of information to assess the</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>criteria of securities included in the Underlying Index, including information
that may be based on assumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances that the Underlying Index’s calculation methodology or sources of information will provide an accurate assessment of included securities.</div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector, market segment or asset class.</font></div>
<div>Cybersecurity Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, the Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of
securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established
business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems of the
Fund’s Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div>
<p>

<div>value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset
classes. The Underlying Index is composed of common stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of
preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</div>
<div>ESG Risk. <font>To
the extent that the Underlying Index uses criteria related to the ESG characteristics of issuers, this may limit the types and number of investment opportunities available to the Fund and, as a result, the Fund may underperform other funds whose
underlying index does not use ESG criteria. The Underlying Index’s use of ESG criteria may result in the Fund investing in, or allocating greater weight to, securities or market sectors that underperform the market as a whole or underperform
other funds that use ESG criteria. In addition, the use of representative sampling may result in divergence of the Fund’s overall ESG characteristics or ESG risk from those of the Underlying Index. The Index Provider may evaluate
security-level ESG data and, if applicable, ESG objectives or constraints that are relevant to the Underlying Index only at index reviews or rebalances. Securities included in the Underlying Index may cease to meet the relevant ESG criteria but may
nevertheless remain in the Underlying Index and the Fund until the next review or rebalance by the Index Provider. As a result, certain securities in the Underlying Index, or the Underlying Index as a whole, may not meet the relevant ESG objectives
or constraints at all times.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Healthcare Sector Risk<font>.</font><font> The profitability of companies in the healthcare sector may be affected by government regulations and government healthcare programs, increases or decreases in the cost of medical products and
services, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, demand for medical products and services and product liability claims, among other factors. Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent on patent protection, and the expiration of a
company’s patent may adversely affect that company’s profitability. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive forces that may result in price discounting, and may be thinly capitalized and susceptible to product
obsolescence.</font></div> <div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of
the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders.
Unusual market conditions or other unforeseen circumstances (such as natural disasters, political unrest or war) may impact the Index Provider or a third-party data provider, and could cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance. This
could cause the</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-6</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div>
<p>
<hr size="3"/> <div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition.</div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk. <font>A widespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in travel restrictions, disruption of healthcare services, prolonged quarantines, cancellations, supply chain
disruptions, business closures, lower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings downgrades, defaults and other significant economic, social and political impacts. Markets may experience temporary closures, extreme volatility, severe losses, reduced
liquidity and increased trading costs. Such events may adversely affect the Fund and its investments and may impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities or cause elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the
Fund's NAV. Despite the development of vaccines, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects cannot be predicted with certainty.</font></div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may
cause the value of the securities to decline.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more
limited growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of
terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s
NAV.</font></div> <div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets,
periods of high volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>Non-Diversification Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is classified as “non-diversified.” This means that, compared with other funds that are classified as “diversified,” the Fund may invest a greater percentage of its
assets in securities issued by or representing a small number of issuers. As a result, the Fund's performance may depend on the performance of a small number of issuers.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund’s service providers,
counterparties</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-7</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div>
<p>
<hr size="3"/> <div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>or other third parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or
systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the
U.S<font>.</font><font> Certain changes in the U.S. economy, such as when the U.S. economy weakens or when its financial markets decline, may have an adverse effect on the
securities to which the Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax
consequences for the Fund.</font></div> <div>Sustainability Risk.<font> Sustainability risk is an inclusive term to designate investment risk that relates to environmental, social or governance issues. Sustainability risk around environmental issues includes, but is not
limited to, climate risk, both physical and transition risk. Risks related to social issues can include, but are not limited to, labor rights and community relations. Governance-related risks can include, but are not</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>limited to, risks around board independence, ownership and control, and audit
and tax management. Sustainability risk can also manifest itself through different existing risk types including, but not limited to, market, liquidity, concentration, credit and asset-liability mismatch risk. These risks can impact an issuer's
operational effectiveness and resilience as well as its public perception and reputation, affecting its profitability and, in turn, its capital growth and ultimately impacting the value of holdings in the Fund. As a result, sustainability risk
factors may have a material impact on an investment, may increase volatility, may affect liquidity and may have an adverse impact on the value of shares of the Fund.</div>
<div>Sustainability risk factors do not solely determine the risk
profile of the investment. The relevance, severity, materiality and time horizon of sustainability risk factors and other risks can differ significantly across funds. All or a combination of these factors may have an unpredictable impact on the
Fund's investments. Under normal market conditions, such events could have a material impact on the value of shares of the Fund. The impacts of sustainability risk are likely to develop over time, and new sustainability risks may be identified as
further data and information regarding sustainability factors and impacts become available.</div>
<div>Technology Sector Risk<font>.</font><font> Technology companies, including information technology companies, may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. Technology companies typically face intense competition
and potentially rapid product obsolescence. They are also</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-8</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div>
<p>
<hr size="3"/> <div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>heavily dependent on intellectual property rights and may be adversely
affected by the loss or impairment of those rights. Companies in the technology sector are facing increased government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or regulatory action.</div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to “tracking error,” which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences
between the securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences, transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in
timing of the accrual or the valuation of dividends or interest received by the Fund or distributions paid to the Fund’s shareholders, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders,
acceptance of custom baskets, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements, among other reasons. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or
other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not. <font>BFA EXPECTS THAT THE FUND MAY EXPERIENCE HIGHER TRACKING ERROR THAN IS
TYPICAL FOR SIMILAR INDEX EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS (“ETFs”).</font></div>

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only be
bought and sold in the secondary market through a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An investor may incur costs
attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for shares of the Fund (ask) when buying or selling shares in the secondary
market (the “bid-ask spread”).<br/> </div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make distributions that may be taxable to
you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an individual retirement account (“IRA”), in which case, your distributions generally will be taxed when
withdrawn.</div> <div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial
Intermediaries</div> <div>If you purchase shares of the Fund through
a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms
and reporting systems or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another
investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.<br/> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
