Please </span><span>read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional </span><span>information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund are listed for trading on </span><span>Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (</span><span>“</span><span>Cboe BZX</span><span>”</span><span>). The market price for a share of the Fund may </span><span>be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly traded securities. The Fund is designed to </span><span>track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund </span><span>represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other </span><span>instruments intended to track a market index. Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which </span><span>can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based </span><span>on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at </span><span>NAV solely by Authorized Participants and only in aggregations of a specified number of </span><span>shares (</span><span>“</span><span>Creation Units</span><span>”</span><span>). Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are </span><span>listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market </span><span>prices that change throughout the day.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund invests in a particular segment of the securities markets and seeks to track </span><span>the performance of a securities index that is not representative of the market as a </span><span>whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. </span><span>Accordingly, an investment in the Fund should not constitute a complete investment </span><span>program.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of financial instruments, and is </span><span>not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The </span><span>performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, </span><span>including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency valuations, asset valuations, corporate </span><span>actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of </span><span>representative sampling or from legal restrictions (such as diversification </span><span>requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to </span><span>time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments </span><span>to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise determined by BFA, any such change or </span><span>adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on </span><span>a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, </span><span>the Underlying Index performance shown for periods prior to the effective date of any </span><span>such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect </span><span>such change or adjustment. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected </span><span>to have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. </span><span>“</span><span>Replication</span><span>”</span><span> is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all of the </span><span>securities in its underlying index in approximately the same proportions as in the </span><span>underlying index.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not insured or guaranteed by </span><span>the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or </span><span>any of its affiliates.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be changed without </span><span>shareholder approval.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Principal Risks</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund is subject to various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of </span><span>which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability </span><span>to meet its investment objective. You could lose all or part of your investment in the </span><span>Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments. The order of the below risk </span><span>factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. The Fund </span><span>discloses its portfolio holdings daily at www.iShares.com.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Asian Economic Risk.</span><span> Many Asian economies have experienced rapid growth and </span><span>industrialization in recent years, but there is no assurance that this growth rate will be </span><span>maintained. Other Asian economies, however, have experienced high inflation, high </span><span>unemployment, currency devaluations and restrictions, and over-extension of credit. </span><span>Geopolitical hostility, political instability, and economic or environmental events in any </span><span>one Asian country may have a significant economic effect on the entire Asian region, </span><span>as well as on major trading partners outside Asia. Any adverse event in the Asian </span><span>markets may have a significant adverse effect on some or all of the economies of the </span><span>countries in which the Fund invests. In particular, China is a key trading partner of </span><span>many Asian countries and any changes in trading relationships between China and </span><span>other Asian countries may affect the region as a whole. Many Asian countries are </span><span>subject to political risk, including political instability, corruption and regional conflict </span><span>with neighboring countries. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial </span><span>military capabilities, and historical tensions between the two countries present the risk </span><span>of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of hostilities </span><span>between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have </span><span>a severe adverse effect on the entire Asian region. Certain Asian countries have </span><span>developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S. or with China, and if these </span><span>relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. </span><span>or China for trade. In addition, many Asian countries are subject to social and labor </span><span>risks associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions. </span><span>These risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of the Fund's investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Asset Class Risk.</span><span> The securities</span><span> </span><span>and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that </span><span>track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries, groups of industries, </span><span>markets, market segments, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, </span><span>currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and </span><span>underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a </span><span>number of factors including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, </span><span>global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental </span><span>controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that </span><span>invest in different asset classes.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Assets Under Management (AUM) Risk.</span><span> From time to time, an Authorized </span><span>Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s </span><span>adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a specific period </span><span>of time to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</span><span> </span><span>can be no assurance that any </span><span>such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund would be </span><span>maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. </span><span>Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of </span><span>those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption </span><span>transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized </span><span>Participants on an agency basis (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, on behalf of other market participants). To the </span><span>extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with </span><span>creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized </span><span>Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares </span><span>may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading </span><span>halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened </span><span>because ETFs, such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or </span><span>other securities or instruments that are less widely traded often involve greater </span><span>settlement and operational issues and capital costs for Authorized Participants, which </span><span>may limit the availability of Authorized Participants.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Calculation Methodology Risk.</span><span> The Index Provider</span><span> </span><span> relies on various sources of </span><span>information to assess the criteria of components of the Underlying Index, including </span><span>information that may be based on assumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund nor </span><span>BFA can offer assurances that the Index Provider's calculation methodology or sources </span><span>of information will provide an accurate assessment of included components.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Concentration Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, </span><span>including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than </span><span>the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's investments are concentrated in </span><span>the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of </span><span>countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, project types, group of project </span><span>types, sector, market segment or asset class. The Fund may be more adversely </span><span>affected by the underperformance of those securities and/or other assets, may </span><span>experience increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse </span><span>economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting those securities and/or</span><span> other assets than a fund that does not concentrate its investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Cybersecurity Risk.</span><span> The Fund,</span><span> </span><span>Authorized Participants, service providers and the </span><span>relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information security and </span><span>related </span><span>“</span><span>cyber</span><span>”</span><span> risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of </span><span>cybersecurity risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, </span><span>which could result in material adverse consequences for such issuers and may cause </span><span>the Fund’s investment in such issuers to lose value. In general, cyber incidents can </span><span>result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are </span><span>not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, through </span><span>“</span><span>hacking</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive </span><span>information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyberattacks may also </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as </span><span>causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, efforts to make network services </span><span>unavailable to intended users). Geopolitical tensions may increase the scale and </span><span>sophistication of deliberate attacks, particularly those from nation-states or from </span><span>entities with nation-state backing. </span></div> <div> <div><span>Cybersecurity failures by, or breaches of, the systems of the Fund's adviser, distributor </span><span>and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index and benchmark </span><span>providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market </span><span>makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests </span><span>have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially </span><span>resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s ability to calculate its NAV, </span><span>disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of </span><span>erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund </span><span>or its service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other </span><span>laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other </span><span>compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyberattacks may </span><span>render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, </span><span>and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund inaccessible, inaccurate or </span><span>incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund in order to resolve or </span><span>prevent cyber incidents. While the Fund has established business continuity plans in </span><span>the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber incidents, there are </span><span>inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain </span><span>risks have not been identified, that prevention and remediation efforts will not be </span><span>successful or that cyberattacks will go undetected. Furthermore, the Fund cannot </span><span>control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by service providers to the </span><span>Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, market makers or </span><span>Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as </span><span>a result.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Equity Securities Risk.</span><span> The Fund invests in equity securities, which are subject to </span><span>changes in value that may be attributable to market perception of a particular issuer or </span><span>to general stock market fluctuations that affect all issuers. Investments in equity </span><span>securities may be more volatile than investments in other asset classes. The </span><span>Underlying Index is composed of common stocks, which generally subject</span><span> </span><span>their holders </span><span>to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common </span><span>stockholders' claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt </span><span>securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>European Economic Risk. </span><span>The Economic and Monetary Union (the </span><span>“</span><span>eurozone</span><span>”</span><span>) of the </span><span>European Union (the </span><span>“</span><span>EU</span><span>”</span><span>) requires compliance by member states that are members of </span><span>the eurozone with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates and debt levels, </span><span>as well as fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every </span><span>country in Europe, including those countries that are not members of the eurozone. </span><span>Additionally, European countries outside of the eurozone may present economic risks </span><span>that are independent of the indirect effects that eurozone policies have on them. In </span><span>particular, the United Kingdom's (the </span><span>“</span><span>U.K.</span><span>”</span><span>) economy may be affected by global </span><span>economic, industrial and financial shifts. Changes in imports or exports, changes in </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro (the </span><span>common currency of eurozone countries), the default or threat of default by an EU </span><span>member state on its sovereign debt and/or an economic recession in an EU member </span><span>state may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of other EU member </span><span>states and their trading partners. The European financial markets have historically </span><span>experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns </span><span>or government debt levels in several European countries, including, but not limited to, </span><span>Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. </span><span>These events have affected and may in the future adversely affect the exchange rate of </span><span>the euro and may significantly affect European countries.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Responses to financial problems by European governments, central banks and others, </span><span>including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may </span><span>result in social unrest, may limit future growth and economic recovery or may have </span><span>other unintended consequences. Further defaults or restructurings by governments </span><span>and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, </span><span>financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more </span><span>countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The U.K. left the EU </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>Brexit</span><span>”</span><span>) on January 31, 2020. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide </span><span>political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability </span><span>in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The national politics of countries in Europe have been unpredictable and subject to </span><span>influence by disruptive political groups and ideologies, including, for example, </span><span>secessionist movements. The governments of European countries may be subject to </span><span>change and such countries may experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated </span><span>or sudden political or social developments may result in sudden and significant </span><span>investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe or war in </span><span>the region could also impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear </span><span>but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely affect the value and </span><span>liquidity of the Fund's investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Russian Invasion of Ukraine</span><span>. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on </span><span>February 24, 2022. The extent and duration of the military action, resulting sanctions </span><span>and resulting future market disruptions, including declines in its stock markets and the </span><span>value of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but could be </span><span>significant. Disruptions caused by Russian military action or other actions (including </span><span>cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting actual and threatened responses to such </span><span>activity, including purchasing and financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in </span><span>consumer or purchaser preferences, sanctions, import and export restrictions, tariffs </span><span>or cyberattacks on the Russian government, Russian companies or Russian individuals, </span><span>including politicians, may impact Russia's economy, Russian issuers of securities in </span><span>which the Fund invests, or the economies of Europe as a whole. Actual and threatened </span><span>responses to Russian military action may also impact the markets for certain Russian </span><span>commodities, such as oil and natural gas, as well as other sectors of the Russian </span><span>economy, and are likely to have collateral impacts on such sectors across Europe and </span><span>globally.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Financials Sector Risk.</span><span> Companies in the financials sector are subject to extensive </span><span>governmental regulation and intervention, which may adversely affect the scope of </span><span>their activities, the prices they can charge, the amount of capital and liquid assets they </span><span>must maintain and, potentially, their size. Governmental regulation may change </span><span>frequently and may have significant adverse consequences for companies in the </span><span>financials sector, including effects not intended by such regulation. Increased risk </span><span>taking by financial companies may also result in greater overall risk in the U.S. and </span><span>global financials sector. The impact of changes in capital requirements, or recent or </span><span>future regulation in various countries, on any individual financial company or on the </span><span>financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. </span></div> <div> <div><span>Certain risks may impact the value of investments in the financials sector more </span><span>severely than those of investments outside this sector, including the risks associated </span><span>with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage. Companies in the </span><span>financials sector are exposed directly to the credit risk of their borrowers and </span><span>counterparties, who may be leveraged to an unknown degree, including through swaps </span><span>and other derivatives products. Financial services companies may have significant </span><span>exposure to the same borrowers and counterparties, with the result that a borrower’s </span><span>or counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations to one company may affect other </span><span>companies with exposure to the same borrower or counterparty. This </span><span>interconnectedness of risk may result in significant negative impacts to companies </span><span>with direct exposure to the defaulting counterparty as well as adverse cascading </span><span>effects in the markets and the financials sector generally. Companies in the financials </span><span>sector may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and loan losses, </span><span>decreases in the availability of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades, </span><span>adverse public perception and adverse conditions in other related markets. Insurance </span><span>companies, in particular, may be subject to severe price competition and/or rate </span><span>regulation, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability. The financials </span><span>sector is particularly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. The financials sector is </span><span>also a target for cyberattacks. Cybersecurity incidents and technology malfunctions </span><span>and failures have become increasingly frequent and have caused significant losses to </span><span>companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund. The extent to which </span><span>the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or </span><span>banking is limited by applicable law.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Geographic Risk.</span><span> Some of the companies in which the Fund invests are located in </span><span>parts of the world that have historically been prone to natural disasters, such as </span><span>earthquakes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, droughts, floods, hurricanes or tsunamis, </span><span>and are economically sensitive to environmental events. Any such event may adversely </span><span>impact the economies of these geographic areas or business operations of companies </span><span>in these geographic areas, causing an adverse impact on the value of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Index-Related Risk.</span><span> The Fund seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to </span><span>the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as </span><span>published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any </span><span>agents that may act on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that </span><span>the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the </span><span>Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>6</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>achieve, neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any </span><span>liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or </span><span>its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in line with </span><span>the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to </span><span>manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider </span><span>to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee against the Index Provider’s or </span><span>any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the </span><span>data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not </span><span>be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, </span><span>particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or </span><span>managers. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its </span><span>shareholders. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains </span><span>incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and </span><span>would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Shareholders </span><span>should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund </span><span>and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will </span><span>be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Unusual market conditions or other unforeseen circumstances (such as natural </span><span>disasters, political unrest or war) may impact the Index Provider or a third-party data </span><span>provider, and could cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance to the </span><span>Underlying Index. This could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or </span><span>expected composition. The postponement of a scheduled rebalance could mean that </span><span>constituents of the Underlying Index that would otherwise be removed at rebalance </span><span>due to changes in market capitalizations, issuer credit ratings, or other reasons may </span><span>remain, causing the performance and constituents of the Underlying Index to vary from </span><span>those expected under normal conditions. Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index </span><span>Provider or its agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying </span><span>Index due to reaching certain weighting constraints, unusual market conditions or </span><span>corporate events or, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index </span><span>constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances </span><span>its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the </span><span>Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such </span><span>portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Therefore, </span><span>errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the Index Provider or its agents </span><span>to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Indexing Investment Risk.</span><span> The Fund is not actively managed and may be affected by </span><span>a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests </span><span>in securities included in, or representative of, the Underlying Index, regardless of their </span><span>investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in </span><span>defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Industrials Sector Risk.</span><span> The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials </span><span>sector may be adversely affected by supply and demand changes related to their </span><span>specific products or services and industrials sector products in general. The products </span><span>of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>7</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>developments and frequent new product introduction. Global events, trade disputes </span><span>and changes in government regulations, economic conditions and exchange rates may </span><span>adversely affect the performance of companies in the industrials sector. Companies in </span><span>the industrials sector may be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage </span><span>and product liability claims. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by </span><span>changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable </span><span>factors. Companies in the industrials sector, particularly aerospace and defense </span><span>companies, may also be adversely affected by government spending policies because </span><span>companies in this sector tend to rely to a significant extent on government demand for </span><span>their products and services.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Infectious Illness Risk. </span><span>A widespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as the </span><span>COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect the economies of many nations and the </span><span>global economy and may impact individual issuers and capital markets in ways that </span><span>cannot be foreseen.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in travel restrictions, closed international </span><span>borders, disruption of healthcare services, prolonged quarantines, cancellations, </span><span>supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, temporary and permanent closures </span><span>of businesses, layoffs, defaults and other significant economic, social and political </span><span>impacts, as well as general concern and uncertainty.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in extreme volatility, severe losses, credit </span><span>deterioration of issuers, and disruptions in markets, which could adversely impact the </span><span>Fund and its investments, including impairing any hedging activity.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain local markets may be subject to closures. Any suspension of trading in markets </span><span>in which the Fund invests will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and will </span><span>impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities in such markets.</span><span> </span><span>Market or </span><span>economic disruptions could result in elevated tracking error and increased premiums </span><span>or discounts to the Fund's NAV. Additionally, an outbreak could impair the operations </span><span>of the Fund’s service providers, including BFA, which could adversely impact the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Governmental and quasi-governmental authorities and regulators throughout the world </span><span>may respond to an outbreak and any resulting economic disruptions with a variety of </span><span>fiscal and monetary policy changes, including direct capital infusions into companies </span><span>and other issuers, new monetary policy tools, and changes in interest rates. A reversal </span><span>of these policies, or the ineffectiveness of such policies, is likely to increase market </span><span>volatility, which could adversely affect the Fund’s investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>An outbreak may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social and economic risks in </span><span>certain countries or globally, which could adversely affect the Fund and its investments </span><span>and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Despite the development of vaccines, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its </span><span>effects cannot be predicted with certainty.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Issuer Risk. </span><span>The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual </span><span>securities to which the Fund has exposure. Any issuer of these securities may perform </span><span>poorly, causing the value of its securities to decline. Poor performance may be caused </span><span>by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, </span><span>expiration of patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages, </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>corporate restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or </span><span>other factors. Issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to </span><span>reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock prices to decline. An </span><span>issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in </span><span>which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.</span><span> Large-capitalization companies may be less </span><span>able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. </span><span>Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more limited </span><span>growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different </span><span>market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the </span><span>overall performance of the broader securities markets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Management Risk. </span><span>Because BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, </span><span>the Fund may not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities not </span><span>included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that BFA’s </span><span>investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of </span><span>constraints, may not produce the intended results.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Market Risk.</span><span> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market </span><span>movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The </span><span>value of a financial instrument or other asset may decline due to changes in general </span><span>market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the </span><span>particular instrument or asset, or factors that affect one or more issuers, </span><span>counterparties, exchanges, countries, regions, markets, industries, sectors or asset </span><span>classes, as applicable. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, </span><span>public health issues, recessions, the prospect or occurrence of a sovereign default or </span><span>other financial crisis, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund</span><span> </span><span>and </span><span>its investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. </span><span>Changes in market and economic conditions generally do not have the same impact on </span><span>all types of instruments and assets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Market Trading Risk.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Absence of Active Market.</span><span> Although shares of the Fund are listed for trading on one or </span><span>more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for </span><span>such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized </span><span>Participants.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Secondary Listings. </span><span>The Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S.</span><span> stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary </span><span>listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made available to non-U.S. investors </span><span>through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There </span><span>can be no assurance that the Fund’s shares will continue to trade on any such stock </span><span>exchange or in any market or that the Fund’s shares will continue to meet the </span><span>requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's shares </span><span>may be less actively traded in certain markets than in others, and investors are subject </span><span>to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of the market where they </span><span>or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to </span><span>investors who trade Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>9</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>hours may not be available to investors who trade in other markets, which may result </span><span>in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Secondary Market Trading Risk.</span><span> Shares of the Fund may trade in the secondary market </span><span>at times when the Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such </span><span>times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more significant premiums or </span><span>discounts than might be experienced at times when the Fund accepts purchase and </span><span>redemption orders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Secondary market trading in Fund shares may be halted by a stock exchange because </span><span>of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund shares on a </span><span>stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by </span><span>extraordinary market volatility pursuant to </span><span>“</span><span>circuit breaker</span><span>”</span><span> rules on the stock </span><span>exchange or market.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed on a stock exchange, may </span><span>be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price </span><span>decreases associated with being sold short. In addition, trading activity in derivative </span><span>products based on the Fund may lead to increased trading volume and volatility in the </span><span>secondary market for the shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV.</span><span> Shares of the Fund trade on </span><span>stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of </span><span>the Fund is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in </span><span>the market value of the Fund’s holdings. The trading price of the Fund's shares </span><span>fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours</span><span> </span><span>based on both market supply of and </span><span>demand for Fund shares and the underlying value of the Fund's portfolio holdings or </span><span>NAV. As a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s shares may deviate significantly from </span><span>NAV during periods of market volatility. </span><span>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, </span><span>MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO </span><span>NAV</span><span>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at </span><span>NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund are not </span><span>likely to be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, </span><span>which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, </span><span>their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely </span><span>that the Fund’s shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the </span><span>Fund’s next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly with </span><span>the Fund's NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other </span><span>factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at </span><span>market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during </span><span>periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the </span><span>Fund that differ significantly from its NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing to </span><span>create or redeem Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for such shares or </span><span>its underlying investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s shares trading at a </span><span>premium or discount to NAV.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.</span><span> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange </span><span>involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or </span><span>selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage </span><span>commission and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread</span><span>”</span><span>; </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>bid</span><span>”</span><span> price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>ask</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>price).</span><span> </span><span>The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume </span><span>and market liquidity and wider if the Fund has less trading volume and market liquidity. </span><span>In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be </span><span>regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because </span><span>of the costs inherent in buying or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract </span><span>significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be </span><span>advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a </span><span>brokerage account.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Model Risk.</span><span> Neither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances that the Index Provider’s </span><span>model will result in the Fund meeting its investment objective. The Fund may </span><span>underperform other funds that do not similarly invest.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>National Closed Market Trading Risk.</span><span> To the extent that the underlying securities or </span><span>other instruments held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets </span><span>that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the Fund’s shares trade is </span><span>open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of an underlying </span><span>security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the Fund’s quote </span><span>from the closed foreign market).</span><span> </span><span>The impact of a closed foreign market on the Fund is </span><span>likely to be greater where a large portion of the Fund’s underlying securities or other </span><span>instruments trade on that closed foreign market or when the foreign market is closed </span><span>for unscheduled reasons. These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to </span><span>the Fund’s NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Non-U.S. Securities Risk.</span><span> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are </span><span>subject to the risks of investing in the markets where such issuers are located, </span><span>including heightened risks of inflation, nationalization and market fluctuations caused </span><span>by economic and political developments. As a result of investing in non-U.S. securities, </span><span>the Fund may be subject to increased risk of loss caused by any of the factors listed </span><span>below:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Government intervention in issuers' operations or structure;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>A lack of market liquidity and market efficiency;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Greater securities price volatility;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Exchange rate fluctuations and exchange controls;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Less availability of public information about issuers;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Limitations on foreign ownership of securities;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Imposition of withholding or other taxes;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Imposition of restrictions on the expatriation of the funds or other assets of the </span><span>Fund;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Higher transaction and custody costs and delays in settlement procedures;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Lower levels of regulation of the securities markets;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Weaker accounting, disclosure and reporting requirements and the risk of being </span><span>delisted from U.S. exchanges; and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>■</span></div> <div><span>Legal principles relating to corporate governance, directors’ fiduciary duties and </span><span>liabilities and stockholders’ rights in markets in which the Fund invests may differ </span><span>from or may not be as extensive or protective as those that apply in the U.S.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Withholding Tax Reclaims Risk</span><span>. The Fund may file claims to recover withholding tax on </span><span>dividend and interest income (if any) received from issuers in certain countries where </span><span>such withholding tax reclaim is possible. Whether or when the Fund will receive a </span><span>withholding tax refund in the future is within the control of the tax authorities in such </span><span>countries. Where the Fund expects to recover withholding tax based on a continuous </span><span>assessment of probability of recovery, the NAV of the Fund generally includes accruals </span><span>for such tax refunds. The Fund continues to evaluate tax developments for potential </span><span>impact to the probability of recovery. If the likelihood of receiving refunds materially </span><span>decreases, for example due to a change in tax regulation or approach, accruals in the </span><span>Fund’s NAV for such refunds may need to be written down partially or in full, which will </span><span>adversely affect that Fund’s NAV. Investors in the Fund at the time an accrual is written </span><span>down will bear the impact of any resulting reduction in NAV regardless of whether they </span><span>were investors during the accrual period. Conversely, if a Fund receives a tax refund </span><span>that has not been previously accrued, investors in the Fund at the time the claim is </span><span>successful will benefit from any resulting increase in the Fund’s NAV. Investors who </span><span>sold their shares prior to such time will not benefit from such NAV increase.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Operational Risk.</span><span> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of </span><span>factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication </span><span>errors, errors of the Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third parties, </span><span>failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA </span><span>seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, </span><span>these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address </span><span>significant operational risks.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Reliance on Trading Partners Risk.</span><span> The economies of some countries or regions in </span><span>which the Fund invests are dependent on trading with certain key trading partners. </span><span>Reduction in spending on the products and services of these countries or regions, </span><span>institution of tariffs or other trade barriers by any of their key trading partners or a </span><span>slowdown in the economies of any of their key trading partners may cause an adverse </span><span>impact on the economies of such countries or regions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. </span><span>Investment in developed country issuers </span><span>may subject the Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and </span><span>other risks associated with developed countries. Developed countries generally tend to </span><span>rely on services sectors (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> the financial services sector) as the primary means of </span><span>economic growth. A prolonged slowdown in one or more services sectors is likely to </span><span>have a negative impact on economies of certain developed countries, although </span><span>economies of individual developed countries can be impacted by slowdowns in other </span><span>sectors. In the past, certain developed countries have been targets of terrorism, and </span><span>some geographic areas in which the Fund invests have experienced strained </span><span>international relations due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense </span><span>concerns and other security concerns. These situations may cause uncertainty in the </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>12</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>financial markets in these countries or geographic areas and may adversely affect the </span><span>performance of the issuers to which the Fund has exposure. Heavy regulation of </span><span>certain markets, including labor and product markets, may have an adverse effect on </span><span>certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause </span><span>prolonged periods of recession. Many developed countries are heavily indebted and </span><span>face rising healthcare and retirement expenses. In addition, price fluctuations of </span><span>certain commodities and regulations impacting the import of commodities may </span><span>negatively affect developed country economies.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Securities Lending Risk.</span><span> The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities </span><span>lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the </span><span>loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund </span><span>could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for </span><span>loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash </span><span>collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund. </span><span>BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>BTC</span><span>”</span><span>), the</span><span> </span><span>Fund's securities lending </span><span>agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments for </span><span>dividends when managing the</span><span> </span><span>Fund's securities lending program.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Small-Capitalization Companies Risk. </span><span>Stock prices of small-capitalization </span><span>companies may be more volatile than those of larger companies and, therefore, the </span><span>Fund's share price may be more volatile than those of funds that invest a larger </span><span>percentage of their assets in stocks issued by mid- or large-capitalization companies. </span><span>Stock prices of small-capitalization companies are generally more vulnerable than </span><span>those of mid- or large-capitalization companies to adverse business and economic </span><span>developments. Securities of small-capitalization companies may be thinly traded, </span><span>making it difficult for the Fund to buy and sell them. In addition, small-capitalization </span><span>companies are typically less financially stable than larger, more established companies </span><span>and may depend on a small number of essential personnel, making these companies </span><span>more vulnerable to experiencing adverse effects due to the loss of personnel. Small-capitalization</span><span> companies also normally have less diverse product lines than those of </span><span>mid- or large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse </span><span>developments concerning their products.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Tracking Error Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be subject to </span><span>“</span><span>tracking error,</span><span>”</span><span> which is the </span><span>divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error </span><span>may occur because of differences between the securities and other instruments held in </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing </span><span>differences</span><span> </span><span>(including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local </span><span>market close and the Fund's valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the </span><span>Fund's NAV), transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested </span><span>cash, differences in timing of the accrual or the valuation of dividends or interest </span><span>received by the Fund or distributions paid to the Fund’s shareholders, the requirements </span><span>to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize </span><span>the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, </span><span>changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various </span><span>new or existing regulatory requirements, among other reasons. This risk may be </span><span>heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>13</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, </span><span>while the Underlying Index does not. Tracking error may occur due to differences </span><span>between the methodologies used in calculating the value of the Underlying Index and </span><span>determining the Fund’s NAV. </span><span>BFA EXPECTS THAT THE FUND MAY EXPERIENCE </span><span>HIGHER TRACKING ERROR THAN IS TYPICAL FOR SIMILAR INDEX ETFs, </span><span>ESPECIALLY BEFORE THE FUND REACHES SUFFICIENT SCALE AND FURTHER </span><span>BROADENS ITS HOLDINGS</span><span>.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Valuation Risk.</span><span> The price the Fund could receive upon the sale of a security</span><span> </span><span>or other </span><span>asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the </span><span>value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other assets that trade </span><span>in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a </span><span>result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. Because non-U.S. exchanges may be </span><span>open on days or during time periods when the Fund does not price its shares, the value </span><span>of the securities or other assets in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during </span><span>time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s shares. </span><span>In addition, for purposes of calculating the Fund's NAV, the value of assets </span><span>denominated in non-U.S. currencies is translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing </span><span>market rates. This translation may result in a difference between the prices used to </span><span>calculate the Fund's NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn, </span><span>could result in a difference between the Fund's performance and the performance of </span><span>the Underlying Index. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on </span><span>days when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, </span><span>or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the </span><span>securities not been fair valued or been valued using a different methodology. The ability </span><span>to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing </span><span>services or other third-party service providers.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Value Securities Risk.</span><span> Value securities are those issued by companies that may be </span><span>perceived as undervalued. Value securities, particularly securities issued by a company </span><span>that appear to trade at a significant discount to the company’s intrinsic value, may fail </span><span>to appreciate for long periods of time and may never realize their full potential value. </span><span>Value securities have generally performed better than non-value securities during </span><span>periods of economic recovery (although there is no assurance that they will continue to </span><span>do so). At other times, value securities may not perform as well as growth securities or </span><span>the stock market in general, and may be out of favor with investors for varying periods </span><span>of time.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated with its investments </span><span>and investment strategies. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the </span><span>significance of any particular risk factor.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Australasian Economic Risk.</span><span> The economies of Australasia, which include Australia </span><span>and New Zealand, are dependent on exports from the energy, agricultural and mining </span><span>sectors. This makes Australasian economies susceptible to fluctuations in the </span><span>commodity markets. Australasian economies are also increasingly dependent on their </span><span>growing service industries. Because the economies of Australasia are dependent on </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>the economies of their key trading partners, which include the U.S., China, Japan, </span><span>South Korea, as well as other Asian countries and certain European countries, </span><span>reduction in spending by any of these trading partners on Australasian products and </span><span>services, or negative changes in any of these economies, may cause an adverse impact </span><span>on some or all of the Australasian economies. Economic events in key trading </span><span>countries can have a significant economic effect on the Australasian economies.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Basic Materials Industry Risk.</span><span> Issuers in the basic materials industry may be </span><span>adversely affected by commodity price volatility, exchange rate fluctuations, import </span><span>controls and increased competition. Production of industrial materials often exceeds </span><span>demand as a result of over-building or economic downturns, leading to poor </span><span>investment returns. Issuers in the basic materials industry are at risk for environmental </span><span>damage and product liability claims and may be adversely affected by depletion of </span><span>resources, delays in technical progress, labor relations and government regulations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Close-Out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.</span><span> Regulations adopted by global </span><span>prudential regulators require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global </span><span>systemically important banking organizations to include contractual restrictions on </span><span>close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. </span><span>Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards </span><span>and other derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending </span><span>agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial </span><span>contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution </span><span>proceedings and also prohibit the Fund from exercising default rights due to a </span><span>receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. These </span><span>requirements may increase credit risk and other risks to the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Consumer Discretionary Sector Risk.</span><span> The success of consumer product </span><span>manufacturers and retailers is tied closely to the performance of domestic and </span><span>international economies, interest rates, exchange rates, supply chains, competition, </span><span>consumer confidence, changes in demographics and consumer preferences. </span><span>Companies in the consumer discretionary sector depend heavily on disposable </span><span>household income and consumer spending, and may be strongly affected by social </span><span>trends and marketing campaigns. These companies may be subject to severe </span><span>competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Consumer Staples Sector Risk.</span><span> Companies in the consumer staples sector may be </span><span>affected by the regulation of various product components and production methods, </span><span>marketing campaigns and changes in the global economy, consumer spending and </span><span>consumer demand. Tobacco and tobacco-related companies, in particular, may be </span><span>adversely affected by new laws, regulations and litigation. Companies in the consumer </span><span>staples sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity </span><span>prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. These companies may be </span><span>subject to severe competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividend-Paying Stock Risk.</span><span> Investing in dividend-paying stocks involves the risk </span><span>that such stocks may fall out of favor with investors and underperform the broader </span><span>market. Companies that issue dividend-paying stocks are not required to pay or </span><span>continue paying dividends on such stocks. It is possible that issuers of the stocks held </span><span>by the Fund will not declare dividends in the future or will reduce or eliminate the </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>15</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>payment of dividends (including reducing or eliminating anticipated accelerations or </span><span>increases in the payment of dividends) in the future.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Illiquid Investments Risk. </span><span>The Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, </span><span>immediately after the acquisition, the Fund would have invested more than 15% of its </span><span>net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the </span><span>Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in </span><span>seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the </span><span>investment. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, </span><span>particularly during periods of market turmoil. There can be no assurance that a security </span><span>or instrument that is deemed to be liquid when purchased will continue to be liquid for </span><span>as long as it is held by the Fund, and any security or instrument held by the Fund may </span><span>be deemed an illiquid investment pursuant to the Fund’s liquidity risk management </span><span>program. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid investments may </span><span>reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be unable to transact at </span><span>advantageous times or prices. An investment may be illiquid due to, among other </span><span>things, the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a </span><span>market in securities or instruments, the lack of an active market for such securities or </span><span>instruments, capital controls, delays or limits on repatriation of local currency, or </span><span>insolvency of local governments. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or </span><span>instruments with substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have </span><span>increased exposure to the risks associated with illiquid investments. Illiquid </span><span>investments may be harder to value, especially in changing markets. Although the Fund </span><span>primarily seeks to redeem shares of the Fund on an in-kind basis, if the Fund is forced </span><span>to sell underlying investments at reduced prices or under unfavorable conditions to </span><span>meet redemption requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. This </span><span>may be magnified in a rising interest rate environment or other circumstances where </span><span>redemptions from the Fund may be greater than normal. Other market participants </span><span>may be attempting to liquidate holdings at the same time as the Fund, causing </span><span>increased supply of the Fund’s underlying investments in the market and contributing </span><span>to illiquid investments risk and downward pricing pressure. In addition, if the Fund is </span><span>limited in its ability to sell illiquid investments during periods when shareholders are </span><span>redeeming their shares, the Fund will need to sell liquid securities to meet redemption </span><span>requests and illiquid securities will become a larger portion of the Fund’s holdings. </span><span>During periods of market volatility, liquidity in the market for the Fund’s shares may be </span><span>impacted by the liquidity in the market for the underlying securities or instruments </span><span>held by the Fund, which could lead to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or </span><span>discount to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Large Shareholder and Large-Scale Redemption Risk.</span><span> Certain shareholders, </span><span>including an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an </span><span>affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, a market maker, or another entity, may from time to time </span><span>own or manage a substantial amount of Fund shares or may invest in the Fund and </span><span>hold their investment for a limited period of time. These shareholders may also pledge </span><span>or loan Fund shares (to secure financing or otherwise), which may result in the shares </span><span>becoming concentrated in another party. There can be no assurance that any large </span><span>shareholder or large group of shareholders would not redeem their investment or that </span><span>the size of the Fund would be maintained. Redemptions of a large number of Fund </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>16</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>shares by these shareholders may adversely affect the Fund’s liquidity and net assets. </span><span>To the extent the Fund permits redemptions in cash, these redemptions may force the </span><span>Fund to sell portfolio securities when it might not otherwise do so, which may </span><span>negatively impact the Fund’s NAV, have a material effect on the market price of the </span><span>Shares and increase the Fund’s brokerage costs and/or accelerate the realization of </span><span>taxable income and/or gains and cause the Fund to make taxable distributions to its </span><span>shareholders earlier than the Fund otherwise would have. In addition, under certain </span><span>circumstances, non-redeeming shareholders may be treated as receiving a </span><span>disproportionately large taxable distribution during or with respect to such tax year. </span><span>The Fund also may be required to sell its more liquid Fund investments to meet a large </span><span>redemption, in which case the Fund’s remaining assets may be less liquid, more </span><span>volatile, and more difficult to price. To the extent these large shareholders transact in </span><span>shares on the secondary market, such transactions may account for a large </span><span>percentage of the trading volume for the shares of the Fund and may, therefore, have a </span><span>material upward or downward effect on the market price of the Fund shares. In </span><span>addition, large purchases of Fund shares may adversely affect the Fund’s performance </span><span>to the extent that the Fund is delayed in investing new cash and is required to maintain </span><span>a larger cash position than it ordinarily would, diluting its investment returns.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Real Estate Investment Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies, such as REITs,</span><span> </span><span>real estate </span><span>holding and operating companies, and real estate management or development </span><span>companies, expose investors to the risks of owning real estate directly, as well as to </span><span>risks that relate specifically to the way in which Real Estate Companies are organized </span><span>and operated. Real estate is highly sensitive to general and local economic conditions </span><span>and developments and is characterized by intense competition and periodic </span><span>overbuilding. Many Real Estate Companies, including REITs,</span><span> </span><span>utilize leverage (and some </span><span>may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk and the risk normally </span><span>associated with debt financing, and could potentially increase the Fund’s losses. Rising </span><span>interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which </span><span>could negatively affect a Real Estate Company's ability to meet its payment obligations </span><span>or its financing activity and could decrease the market prices for REITs and for </span><span>properties held by such REITs. In addition, to the extent a Real Estate Company has its </span><span>own expenses, the Fund (and indirectly, its shareholders) will bear its proportionate </span><span>share of such expenses.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Concentration Risk</span><span>. Real Estate Companies may own a limited number of properties </span><span>and concentrate their investments in a particular geographic region, industry or </span><span>property type. Economic downturns affecting a particular region, industry or property </span><span>type may lead to a high volume of defaults within a short period.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Equity REITs Risk. </span><span>Certain REITs may make direct investments in real estate. These </span><span>REITs are often referred to as </span><span>“</span><span>Equity REITs.</span><span>”</span><span> Equity REITs invest primarily in real </span><span>properties and may earn rental income from leasing those properties. Equity REITs may </span><span>also realize gains or losses from the sale of properties. Equity REITs will be affected by </span><span>conditions in the real estate rental market and by changes in the value of the </span><span>properties they own. A decline in rental income may occur because of extended </span><span>vacancies, limitations on rents, the failure to collect rents, increased competition from </span><span>other properties or poor management. Equity REITs also can be affected by rising </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>17</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>interest rates. Rising interest rates may cause investors to demand a high annual yield </span><span>from future distributions that, in turn, could decrease the market prices for such REITs </span><span>and for the properties held by such REITs. In addition, rising interest rates also increase </span><span>the costs of obtaining financing for real estate projects. Because many real estate </span><span>projects are dependent upon receiving financing, this could cause the value of the </span><span>Equity REITs in which the Fund invests to decline.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Illiquidity Risk</span><span>. Investing in Real Estate Companies may involve risks similar to those </span><span>associated with investing in small-capitalization companies. Real Estate Company </span><span>securities may be volatile. There may be less trading in Real Estate Company shares, </span><span>which means that purchase and sale transactions in those shares could have a </span><span>magnified impact on share price, resulting in abrupt or erratic price fluctuations. In </span><span>addition, real estate is relatively illiquid and, therefore, a Real Estate Company may </span><span>have a limited ability to vary or liquidate its investments in properties in response to </span><span>changes in economic or other conditions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Interest Rate Risk</span><span>. Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real </span><span>Estate Companies, which could negatively affect a Real Estate Company’s ability to </span><span>meet its payment obligations. Declining interest rates could result in increased </span><span>prepayment on loans and require redeployment of capital in less desirable </span><span>investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Leverage Risk</span><span>. Real Estate Companies may use leverage (and some may be highly </span><span>leveraged), which increases investment risk and the risks normally associated with </span><span>debt financing and could adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s operations and </span><span>market value in periods of rising interest rates. Financial covenants related to a Real </span><span>Estate Company’s leveraging may affect the ability of the Real Estate Company to </span><span>operate effectively. In addition, investments may be subject to defaults by borrowers </span><span>and tenants. Leveraging may also increase repayment risk.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Loan Foreclosure Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may foreclose on loans that the Real </span><span>Estate Company originated and/or acquired. Foreclosure may generate negative </span><span>publicity for the underlying property that affects its market value. In addition to the </span><span>length and expense of such proceedings, the validity of the terms of the applicable </span><span>loan may not be recognized in foreclosure proceedings.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Operational Risk</span><span>. Real Estate Companies are dependent upon management skills and </span><span>may have limited financial resources. Real Estate Companies are generally not </span><span>diversified and may be subject to heavy cash flow dependency, default by borrowers </span><span>and self-liquidation. In addition, transactions between Real Estate Companies and their </span><span>affiliates may be subject to conflicts of interest, which may adversely affect a Real </span><span>Estate Company’s shareholders. A Real Estate Company may also have joint ventures </span><span>in certain of its properties and, consequently, its ability to control decisions relating to </span><span>such properties may be limited.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Property Risk</span><span>. Real Estate Companies may be subject to risks relating to functional </span><span>obsolescence or reduced desirability of properties; extended vacancies due to </span><span>economic conditions and tenant bankruptcies; property damage due to events such as </span><span>earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, rodent, insect or disease infestations and terrorist </span><span>acts; eminent domain seizures; and casualty or condemnation losses. Real estate </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>18</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>income and values also may be greatly affected by demographic trends, such as </span><span>population shifts, changes in consumer preferences and values, increasing vacancies </span><span>or declining rents resulting from legal, cultural, technological, global or local economic </span><span>developments and changes in tax law.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Regulatory Risk</span><span>. Real estate income and values may be adversely affected by </span><span>applicable domestic and foreign laws (including tax laws). Government actions, such as </span><span>tax increases, zoning law changes, mandated closures or other commercial </span><span>restrictions, reduced funding for schools, parks, garbage collection and other public </span><span>services or environmental regulations also may have a major impact on real estate </span><span>income and values.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Repayment Risk.</span><span> The prices of Real Estate Company securities may drop because of </span><span>the failure of borrowers to repay their loans, poor management, or the inability to </span><span>obtain financing either on favorable terms or at all. If the properties in which Real </span><span>Estate Companies invest do not generate sufficient income to meet operating </span><span>expenses, including, where applicable, debt service, ground lease payments, tenant </span><span>improvements, third-party leasing commissions and other capital expenditures, the </span><span>income and ability of the Real Estate Companies to make payments of interest and </span><span>principal on their loans will be adversely affected.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>U.S. Tax Risk. </span><span>Certain U.S. Real Estate Companies are subject to special U.S. federal </span><span>tax requirements. A REIT that fails to comply with such tax requirements may be </span><span>subject to U.S. federal income taxation, which may affect the value of the REIT and the </span><span>characterization of the REIT’s distributions. The U.S. federal tax requirement that a </span><span>REIT distributes substantially all of its net income to its shareholders may result in the </span><span>REIT having insufficient capital for future expenditures. A REIT that successfully </span><span>maintains its qualification may still become subject to U.S. federal, state and local </span><span>taxes, including excise, penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage recording, and transfer </span><span>taxes, both directly and indirectly through its subsidiaries.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.</span><span> If certain aggregate and/or fund-level ownership </span><span>thresholds are reached through transactions undertaken by BFA, its affiliates or the </span><span>Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions or actions by an issuer or regulator, the </span><span>ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to purchase or </span><span>dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be </span><span>restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make </span><span>investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant threshold limits, and </span><span>such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio holdings</span><span> </span><span>compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This </span><span>may increase the risk of the Fund being underinvested to the Underlying Index and </span><span>increase the risk of tracking error.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For example, in certain circumstances where the Fund invests in securities issued by </span><span>companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or </span><span>international markets, is subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or </span><span>invests in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits on the </span><span>aggregate and/or fund-level amount invested or voted by BFA and its affiliates for their </span><span>proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Fund) that may not be </span><span>exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>19</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>exceeded, may cause BFA and its affiliates, the Fund or other client accounts to suffer </span><span>disadvantages or business restrictions.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Portfolio Holdings Information</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A description of the Trust's policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Fund's Statement of Additional </span><span>Information (</span><span>“</span><span>SAI</span><span>”</span><span>). The Fund discloses its portfolio holdings daily at www.iShares.com. </span><span>Fund fact sheets providing information regarding the Fund's top holdings are posted on </span><span>www.iShares.com when available and may be requested by calling 1-800-iShares </span><span>(1-800-474-2737).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Management</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investment Adviser.</span><span> As investment adviser, BFA has overall responsibility for the </span><span>general management and administration of the Fund. BFA provides an investment </span><span>program for the Fund and manages the investment of the Fund’s assets. In managing </span><span>the Fund, BFA may draw upon the research and expertise of its asset management </span><span>affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's </span><span>investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists </span><span>and other investment specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines </span><span>and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and the Trust (entered </span><span>into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the </span><span>Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with </span><span>respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of </span><span>portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, </span><span>and litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of </span><span>the Trustees who are not </span><span>“</span><span>interested persons</span><span>”</span><span> of the Trust). Operating expenses paid </span><span>by BFA under the Investment Advisory Agreement exclude acquired fund fees and </span><span>expenses, if any.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, BFA was paid a management fee from the </span><span>Fund, as a percentage of the Fund's average daily net assets, net of any applicable </span><span>waivers, at the annual rate of 0.30%. Effective June 30, 2023, BFA is paid a </span><span>management fee from the Fund, as a percentage of the Fund's average daily net </span><span>assets, at the annual rate of 0.30%. Prior to June 30, 2023, BFA had contractually </span><span>agreed to waive a portion of its management fee such that the Fund's total annual fund </span><span>operating expenses after the fee waiver would not exceed 0.30%. The contractual </span><span>waiver was terminated as of June 30, 2023, by written agreement of the Trust and BFA. </span><span>BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses in </span><span>order to limit total annual fund operating expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and </span><span>expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by </span><span>BFA at any time.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BFA is located at 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.

BFA and its Affiliates provide investment </span><span>management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that may </span><span>follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA and its Affiliates are </span><span>involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management </span><span>activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in which their </span><span>interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or </span><span>one or more Affiliates act, or may act, as an investor, research provider, investment </span><span>manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>21</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>adviser, trader, lender,</span><span> </span><span>index provider, agent and/or principal, and have other direct </span><span>and indirect interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other </span><span>instruments in which the Fund may directly or indirectly invest. The Fund may invest in </span><span>securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate </span><span>has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The Fund may also invest </span><span>in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which an Affiliate provides and is </span><span>compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of </span><span>such issuances. The Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in other </span><span>transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate provides or may in the future </span><span>provide research coverage. An Affiliate may have business relationships with, and </span><span>purchase or distribute or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants </span><span>or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, </span><span>and may receive compensation for such services. BFA or one or more Affiliates may </span><span>engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment </span><span>objectives similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for </span><span>transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the </span><span>Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end</span><span> investment companies (which may include investment companies that are </span><span>affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment </span><span>Company Act of 1940, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1940 Act</span><span>”</span><span>)). The trading activities of BFA and </span><span>these Affiliates are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly </span><span>by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate having positions in certain securities </span><span>that are senior or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities </span><span>that are owned by the Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to share any investment </span><span>opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with </span><span>the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's </span><span>investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an Affiliate and of other </span><span>accounts managed by BlackRock or an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could </span><span>sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts </span><span>achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The opposite result is </span><span>also possible.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, the Fund may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an </span><span>Affiliate or</span><span> </span><span>its or their directors, officers, employees or clients have an adverse interest. </span><span>Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or managed by BFA or its </span><span>Affiliates may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or</span><span> </span><span>by </span><span>BFA or its Affiliates or their directors, officers or employees may have the effect of </span><span>diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund's activities may be limited because of regulatory restrictions applicable to </span><span>BFA or one or more Affiliates and/or their internal policies designed to comply with </span><span>such restrictions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Under a securities lending program approved by the Board, the Fund has retained BTC, </span><span>an Affiliate of BFA, to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent </span><span>that the Fund participates in the securities lending program.

In addition, one or more Affiliates may be among the entities </span><span>to which the Fund may lend its portfolio securities under the securities lending </span><span>program.</span></div> <div> <div><span>It is also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients </span><span>(including other funds and separately managed accounts) may, subject to compliance </span><span>with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of the Fund. The price, availability, </span><span>liquidity, and (in some cases) expense ratio of the Fund may be impacted by purchases </span><span>and sales of the Fund by BlackRock and/or its advisory clients.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The activities of BFA and its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers or </span><span>employees may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund </span><span>and its shareholders. BFA has adopted policies and procedures designed to address </span><span>these potential conflicts of interest. See the SAI for further information.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shareholder Information</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Additional shareholder information, including how to buy and sell shares of the Fund, is </span><span>available free of charge by calling toll-free: 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or visiting </span><span>our website at www.iShares.com.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Buying and Selling Shares.</span><span> Shares of the Fund may be acquired or redeemed directly </span><span>from the Fund only in Creation Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the </span><span>Creations </span><span>and Redemptions</span><span> section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, </span><span>shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a </span><span>Creation Unit.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange for trading during the </span><span>trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of </span><span>other publicly traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment </span><span>for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or otherwise in the secondary </span><span>market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol </span><span>“</span><span>ISVL.</span><span>”</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary market involves two </span><span>types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling </span><span>shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other </span><span>charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may be a significant </span><span>proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In </span><span>addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread,</span><span>”</span><span> that is, any difference between the </span><span>bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over time for shares of the Fund based </span><span>on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund </span><span>has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity (which is often the case for funds that are newly launched </span><span>or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity or illiquidity </span><span>of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller </span><span>funds or in instances of significant volatility of the underlying securities.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>23</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund does not impose restrictions on the frequency of purchases and redemptions </span><span>of Fund shares directly with the Fund. The Board determined not to adopt policies and </span><span>procedures designed to prevent or monitor for frequent purchases and redemptions of </span><span>Fund shares because the Fund generally sells and redeems its shares directly through </span><span>transactions that are in-kind and/or for cash, with a deadline for placing cash-related </span><span>transactions no later than the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio </span><span>securities. However, the Fund has taken certain measures (</span><span>e.g</span><span>., imposing transaction </span><span>fees on purchases and redemptions of Creation Units and reserving the right to reject </span><span>purchases of Creation Units under certain circumstances) to minimize the potential </span><span>consequences of frequent cash purchases and redemptions by Authorized Participants, </span><span>such as increased tracking error, disruption of portfolio management, dilution to the </span><span>Fund, and/or increased transaction costs. Further, the vast majority of trading in Fund </span><span>shares occurs on the secondary market, which does not involve the Fund directly, and </span><span>such trading is unlikely to cause many of the harmful effects of frequent cash </span><span>purchases or redemptions of Fund shares.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed is open for </span><span>trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays </span><span>(or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, </span><span>Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor </span><span>Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is Cboe </span><span>BZX.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act generally restricts investments by investment </span><span>companies, including foreign and unregistered investment companies, in the securities </span><span>of other investment companies. For example, a registered investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquired Fund</span><span>”</span><span>), such as the Fund, may not knowingly sell or otherwise dispose of any </span><span>security issued by the Acquired Fund to any investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquiring </span><span>Fund</span><span>”</span><span>) or any company or companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund if, immediately </span><span>after such sale or disposition: (i) more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of </span><span>the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and any company or companies </span><span>controlled by the Acquiring Fund, or (ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding voting </span><span>stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and other investment </span><span>companies and companies controlled by them. However, registered investment </span><span>companies are permitted to invest in the Fund beyond the limits set forth in Section </span><span>12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in SEC rules. In order for a </span><span>registered investment company to invest in shares of the Fund beyond the limitations </span><span>of Section 12(d)(1) in reliance on Rule 12d1-4 under the 1940 Act, the registered </span><span>investment company must, among other things, enter into an agreement with the </span><span>Trust. Foreign investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund only up to the </span><span>limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to any applicable SEC no-action relief.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Book Entry.</span><span> Shares of the Fund are held in book-entry form, which means that no </span><span>stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (</span><span>“</span><span>DTC</span><span>”</span><span>) or its nominee is </span><span>the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as shown on the records of </span><span>DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. </span><span>DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>24</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>clearing corporations and other institutions that directly or indirectly maintain a </span><span>custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to </span><span>receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your </span><span>name, and you are not considered a registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise </span><span>any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its </span><span>participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other </span><span>securities that you hold in book-entry or </span><span>“</span><span>street name</span><span>”</span><span> form.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Share Prices.</span><span> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market </span><span>generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as </span><span>the supply of and demand for ETF shares and shares of underlying securities held by </span><span>the Fund, economic conditions and other factors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Determination of Net Asset Value. </span><span>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined </span><span>once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the close of regular trading hours of </span><span>the New York Stock Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>NYSE</span><span>”</span><span>) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day </span><span>that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that </span><span>any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are </span><span>translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as </span><span>quoted by one or more data service providers. The NAV of the Fund is calculated by </span><span>dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the value of its total assets less </span><span>total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally </span><span>rounded to the nearest cent.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities held by the Fund is </span><span>determined pursuant to BFA’s valuation policies and procedures. BFA has been </span><span>designated by the Board as the valuation designee for the Fund pursuant to Rule 2a-5 </span><span>under the 1940 Act.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Equity securities and other equity instruments for which market quotations are readily </span><span>available are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the last </span><span>reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the last </span><span>traded price on the exchange or market on which the security or instrument is </span><span>primarily traded at the time of valuation. Shares of underlying open-end funds </span><span>(including money market funds) are valued at net asset value. Shares of underlying </span><span>exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs are valued at their most recent </span><span>closing price.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities and money market instruments is substantially </span><span>completed each day at various times prior to the close of regular trading hours of the </span><span>NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are </span><span>determined as of such times.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be </span><span>unreliable, BFA will fair value the Fund’s investments in accordance with its policies </span><span>and procedures. BFA may conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is </span><span>unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its </span><span>lack of trading or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent </span><span>price quotations or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security </span><span>or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>25</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is </span><span>listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is </span><span>available. A </span><span>“</span><span>significant event</span><span>”</span><span> is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable </span><span>business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s assets or liabilities, that </span><span>the event is likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or </span><span>closing market price of one or more assets held by, or liabilities of, the Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>For certain foreign assets, a third-party vendor supplies evaluated, systematic fair </span><span>value pricing based upon the movement of a proprietary multi-factor model after the </span><span>relevant foreign markets have closed. This systematic fair value pricing methodology is </span><span>designed to correlate the prices of foreign assets in one or more non-U.S. markets </span><span>following the close of the local markets to the prices that might have prevailed as of </span><span>the Fund’s pricing time.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The </span><span>fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might </span><span>reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to </span><span>extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments </span><span>using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market </span><span>valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been </span><span>sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value </span><span>prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the </span><span>prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, </span><span>which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the </span><span>performance of the Underlying Index.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividends and Distributions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>General Policies.</span><span> Dividends from net investment income, if any, generally are declared </span><span>and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, </span><span>if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make </span><span>distributions on a more frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to </span><span>declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or </span><span>advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company (</span><span>“</span><span>RIC</span><span>”</span><span>) or to avoid </span><span>imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are distributed on a </span><span>pro rata</span><span> </span><span>basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC </span><span>participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds </span><span>received from the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividend Reinvestment Service.</span><span> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the </span><span>Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment </span><span>Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend </span><span>distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the </span><span>availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers </span><span>may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this </span><span>service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains </span><span>will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in </span><span>the secondary market.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>26</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Note on Tax Information.</span><span> The following sections summarize some of the consequences </span><span>under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for </span><span>personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund </span><span>distributions and sales of shares. Certain states and localities may exempt from tax </span><span>distributions attributable to interest from U.S. federal government obligations. Consult </span><span>your personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in </span><span>shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Taxes.</span><span> As with any investment, you should consider how your investment in shares of </span><span>the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general </span><span>information, based on current law. You should consult your own tax professional about </span><span>the tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Unless your investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred</span><span> retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally </span><span>will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax </span><span>consequences when the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxes on Distributions.</span><span> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income (other </span><span>than qualified dividend income), including</span><span> </span><span>distributions of income from securities </span><span>lending and distributions out of the Fund’s net short-term capital gains, if any, are </span><span>taxable to you as ordinary income. Distributions by the Fund of net long-term capital </span><span>gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain dividends) are </span><span>taxable to you as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the </span><span>Fund’s shares. Distributions by the Fund that qualify as qualified dividend income are </span><span>taxable to you at long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified </span><span>dividend income are generally eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for </span><span>non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain </span><span>threshold amounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is </span><span>imposed on </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income,</span><span>”</span><span> including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, </span><span>and net gain, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if </span><span>married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividends will be qualified dividend income to you if they are attributable to qualified </span><span>dividend income received by the Fund. Generally, qualified dividend income includes </span><span>dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S. corporations, </span><span>provided that the Fund satisfies certain holding period requirements in respect of the </span><span>stock of such corporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. </span><span>Substitute dividends received by the Fund with respect to dividends paid on securities </span><span>lent out will not be qualified dividend income. For this purpose, a qualified non-U.S. </span><span>corporation means any non-U.S. corporation that is eligible for benefits under a </span><span>comprehensive income tax treaty with the U.S., which includes an exchange of </span><span>information program, or if the stock with respect to which the dividend was paid is </span><span>readily tradable on an established U.S. securities market. The term excludes a </span><span>corporation that is a passive foreign investment company.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividends received by the Fund from a RIC generally are qualified dividend income only </span><span>to the extent such dividend distributions are made out of qualified dividend income </span><span>received by such RIC. Additionally, it is expected that dividends received by the Fund </span><span>from a REIT and distributed to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>27</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>shareholder as ordinary income. However, for tax years beginning after December 31, </span><span>2017 and before January 1, 2026, the Fund may report dividends eligible for a 20% </span><span>“</span><span>qualified business income</span><span>”</span><span> deduction for non-corporate U.S. shareholders to the </span><span>extent the Fund’s income is derived from ordinary REIT dividends, reduced by allocable </span><span>Fund expenses.</span></div> <div> <div><span>For a dividend to be treated as qualified dividend income, the dividend must be </span><span>received with respect to a share of stock held without being hedged by the Fund, and </span><span>with respect to a share of the Fund held without being hedged by you, for 61 days </span><span>during the 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days before the date on </span><span>which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of </span><span>certain preferred stock, 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before </span><span>such date.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fund distributions, to the extent attributable to dividends from U.S. corporations, will </span><span>be eligible for the dividends received deduction for Fund shareholders that are </span><span>corporations, subject to certain hedging and holding requirements.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal income tax for the year when </span><span>they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on </span><span>December 31 of the prior year.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If the Fund’s distributions exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits, all or </span><span>a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a </span><span>return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum </span><span>distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be </span><span>taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return </span><span>of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder’s </span><span>cost basis and result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those shares on </span><span>which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is </span><span>reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the shareholder </span><span>holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividends, interest and capital gains earned by the Fund with respect to securities </span><span>issued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to withholding, capital gains and other taxes </span><span>imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the </span><span>U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If more than 50% of the total assets of the </span><span>Fund at the close of a year consists of non-U.S. stocks or securities (generally, for this </span><span>purpose, depositary receipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S. companies are </span><span>treated as </span><span>“</span><span>non-U.S.</span><span>”</span><span>), generally the Fund may </span><span>“</span><span>pass through</span><span>”</span><span> to you certain non-U.S. </span><span>income taxes (including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund. This means that you </span><span>would be considered to have received as an additional dividend your share of such </span><span>non-U.S. taxes, but you may be entitled to either a corresponding tax deduction in </span><span>calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations, a credit in </span><span>calculating your U.S. federal income tax. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For purposes of foreign tax credits for U.S. shareholders of the Fund, foreign capital </span><span>gains taxes may not produce associated foreign source income, limiting the availability </span><span>of such credits for U.S. persons.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>28</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if you are a non-U.S. entity </span><span>(other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s </span><span>ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) </span><span>will generally be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate </span><span>applies, provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income </span><span>realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital </span><span>gains or upon the sale or other disposition of shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, </span><span>interest and other income items paid to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S.</span><span> investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the U.S. Internal </span><span>Revenue Service (</span><span>“</span><span>IRS</span><span>”</span><span>) information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account </span><span>holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information </span><span>regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial </span><span>institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will </span><span>provide the IRS information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer </span><span>identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders, comply with due </span><span>diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts, report to the </span><span>IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax </span><span>on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account </span><span>holders who fail to provide the required information, and determine certain other </span><span>information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable </span><span>intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local </span><span>revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may </span><span>need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each </span><span>substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless </span><span>certain exceptions apply.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If your Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending arrangement, you </span><span>may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends paid while the shares are held by the </span><span>borrower as qualified dividend income. In addition, you may lose the ability to use </span><span>foreign tax credits passed through by the Fund if your Fund shares are loaned out </span><span>pursuant to a securities lending agreement.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup withholding at a 24% rate </span><span>will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer </span><span>identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxes When Shares Are Sold.</span><span> Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale </span><span>of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been </span><span>held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund </span><span>shares held for one year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except </span><span>that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term</span><span> capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to </span><span>such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from </span><span>capital gain dividends, are included in </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income</span><span>”</span><span> for purposes of the </span><span>3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned above.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Creations and Redemptions.</span><span> Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the </span><span>Fund are </span><span>“</span><span>created</span><span>”</span><span> at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>29</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>block-size Creation Units or multiples thereof.

An </span><span>Authorized Participant is a member or participant of a clearing agency registered with </span><span>the SEC, which has a written agreement with the Fund or one of its service providers </span><span>that allows such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and </span><span>redemption of Creation Units.</span></div> <div> <div><span>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the Distributor and the Fund, </span><span>generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a </span><span>designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>creation basket</span><span>”</span><span>), and </span><span>an amount of cash (including any cash representing the value of substituted securities, </span><span>assets or other positions), if any, which together approximate the holdings of the Fund </span><span>in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. Similarly, shares can be </span><span>redeemed only in Creation Units, generally for a designated portfolio of securities, </span><span>assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>redemption basket</span><span>”</span><span>) held by the Fund and an amount of </span><span>cash (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted).

Such payments, which may </span><span>be significant to the intermediary, are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments </span><span>are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or </span><span>indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type </span><span>are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may </span><span>make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or </span><span>the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other </span><span>financial incentives it is eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial </span><span>incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the </span><span>intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the </span><span>Fund or other iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding </span><span>these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. </span><span>Please contact your salesperson or </span><span>other investment professional for more information regarding any such </span><span>payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>32</span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Financial Highlights</span></div> <div> <div><span>The financial highlights table is intended to help investors understand the Fund’s </span><span>financial performance since inception.

This SAI relates solely to the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund is managed by BlackRock Fund Advisors (</span><span>“</span><span>BFA</span><span>”</span><span>), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc., and </span><span>generally seeks to track the investment results of the specific benchmark index identified in the Fund's Prospectus (the </span><span>“</span><span>Underlying Index</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund offers and issues shares at their net asset value per share (</span><span>“</span><span>NAV</span><span>”</span><span>) only in aggregations of a specified number of </span><span>shares (each, a </span><span>“</span><span>Creation Unit</span><span>”</span><span>), generally in exchange for a designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions </span><span>(including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) included in its Underlying Index (the </span><span>“</span><span>Deposit </span><span>Securities</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>Creation Basket</span><span>”</span><span>), together with the deposit of a specified cash payment (the </span><span>“</span><span>Cash Component</span><span>”</span><span>). Shares of </span><span>the Fund are listed and trade on NYSE Arca, Inc. (the </span><span>“</span><span>Listing Exchange</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>NYSE Arca</span><span>”</span><span>), a national securities exchange. </span><span>Shares of the Fund are traded in the secondary market and elsewhere at market prices that may be at, above or below the </span><span>Fund's NAV. Shares are redeemable only in Creation Units by Authorized Participants (as defined in the </span><span>Creation and </span><span>Redemption of Creation Units-Role of the Authorized Participant</span><span> section of this SAI) and, generally, in exchange for portfolio </span><span>securities and a Cash Amount (as defined in the </span><span>Redemption of Creation Units</span><span> section of this SAI). Creation Units typically are </span><span>a specified number of shares, generally 50,000 or multiples thereof.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Trust reserves the right to permit or require that creations and redemptions of shares are effected fully or partially in cash </span><span>and reserves the right to permit or require the substitution of Deposit Securities in lieu of cash.

The Trust may use </span><span>such collateral at any time to purchase Deposit Securities. See the </span><span>Creation and Redemption of Creation Units</span><span> section of this </span><span>SAI. Transaction fees and other costs associated with creations or redemptions that include a cash portion may be higher </span><span>than the transaction fees and other costs associated with in-kind creations or redemptions. In all cases, conditions with </span><span>respect to creations and redemptions of shares and fees will be limited in accordance with the requirements of SEC rules and </span><span>regulations applicable to management investment companies offering redeemable securities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Exchange Listing and Trading</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A discussion of exchange listing and trading matters associated with an investment in the Fund is contained in the </span><span>Shareholder Information</span><span> section of the Fund's Prospectus. The discussion below supplements, and should be read in </span><span>conjunction with, that section of the Prospectus.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund are listed for trading, and trade throughout the day, on the Listing Exchange and in other secondary </span><span>markets. Shares of the Fund may also be listed on certain non-U.S. exchanges. There can be no assurance that the </span><span>requirements of the Listing Exchange necessary to maintain the listing of shares of the Fund will continue to be met. The </span><span>Listing Exchange may, but is not required to, remove the shares of the Fund from listing if, among other things: (i) following </span><span>the initial 12-month period beginning upon the commencement of trading of Fund shares, there are fewer than 50 record </span><span>and/or beneficial owners of shares of the Fund; (ii) the Fund is no longer eligible to operate in reliance on Rule 6c-11 under </span><span>the Investment Company Act; (iii) any of the other listing requirements are not continuously maintained; or (iv) any event </span><span>shall occur or condition shall exist that, in the opinion of the Listing Exchange, makes further dealings on the Listing </span><span>Exchange inadvisable. The Listing Exchange will also remove shares of the Fund from listing and trading upon termination of </span><span>the Fund.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As in the case of other publicly-traded securities, when you buy or sell shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a </span><span>brokerage commission determined by that broker, as well as other charges.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Trust reserves the right to adjust the share price of the Fund in the future to maintain convenient trading ranges for </span><span>investors. Any adjustments would be accomplished through stock splits or reverse stock splits, which would have no effect </span><span>on the net assets of the Fund or an investor's equity interest in the Fund.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Investment Strategies and Risks of the Fund</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing primarily in securities issued by issuers that compose its Underlying </span><span>Index and in investments that provide substantially similar exposure to securities in the Underlying Index. The Fund operates </span><span>as an index fund and is not actively managed. Adverse performance of a security in the Fund’s portfolio will ordinarily not </span><span>result in the elimination of the security from the Fund’s portfolio.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund engages in representative sampling, which is investing in a sample of securities selected by BFA to have a collective </span><span>investment profile similar to that of the Fund's Underlying Index. Securities selected have aggregate investment </span><span>characteristics (based on market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return </span><span>variability, earnings valuation and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of the Fund’s Underlying Index. A fund that </span><span>uses representative sampling generally does not hold all of the securities that are in its underlying index.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Although the Fund does not seek leveraged returns, certain instruments used by the Fund may have a leveraging effect as </span><span>described below.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Borrowing. </span><span> </span><span>The Fund may borrow for temporary or emergency purposes, including to meet payments due from </span><span>redemptions or to facilitate the settlement of securities or other transactions.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The purchase of securities while borrowings are outstanding may have the effect of leveraging the Fund. The incurrence of </span><span>leverage increases the Fund’s exposure to risk, and borrowed funds are subject to interest costs that will reduce net income. </span><span>Purchasing securities while borrowings are outstanding creates special risks, such as the potential for greater volatility in the </span><span>NAV of Fund shares and in the yield on the Fund’s portfolio. In addition, the interest expenses from borrowings may exceed </span><span>the income generated by the Fund’s portfolio and, therefore, the amount available (if any) for distribution to shareholders as </span><span>dividends may be reduced. BFA may determine to maintain outstanding borrowings if it expects that the benefits to the </span><span>Fund’s shareholders will outweigh the current reduced return.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain types of borrowings by the Fund must be made from a bank or may result in the Fund being subject to covenants in </span><span>credit agreements relating to asset coverage, portfolio composition requirements and other matters. It is not anticipated that </span><span>observance of such covenants would impede BFA’s management of the Fund’s portfolio in accordance with the Fund’s </span><span>investment objectives and policies. However, a breach of any such covenants not cured within the specified cure period may </span><span>result in acceleration of outstanding indebtedness and require the Fund to dispose of portfolio investments at a time when it </span><span>may be disadvantageous to do so.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Diversification Status. </span><span> </span><span>The Fund is classified as a diversified fund under the 1940 Act. This means that the Fund may not </span><span>purchase securities of an issuer (other than (i) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or </span><span>instrumentalities and (ii) securities of other investment companies) if, with respect to 75% of its total assets, (a) more than </span><span>5% of the Fund’s total assets would be invested in securities of that issuer or (b) the Fund would hold more than 10% of the </span><span>outstanding voting securities of that issuer. With respect to the remaining 25% of its total assets, the Fund may invest more </span><span>than 5% of its assets in one issuer. Under the 1940 Act, the Fund cannot change its classification from diversified to non-diversified</span><span> without shareholder approval.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund intends to maintain the required level of diversification and otherwise conduct its operations so as to qualify as a </span><span>regulated investment company (</span><span>“</span><span>RIC</span><span>”</span><span>) for purposes of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>Internal </span><span>Revenue Code</span><span>”</span><span>), and to relieve the Fund of any liability for U.S. federal income tax to the extent that its earnings are </span><span>distributed to shareholders, provided that the Fund satisfies a minimum distribution requirement. Compliance with the </span><span>diversification requirements of the Internal Revenue Code may limit the investment flexibility of the Fund and may make it </span><span>less likely that the Fund will meet its investment objective.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Futures, Options on Futures and Securities Options.</span><span>  </span><span>Futures contracts, options on futures and securities options may be </span><span>used by the Fund to simulate investment in its Underlying Index, to facilitate trading or to reduce transaction costs. The Fund </span><span>may enter into futures contracts and options on futures that are traded on a U.S. or non-U.S. futures exchange. The Fund will </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>not use futures, options on futures or securities options for speculative purposes. The Fund intends to use futures and </span><span>options on futures in accordance with Rule 4.5 of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the </span><span>“</span><span>CFTC</span><span>”</span><span>) promulgated </span><span>under the Commodity Exchange Act (</span><span>“</span><span>CEA</span><span>”</span><span>). BFA, with respect to the Fund, has claimed an exclusion from the definition of </span><span>the term </span><span>“</span><span>commodity pool operator</span><span>”</span><span> in accordance with Rule 4.5 so that BFA, with respect to the Fund, is not subject to </span><span>registration or regulation as a commodity pool operator under the CEA. See the </span><span>Regulation Regarding Derivatives </span><span>section of </span><span>this SAI for more information.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Futures contracts provide for the future sale by one party and purchase by another party of a specified amount of a specific </span><span>instrument or index at a specified future time and at a specified price. Stock index contracts are based on investments that </span><span>reflect the market value of common stock of the firms included in the investments. The Fund may enter into futures </span><span>contracts to purchase securities indexes when BFA anticipates purchasing the underlying securities and believes prices will </span><span>rise before the purchase will be made. Upon entering into a futures contract, the Fund will be required to deposit with the </span><span>broker an amount of cash or cash equivalents known as </span><span>“</span><span>initial margin,</span><span>”</span><span> which is similar to a performance bond or good faith </span><span>deposit on the contract and is returned to the Fund upon termination of the futures contract if all contractual obligations </span><span>have been satisfied. Subsequent payments, known as </span><span>“</span><span>variation margin,</span><span>”</span><span> will be made to and from the broker daily as the </span><span>price of the instrument or index underlying the futures contract fluctuates, making the long and short positions in the futures </span><span>contract more or less valuable, a process known as </span><span>“</span><span>marking-to-market.</span><span>”</span><span> At any time prior to the expiration of a futures </span><span>contract, the Fund may elect to close the position by taking an opposite position, which will operate to terminate the Fund’s </span><span>existing position in the contract. An option on a futures contract, as contrasted with a direct investment in such a contract, </span><span>gives the purchaser the right, but no obligation, in return for the premium paid, to assume a position in the underlying </span><span>futures contract at a specified exercise price at any time prior to the expiration date of the option. Upon exercise of an option, </span><span>the delivery of the futures position by the writer of the option to the holder of the option will be accompanied by delivery of </span><span>the accumulated balance in the writer’s futures margin account that represents the amount by which the market price of the </span><span>futures contract exceeds (in the case of a call) or is less than (in the case of a put) the exercise price of the option on the </span><span>futures contract.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The potential for loss related to the purchase of an option on a futures contract is limited to the premium paid for the option </span><span>plus transaction costs. Because the value of the option is fixed at the point of sale, there are no daily cash payments by the </span><span>purchaser to reflect changes in the value of the underlying contract; however, the value of the option changes daily and that </span><span>change would be reflected in the NAV of the Fund. The potential for loss related to writing call options is unlimited. The </span><span>potential for loss related to writing put options is limited to the agreed-upon price per share, also known as the </span><span>“</span><span>strike price,</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>less the premium received from writing the put. The Fund may purchase and write put and call options on futures contracts </span><span>that are traded on an exchange as a hedge against changes in value of its portfolio securities or in anticipation of the </span><span>purchase of securities, and may enter into closing transactions with respect to such options to terminate existing positions. </span><span>There is no guarantee that such closing transactions can be effected.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Securities options may be used by the Fund to obtain access to securities in the Underlying Index or to dispose of securities </span><span>in the Underlying Index at favorable prices, to invest cash in a securities index that offers similar exposure to that provided by </span><span>the Underlying Index or otherwise to achieve the Fund’s objective of tracking the Underlying Index.</span><span> </span><span>A call option gives a </span><span>holder the right to purchase a specific security at a specified price (</span><span>“</span><span>exercise price</span><span>”</span><span>) within a specified period of time. A put </span><span>option gives a holder the right to sell a specific security at an exercise price within a specified period of time. The initial </span><span>purchaser of a call option pays the </span><span>“</span><span>writer</span><span>”</span><span> a premium, which is paid at the time of purchase and is retained by the writer </span><span>whether or not such option is exercised. The Fund may purchase put options to hedge its portfolio against the risk of a </span><span>decline in the market value of securities held and may purchase call options to hedge against an increase in the price of </span><span>securities it is committed to purchase. The Fund may write put and call options along with a long position in options to </span><span>increase its ability to hedge against a change in the market value of the securities it holds or is committed to purchase. The </span><span>Fund may purchase or sell securities options on a U.S. or non-U.S. securities exchange or in the OTC market through a </span><span>transaction with a dealer. Options on a securities index are typically settled on a net basis based on the appreciation or </span><span>depreciation of the index level over the strike price. Options on single name securities may be cash- or physically-settled, </span><span>depending upon the market in which they are traded. Options may be structured so as to be exercisable only on certain dates </span><span>or on a daily basis. Options may also be structured to have conditions to exercise (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, </span><span>“</span><span>Knock-in Events</span><span>”</span><span>) or conditions that </span><span>trigger termination (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, </span><span>“</span><span>Knock-out Events</span><span>”</span><span>).</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Lending Portfolio Securities.</span><span>  </span><span>The Fund may lend portfolio securities to certain borrowers that BFA determines to be </span><span>creditworthy, including borrowers affiliated with BFA. The borrowers provide collateral that is maintained in an amount at </span><span>least equal to the current market value of the securities loaned. No securities loan shall be made on behalf of the Fund if, as a </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The Fund may terminate a loan at any time and obtain the return of the </span><span>securities loaned. The Fund receives, by way of substitute payment, the value of any interest or cash or non-cash </span><span>distributions paid on the loaned securities that it would have otherwise received if the securities were not on loan.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>With respect to loans that are collateralized by cash, the borrower may be entitled to receive a fee based on the amount of </span><span>cash collateral. The Fund is compensated by any positive difference between the amount earned on the reinvestment of cash </span><span>collateral and the fee paid to the borrower. In the case of collateral other than cash, the Fund is compensated by a fee paid by </span><span>the borrower equal to a percentage of the market value of the loaned securities. Any cash collateral received by the Fund for </span><span>such loans, and uninvested cash, may be reinvested in certain short-term instruments either directly on behalf of the Fund or </span><span>through one or more joint accounts or money market funds, including those affiliated with BFA; such investments are subject </span><span>to investment risk.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund conducts its securities lending pursuant to an exemptive order from the SEC permitting it to lend portfolio </span><span>securities to borrowers affiliated with the Fund and to retain an affiliate of the Fund to act as securities lending agent. To the </span><span>extent that the Fund engages in securities lending, BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>BTC</span><span>”</span><span>) acts as securities </span><span>lending agent for the Fund, subject to the overall supervision of BFA. BTC administers the lending program in accordance </span><span>with guidelines approved by the Trust's Board of Trustees (the </span><span>“</span><span>Board,</span><span>”</span><span> the trustees of which are the </span><span>“</span><span>Trustees</span><span>”</span><span>).</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Securities lending involves exposure to certain risks, including operational risk (i.e., the risk of losses resulting from problems </span><span>in the settlement and accounting process), </span><span>“</span><span>gap</span><span>”</span><span> risk (i.e., the risk of a mismatch between the return on cash collateral </span><span>reinvestments and the fees the Fund has agreed to pay a borrower), foreign exchange risk (i.e., the risk of a shortfall at </span><span>default when a cash collateral investment is denominated in a currency other than the currency of the assets being loaned </span><span>due to movements in foreign exchange rates), and credit, legal, counterparty and market risks (including the risk that market </span><span>events, including but not limited to corporate actions, could lead the Fund to lend securities that are trading at a premium </span><span>due to increased demand, or to recall loaned securities or to lend less or not at all, which could lead to reduced securities </span><span>lending revenue). If the Fund were to lend out securities that are subject to a corporate action and commit to the borrower a </span><span>particular election as determined by the Fund's investment adviser, the benefit the Fund would receive in respect of </span><span>committing to such election may or may not be less than the benefit the Fund would have received from making a different </span><span>election in such corporate action. If a securities lending counterparty were to default, the Fund would be subject to the risk of </span><span>a possible delay in receiving collateral or in recovering the loaned securities, or to a possible loss of rights in the collateral. In </span><span>the event a borrower does not return the Fund’s securities as agreed, the Fund’s ability to participate in a corporate action </span><span>event may be impacted, or the Fund may experience losses if the proceeds received from liquidating the collateral do not at </span><span>least equal the value of the loaned security at the time the collateral is liquidated, plus the transaction costs incurred in </span><span>purchasing replacement securities. This latter event could trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund. The Fund could </span><span>lose money if its short-term investment of the collateral declines in value over the period of the loan. Substitute payments </span><span>received by the Fund representing dividends paid on securities loaned out by the Fund will not be considered qualified </span><span>dividend income. BTC will take into account the tax effects on shareholders caused by this difference in connection with the </span><span>Fund’s securities lending program. Substitute payments received on tax-exempt securities loaned out will not be tax-exempt </span><span>income. There could also be changes in the status of issuers under applicable laws and regulations, including tax regulations, </span><span>that may impact the regulatory or tax treatment of loaned securities and could, for example, result in a delay in the payment </span><span>of dividend equivalent payments owed to the Fund (as permitted by applicable law).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Regulations adopted by global prudential regulators require certain bank-regulated counterparties and certain of their </span><span>affiliates to include in certain financial contracts, including many securities lending agreements, terms that delay or restrict </span><span>the rights of counterparties, such as the Fund, to terminate such agreements, foreclose upon collateral, exercise other default </span><span>rights or restrict transfers of credit support in the event that the counterparty and/or its affiliates are subject to certain types </span><span>of resolution or insolvency proceedings. It is possible that these requirements, as well as potential additional government </span><span>regulation and other developments in the market, could adversely affect the Fund’s ability to terminate existing securities </span><span>lending agreements or to realize amounts to be received under such agreements.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Liquidity Risk Management.</span><span>  </span><span>Rule 22e-4 under the Investment Company Act (the </span><span>“</span><span>Liquidity Rule</span><span>”</span><span>) requires open-end funds, </span><span>including exchange-traded funds (</span><span>“</span><span>ETFs</span><span>”</span><span>) such as the Fund, to establish a liquidity risk management program (the </span><span>“</span><span>Liquidity </span><span>Program</span><span>”</span><span>) and enhance disclosures regarding fund liquidity. As required by the Liquidity Rule, the Fund has implemented a </span><span>Liquidity Program, and the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees of the Trust, has appointed BFA as the </span><span>administrator of the Liquidity Program.

The CFTC also subjects advisers to registered investment companies to regulation </span><span>by the CFTC if the registered investment company invests in one or more commodity pools. To the extent the Fund uses </span><span>CFTC Derivatives, it intends to do so below such prescribed levels and intends not to market itself as a </span><span>“</span><span>commodity pool</span><span>”</span><span> or a </span><span>vehicle for trading such instruments.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BFA has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term </span><span>“</span><span>commodity pool operator</span><span>”</span><span> under the CEA pursuant to Rule 4.5 </span><span>under the CEA with respect to the Fund.

Section 18 of the Investment Company Act, among other things, prohibits open-end funds, </span><span>including the Fund, from issuing or selling any </span><span>“</span><span>senior security,</span><span>”</span><span> other than borrowing from a bank (subject to a requirement </span><span>to maintain 300% </span><span>“</span><span>asset coverage</span><span>”</span><span>). </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Under Rule 18f-4, </span><span>“</span><span>Derivatives Transactions</span><span>”</span><span> include the following: (1) any swap, security-based swap (including a contract </span><span>for differences), futures contract, forward contract, option (excluding purchased options), any combination of the foregoing, </span><span>or any similar instrument, under which the Fund is or may be required to make any payment or delivery of cash or other </span><span>assets during the life of the instrument or at maturity or early termination, whether as margin or settlement payment or </span><span>otherwise; (2) any short sale borrowing; (3) reverse repurchase agreements and similar financing transactions (</span><span>e.g</span><span>., recourse </span><span>and non-recourse tender option bonds, and borrowed bonds), if the Fund elects to treat these transactions as Derivatives </span><span>Transactions under Rule 18f-4; and (4) when-issued or forward-settling securities (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, firm and standby commitments, </span><span>including to-be-announced (</span><span>“</span><span>TBA</span><span>”</span><span>) commitments, and dollar rolls) and non-standard settlement cycle securities, unless the </span><span>Fund intends to physically settle the transaction and the transaction will settle within 35 days of its trade date (the </span><span>“</span><span>Delayed-Settlement</span><span> Securities Provision</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Unless the Fund is relying on the Limited Derivatives User Exception (as defined below), the Fund must comply with Rule 18f-4</span><span> with respect to its Derivatives Transactions.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Repurchase Agreements.</span><span>  </span><span>A repurchase agreement is an instrument under which the purchaser (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the Fund) acquires a </span><span>security and the seller agrees, at the time of the sale, to repurchase the security at a mutually agreed-upon time and price, </span><span>thereby determining the yield during the purchaser’s holding period. Repurchase agreements may be construed to be </span><span>collateralized loans by the purchaser to the seller secured by the securities transferred to the purchaser. If a repurchase </span><span>agreement is construed to be a collateralized loan, the underlying securities will not be considered to be owned by the Fund </span><span>but only to constitute collateral for the seller’s obligation to pay the repurchase price, and, in the event of a default by the </span><span>seller, the Fund may suffer time delays and incur costs or losses in connection with the disposition of the collateral.</span></div> <div> <div><span>In any repurchase transaction, the collateral for a repurchase agreement may include: (i) cash items; (ii) obligations issued by </span><span>the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities; or (iii) obligations that, at the time the repurchase agreement is </span><span>entered into, are determined to (A) have exceptionally strong capacity to meet their financial obligations and (B) are </span><span>sufficiently liquid such that they can be sold at approximately their carrying value in the ordinary course of business within </span><span>seven days.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Repurchase agreements pose certain risks for the Fund, should it decide to utilize them. Such risks are not unique to the </span><span>Fund, but are inherent in repurchase agreements. The Fund seeks to minimize such risks, but because of the inherent legal </span><span>uncertainties involved in repurchase agreements, such risks cannot be eliminated. Lower quality collateral and collateral with </span><span>a longer maturity may be subject to greater price fluctuations than higher quality collateral and collateral with a shorter </span><span>maturity. If the repurchase agreement counterparty were to default, lower quality collateral may be more difficult to liquidate </span><span>than higher quality collateral. Should the counterparty default and the amount of collateral not be sufficient to cover the </span><span>counterparty’s repurchase obligation, the Fund would likely retain the status of an unsecured creditor of the counterparty </span><span>(</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the position the Fund would normally be in if it were to hold, pursuant to its investment policies, other unsecured debt </span><span>securities of the defaulting counterparty) with respect to the amount of the shortfall. As an unsecured creditor, the Fund </span><span>would be at risk of losing some or all of the principal and income involved in the transaction.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Reverse Repurchase Agreements.</span><span>  </span><span>Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities with an agreement to </span><span>repurchase the securities at an agreed-upon price, date and interest payment and have the characteristics of borrowing. </span><span>Generally, the effect of such transactions is that the Fund can recover all or most of the cash invested in the portfolio </span><span>securities involved during the term of the reverse repurchase agreement, while in many cases the Fund is able to keep some </span><span>of the interest income associated with those securities. Such transactions are advantageous only if the Fund has an </span><span>opportunity to earn a rate of interest on the cash derived from these transactions that is greater than the interest cost of </span><span>obtaining the same amount of cash. Opportunities to realize earnings from the use of the proceeds equal to or greater than </span><span>the interest required to be paid may not always be available, and the Fund intends to use the reverse repurchase technique </span><span>only when BFA believes it will be advantageous to the Fund. The use of reverse repurchase agreements may exaggerate any </span><span>increase or decrease in the value of the Fund’s assets. The use of reverse repurchase agreements is a form of leverage, and </span><span>the proceeds obtained by the Fund through reverse repurchase agreements may be invested in additional securities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Rule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act permits the Fund to enter into reverse repurchase agreements and similar </span><span>financing transactions (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> recourse and non-recourse tender option bonds, borrowed bonds) notwithstanding the </span><span>limitation on the issuance of senior securities in Section 18 of the Investment Company Act, provided that the Fund either (i) </span><span>complies with the 300% asset coverage ratio with respect to such transactions and any other borrowings in the aggregate, or </span><span>(ii) treats such transactions as Derivatives Transactions under Rule 18f-4. (See </span><span>“</span><span>Regulation Regarding Derivatives</span><span>”</span><span> above.)</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Securities of Investment Companies.</span><span>  </span><span>The Fund may invest in the securities of other investment companies (including </span><span>money market funds) to the extent permitted by law. Pursuant to the 1940 Act, the Fund’s investment in registered </span><span>investment companies is generally limited to, subject to certain exceptions: (i) 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of </span><span>any one investment company; (ii) 5% of the Fund’s total assets with respect to any one investment company; and (iii) 10% of </span><span>the Fund’s total assets with respect to investment companies in the aggregate. Other investment companies in which the </span><span>Fund may invest can be expected to incur fees and expenses for operations, such as investment advisory and administration </span><span>fees, which would be in addition to those incurred by the Fund. Pursuant to guidance issued by the SEC staff, fees and </span><span>expenses of money market funds used for cash collateral received in connection with loans of securities are not treated as </span><span>Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, which reflect the Fund’s </span><span>pro rata</span><span> share of the fees and expenses incurred by investing in </span><span>other investment companies (as disclosed in the Prospectus, as applicable).</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>6</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Short-Term Instruments and Temporary Investments.</span><span>  </span><span>The Fund invest in short-term instruments, including money market </span><span>instruments, on an ongoing basis to provide liquidity or for other reasons. Money market instruments are generally short-term</span><span> investments that may include, but are not limited to: (i) shares of money market funds (including those advised by BFA </span><span>or otherwise affiliated with BFA); (ii) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or </span><span>instrumentalities (including government-sponsored enterprises); (iii) negotiable certificates of deposit (</span><span>“</span><span>CDs</span><span>”</span><span>), bankers’ </span><span>acceptances, fixed-time deposits and other obligations of U.S. and non-U.S. banks (including non-U.S. branches) and similar </span><span>institutions; (iv) commercial paper rated, at the date of purchase, </span><span>“</span><span>Prime-1</span><span>”</span><span> by Moody's</span><span>®</span><span> Investors Service, Inc., </span><span>“</span><span>F-1</span><span>”</span><span> by </span><span>Fitch Ratings, Inc., or </span><span>“</span><span>A-1</span><span>”</span><span> by Standard &amp; Poor's</span><span>®</span><span> Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of S&amp;P Global, Inc., or if unrated, of </span><span>comparable quality as determined by BFA; (v) non-convertible corporate debt securities (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, bonds and debentures) with </span><span>remaining maturities at the date of purchase of not more than 397 days and that have been determined to present minimal </span><span>credit risks, in accordance with the requirements set forth in Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act; (vi) repurchase agreements; and </span><span>(vii) short-term U.S. dollar-denominated obligations of non-U.S. banks (including U.S. branches) that, in the opinion of BFA, </span><span>are of comparable quality to obligations of U.S. banks that may be purchased by the Fund. Any of these instruments may be </span><span>purchased on a current or forward-settled basis. Time deposits are non-negotiable deposits maintained in banking </span><span>institutions for specified periods of time at stated interest rates. Bankers’ acceptances are time drafts drawn on commercial </span><span>banks by borrowers, usually in connection with international transactions.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Swap Agreements.</span><span>  </span><span>Swap agreements are contracts between parties in which one party agrees to make periodic payments to </span><span>the other party based on a pre-determined underlying investment or notional amount. In return, the other party agrees to </span><span>make periodic payments to the first party based on the return (or a differential in rate of return) earned or realized on the </span><span>underlying investment or notional amount. Swap agreements will usually be performed on a net basis, with the Fund </span><span>receiving or paying only the net amount of the two payments. The net amount of the excess, if any, of the Fund’s obligations </span><span>over its entitlements with respect to each swap is accrued on a daily basis.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The use of swaps is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated </span><span>with ordinary portfolio security transactions. These transactions generally do not involve the delivery of securities or other </span><span>underlying assets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Tracking Stocks.</span><span>  </span><span>A tracking stock is a separate class of common stock whose value is linked to a specific business unit or </span><span>operating division within a larger company and is designed to </span><span>“</span><span>track</span><span>”</span><span> the performance of such business unit or division. The </span><span>tracking stock may pay dividends to shareholders independent of the parent company. The parent company, rather than the </span><span>business unit or division, generally is the issuer of tracking stock. However, holders of the tracking stock may not have the </span><span>same rights as holders of the company’s common stock.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Future Developments.</span><span>  </span><span>The Board may, in the future, authorize the Fund to invest in securities contracts and investments, </span><span>other than those listed in this SAI and in the Prospectus, provided they are consistent with the Fund's investment objective </span><span>and do not violate any of its investment restrictions or policies.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>General Considerations and Risks</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A discussion of some of the principal risks associated with an investment in the Fund is contained in the Prospectus.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>An investment in the Fund should be made with an understanding that the value of the Fund’s portfolio</span><span> </span><span>securities may </span><span>fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the issuers of the portfolio securities, the value of preferred </span><span>or common stocks in general, and other factors that affect the market. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate </span><span>the significance of any particular risk factor.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Borrowing Risk. </span><span> </span><span>Borrowing may exaggerate changes in the NAV of Fund shares and in the return on the Fund’s portfolio. </span><span>Borrowing will cause the Fund to incur interest expense and other fees. The costs of borrowing may reduce the Fund’s </span><span>return. Borrowing may cause the Fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its </span><span>obligations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Illiquid Investments Risk.</span><span>  </span><span>The Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, immediately after the acquisition, the Fund </span><span>would have invested more than 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the </span><span>Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less without </span><span>significantly changing the market value of the investment. The liquidity of an investment will be determined based on </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>7</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>relevant market, trading and investment specific considerations as set out in the Liquidity Program as required by the </span><span>Liquidity Rule. Illiquid investments may trade at a discount to comparable, more liquid investments and the Fund may not be </span><span>able to dispose of illiquid investments in a timely fashion or at their expected prices. If illiquid investments exceed 15% of the </span><span>Fund’s net assets, the Liquidity Rule and the Liquidity Program will require that certain remedial actions be taken.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Reference Rate Replacement Risk. </span><span> </span><span>The Fund may be exposed to financial instruments that recently transitioned from, or </span><span>continue to be tied to, the London Interbank Offered Rate (</span><span>“</span><span>LIBOR</span><span>”</span><span>) to determine payment obligations, financing terms, </span><span>hedging strategies or investment value. The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (</span><span>“</span><span>FCA</span><span>”</span><span>), which regulates LIBOR, </span><span>has ceased publishing all LIBOR settings. In April 2023, however, the FCA announced that some USD LIBOR settings will </span><span>continue to be published under a synthetic methodology until September 30, 2024 for certain legacy contracts. The Secured </span><span>Overnight Financing Rate (</span><span>“</span><span>SOFR</span><span>”</span><span>), which is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. </span><span>Treasury securities in the repurchase agreement market, has been used increasingly on a voluntary basis in new instruments </span><span>and transactions. Under U.S. regulations that implement a statutory fallback mechanism to replace LIBOR, benchmark rates </span><span>based on SOFR have replaced LIBOR in different categories of financial contracts.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Neither the effect of the LIBOR transition process nor its ultimate success can yet be known. While some existing LIBOR-based</span><span> instruments may contemplate a scenario where LIBOR is no longer available by providing for an alternative rate-setting </span><span>methodology, there may be significant uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of any such alternative methodologies to </span><span>replicate LIBOR. Not all existing LIBOR-based instruments may have alternative rate-setting provisions and there remains </span><span>uncertainty regarding the willingness and ability of issuers to add alternative rate-setting provisions in certain existing </span><span>instruments. Parties to contracts, securities, or other instruments using LIBOR may disagree on transition rates or the </span><span>application of transition regulation, potentially resulting in uncertainty of performance and the possibility of litigation. The </span><span>Fund may have instruments linked to other interbank offered rates that may also cease to be published in the future.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Money Market Instruments Risk. </span><span> </span><span>The Fund may hold money market instruments. The value of money market instruments </span><span>may be affected by changes in interest rates or in the credit ratings of the investments, among other things. If a significant </span><span>amount of the Fund's assets is invested in money market instruments, it may be more difficult for the Fund to achieve its </span><span>investment objective. An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance </span><span>Corporation or any other government agency. It is possible to lose money by investing in a money market fund. Money </span><span>market funds other than U.S. government money market funds and retail money market funds </span><span>“</span><span>float</span><span>”</span><span> their NAV instead of </span><span>using a stable $1.00 per share price.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Operational Risk.</span><span>  </span><span>BFA and the Fund's other service providers may experience disruptions or operating errors such as </span><span>processing errors or human errors, inadequate or failed internal or external processes, or systems or technology failures, that </span><span>could negatively impact the Fund. While service providers are required to have appropriate operational risk management </span><span>policies and procedures, their methods of operational risk management may differ from the Fund’s in the setting of priorities, </span><span>the personnel and resources available or the effectiveness of relevant controls. BFA, through its monitoring and oversight of </span><span>service providers, seeks to ensure that service providers take appropriate precautions to avoid and mitigate risks that could </span><span>lead to disruptions and operating errors. However, it is not possible for BFA or the other Fund service providers to identify all </span><span>of the operational risks that may affect the Fund or to develop processes and controls to completely eliminate or mitigate </span><span>their occurrence or effects.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Derivatives.</span><span>  </span><span>A derivative is a financial contract, the value of which depends on, or is derived from, the value of an </span><span>underlying asset, such as a security, a commodity (such as gold or silver), a currency or an index (a measure of value or rates, </span><span>such as the S&amp;P 500</span><span>®</span><span> or the prime lending rate). The Fund may invest in futures contracts, securities options and other </span><span>derivatives. Compared to securities, derivatives can be more sensitive to changes in interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in </span><span>market prices and thus the Fund’s losses may be greater if it invests in derivatives than if it invests only in conventional </span><span>securities. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not </span><span>fulfill its contractual obligations. Derivatives generally involve the incurrence of leverage.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When a derivative is used as a hedge against a position that the Fund holds or is committed to purchase, any loss generated </span><span>by the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging </span><span>can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains and, in some cases, hedging can cause losses that are </span><span>not offset by gains, and the Fund will recognize losses on both the investment and the hedge. Hedges are sometimes subject </span><span>to imperfect matching between the derivative and the underlying security, and there can be no assurance that the Fund's </span><span>hedging transactions, which entail additional transaction costs, will be effective.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Equity Securities.</span><span>  </span><span>An investment in the Fund should be made with an understanding of the risks inherent in an </span><span>investment in equity securities, including the risk that the financial condition of issuers may become impaired or that the </span><span>general condition of stock markets may deteriorate (either of which may cause a decrease in the value of the portfolio </span><span>securities and thus in the value of shares of the Fund). Common stocks are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations </span><span>and to increases and decreases in value as market confidence and perceptions of their issuers change. These investor </span><span>perceptions are based on various and unpredictable factors, including expectations regarding government, economic, </span><span>monetary and fiscal policies, inflation and interest rates, economic expansion or contraction, and global or regional political, </span><span>economic or banking crises. Common stocks may experience extreme price volatility due to actions taken by particular </span><span>investors or groups of investors (for example, retail investors influenced by social media activity or other media coverage or </span><span>significant </span><span>“</span><span>short</span><span>”</span><span> positions taken by institutional investors).</span></div> <div> <div><span>Holders of common stocks incur more risks than holders of preferred stocks and debt obligations because common </span><span>stockholders generally have rights to receive payments from stock issuers that are inferior to the rights of creditors, or </span><span>holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks. Further, unlike debt securities, which typically have a stated principal amount </span><span>payable at maturity (the value of which, however, is subject to market fluctuations prior to maturity), or preferred stocks, </span><span>which typically have a liquidation preference and which may have stated optional or mandatory redemption provisions, </span><span>common stocks have neither a fixed principal amount nor a maturity date. In addition, issuers may, in times of distress or at </span><span>their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock price to decline.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Although most of the securities in the Underlying Index are listed on a securities exchange, the principal trading market for </span><span>some of the securities may be in the OTC market. The existence of a liquid trading market for certain securities may depend </span><span>on whether dealers will make a market in such securities. There can be no assurance that a market will be made or </span><span>maintained or that any such market will be or remain liquid. The price at which securities may be sold and the value of the </span><span>Fund’s shares will be adversely affected if trading markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities are limited or absent, or if </span><span>bid/ask spreads are wide.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Futures and Options on Futures Transactions.</span><span>  </span><span>There are several risks accompanying the utilization of futures </span><span>contracts and options on futures contracts. A position in futures contracts and options on futures contracts may be closed </span><span>only on the exchange on which the contract was made (or a linked exchange). While the Fund plans to utilize futures </span><span>contracts only if an active market exists for such contracts, there is no guarantee that a liquid market will exist for the </span><span>contract at a specified time. Futures contracts, by definition, project price levels in the future and not current levels of </span><span>valuation; therefore, market circumstances may result in a discrepancy between the price of the future and the movement in </span><span>the Fund's Underlying Index. In the event of adverse price movements, the Fund would continue to be required to make daily </span><span>cash payments to maintain its required margin. In such situations, if the Fund has insufficient cash, it may have to sell </span><span>portfolio securities to meet daily margin requirements at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. In addition, the </span><span>Fund may be required to deliver the instruments underlying the futures contracts it has sold.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The risk of loss in trading futures contracts or uncovered call options in some strategies (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, selling uncovered stock index </span><span>futures contracts) is potentially unlimited. The Fund does not plan to use futures and options contracts in this way. The risk </span><span>of a futures position may still be large as traditionally measured due to the low margin deposits required. In many cases, a </span><span>relatively small price movement in a futures contract may result in immediate and substantial loss or gain to the investor </span><span>relative to the size of a required margin deposit. The Fund, however, intends to utilize futures and options contracts in a </span><span>manner designed to limit the risk exposure to levels comparable to a direct investment in the types of stocks in which it </span><span>invests.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Utilization of futures and options on futures by the Fund involves the risk of imperfect or even negative correlation to the </span><span>Underlying Index if the index underlying the futures contract differs from the Underlying Index. There is also the risk of loss of </span><span>margin deposits in the event of bankruptcy of a broker with whom the Fund has an open position in the futures contract or </span><span>option. The purchase of put or call options will be based upon predictions by BFA as to anticipated trends, which predictions </span><span>could prove to be incorrect.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Because the futures market generally imposes less burdensome margin requirements than the securities market, an </span><span>increased amount of participation by speculators in the futures market could result in price fluctuations. Certain financial </span><span>futures exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures contract prices during a single trading day. The daily </span><span>limit establishes the maximum amount by which the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the </span><span>previous day’s settlement price at the end of a trading session. Once the daily limit has been reached in a particular type of </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>9</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>contract, no trades may be made on that day at a price beyond that limit. It is possible that futures contract prices could </span><span>move to the daily limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading, thereby preventing prompt liquidation of </span><span>futures positions and subjecting the Fund to substantial losses. In the event of adverse price movements, the Fund would be </span><span>required to make daily cash payments of variation margin.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Swap Agreements.</span><span>  </span><span>The risk of loss with respect to swaps is generally limited to the net amount of payments that the </span><span>Fund is contractually obligated to make. Swap agreements are subject to the risk that the swap counterparty will default on </span><span>its obligations</span><span> </span><span>to pay a Fund and the risk that the Fund will not be able to meet its obligations to pay the other party to the </span><span>agreement. If such a default occurs, the Fund will have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the </span><span>transaction. However, such remedies may be subject to bankruptcy and insolvency laws, which could affect the Fund’s rights </span><span>as a creditor (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, the Fund may not receive the net amount of payments that it is contractually entitled to receive). Swap </span><span>agreements may also involve the risk that there is an imperfect correlation between the return on the Fund’s obligation to its </span><span>counterparty and the return on the referenced asset. In addition, swap agreements are subject to market and liquidity risk, </span><span>leverage risk and hedging risk.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund is required to post and collect variation margin and initial margin (comprised of specified liquid securities subject </span><span>to haircuts) in connection with trading of OTC swaps. These requirements may raise the costs for the Fund’s investment in </span><span>swaps.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Tracking Error Risk.</span><span>  </span><span>The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that </span><span>of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities and other instruments held </span><span>in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences, transaction costs incurred by the Fund, </span><span>the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest received </span><span>by the Fund or distributions paid to the Fund’s shareholders, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, </span><span>portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, </span><span>changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. </span><span>This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error </span><span>also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not. Tracking error may occur </span><span>due to differences between the methodologies used in calculating the value of the Underlying Index and determining the </span><span>Fund’s NAV.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When an issuer is introduced by an index provider into an index tracked by a Fund, BFA may conduct an analysis on such </span><span>issuer’s securities to identify and screen for outlier high risk behavior (such as rapid or unusual price growth that does not </span><span>appear to be supported by publicly available information on the business and assets of the issuer, unusual or significant short </span><span>interest or lending activity, negative sentiment, suspended trading or incorrect free-float calculations, which could be </span><span>indicators of possible irregularities, miscalculations or even fraud). If it identifies such behavior, BFA may, where appropriate, </span><span>alert the index provider as to the alleged issue. The index provider has sole discretion for the determination as to whether to </span><span>continue to include the issuer’s securities in the rebalancing of its index. If the securities continue to be included in the index, </span><span>BFA may underweight or exclude such securities from a Fund’s portfolio and, if it does so, such Fund will be subject to </span><span>increased tracking error due to the divergence in the securities included in its portfolio from its underlying index. BFA’s </span><span>underweighting or excluding such securities may result in a decline in the Fund’s net asset value. The application of the </span><span>abovementioned analysis and screening to a Fund and its Underlying Index is in the sole discretion of BFA and its affiliates </span><span>(without any guarantees). The analysis and screening may not exclude any or all high risk securities from an Underlying </span><span>Index or a Fund’s portfolio, and the inclusion of such securities will result in an adverse impact to the Fund’s net asset value if </span><span>one or more such securities declines in value.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Discretionary Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies engaged in the design, production or distribution of </span><span>products or services for the consumer discretionary sector (including, without limitation, television and radio broadcasting, </span><span>manufacturing, publishing, recording and musical instruments, motion pictures, photography, amusement and theme parks, </span><span>gaming casinos, sporting goods and sports arenas, camping and recreational equipment, toys and games, apparel, travel-related</span><span> services, automobiles, hotels and motels, and fast food and other restaurants) are subject to the risk that their </span><span>products or services may become obsolete quickly. The success of these companies can depend heavily on disposable </span><span>household income and consumer spending. During periods of an expanding economy, the consumer discretionary sector </span><span>may outperform the consumer staples sector, but may underperform when economic conditions worsen. Moreover, the </span><span>consumer discretionary sector can be significantly affected by several factors, including, without limitation, the performance </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>of domestic and international economies, exchange rates, changing consumer preferences, demographics, marketing </span><span>campaigns, cyclical revenue generation, consumer confidence, commodity price volatility, labor relations, interest rates, </span><span>import and export controls, intense competition, technological developments and government regulation.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Staples Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the consumer staples sector may be adversely affected by </span><span>changes in the global economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, and production </span><span>spending. Companies in the consumer staples sector may also be affected by changes in global economic, environmental </span><span>and political events, economic conditions, the depletion of resources, and government regulation. For instance, government </span><span>regulations may affect the permissibility of using various food additives and production methods of companies that make </span><span>food products, which could affect company profitability. In addition, tobacco companies may be adversely affected by the </span><span>adoption of proposed legislation and/or by litigation. Companies in the consumer staples sector also may be subject to risks </span><span>pertaining to the supply of, demand for and prices of raw materials. The prices of raw materials fluctuate in response to a </span><span>number of factors, including, without limitation, changes in government agricultural support programs, exchange rates, </span><span>import and export controls, changes in international agricultural and trading policies, and seasonal and weather conditions. </span><span>Companies in the consumer staples sector may be subject to severe competition, which may also have an adverse impact on </span><span>their profitability.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Energy Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the energy sector are strongly affected by the changes in and volatility </span><span>of global energy prices, energy supply and demand, government regulations and policies, energy production and </span><span>conservation efforts, technological change, development of alternative energy sources, and other factors that they cannot </span><span>control. Energy companies may have relatively high levels of debt and may be more likely to restructure their businesses if </span><span>there are downturns in energy markets or in the global economy. If an energy company in the Fund's portfolio becomes </span><span>distressed, the Fund could lose all or a substantial portion of its investment. The energy sector is cyclical and is highly </span><span>dependent on commodity prices. Prices and supplies of energy may fluctuate significantly over short and long periods of </span><span>time due to, among other things, national and international political changes, Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>OPEC</span><span>”</span><span>) policies, changes in relationships among OPEC members and between OPEC and oil-importing nations, the </span><span>regulatory environment, taxation policies, the enactment or cessation of trade sanctions, war or other geopolitical conflicts, </span><span>and the economies of key energy-consuming countries. Companies in the energy sector may be adversely affected by </span><span>terrorism, cyber incidents, natural disasters or other catastrophes. Companies in the energy sector are at risk of liability from </span><span>accidents resulting in injury, loss of life or property, pollution or other environmental damage claims. Significant oil and gas </span><span>deposits are located in emerging markets countries where corruption and security may raise significant risks, in addition to </span><span>the other risks of investing in emerging markets. Additionally, the Middle East, where many companies in the energy sector </span><span>may operate, has experienced conflict and unrest. Companies in the energy sector may also be adversely affected by changes </span><span>in exchange rates, interest rates, economic conditions, tax treatment, government regulation and intervention, negative </span><span>perception, efforts at energy conservation and world events in the regions in which the companies operate (</span><span>e.g</span><span>., </span><span>expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments </span><span>and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest, violence or labor unrest). Because a significant portion of revenues of </span><span>companies in this sector is derived from a relatively small number of customers that are largely composed of governmental </span><span>entities and utilities, governmental budget constraints may have a significant impact on companies in this sector. The energy </span><span>sector is highly regulated. Entities operating in the energy sector are subject to significant regulation of nearly every aspect of </span><span>their operations by governmental agencies. Such regulation can change rapidly or over time in both scope and intensity. </span><span>Stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be enacted, which would likely increase compliance costs and may </span><span>materially adversely affect the financial performance of companies in the energy sector.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The energy sector may experience significant market volatility. For example, Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine on </span><span>February 24, 2022 led to further disruptions and increased volatility in the energy and commodity futures markets due to </span><span>actual and potential disruptions in the supply and demand for certain commodities, including oil and natural gas. The U.S. </span><span>and other actors have enacted various sanctions and restrictions on business dealings with Russia, which include restrictions </span><span>on imports of oil, natural gas and coal. The effect of the current sanctions and restrictions, as well as the extent and duration </span><span>of the Russian military action, additional sanctions and associated market disruptions on the energy sector, are impossible to </span><span>predict and depend on a number of factors. The effect of these events or any related developments could be significant and </span><span>may have a severe adverse effect on the performance of the Fund.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Financials Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the financials sector include small, regional and money center </span><span>banks, securities brokerage firms, asset management companies, savings banks and thrift institutions, specialty finance </span><span>companies (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, credit card, mortgage providers), insurance and insurance brokerage firms, consumer finance firms, </span><span>financial conglomerates and foreign banking and financial companies.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Most financial companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which limits their activities and may affect their </span><span>ability to earn a profit from a given line of business. Government regulation may change frequently and may have significant </span><span>adverse consequences for companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by the regulation. Direct </span><span>governmental intervention in the operations of financial companies and financial markets may materially and adversely affect </span><span>the companies in which the Fund invests, including legislation in many countries that may increase government regulation, </span><span>repatriation and other intervention. The impact of governmental intervention and legislative changes on any individual </span><span>financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. The valuation of financial companies has been </span><span>and continues to be subject to unprecedented volatility and may be influenced by unpredictable factors, including interest </span><span>rate risk and sovereign debt default. Certain financial businesses are subject to intense competitive pressures, including </span><span>market share and price competition. Financial companies in foreign countries are subject to market-specific and general </span><span>regulatory and interest rate concerns. In particular, government regulation in certain foreign countries may include taxes and </span><span>controls on interest rates, credit availability, minimum capital requirements, bans on short sales, limits on prices and </span><span>restrictions on currency transfers. In addition, companies in the financials sector may be the targets of hacking and potential </span><span>theft of proprietary or customer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their </span><span>businesses.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The profitability of banks, savings and loan associations and other financial companies is largely dependent on the availability </span><span>and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change; for instance, when interest rates go up, </span><span>the value of securities issued by many types of companies in the financials sector generally goes down. In other words, </span><span>financial companies may be adversely affected in certain market cycles, including, without limitation, during periods of rising </span><span>interest rates, which may restrict the availability and increase the cost of capital, and during periods of declining economic </span><span>conditions, which may cause, among other things, credit losses due to financial difficulties of borrowers.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, general economic conditions are important to the operations of these companies, and financial difficulties of </span><span>borrowers may have an adverse effect on the profitability of financial companies. Companies in the financials sector are </span><span>exposed directly to the credit risk of their borrowers and counterparties, who may be leveraged to an unknown degree, </span><span>including through swaps and other derivatives products, and who at times may be unable to meet their obligations to the </span><span>financial services companies. Financial services companies may have significant exposure to the same borrowers and </span><span>counterparties, with the result that a borrower’s or counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations to one company may affect </span><span>other companies with exposure to the same borrower or counterparty. This interconnectedness of risk, including cross-default</span><span> risk, may result in significant negative impacts to the financial condition and reputation of companies with direct </span><span>exposure to the defaulting counterparty as well as adverse cascading effects in the markets and the financials sector </span><span>generally. Financial companies can be highly dependent upon access to capital markets, and any impediments to such </span><span>access, such as adverse overall economic conditions or a negative perception in the capital markets of a financial company’s </span><span>financial condition or prospects, could adversely affect its business. Deterioration of credit markets can have an adverse </span><span>impact on a broad range of financial markets, causing certain financial companies to incur large losses. In these conditions, </span><span>companies in the financials sector may experience significant declines in the valuation of their assets, take actions to raise </span><span>capital and even cease operations. Some financial companies may also be required to accept or borrow significant amounts </span><span>of capital from government sources and may face future government-imposed restrictions on their businesses or increased </span><span>government intervention. In addition, there is no guarantee that governments will provide any such relief in the future. These </span><span>actions may cause the securities of many companies in the financials sector to decline in value.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Healthcare Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the healthcare sector are often issuers whose profitability may be </span><span>affected by extensive government regulation, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising or </span><span>falling costs of medical products and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, a limited </span><span>number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market developments. Many healthcare </span><span>companies are heavily dependent on patent protection and the actual or perceived safety and efficiency of their products.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Patents have a limited duration, and, upon expiration, other companies may market substantially similar </span><span>“</span><span>generic</span><span>”</span><span> products </span><span>that are typically sold at a lower price than the patented product, which can cause the original developer of the product to </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>12</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>lose market share and/or reduce the price charged for the product, resulting in lower profits for the original developer. As a </span><span>result, the expiration of patents may adversely affect the profitability of these companies.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>In addition, because the products and services of many companies in the healthcare sector affect the health and well-being </span><span>of many individuals, these companies are especially susceptible to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar </span><span>claims. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may </span><span>result in price discounting. Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The process </span><span>of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, which can result in increased development costs, delayed cost recovery </span><span>and loss of competitive advantage to the extent that rival companies have developed competing products or procedures, </span><span>adversely affecting the company’s revenues and profitability. In other words, delays in the regulatory approval process may </span><span>diminish the opportunity for a company to profit from a new product or to bring a new product to market, which could have </span><span>a material adverse effect on a company’s business. Healthcare companies may also be strongly affected by scientific </span><span>biotechnology or technological developments, and their products may quickly become obsolete. Also, many healthcare </span><span>companies offer products and services that are subject to governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by changes </span><span>in governmental policies or laws. Changes in governmental policies or laws may span a wide range of topics, including cost </span><span>control, national health insurance, incentives for compensation in the provision of healthcare services, tax incentives and </span><span>penalties related to healthcare insurance premiums, and promotion of prepaid healthcare plans. In addition, a number of </span><span>legislative proposals concerning healthcare have been considered by the U.S. Congress in recent years. It is unclear what </span><span>proposals will ultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect they may have on companies in the healthcare sector.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Additionally, the expansion of facilities by healthcare-related providers may be subject to </span><span>“</span><span>determinations of need</span><span>”</span><span> by certain </span><span>government authorities. This process not only generally increases the time and costs involved in these expansions, but also </span><span>makes expansion plans uncertain, limiting the revenue and profitability growth potential of healthcare-related facilities </span><span>operators and negatively affecting the prices of their securities. Moreover, in recent years, both local and national </span><span>governmental budgets have come under pressure to reduce spending and control healthcare costs, which could both </span><span>adversely affect regulatory processes and public funding available for healthcare products, services and facilities.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Industrials Sector. </span><span> </span><span>The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be </span><span>adversely affected by supply of and demand for both their specific products or services and for industrials sector products in </span><span>general. The products of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and </span><span>frequent new product introduction. Government regulations, trade disputes, world events and economic conditions may </span><span>affect the performance of companies in the industrials sector. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by </span><span>changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. For example, commodity price </span><span>declines and unit volume reductions resulting from an over-supply of materials used in the industrials sector can adversely </span><span>affect the sector. Furthermore, companies in the industrials sector may be subject to liability for environmental damage, </span><span>product liability claims, depletion of resources, and mandated expenditures for safety and pollution control.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Information Technology Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Information technology companies face intense competition, both </span><span>domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Like other technology companies, </span><span>information technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products </span><span>of information technology companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent </span><span>new product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. </span><span>Technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technology, especially those of smaller, less-seasoned companies, </span><span>tend to be more volatile than the overall market. Companies in the information technology sector are heavily dependent on </span><span>patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these </span><span>companies. Information technology companies are facing increased government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject </span><span>to adverse government or regulatory action. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, </span><span>certain companies in the information technology sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of </span><span>proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses. </span><span>These risks are heightened for information technology companies in foreign markets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Materials Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the materials sector may be adversely affected by commodity price </span><span>volatility, exchange rate fluctuations, social and political unrest, war, import or export controls, increased competition, </span><span>depletion of resources, technical progress, labor relations and government regulations, and mandated expenditures for safety </span><span>and pollution control, among other factors. Such risks may adversely affect the issuers to which the Fund has exposure. </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>13</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Companies in the materials sector are also at risk of liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. </span><span>Production of materials may exceed demand as a result of market imbalances or economic downturns, leading to poor </span><span>investment returns. These risks are heightened for companies in the materials sector located in foreign markets.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Real Estate Industry. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the real estate industry include companies that invest in real </span><span>estate, such as real estate investment trusts (</span><span>“</span><span>REITs</span><span>”</span><span>), real estate holding and operating companies or real estate </span><span>development companies (collectively, </span><span>“</span><span>Real Estate Companies</span><span>”</span><span>). Investing in Real Estate Companies exposes investors to the </span><span>risks of owning real estate directly, as well as to risks that relate specifically to the way in which Real Estate Companies are </span><span>organized and operated. The real estate industry is highly sensitive to general and local economic conditions and </span><span>developments, and characterized by intense competition and periodic overbuilding. Investing in Real Estate Companies </span><span>involves various risks. Some risks that are specific to Real Estate Companies are discussed in greater detail below.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Concentration Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may own a limited number of properties and concentrate their investments in a </span><span>particular geographic region or property type. Economic downturns affecting a particular region, industry or property type </span><span>may lead to a high volume of defaults within a short period.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Distressed Investment Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may invest in distressed, defaulted or out-of-favor bank loans. </span><span>Identification and implementation by a Real Estate Company of loan modification and restructure programs involves a high </span><span>degree of uncertainty. Even successful implementation may still require adverse compromises and may not prevent </span><span>bankruptcy. Real Estate Companies may also invest in other debt instruments that may become non-performing, including </span><span>the securities of companies with higher credit and market risk due to financial or operational difficulties. Higher risk securities </span><span>may be less liquid and more volatile than the securities of companies not in distress.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Illiquidity Risk.</span><span> Investing in Real Estate Companies may involve risks similar to those associated with investing in small-capitalization</span><span> companies. Real Estate Company securities, like the securities of small-capitalization companies, may be more </span><span>volatile than, and perform differently from, shares of large-capitalization companies. There may be less trading in Real Estate </span><span>Company shares, which means that buy and sell transactions in those shares could have a magnified impact on share price, </span><span>resulting in abrupt or erratic price fluctuations. In addition, real estate is relatively illiquid, and, therefore, a Real Estate </span><span>Company may have a limited ability to vary or liquidate properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Interest Rate Risk.</span><span> Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could </span><span>negatively impact a Real Estate Company’s ability to meet its payment obligations. Declining interest rates could result in </span><span>increased prepayment on loans and require redeployment of capital in less desirable investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Leverage Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may use leverage (and some may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk </span><span>and could adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s operations and market value in periods of rising interest rates. Real Estate </span><span>Companies are also exposed to the risks normally associated with debt financing. Financial covenants related to a Real Estate </span><span>Company’s leverage may affect the ability of the Real Estate Company to operate effectively. In addition, real property may be </span><span>subject to the quality of credit extended and defaults by borrowers and tenants. If the properties do not generate sufficient </span><span>income to meet operating expenses, including, where applicable, debt service, ground lease payments, tenant improvements, </span><span>third-party leasing commissions and other capital expenditures, the income and ability of a Real Estate Company to make </span><span>payments of any interest and principal on its debt securities will be adversely affected.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Loan Foreclosure Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may foreclose on loans that the Real Estate Company originated and/or </span><span>acquired. Foreclosure may generate negative publicity for the underlying property that affects its market value. In addition to </span><span>the length and expense of such proceedings, the validity of the terms of the applicable loan may not be recognized in </span><span>foreclosure proceedings. Claims and defenses asserted by borrowers or other lenders may interfere with the enforcement of </span><span>rights by a Real Estate Company. Parallel proceedings, such as bankruptcy, may also delay resolution and limit the amount of </span><span>recovery on a foreclosed loan by a Real Estate Company even where the property underlying the loan is liquidated.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Management Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies are dependent upon management skills and may have limited financial resources. </span><span>Real Estate Companies are generally not diversified and may be subject to heavy cash flow dependency, default by borrowers </span><span>and voluntary liquidation. In addition, transactions between Real Estate Companies and their affiliates may be subject to </span><span>conflicts of interest, which may adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s shareholders. A Real Estate Company may also have </span><span>joint venture investments in certain of its properties, and, consequently, its ability to control decisions relating to such </span><span>properties may be limited.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Property Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may be subject to risks relating to functional obsolescence or reduced desirability of </span><span>properties; extended vacancies due to economic conditions and tenant bankruptcies; catastrophic events such as </span><span>earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts; and casualty or condemnation losses. Real estate income and values also may be </span><span>greatly affected by demographic trends, such as population shifts or changes in consumer preferences and values, or </span><span>increasing vacancies or declining rents resulting from legal, cultural, technological, global or local economic developments.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Regulatory Risk.</span><span> Real estate income and values may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable domestic and foreign </span><span>laws (including tax laws). Government actions, such as tax increases, zoning law changes, mandated closures or other </span><span>commercial restrictions or environmental regulations, also may have a major impact on real estate income and values. In </span><span>addition, quarterly compliance with regulations limiting the proportion of asset types held by a U.S. REIT may force certain </span><span>Real Estate Companies to liquidate or restructure otherwise attractive investments. Some countries may not recognize REITs </span><span>or comparable structures as a viable form of real estate funds.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Underlying Investment Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies make investments in a variety of debt and equity instruments with </span><span>varying risk profiles. For instance, Real Estate Companies may invest in debt instruments secured by commercial property </span><span>that have higher risks of delinquency and foreclosure than loans on single family homes due to a variety of factors associated </span><span>with commercial property, including the tie between income available to service debt and productive use of the property. Real </span><span>Estate Companies may also invest in debt instruments and preferred equity that are junior in an issuer’s capital structure and </span><span>that involve privately negotiated structures. Subordinated debt investments, such as B-Notes and mezzanine loans, involve a </span><span>greater credit risk of default due to the need to service more senior debt of the issuer. Similarly, preferred equity investments </span><span>involve a greater risk of loss than conventional debt financing due to their non-collateralized nature and subordinated </span><span>ranking. Investments in commercial mortgage-backed securities may also be junior in priority in the event of bankruptcy or </span><span>similar proceedings. Investments in senior loans may be effectively subordinated if the senior loan is pledged as collateral. </span><span>The ability of a holder of junior claims to proceed against a defaulting issuer is circumscribed by the terms of the particular </span><span>contractual arrangement, which vary considerably from transaction to transaction.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>U.S. Tax Risk.</span><span> Certain U.S. Real Estate Companies are subject to special U.S. federal tax requirements. A REIT that fails to </span><span>comply with such tax requirements may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation, which may affect the value of the REIT </span><span>and the characterization of the REIT’s distributions. The U.S. federal tax requirement that a REIT distribute substantially all of </span><span>its net income to its shareholders may result in a REIT having insufficient capital for future expenditures. A REIT that </span><span>successfully maintains its qualification may still become subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes, including excise, </span><span>penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage recording, and transfer taxes, both directly and indirectly through its subsidiaries. </span><span>Because REITs often do not provide complete tax information until after the calendar year-end, the Fund may at times need </span><span>to request permission to extend the deadline for issuing your tax reporting statement or supplement the information </span><span>otherwise provided to you.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Utilities Sector. </span><span> </span><span>The utilities sector may be adversely affected by changing commodity prices, </span><span>government regulation stipulating rates charged by utilities, increased tariffs, changes in tax laws, interest rate fluctuations </span><span>and changes in the cost of providing specific utility services. The utilities industry is also subject to potential terrorist attacks, </span><span>natural disasters and severe weather conditions, as well as regulatory and operational burdens associated with the operation </span><span>and maintenance of nuclear facilities. Government regulators monitor and control utility revenues and costs, and therefore </span><span>may limit utility profits. Federal legislation may facilitate the construction of electric transmission lines not only by public </span><span>utilities but also by independent transmission developers, which could increase competition in the wholesale electricity </span><span>markets. In certain countries, regulatory authorities may also restrict a company’s access to new markets, thereby </span><span>diminishing the company’s long-term prospects.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>There are substantial differences among the regulatory practices and policies of various jurisdictions, and any regulatory </span><span>agency may make major shifts in policy from time to time. There is no assurance that regulatory authorities will, in the future, </span><span>grant rate increases. Additionally, existing and possible future regulatory legislation may make it even more difficult for </span><span>utilities to obtain adequate relief. Certain of the issuers of securities held in the Fund's portfolio may own or operate nuclear </span><span>generating facilities. Governmental authorities may from time to time review existing policies and impose additional </span><span>requirements governing the licensing, construction and operation of nuclear power plants. Prolonged changes in climate </span><span>conditions can also have a significant impact on both the revenues of an electric and gas utility as well as the expenses of a </span><span>utility, particularly a hydro-based electric utility.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>15</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The rates that traditional regulated utility companies may charge their customers generally are subject to review and </span><span>limitation by governmental regulatory commissions. Rate changes may occur only after a prolonged approval period or may </span><span>not occur at all, which could adversely affect utility companies when costs are rising. The value of regulated utility debt </span><span>securities (and, to a lesser extent, equity securities) tends to have an inverse relationship to the movement of interest rates. </span><span>Certain utility companies have experienced full or partial deregulation in recent years. These utility companies are frequently </span><span>more similar to industrial companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been permitted by regulators to </span><span>diversify outside of their original geographic regions and their traditional lines of business. As a result, some companies may </span><span>be forced to defend their core business and may be less profitable. Deregulation may also permit a utility company to expand </span><span>outside of its traditional lines of business and engage in riskier ventures.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Proxy Voting Policy</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Board has approved a proxy voting pilot program for the Fund (the </span><span>“</span><span>Pilot</span><span>”</span><span>). Under the Pilot, eligible Fund shareholders </span><span>will have the opportunity to select from among seven proxy voting policies that include: 1) BFA’s proxy voting policies and </span><span>procedures (</span><span>“</span><span>BFA’s Proxy Voting Policy</span><span>”</span><span>), and 2) proxy voting policies from third parties (each, a </span><span>“</span><span>Third-Party Proxy Voting </span><span>Policy</span><span>”</span><span> and together with BFA’s Proxy Voting Policy, the </span><span>“</span><span>IVV Proxy Voting Policies</span><span>”</span><span>). BFA will administer the Pilot, will utilize </span><span>the applicable IVV Proxy Voting Policy when selected by an eligible Fund shareholder (as described below), and will be </span><span>responsible for any interpretative questions in connection with the Pilot and the utilization of a IVV Proxy Voting Policy, </span><span>including the Third-Party Proxy Voting Policies.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Once an IVV Proxy Voting Policy is selected by an eligible Fund shareholder, BFA will apply it at the annual general </span><span>shareholder meetings (</span><span>“</span><span>AGMs</span><span>”</span><span>) of issuers of securities held by the Fund based on the Fund shareholder’s proportional </span><span>ownership of the Fund as of the record date of the applicable AGM, subject to certain exceptions described below. If a Fund </span><span>shareholder does not, or is unable to, select an IVV Proxy Voting Policy, BFA will continue to use BFA’s Proxy Voting Policy for </span><span>each such Fund shareholder’s proportional ownership of the Fund. The Pilot will be applied to AGMs held through 2024. At </span><span>the end of the Pilot, the Board will determine whether to extend, modify or terminate the Pilot based on, among other things, </span><span>investor interest, the availability of necessary proxy voting infrastructure, expected costs, and overall investor experience.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shareholder Eligibility for the Pilot</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BFA is working with Broadridge Investor Communication Solutions Inc. (</span><span>“</span><span>Broadridge</span><span>”</span><span>) to identify and track known </span><span>shareholder accounts in the Fund, which are referred to as </span><span>“</span><span>Eligible Shareholders.</span><span>”</span><span> Broadridge will identify shareholder </span><span>accounts that are Eligible Shareholders but will only do so for the initial and subsequent communication in February and </span><span>March 2024 using its network of brokers to identify Fund shareholder information. Fund shareholder accounts that are not </span><span>known to Broadridge or are not accounts at the time of the communications and shareholders that cannot be reached due to </span><span>limits on proxy voting infrastructure are not expected to be eligible to participate in the Pilot. Shareholders purchasing shares </span><span>after March 2024 will not be Eligible Shareholders during the Pilot. The Eligible Shareholders will be notified by email or mail, </span><span>as applicable under their current preferences to receive Fund proxy communications, and will be asked to participate in a </span><span>survey to select from the IVV Proxy Voting Polices.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shareholders that hold the Fund in multiple shareholder accounts may receive a survey request for each account identified by </span><span>Broadridge and may only receive the survey for certain accounts. Shareholders should submit a response for each </span><span>shareholder account that they want to participate in the Pilot.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Eligible Shareholders may also subsequently select a different IVV Proxy Voting Policy, from time to time, by accessing the </span><span>survey through the prior communication they received. BFA will review and implement initial and subsequent shareholder </span><span>selections; provided that such selections will not be implemented until after all such reviews are complete. Eligible </span><span>Shareholders should expect a reasonable delay after each selection is made before being implemented. For Fund </span><span>shareholders that choose not to participate or are not eligible to participate, BFA will continue to vote the Fund shareholder’s </span><span>proportional ownership of the Fund pursuant to BFA’s Proxy Voting Policy. If BFA has invested another client (including a </span><span>registered investment company) in the Fund, BFA will utilize BFA’s Proxy Voting Policy as the client’s selection unless </span><span>otherwise agreed between the client and BFA. BFA will not seek the preferences of the investors in other registered </span><span>investment company clients during the Pilot.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Pilot Administration and Voting</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>16</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>BFA has been delegated the responsibility to administer the Pilot and vote proxies for the Fund. BFA will cast votes on behalf </span><span>of the Fund on specific proxy issues in respect of securities held by the Fund (or may refrain from voting) in accordance with </span><span>the IVV Proxy Voting Policies at AGMs, subject to BFA’s interpretation of the IVV Proxy Voting Polices. The number of shares </span><span>voted pursuant to each IVV Proxy Voting Policy will be based on the pro rata ownership of Eligible Shareholders that have </span><span>selected such IVV Proxy Voting Policy, calculated as of the record date for the applicable proxy for the underlying security </span><span>held by the Fund. BFA will rely on the information reasonably available to it to determine the percentages and corresponding </span><span>votes for the Eligible Shareholders.</span></div> <div> <div><span>BFA is authorized to use discretion in not voting or limiting the use of a Third-Party Proxy Voting Policy for certain underlying </span><span>securities or certain proposals due to considerations including, but not limited to, cost, operational risk and/or complexity, </span><span>local market regulation and practice, and financial considerations, including the decision not to recall securities on loan by </span><span>the Fund. In addition, for corporate actions, special meetings such as in connection with merger transactions or other </span><span>change of control transactions, voting in contested director elections, or other proxy issues where BFA has determined that a </span><span>consistent vote cast according to BFA’s Proxy Voting Policy would be in the best interest of the Fund as a whole, BFA will </span><span>apply BFA’s Proxy Voting Policy.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BFA will review proxy voting activity on behalf of the Fund, including any voting conducted in accordance with a Third-Party </span><span>Proxy Voting Policy, to ensure that votes are cast in accordance with the Board’s delegation and applicable IVV Proxy Voting </span><span>Policy.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>IVV Proxy Voting Policies</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Eligible Shareholders can select from the seven IVV Proxy Voting Policies, which are listed below in alphabetical order and </span><span>included as appendices:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div> </div> </div> <div>

Issuers (</span><span>i.e</span><span>., the </span><span>“</span><span>components</span><span>”</span><span>) selected for the Standard &amp; Poor’s Financial Services LLC (</span><span>“</span><span>S&amp;P</span><span>”</span><span>) U.S. indexes represent a broad range of </span><span>industry segments within the U.S. economy. The starting universe of publicly traded U.S. issuers classified by the Global </span><span>Industry Classification Standard (GICS</span><span>®</span><span>) is screened to eliminate ADRs, mutual funds, limited partnerships, royalty trusts, </span><span>certain holding issuers, OTC bulletin board issues, pink sheet-listed issues, closed-end funds, ETFs and tracking stocks. REITs, </span><span>except for mortgage REITs, are eligible for inclusion in the Indexes. The stock of each constituent must trade on either the </span><span>New York Stock Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>NYSE</span><span>”</span><span>), the NYSE Amex Equities or on NASDAQ. Additionally, only one share class per </span><span>constituent will be included in an Index. The share class is selected by SPDJI and is generally defined as the largest, most </span><span>liquid share class. Issuers with multiple share classes will have the classes combined for purposes of calculation of market </span><span>capitalization. The following criteria are then analyzed to determine an issuer’s eligibility for inclusion in the S&amp;P Indexes: (i) </span><span>ownership of an issuer’s outstanding common stock, in order to screen out closely held issuers; (ii) trading volume of an </span><span>issuer’s shares, in order to ensure ample liquidity and efficient share pricing; and (iii) the financial and operating condition of </span><span>an issuer.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The S&amp;P DJI’s Indices are capitalization-weighted, based on the following formula: number of outstanding shares of a </span><span>constituent (as determined by the float-adjusted market capitalization using SPDJI’s methodology) multiplied by the </span><span>constituent’s share price. Issuers with float-adjusted market capitalizations below certain thresholds are not eligible for the </span><span>Indexes. In addition, the market capitalization of an issuer eligible for inclusion typically must be greater than the Index’s </span><span>minimum market capitalization at the time it is being considered for Index inclusion. The market capitalizations of an Index’s </span><span>components are adjusted to reflect changes in capitalization resulting from mergers, acquisitions, stock rights, substitutions </span><span>and other capital events. The market capitalizations of an Index’s constituent are adjusted for all strategic holdings, including </span><span>private, corporate, and government holdings.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Issue Changes.</span><span> </span><span>General oversight responsibility for the S&amp;P DJI Indices, including overall policy guidelines and methodology, </span><span>is handled by the S&amp;P Global Index Committee. Maintenance of component investments, including additions and deletions to </span><span>these investments, is the responsibility of separate regional index committees composed of S&amp;P staff specialized in the </span><span>various regional equity markets and, in some cases, with the assistance of local stock exchanges. Public announcements of </span><span>index changes as the result of committee decisions will generally be made two business days in advance of the anticipated </span><span>effective date whenever possible, although for exceptional corporate events announcements may be made earlier.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Index Maintenance.</span><span> </span><span>Maintaining the S&amp;P DJI Indices includes monitoring and completing the adjustments for issuer </span><span>additions and deletions, share changes, stock splits, stock dividends, and stock price adjustments due to restructuring and </span><span>spin-offs. An issuer will be removed from the S&amp;P DJI Indices as a result of mergers/acquisitions, bankruptcy, or </span><span>restructuring. An issuer is removed from the relevant index as close as possible to the actual date on which the event </span><span>occurred. An issuer can be removed from an index because it no longer meets current criteria for inclusion and/or is no </span><span>longer representative of its industry group. All replacement issuers are selected based on the above component section </span><span>criteria.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When calculating index weights, individual components shares held by governments, corporations, strategic partners, or </span><span>other control groups are excluded from the issuer’s shares outstanding. Shares owned by other issuers are also excluded </span><span>regardless of whether they are index components. In countries with regulated environments, where a foreign investment </span><span>limit exists at the sector or issuer level, the constituent’s weight will reflect either the foreign investment limit or the </span><span>percentage float, whichever is the more restrictive.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Each issuer’s financial statements will be used to update the major shareholders’ ownership. However, during the course of </span><span>the year, SPDJI also monitors each issuer’s Investable Weight Factor (</span><span>“</span><span>IWF</span><span>”</span><span>) which is SPDJI’s term for the mathematical float </span><span>factor used to calculate the float adjustment. If a change in IWF is caused by a major corporate action (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, privatization, </span><span>merger, takeover, or share offering) and the change equal to or greater than 5%, a float adjustment will be implemented as </span><span>soon as reasonably possible.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Changes in the number of shares outstanding driven by corporate events such as stock dividends, splits, and rights issues </span><span>will be adjusted on the ex-date. Share changes of 5% or greater are implemented when they occur. Share changes of less </span><span>than 5% are only updated on a quarterly basis on the Friday near the end of the calendar quarter.

BFA monitors Fund </span><span>holdings in illiquid investments, pursuant to the Liquidity Program.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If any percentage restriction described above is complied with at the time of an investment, a later increase or decrease in </span><span>percentage resulting from a change in values of assets will not constitute a violation of such restriction, except that certain </span><span>percentage limitations will be observed continuously in accordance with applicable law.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund has adopted a non-fundamental investment policy in accordance with Rule 35d-1 under the 1940 Act to invest, </span><span>under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the value of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment </span><span>purposes, in component securities of the Underlying Index or in depositary receipts representing component securities in the </span><span>Underlying Index. The Fund also has adopted a policy to provide its shareholders with at least 60 days’ prior written notice of </span><span>any change in such policy. If, subsequent to an investment, the 80% requirement is no longer met, the Fund’s future </span><span>investments will be made in a manner that will bring the Fund into compliance with this policy.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy not to purchase securities of other investment companies, except to the </span><span>extent permitted by the 1940 Act. As a matter of policy, however, the Fund will not purchase shares of any registered open-end</span><span> investment company or registered unit investment trust, in reliance on Section 12(d)(1)(F) or (G) (the </span><span>“</span><span>fund of funds</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>provisions) of the 1940 Act, at any time the Fund has knowledge that its shares are purchased by another investment </span><span>company investor in reliance on the provisions of subparagraph (G) of Section 12(d)(1).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Unless otherwise indicated, all limitations under the Fund's fundamental or non-fundamental investment policies apply only </span><span>at the time that a transaction is undertaken. Any change in the percentage of the Fund's assets invested in certain securities </span><span>or other instruments resulting from market fluctuations or other changes in the Fund’s total assets will not require the Fund </span><span>to dispose of an investment until BFA determines that it is practicable to sell or close out the investment without undue </span><span>market or tax consequences.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Continuous Offering</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The method by which Creation Units are created and traded may raise certain issues under applicable securities laws. </span><span>Because new Creation Units are issued and sold by the Fund on an ongoing basis, at any point a </span><span>“</span><span>distribution,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term </span><span>is used in the 1933 Act, may occur. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, </span><span>depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render </span><span>them statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus delivery requirement and liability provisions of the 1933 Act.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For example, a broker-dealer firm or its client may be deemed a statutory underwriter if it takes Creation Units after placing </span><span>an order with the Distributor, breaks them down into constituent shares and sells such shares directly to customers or if it </span><span>chooses to couple the creation of new shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand </span><span>for shares. A determination of whether one is an underwriter for purposes of the 1933 Act must take into account all of the </span><span>facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the broker-dealer or its client in the particular case and the examples </span><span>mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that could lead to a categorization as </span><span>an underwriter.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Broker-dealer firms should also note that dealers who are not </span><span>“</span><span>underwriters</span><span>”</span><span> but are effecting transactions in shares, </span><span>whether or not participating in the distribution of shares, generally are required to deliver a prospectus.

Firms that incur a prospectus delivery obligation with respect to shares of the Fund are </span><span>reminded that, pursuant to Rule 153 under the 1933 Act, a prospectus delivery obligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the 1933 </span><span>Act owed to an exchange member in connection with a sale on the Listing Exchange generally is satisfied by the fact that the </span><span>prospectus is available at the Listing Exchange upon request.

The Board has engaged BFA to manage the Fund on a </span><span>day-to-day basis. The Board is responsible for overseeing BFA and other service providers in the operations of the Fund in </span><span>accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, applicable provisions of state and other laws and the Trust’s charter. The </span><span>Board is currently composed of eleven members, nine of whom are Independent Trustees. The Board currently conducts </span><span>regular in person meetings four times a year. In addition, the Board frequently holds special in person or telephonic meetings </span><span>or informal conference calls to discuss specific matters that may arise or require action between regular meetings. The </span><span>Independent Trustees meet regularly outside the presence of management, in executive session or with other service </span><span>providers to the Trust.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Board has appointed an Independent Trustee to serve in the role of Board Chair. The Board Chair’s role is to preside at all </span><span>meetings of the Board and to act as a liaison with service providers, officers, attorneys, and other Trustees generally between </span><span>meetings. The Board Chair may also perform such other functions as may be delegated by the Board from time to time. The </span><span>Board has established seven standing Committees: a Nominating and Governance Committee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c) </span><span>Committee, a Securities Lending Committee, a Risk Committee, an Equity Plus Committee and a Fixed Income Plus </span><span>Committee to assist the Board in the oversight and direction of the business and affairs of the Fund, and from time to time </span><span>the Board may establish ad hoc committees or informal working groups to review and address the policies and practices of </span><span>the Fund with respect to certain specified matters. The Chair of each standing Committee is an Independent Trustee. The </span><span>role of the Chair of each Committee is to preside at all meetings of the Committee and to act as a liaison with service </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>29</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>providers, officers, attorneys and other Trustees between meetings. Each standing Committee meets regularly to conduct the </span><span>oversight functions delegated to the Committee by the Board and reports its finding to the Board. The Board and each </span><span>standing Committee conduct annual assessments of their oversight function and structure. The Board has determined that </span><span>the Board’s leadership structure is appropriate because it allows the Board to exercise independent judgment over </span><span>management and it allocates areas of responsibility among committees of Independent Trustees and the full Board to </span><span>enhance effective oversight.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Day-to-day risk management with respect to the Fund is the responsibility of BFA or other service providers (depending on </span><span>the nature of the risk), subject to the supervision of BFA. The Fund is subject to a number of risks, including investment, </span><span>compliance, operational, reputational, counterparty and valuation risks, among others. While there are a number of risk </span><span>management functions performed by BFA and other service providers, as applicable, it is not possible to identify and </span><span>eliminate all of the risks applicable to the Fund. The Trustees have an oversight role in this area, satisfying themselves that </span><span>risk management processes and controls are in place and operating effectively. Risk oversight forms part of the Board’s </span><span>general oversight of the Fund and is addressed as part of various Board and committee activities. In some cases, risk </span><span>management issues are specifically addressed in presentations and discussions. For example, BFA has an independent </span><span>dedicated Risk and Quantitative Analysis Group (</span><span>“</span><span>RQA</span><span>”</span><span>) that assists BFA in managing fiduciary and corporate risks, including </span><span>investment, operational, counterparty credit and enterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet with the Board to discuss their </span><span>analysis and methodologies, as well as specific risk topics such as operational and counterparty risks relating to the Fund. </span><span>The Board, directly or through a committee, also reviews reports from, among others, management and the independent </span><span>registered public accounting firm for the Trust, as appropriate, regarding risks faced by the Fund and management’s risk </span><span>functions. The Board has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer who oversees the implementation and testing of the Trust's </span><span>compliance program, including assessments by independent third parties, and reports to the Board regarding compliance </span><span>matters for the Trust and its principal service providers. In testing and maintaining the compliance program, the Chief </span><span>Compliance Officer (and his or her delegates) assesses key compliance risks affecting the Fund, and addresses them in </span><span>periodic reports to the Board. In addition, the Audit Committee meets with both the Fund's independent registered public </span><span>accounting firm and BFA’s internal audit group to review risk controls in place that support the Fund as well as test results. </span><span>Board oversight of risk is also performed as needed between meetings through communications between BFA and the Board. </span><span>The Independent Trustees have engaged independent legal counsel to assist them in performing their oversight </span><span>responsibilities. From time to time, the Board may modify the manner in which it conducts risk oversight. The Board’s </span><span>oversight role does not make it a guarantor of the Fund's investment performance or other activities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Committees of the Board of Trustees.</span><span>  </span><span>The members of the Audit Committee are Richard L.

BlackRock, its subsidiaries and their respective directors, </span><span>officers and employees, including the business units or entities and personnel who may be involved in the investment </span><span>activities and business operations of the Fund, are engaged worldwide in businesses, including managing equities, fixed-income</span><span> securities, cash and alternative investments, and have interests other than that of managing the Fund. These are </span><span>considerations of which investors in the Fund should be aware, and which may cause conflicts of interest that could </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>35</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. These businesses and interests include potential multiple advisory, financial and </span><span>other relationships with, or interests in, companies and interests in securities or other instruments that may be purchased or </span><span>sold by the Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock has proprietary interests in, and may manage or advise with respect to, accounts or funds (including separate </span><span>accounts and other funds and collective investment vehicles) that have investment objectives similar to those of the Fund </span><span>and/or that engage in transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and instruments as the Fund. BlackRock is also </span><span>a major participant in the global currency, equities, swap and fixed-income markets, in each case, for the accounts of clients </span><span>and, in some cases, on a proprietary basis. As such, BlackRock is or may be actively engaged in transactions in the same </span><span>securities, currencies, and instruments in which the Fund invests. Such activities could affect the prices and availability of the </span><span>securities, currencies, and instruments in which the Fund invests, which could have an adverse impact on the Fund's </span><span>performance. Such transactions, particularly in respect of most proprietary accounts or client accounts, will be executed </span><span>independently of the Fund's transactions and thus at prices or rates that may be more or less favorable than those obtained </span><span>by the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When BlackRock seeks to purchase or sell the same assets for managed accounts, including the Fund, the assets actually </span><span>purchased or sold may be allocated among the accounts on a basis determined in its good faith discretion to be equitable. In </span><span>some cases, this system may adversely affect the size or price of the assets purchased or sold for the Fund. In addition, </span><span>transactions in investments by one or more other accounts managed by BlackRock may have the effect of diluting or </span><span>otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the Fund, particularly, but not limited to, with respect </span><span>to small-capitalization, emerging market or less liquid strategies. This may occur with respect to BlackRock-advised accounts </span><span>when investment decisions regarding the Fund are based on research or other information that is also used to support </span><span>decisions for other accounts. When BlackRock implements a portfolio decision or strategy on behalf of another account </span><span>ahead of, or contemporaneously with, similar decisions or strategies for the Fund, market impact, liquidity constraints, or </span><span>other factors could result in the Fund receiving less favorable trading results and the costs of implementing such decisions or </span><span>strategies could be increased or the Fund could otherwise be disadvantaged. BlackRock may, in certain cases, elect to </span><span>implement internal policies and procedures designed to limit such consequences, which may cause the Fund to be unable to </span><span>engage in certain activities, including purchasing or disposing of securities, when it might otherwise be desirable for it to do </span><span>so.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Conflicts may also arise because portfolio decisions regarding the Fund may benefit other accounts managed by BlackRock. </span><span>For example, the sale of a long position or establishment of a short position by the Fund may impair the price of the same </span><span>security sold short by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its other accounts or funds, and the purchase of a security or </span><span>covering of a short position in a security by the Fund may increase the price of the same security held by (and therefore </span><span>benefit) BlackRock or its other accounts or funds. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Fund may invest </span><span>its assets in other funds advised by BlackRock, including funds that are managed by one or more of the same portfolio </span><span>managers, which could result in conflicts of interest relating to asset allocation, timing of Fund purchases and sales, and </span><span>increased remuneration and profitability for BlackRock, and/or its personnel, including portfolio managers.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In certain circumstances, BlackRock, on behalf of the Fund, may seek to buy from or sell securities to another fund or </span><span>account advised by BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is not required to) effect purchases and sales between BlackRock clients </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>cross trades</span><span>”</span><span>), including the Fund, if BlackRock believes such transactions are appropriate based on each party's </span><span>investment objectives and guidelines, subject to applicable law and regulation. There may be potential conflicts of interest or </span><span>regulatory issues relating to these transactions which could limit BlackRock’s decision to engage in these transactions for the </span><span>Fund. BlackRock may have a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities to the parties in such transactions. </span><span>On any occasion when the Fund participates in a cross trade, BlackRock will comply with procedures adopted under </span><span>applicable rules and SEC guidance.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock and its clients may pursue or enforce rights with respect to an issuer in which the Fund has invested, and those </span><span>activities may have an adverse effect on the Fund. As a result, prices, availability, liquidity and terms of the Fund's investments </span><span>may be negatively impacted by the activities of BlackRock or its clients, and transactions for the Fund may be impaired or </span><span>effected at prices or terms that may be less favorable than would otherwise have been the case.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The results of the Fund’s investment activities may differ significantly from the results achieved by BlackRock for its </span><span>proprietary accounts or other accounts (including investment companies or collective investment vehicles) which it manages </span><span>or advises. It is possible that one or more accounts managed or advised by BlackRock and such other accounts will achieve </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>36</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>investment results that are substantially more or less favorable than the results achieved by the Fund. Moreover, it is possible </span><span>that the Fund will sustain losses during periods in which one or more proprietary or other accounts managed or advised by </span><span>BlackRock achieve significant profits. The opposite result is also possible.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>From time to time, the Fund may be restricted from purchasing or selling securities, or from engaging in other investment </span><span>activities because of regulatory, legal or contractual requirements applicable to BlackRock or other accounts managed or </span><span>advised by BlackRock, and/or the internal policies of BlackRock designed to comply with such requirements. As a result, </span><span>there may be periods, for example, when BlackRock will not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions in certain </span><span>securities or instruments with respect to which BlackRock is performing services or when position limits have been reached. </span><span>For example, the investment activities of BlackRock for its proprietary accounts and accounts under its management may </span><span>limit the investment opportunities for the Fund in certain emerging and other markets in which limitations are imposed upon </span><span>the amount of investment, in the aggregate or in individual issuers, by affiliated foreign investors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In connection with its management of the Fund, BlackRock may have access to certain fundamental analysis and proprietary </span><span>technical models developed by BlackRock. BlackRock will not be under any obligation, however, to effect transactions on </span><span>behalf of the Fund in accordance with such analysis and models. In addition, BlackRock will not have any obligation to make </span><span>available any information regarding its proprietary activities or strategies, or the activities or strategies used for other </span><span>accounts managed by them, for the benefit of the management of the Fund and it is not anticipated that BlackRock will have </span><span>access to such information for the purpose of managing the Fund. The proprietary activities or portfolio strategies of </span><span>BlackRock, or the activities or strategies used for accounts managed by BlackRock or other client accounts could conflict </span><span>with the transactions and strategies employed by BlackRock in managing the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund may be included in investment models developed by BlackRock for use by clients and financial advisors. To the </span><span>extent clients invest in these investment models and increase the assets under management of the Fund, the investment </span><span>management fee amounts paid by the Fund to BlackRock may also increase. The price, availability and liquidity of the Fund </span><span>may be impacted by purchases and sales of the Fund by model-driven investment portfolios, as well as by BlackRock itself </span><span>and by its advisory clients.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, certain principals and certain employees of the Fund’s investment adviser are also principals or employees of </span><span>other business units or entities within BlackRock. As a result, these principals and employees may have obligations to such </span><span>other business units or entities or their clients and such obligations to other business units or entities or their clients may be </span><span>a consideration of which investors in the Fund should be aware.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock may enter into transactions and invest in securities, instruments and currencies on behalf of the Fund in which </span><span>clients of BlackRock or, to the extent permitted by the SEC and applicable law, BlackRock serves as the counterparty, principal </span><span>or issuer. In such cases, such party's interests in the transaction will be adverse to the interests of the Fund, and such party </span><span>may have no incentive to assure that the Fund obtains the best possible prices or terms in connection with the transactions. </span><span>In addition, the purchase, holding and sale of such investments by the Fund may enhance the profitability of BlackRock.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock may also create, write or issue derivatives for clients based on the underlying securities, currencies or instruments </span><span>in which the Fund may invest or on the performance of the Fund. An entity in which BlackRock has a significant minority </span><span>interest will create, write or issue options which may be based on the performance of certain Funds. BlackRock has the right </span><span>to receive a portion of the gross revenue earned by such entity. Options writing by such entity on the Fund could potentially </span><span>lead to increased purchase activity with respect to the Fund and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock has entered into an arrangement with Markit Indices Limited, the index provider for underlying fixed-income </span><span>indexes used by certain iShares funds, related to derivative fixed-income products that are based on such iShares funds. </span><span>BlackRock may receive certain payments for licensing intellectual property belonging to BlackRock and for facilitating the </span><span>provision of data in connection with such derivative products, which may include payments based on the trading volumes of, </span><span>or revenues generated by, the derivative products. However, BlackRock will not receive any such payments on those derivative </span><span>products utilized by the Fund or other BlackRock funds or accounts. Other funds and accounts managed by BlackRock may </span><span>from time to time transact in such derivative products, which could contribute to the viability or success of such derivative </span><span>products by making them more appealing to funds and accounts managed by third parties, and in turn lead to increased </span><span>payments to BlackRock. Trading activity in such derivative products could also potentially lead to increased purchase activity </span><span>with respect to these iShares funds and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>37</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund may, subject to applicable law, purchase investments that are the subject of an underwriting or other distribution </span><span>by BlackRock and may also enter into transactions with other clients of BlackRock where such other clients have interests </span><span>adverse to those of the Fund.</span></div> <div> <div><span>At times, these activities may cause business units or entities within BlackRock to give advice to clients that may cause these </span><span>clients to take actions adverse to the interests of the Fund. To the extent such transactions are permitted, the Fund will deal </span><span>with BlackRock on an arm’s-length basis.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>To the extent authorized by applicable law, BlackRock may act as broker, dealer, agent, lender or adviser or in other </span><span>commercial capacities for the Fund. It is anticipated that the commissions, mark-ups, mark-downs, financial advisory fees, </span><span>underwriting and placement fees, sales fees, financing and commitment fees, brokerage fees, other fees, compensation or </span><span>profits, rates, terms and conditions charged by BlackRock will be in its view commercially reasonable, although BlackRock, </span><span>including its sales personnel, will have an interest in obtaining fees and other amounts that are favorable to BlackRock and </span><span>such sales personnel, which may have an adverse effect on the Fund. Index based funds may use an index provider that is </span><span>affiliated with another service provider of the Fund or BlackRock that acts as a broker, dealer, agent, lender or in other </span><span>commercial capacities for the Fund or BlackRock.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock (and its personnel and other distributors) will be entitled to retain fees and other </span><span>amounts that they receive in connection with their service to the Fund as broker, dealer, agent, lender, adviser or in other </span><span>commercial capacities. No accounting to the Fund or its shareholders will be required, and no fees or other compensation </span><span>payable by the Fund or its shareholders will be reduced by reason of receipt by BlackRock of any such fees or other amounts.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When BlackRock acts as broker, dealer, agent, adviser or in other commercial capacities in relation to the Fund, BlackRock </span><span>may take commercial steps in its own interests, which may have an adverse effect on the Fund. The Fund will be required to </span><span>establish business relationships with its counterparties based on the Fund's own credit standing. BlackRock will not have any </span><span>obligation to allow its credit to be used in connection with the Fund's establishment of its business relationships, nor is it </span><span>expected that the Fund's counterparties will rely on the credit of BlackRock in evaluating the Fund's creditworthiness.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BTC, an affiliate of BFA pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, acts as securities lending agent to, and receives a share of securities </span><span>lending revenues from, the Fund. BlackRock will also receive compensation for managing the reinvestment of the cash </span><span>collateral from securities lending. There are potential conflicts of interests in managing a securities lending program, </span><span>including but not limited to: (i) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to, among other things, increase </span><span>or decrease the amount of securities on loan or to lend particular securities in order to generate additional risk-adjusted </span><span>revenue for BlackRock and its affiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to allocate loans </span><span>to clients that would provide more revenue to BlackRock. As described further below, BlackRock seeks to mitigate this </span><span>conflict by providing its securities lending clients with equal lending opportunities over time in order to approximate </span><span>pro rata</span><span> </span><span>allocation.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As part of its securities lending program, BlackRock indemnifies the Fund and certain other clients and/or funds against a </span><span>shortfall in collateral in the event of borrower default. On a regular basis, BlackRock calculates the potential dollar exposure of </span><span>collateral shortfall resulting from a borrower default (</span><span>“</span><span>shortfall risk</span><span>”</span><span>) in the securities lending program. BlackRock establishes </span><span>program-wide borrower limits (</span><span>“</span><span>credit limits</span><span>”</span><span>) to actively manage borrower-specific credit exposure. BlackRock oversees the </span><span>risk model that calculates projected collateral shortfall values using loan-level factors such as loan and collateral type and </span><span>market value as well as specific borrower credit characteristics. When necessary, BlackRock may adjust securities lending </span><span>program attributes by restricting eligible collateral or reducing borrower credit limits. As a result, the management of </span><span>program-wide exposure as well as BlackRock-specific indemnification exposure may affect the amount of securities lending </span><span>activity BlackRock may conduct at any given point in time by reducing the volume of lending opportunities for certain loans </span><span>(including by asset type, collateral type and/or revenue profile).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock uses a predetermined systematic process in order to approximate </span><span>pro rata</span><span> allocation over time. In order to allocate </span><span>a loan to a portfolio: (i) BlackRock as a whole must have sufficient lending capacity pursuant to the various program limits </span><span>(</span><span>i.e</span><span>., indemnification exposure limit and borrower credit limits); (ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset at the time a </span><span>loan opportunity arrives; and (iii) the lending portfolio must also have enough inventory, either on its own or when </span><span>aggregated with other portfolios into one single market delivery, to satisfy the loan request. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to </span><span>provide equal lending opportunities for all portfolios, independent of whether BlackRock indemnifies the portfolio.

Specifically, short and long-term outcomes for </span><span>individual clients may vary due to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on different securities, and the overall limits imposed by </span><span>the firm.</span></div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock may decline to make a securities loan on behalf of the Fund, discontinue lending on behalf of the Fund or </span><span>terminate a securities loan on behalf of the Fund for any reason, including but not limited to regulatory requirements and/or </span><span>market rules, liquidity considerations, or credit considerations, which may impact Funds by reducing or eliminating the </span><span>volume of lending opportunities for certain types of loans, loans in particular markets, loans of particular securities or types </span><span>of securities, or for loans overall.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Purchases and sales of securities and other assets for the Fund may be bunched or aggregated with orders for other </span><span>BlackRock client accounts, including with accounts that pay different transaction costs solely due to the fact that they have </span><span>different research payment arrangements. BlackRock, however, is not required to bunch or aggregate orders if portfolio </span><span>management decisions for different accounts are made separately, or if they determine that bunching or aggregating is not </span><span>practicable or required, or in cases involving client direction.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Prevailing trading activity frequently may make impossible the receipt of the same price or execution on the entire volume of </span><span>securities purchased or sold. When this occurs, the various prices may be averaged, and the Fund will be charged or credited </span><span>with the average price. Thus, the effect of the aggregation may operate on some occasions to the disadvantage of the Fund. </span><span>In addition, under certain circumstances, the Fund will not be charged the same commission or commission equivalent rates </span><span>in connection with a bunched or aggregated order.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock may select brokers that furnish BlackRock, the Fund, other BlackRock client accounts or </span><span>personnel, directly or through correspondent relationships, with research or other appropriate services which provide, in </span><span>BlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to BlackRock in the investment decision-making process (including with respect to </span><span>futures, fixed-price offerings and OTC transactions). Such research or other services may include, to the extent permitted by </span><span>law, research reports on companies, industries and securities; economic and financial data; financial publications; proxy </span><span>analysis; trade industry seminars; computer data bases; research-oriented software and other services and products. </span><span>Research or other services obtained in this manner may be used in servicing any or all of the Fund and other BlackRock client </span><span>accounts, including in connection with BlackRock client accounts other than those that pay commissions to the broker </span><span>relating to the research or other service arrangements. Such products and services may disproportionately benefit other </span><span>BlackRock client accounts relative to the Fund based on the amount of brokerage commissions paid by the Fund and such </span><span>other BlackRock client accounts. For example, research or other services that are paid for through one client's commissions </span><span>may not be used in managing that client's account. In addition, other BlackRock client accounts may receive the benefit, </span><span>including disproportionate benefits, of economies of scale or price discounts in connection with products and services that </span><span>may be provided to the Fund and to such other BlackRock client accounts. To the extent that BlackRock uses soft dollars, it </span><span>will not have to pay for those products and services itself.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock does not currently enter into arrangements to use the Fund's assets for, or participate in, soft dollars, although </span><span>BlackRock may receive research that is bundled with the trade execution, clearing, and/or settlement services provided by a </span><span>particular broker-dealer. To the extent that BlackRock receives research on this basis, many of the same conflicts related to </span><span>traditional soft dollars may exist. For example, the research effectively will be paid by client commissions that also will be </span><span>used to pay for the execution, clearing, and settlement services provided by the broker-dealer and will not be paid by </span><span>BlackRock. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may endeavor to execute trades through brokers who, pursuant to </span><span>such arrangements, provide research or other services in order to ensure the continued receipt of research or other services </span><span>BlackRock believes are useful in its investment decision-making process. BlackRock may from time to time choose not to </span><span>engage in the above described arrangements to varying degrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may also </span><span>enter into commission sharing arrangements under which BlackRock may execute transactions through a broker-dealer, and </span><span>request that the broker-dealer allocate a portion of the commissions or commission credits to another firm that provides </span><span>research to BlackRock. To the extent that BlackRock engages in commission sharing arrangements, many of the same </span><span>conflicts related to traditional soft dollars may exist.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock may utilize certain electronic crossing networks (</span><span>“</span><span>ECNs</span><span>”</span><span>) (including, without limitation, ECNs in which BlackRock </span><span>has an investment or other interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law) in executing client</span><span> </span><span>securities transactions for </span><span>certain types of securities. These ECNs may charge fees for their services, including access fees and transaction fees. The </span><span>transaction fees, which are similar to commissions or markups/markdowns, will generally be charged to clients and, like </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>39</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>commissions and markups/markdowns, would generally be included in the cost of the securities purchased. Access fees </span><span>may be paid by BlackRock even though incurred in connection with executing transactions on behalf of clients, including the </span><span>Fund. In certain circumstances, ECNs may offer volume discounts that will reduce the access fees typically paid by BlackRock. </span><span>BlackRock will only utilize ECNs consistent with its obligation to seek to obtain best execution in client transactions.</span></div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock owns a minority interest in, and is a member of, Members Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>MEMX</span><span>”</span><span>), a newly created U.S. stock </span><span>exchange. Transactions for the Fund may be executed on MEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue </span><span>for execution of orders placed by BlackRock traders on behalf of such Funds. In addition, transactions in Fund shares may be </span><span>executed on MEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue for the execution of such orders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock has adopted policies and procedures designed to prevent conflicts of interest from influencing proxy voting </span><span>decisions that it makes on behalf of advisory clients, including the Fund, and to help ensure that such decisions are made in </span><span>accordance with BlackRock's fiduciary obligations to its clients. Nevertheless, notwithstanding such proxy voting policies and </span><span>procedures, actual proxy voting decisions of BlackRock may have the effect of favoring the interests of other clients or </span><span>businesses of other divisions or units of BlackRock, provided that BlackRock believes such voting decisions to be in </span><span>accordance with its fiduciary obligations. For a more detailed discussion of these policies and procedures, see the </span><span>Proxy </span><span>Voting Policy</span><span> section of this SAI.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>It is also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients (including other funds and separately </span><span>managed accounts) may, subject to compliance with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of the Fund. Increasing the </span><span>Fund’s assets may enhance liquidity, investment flexibility and diversification and may contribute to economies of scale that </span><span>tend to reduce the Fund's expense ratio. BlackRock reserves the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to sell into </span><span>the market or redeem in Creation Units through an Authorized Participant at any time some or all of the shares of the Fund </span><span>acquired for its own accounts or the account of a BlackRock advisory client. A large sale or redemption of shares of the Fund </span><span>by BlackRock itself or a BlackRock advisory client could significantly reduce the asset size of the Fund, which might have an </span><span>adverse effect on the Fund's liquidity, investment flexibility, portfolio diversification, expense ratio or ability to comply with the </span><span>listing requirements for the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>It is possible that the Fund may invest in securities of, or engage in transactions with, companies in which BlackRock has </span><span>significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by </span><span>entities for which BlackRock provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the </span><span>sale of such issuances. In making investment decisions for the Fund, BlackRock is not permitted to obtain or use material </span><span>non-public information acquired by any unit of BlackRock in the course of these activities. In addition, from time to time, the </span><span>activities of BlackRock may limit the Fund's flexibility in purchases and sales of securities. As indicated below, BlackRock may </span><span>engage in transactions with companies in which BlackRock-advised funds or other clients of BlackRock have an investment.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock, its personnel and other financial service providers may have interests in promoting sales of the Fund. With respect </span><span>to BlackRock and its personnel, the remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of the Fund or other </span><span>products may be greater than remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of certain funds or other </span><span>products that might be provided or offered. BlackRock and its sales personnel may directly or indirectly receive a portion of </span><span>the fees and commissions charged to the Fund or its shareholders. BlackRock and its advisory or other personnel may also </span><span>benefit from increased amounts of assets under management. Fees and commissions may also be higher than for other </span><span>products or services, and the remuneration and profitability to BlackRock and such personnel resulting from transactions on </span><span>behalf of or management of the Fund may be greater than the remuneration and profitability resulting from other funds or </span><span>products.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Third parties, including service providers to BlackRock or the Fund, may sponsor events (including, but not limited to, </span><span>marketing and promotional activities and presentations, educational training programs and conferences) for registered </span><span>representatives, other professionals and individual investors. There is a potential conflict of interest as such sponsorships </span><span>may defray the costs of such activities to BlackRock, and may provide an incentive to BlackRock to retain such third parties to </span><span>provide services to the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock may provide valuation assistance to certain clients with respect to certain securities or other investments and the </span><span>valuation recommendations made for such clients' accounts may differ from the valuations for the same securities or </span><span>investments assigned by the Fund's pricing vendors, especially if such valuations are based on broker-dealer quotes or other </span><span>data sources unavailable to the Fund's pricing vendors. While BlackRock will generally communicate its valuation information </span><span>or determinations to the Fund's pricing vendors and/or fund accountants, there may be instances where the Fund's pricing </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>40</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>vendors or fund accountants assign a different valuation to a security or other investment than the valuation for such </span><span>security or investment determined or recommended by BlackRock.</span></div> <div> <div><span>As disclosed in more detail in the </span><span>Determination of Net Asset Value</span><span> section in this SAI, when market quotations are not </span><span>readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, the Fund’s investments are valued at fair value by BFA. BFA has been </span><span>designated as the Fund’s valuation designee pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act and acts through </span><span>BFA’s Rule 2a-5 Committee (the </span><span>“</span><span>2a-5 Committee</span><span>”</span><span>), with assistance from other BFA pricing committees and in accordance </span><span>with BFA’s policies and procedures (the </span><span>“</span><span>Valuation Procedures</span><span>”</span><span>). When determining a </span><span>“</span><span>fair value price,</span><span>”</span><span> the 2a-5 Committee </span><span>seeks to determine the price that the Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or liability in </span><span>an arm’s-length transaction. The price generally may not be determined based on what the Fund might reasonably expect to </span><span>receive for selling an asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. While fair value </span><span>determinations will be based upon all available factors that BFA deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be </span><span>based on analytical values determined by BFA using proprietary or third-party valuation models, fair value represents only a </span><span>good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in </span><span>retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair </span><span>values were used in determining the Fund’s NAV. As a result, the Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time </span><span>when a holding or holdings are valued by the 2a-5 Committee at fair value, may have the effect of diluting or increasing the </span><span>economic interest of existing shareholders and may affect the amount of revenue received by BFA with respect to services for </span><span>which it receives an asset-based fee.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Fund may invest all or some of its short-term cash investments in any money </span><span>market fund or similarly-managed private fund advised or managed by BlackRock. In connection with any such investments, </span><span>the Fund, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, may pay its share of expenses of a money market fund or other similarly-managed</span><span> private fund in which it invests, which may result in the Fund bearing some additional expenses.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock and its directors, officers and employees, may buy and sell securities or other investments for their own accounts </span><span>and may have conflicts of interest with respect to investments made on behalf of the Fund. As a result of differing trading </span><span>and investment strategies or constraints, positions may be taken by directors, officers and employees that are the same, </span><span>different from or made at different times than positions taken for the Fund. To lessen the possibility that the Fund will be </span><span>adversely affected by this personal trading, the Fund, BFA and BlackRock have each adopted a code of ethics in compliance </span><span>with Section 17(j) of the 1940 Act that restricts securities trading in the personal accounts of investment professionals and </span><span>others who normally come into possession of information regarding the Fund's portfolio transactions. Each code of ethics is </span><span>available by contacting BlackRock at the telephone number on the back cover of the Fund’s Prospectus or by accessing the </span><span>EDGAR Database on the SEC's Internet site at http://www.sec.gov, and copies may be obtained, after paying a duplicating </span><span>fee, by e-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock will not purchase securities or other property from, or sell securities or other property to, the Fund, except that the </span><span>Fund may in accordance with rules or guidance adopted under the 1940 Act engage in transactions with another Fund or </span><span>accounts that are affiliated with the Fund as a result of common officers, directors, or investment advisers or pursuant to </span><span>exemptive orders granted to the Fund and/or BlackRock by the SEC. These transactions would be effected in circumstances </span><span>in which BlackRock determined that it would be appropriate for the Fund to purchase and another client of BlackRock to sell, </span><span>or the Fund to sell and another client of BlackRock to purchase, the same security or instrument on the same day. From time </span><span>to time, the activities of the Fund may be restricted because of regulatory requirements applicable to BlackRock and/or </span><span>BlackRock's internal policies designed to comply with, limit the applicability of, or otherwise relate to such requirements. A </span><span>client not advised by BlackRock would not be subject to some of those considerations. There may be periods when </span><span>BlackRock may not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions, or may otherwise restrict or limit its advice in certain </span><span>securities or instruments issued by or related to companies for which BlackRock is performing advisory or other services or </span><span>has proprietary positions. For example, when BlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or risk management services for a </span><span>company, BlackRock may be prohibited from or limited in purchasing or selling securities of that company on behalf of the </span><span>Fund, particularly where such services result in BlackRock obtaining material non-public information about the company </span><span>(</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, in connection with participation in a creditors’ committee). Similar situations could arise if personnel of BlackRock serve </span><span>as directors of companies the securities of which the Fund wishes to purchase or sell. However, if permitted by applicable law, </span><span>and where consistent with BlackRock’s policies and procedures (including the necessary implementation of appropriate </span><span>information barriers), the Fund may purchase securities or instruments that are issued by such companies, are the subject of </span><span>an advisory or risk management assignment by BlackRock, or where personnel of BlackRock are directors or officers of the </span><span>issuer.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>41</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The investment activities of BlackRock for its proprietary accounts and for client accounts may also limit the investment </span><span>strategies and rights of the Fund. For example, in certain circumstances where the Fund invests in securities issued by </span><span>companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or international markets, or is subject to </span><span>corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or invests in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be </span><span>limits on the aggregate amount invested by BlackRock for their proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the </span><span>Fund) that may not be exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if exceeded, may </span><span>cause BlackRock, the Fund or other client accounts to suffer disadvantages or business restrictions.</span></div> <div> <div><span>If certain aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either through the actions of BlackRock or the Fund or as a result of </span><span>third-party transactions, the ability of BlackRock, on behalf of clients (including the Fund), to purchase or dispose of </span><span>investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. As </span><span>a result, BlackRock, on behalf of its clients (including the Fund), may limit purchases, sell existing investments, or otherwise </span><span>restrict, forgo or limit the exercise of rights (including transferring, outsourcing or limiting voting rights or forgoing the right </span><span>to receive dividends) when BlackRock, in its sole discretion, deems it appropriate in light of potential regulatory or other </span><span>restrictions on ownership or other consequences resulting from reaching investment thresholds.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In those circumstances where ownership thresholds or limitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks to allocate limited </span><span>investment opportunities equitably among clients (including the Fund), taking into consideration benchmark weight and </span><span>investment strategy. BlackRock has adopted certain controls designed to prevent the occurrence of a breach of any </span><span>applicable ownership threshold or limits, including, for example, when ownership in certain securities nears an applicable </span><span>threshold, BlackRock may remove such securities from the list of Deposit Securities to be delivered to the Fund in connection </span><span>with purchases of Creation Units of such Fund and may limit purchases in such securities to the issuer's weighting in the </span><span>applicable benchmark used by BlackRock to manage such Fund. If client (including Fund) holdings of an issuer exceed an </span><span>applicable threshold and BlackRock is unable to obtain relief to enable the continued holding of such investments, it may be </span><span>necessary to sell down these positions to meet the applicable limitations. In these cases, benchmark overweight positions </span><span>will be sold prior to benchmark positions being reduced to meet applicable limitations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition to the foregoing, other ownership thresholds may trigger reporting requirements to governmental and regulatory </span><span>authorities, and such reports may entail the disclosure of the identity of a client or BlackRock’s intended strategy with respect </span><span>to such security or asset.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock may not serve as an Authorized Participant in the creation and redemption of iShares ETFs.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Under an ETF Services Agreement, the Fund has retained BRIL, an Affiliate of BFA, to perform certain order processing, </span><span>Authorized Participant communications, and related services in connection with the issuance and redemption of Creation </span><span>Units of the Fund (</span><span>“</span><span>ETF Services</span><span>”</span><span>). BRIL will retain a portion of the standard transaction fee received from Authorized </span><span>Participants on each creation or redemption order from the Authorized Participant for the ETF Services provided. BlackRock </span><span>collaborated with, and received payment from, Citibank, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>Citibank</span><span>”</span><span>) on the design and development of the ETF Services </span><span>platform. Citibank may have, or from time to time may develop, additional relationships with BlackRock or funds managed by </span><span>BFA and its affiliates.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In order to defray transaction expenses and protect against possible shareholder dilution, the Fund may collect certain fees </span><span>from Authorized Participants in connection with creation and redemption transactions. While BlackRock uses good faith </span><span>estimates of the expected costs to the Fund in determining the rates for fees collected by the Fund related to creation and </span><span>redemption activity, BlackRock may have incentives to improve Fund performance through the collection of these fees. As </span><span>these charges are based on estimates, where the charges exceed actual transaction- related costs and/or expenses incurred </span><span>by the Fund, Fund performance could improve as a result. BlackRock has established processes to oversee the determination </span><span>of these estimates in an effort to mitigate this conflict.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock may maintain securities indices. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, the Fund may seek to license and use </span><span>such indices as part of its investment strategy. Index based funds that seek to track the performance of securities indices also </span><span>may use the name of the index or index provider in the fund name. Index providers, including BlackRock (to the extent </span><span>permitted by applicable law), may be paid licensing fees for use of their index or index name. In instances where BlackRock </span><span>charges a unitary management fee, BlackRock may have a financial incentive to use a BlackRock index that is less costly to </span><span>BlackRock than a third party index. BlackRock may benefit from the Fund using BlackRock indices by creating increasing </span><span>acceptance in the marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is not obligated to license its indices to the Fund and the Fund is </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>42</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>under no obligation to use BlackRock indices. Any Fund that enters into a license for a BlackRock index cannot be assured </span><span>that the terms of any index licensing agreement with BlackRock will be as favorable as those terms offered to other licensees.</span></div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock may enter into contractual arrangements with third-party service providers to the Fund (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, custodians, </span><span>administrators and index providers) pursuant to which BlackRock receives fee discounts or concessions in recognition of </span><span>BlackRock’s overall relationship with such service providers. BlackRock may also enter into contractual arrangements with </span><span>such service providers pursuant to which BlackRock incurs additional costs if the service provider’s services are terminated </span><span>with respect to the Fund. To the extent that BlackRock is responsible for paying service providers out of its fees that it </span><span>receives from the Fund, the benefits of lower fees, including any fee discounts or concessions, or any additional savings, may </span><span>accrue, in whole or in part, to BlackRock, which could result in conflicts of interest relating to the use or termination of </span><span>service providers to the Fund. In addition, conflicts of interest may arise with respect to contractual arrangements with third-party</span><span> service providers to the Fund, or the selection of such providers, particularly in circumstances where BlackRock is </span><span>negotiating on behalf of both funds that have a unitary management fee and those that do not or different service providers </span><span>have different fee structures.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Conflicts of interest may arise as a result of simultaneous investment management of multiple client accounts by the </span><span>BlackRock’s investment professionals. For example, differences in the advisory fee structure may create the appearance of </span><span>actual or potential conflicts of interest because such differences could create pecuniary incentives for BlackRock to favor one </span><span>client account over another.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock owns or has an ownership interest in certain trading, portfolio management, operations and/or information </span><span>systems used by Fund service providers. These systems are, or will be, used by the Fund service provider in connection with </span><span>the provision of services to accounts managed by BlackRock and funds managed and sponsored by BlackRock, including the </span><span>Fund, that engage the service provider (typically the custodian). The Fund’s service provider remunerates BlackRock for the </span><span>use of the systems. The Fund service provider’s payments to BlackRock for the use of these systems may enhance the </span><span>profitability of BlackRock.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock’s receipt of fees from a service provider in connection with the use of systems provided by BlackRock may create </span><span>an incentive for BlackRock to recommend that the Fund enter into or renew an arrangement with the service provider.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In recognition of a BlackRock client’s overall relationship with BlackRock, BlackRock may offer special pricing arrangements </span><span>for certain services provided by BlackRock. Any such special pricing arrangements will not apply to the client’s investment in </span><span>the Fund.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Present and future activities of BlackRock (including BFA), its directors, officers and employees, in addition to those described </span><span>in this section, may give rise to additional conflicts of interest.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investment Advisory, Administrative and </span><span>Distribution Services</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investment Adviser. </span><span> </span><span>BFA serves as investment adviser to the Fund pursuant to an investment advisory agreement between </span><span>the Trust, on behalf of the Fund, and BFA. BFA is a California corporation indirectly owned by BlackRock, Inc. and is registered </span><span>as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Under the investment advisory agreement, </span><span>BFA, subject to the supervision of the Board and in conformity with the stated investment policies of the Fund, manages and </span><span>administers the Trust and the investment of the Fund’s assets. BFA is responsible for placing purchase and sale orders and </span><span>providing continuous supervision of the investment portfolio of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Pursuant to the investment advisory agreement, BFA may, from time to time, in its sole discretion and to the extent permitted </span><span>by applicable law, appoint one or more sub-advisers, including, without limitation, affiliates of BFA, to perform investment </span><span>advisory or other services with respect to the Fund. In addition, BFA may delegate certain of its investment advisory functions </span><span>under the investment advisory agreement to one or more of its affiliates to the extent permitted by applicable law. BFA may </span><span>terminate any or all sub-advisers or such delegation arrangements in its sole discretion upon appropriate notice at any time </span><span>to the extent permitted by applicable law.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>43</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Effective June 4, 2016, this </span><span>relationship was expanded to include National Financial Services, LLC (</span><span>“</span><span>NFS</span><span>”</span><span>), an affiliate of FBS.

Payments made </span><span>pursuant to such arrangements may vary in any year and may be different for different Intermediaries and third parties.

BFA Entities may determine to make such payments based on any number of metrics. For </span><span>example, BFA Entities may make payments at year-end or other intervals in a fixed amount, an amount based upon an </span><span>Intermediary’s services at defined levels or an amount based on the Intermediary’s net sales of one or more iShares funds in a </span><span>year or other period, any of which arrangements may include an agreed-upon minimum or maximum payment, or any </span><span>combination of the foregoing. As of the date of this SAI, BFA anticipates that the payments paid by BFA Entities in connection </span><span>with the Fund, iShares funds and exchange-traded products in general will be immaterial to BFA Entities in the aggregate for </span><span>the next year. </span><span>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such </span><span>payments or financial incentives his or her Intermediary firm may receive. Any payments made, or financial incentives </span><span>offered, by the BFA Entities to an Intermediary may create the incentive for the Intermediary to encourage customers to </span><span>buy shares of the Fund, other iShares funds or other exchange-traded products.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund may participate in certain market maker incentive programs of a national securities exchange in which an affiliate </span><span>of the Fund would pay a fee to the exchange used for the purpose of incentivizing one or more market makers in the </span><span>securities of the Fund to enhance the liquidity and quality of the secondary market of securities of the Fund. The fee would </span><span>then be credited by the exchange to one or more market makers that meet or exceed liquidity and market quality standards </span><span>with respect to the securities of the Fund. Each market maker incentive program is subject to approval from the SEC. Any </span><span>such fee payments made to an exchange will be made by an affiliate of the Fund solely for the benefit of the Fund and will </span><span>not be paid from any Fund assets. Other funds managed by BFA may also participate in such programs.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Determination of Net Asset Value</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Valuation of Shares. </span><span>The NAV for the Fund is generally calculated as of the close of regular trading hours on the New York </span><span>Stock Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>NYSE</span><span>”</span><span>) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time) on each business day the NYSE is open. Valuation of assets held </span><span>by the Fund is as follows:</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Equity Investments. </span><span>Equity securities traded on a recognized securities exchange (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, NYSE), on separate trading boards of a </span><span>securities exchange or through a market system that provides contemporaneous transaction pricing information (each an </span><span>“</span><span>Exchange</span><span>”</span><span>) are valued using information obtained via independent pricing services, generally at the closing price or, if an </span><span>Exchange closing price is not available, the last traded price on that Exchange prior to the time as of which the assets or </span><span>liabilities are valued. However, under certain circumstances, other means of determining current market value may be used. If </span><span>an equity security is traded on more than one Exchange, the current market value of the security where it is primarily traded </span><span>generally will be used. In the event that there are no sales involving an equity security held by the Fund on a day on which the </span><span>Fund values such security, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BFA determines that such prior day’s price no longer </span><span>reflects the fair value of the security, in which case such asset would be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below).</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Options, Futures, Swaps and Other Derivatives. </span><span>Exchange-traded equity options (except those that are customized) for </span><span>which market quotations are readily available are valued at the mean of the last bid and ask prices as quoted on the </span><span>Exchange or the board of trade on which such options are traded. In the event that there is no mean price available for an </span><span>exchange traded equity option held by the Fund on a day on which the Fund values such option, the last bid (long positions) </span><span>or ask (short positions) price, if available, will be used as the value of such option. If no bid or ask price is available on a day </span><span>on which the Fund values such option, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BFA determines that such prior day’s price no </span><span>longer reflects the fair value of the option, in which case such option will be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below). </span><span>Customized exchange-traded equity options, as well as OTC derivatives, may be valued using a mathematical model which </span><span>may incorporate a number of market data factors. Financial futures contracts and options thereon, which are traded on </span><span>exchanges, are valued at their last sale price or settle price as of the close of such exchanges. Swap agreements and other </span><span>derivatives are generally valued daily based upon quotations from market makers or by a pricing service in accordance with </span><span>the Valuation Procedures.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Underlying Funds. </span><span>Shares of underlying open-end funds (including money market funds) are valued at NAV. Shares of </span><span>underlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs will be valued at their most recent closing price.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>51</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>General Valuation Information. </span><span>Prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services, broker-dealers or market </span><span>makers to value the Fund’s securities and other assets and liabilities are based on information available at the time the Fund </span><span>values its assets and liabilities. In the event that a pricing service quotation is revised or updated subsequent to the day on </span><span>which the Fund valued such security, the revised pricing service quotation generally will be applied prospectively. Such </span><span>determination will be made considering pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding the revision.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The price the Fund could receive upon the sale of any particular portfolio investment may differ from the Fund’s valuation of </span><span>the investment, particularly for assets that trade in thin or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair valuation </span><span>methodology or a price provided by an independent pricing service. As a result, the price received upon the sale of an </span><span>investment may be less than the value ascribed by the Fund, and the Fund could realize a greater than expected loss or lesser </span><span>than expected gain upon the sale of the investment. The Fund’s ability to value its investment may also be impacted by </span><span>technological issues and/or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>All cash, receivables and current payables are carried on the Fund’s books at their fair value.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the event that application of the methods of valuation discussed above result in a price for a security which is deemed not </span><span>to be representative of the fair market value of such security, the security will be valued by, under the direction of or in </span><span>accordance with a method approved by BFA, the Fund’s valuation designee, as reflecting fair value. All other assets and </span><span>liabilities (including securities for which market quotations are not readily available) held by the Fund (including restricted </span><span>securities) are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by BFA pursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any assets and </span><span>liabilities which are denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate </span><span>a Fund’s NAV and the prices used in the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between a Fund’s </span><span>performance and the performance of the Underlying Index.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fair Value.</span><span> When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, the Fund’s investments </span><span>are valued at fair value (</span><span>“</span><span>Fair Value Assets</span><span>”</span><span>). Fair Value Assets are valued by BFA in accordance with the Valuation </span><span>Procedures. Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act, the Board of Trustees has designated BFA as the </span><span>valuation designee for the respective Funds for which it serves as investment adviser. BFA may reasonably conclude that a </span><span>market quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if, among other things, a security or other asset or liability does not </span><span>have a price source due to its complete lack of trading, if BFA believes a market quotation from a broker-dealer or other </span><span>source is unreliable (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, where it varies significantly from a recent trade, or no longer reflects the fair value of the security or </span><span>other asset or liability subsequent to the most recent market quotation), or where the security or other asset or liability is </span><span>only thinly traded or due to the occurrence of a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation. For this </span><span>purpose, a </span><span>“</span><span>significant event</span><span>”</span><span> is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment, that an event has </span><span>occurred after the close of trading for an asset or liability but prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s assets or liabilities, is </span><span>likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or closing market price of one or more assets held by, or </span><span>liabilities of, the Fund. On any day the NYSE is open and a foreign market or the primary exchange on which a foreign asset or </span><span>liability is traded is closed, such asset or liability will be valued using the prior day’s price, provided that BFA is not aware of </span><span>any significant event or other information that would cause such price to no longer reflect the fair value of the asset or </span><span>liability, in which case such asset or liability would be treated as a Fair Value Asset.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BFA’s Rule 2a-5 Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving methodologies by investment type and significant </span><span>inputs used in the fair valuation of Fund assets or liabilities. In addition, the Fund’s accounting agent assists BFA by </span><span>periodically endeavoring to confirm the prices it receives from all third-party pricing services, index providers and broker-dealers</span><span> and regularly evaluating the values assigned to the securities and other assets and liabilities of the Fund. The pricing </span><span>of all Fair Value Assets is subsequently reported to the Board or a committee thereof.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When determining the price for a Fair Value Asset, BFA will seek to determine the price that the Fund might reasonably </span><span>expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or liability in an arm’s-length transaction on the date on which the asset </span><span>or liability is being valued, and does not seek to determine the price the Fund might reasonably expect to receive for selling </span><span>an asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. Fair value determinations will be based upon all </span><span>available factors that BFA deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be based on analytical values determined </span><span>by BFA using proprietary or third-party valuation models.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>52</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. When determining the fair value of an </span><span>investment, one or more fair value methodologies may be used (depending on certain factors, including the asset type). For </span><span>example, the investment may be initially priced based on the original cost of the investment or, alternatively, using proprietary </span><span>or third-party models that may rely upon one or more unobservable inputs. Prices of actual, executed or historical </span><span>transactions in the relevant investment (or comparable instruments) or, where appropriate, an appraisal by a third-party </span><span>experienced in the valuation of similar instruments, may also be used as a basis for establishing the fair value of an </span><span>investment.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could </span><span>have been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used in determining the Fund’s NAV. As a result, the </span><span>Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a holding or holdings are valued at fair value, may have the </span><span>effect of diluting or increasing the economic interest of existing shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund’s annual audited financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally </span><span>accepted in the United States of America (</span><span>“</span><span>US GAAP</span><span>”</span><span>), follow the requirements for valuation set forth in Financial </span><span>Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, </span><span>“</span><span>Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>ASC 820</span><span>”</span><span>), which defines and establishes a framework for measuring fair value under US GAAP and expands financial </span><span>statement disclosure requirements relating to fair value measurements.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Generally, ASC 820 and other accounting rules applicable to funds and various assets in which they invest are evolving. Such </span><span>changes may adversely affect the Fund. For example, the evolution of rules governing the determination of the fair market </span><span>value of assets or liabilities, to the extent such rules become more stringent, would tend to increase the cost and/or reduce </span><span>the availability of third-party determinations of fair market value. This may in turn increase the costs associated with selling </span><span>assets or affect their liquidity due to the Fund’s inability to obtain a third-party determination of fair market value.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Brokerage Transactions</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Subject to policies established by the Board, BFA is primarily responsible for the execution of the Fund’s portfolio transactions </span><span>and the allocation of brokerage. BFA does not execute transactions through any particular broker or dealer, but seeks to </span><span>obtain the best net results for the Fund, taking into account such factors as price (including the applicable brokerage </span><span>commission or dealer spread), size of order, difficulty of execution, operational facilities of the firm and the firm’s risk and skill </span><span>in positioning blocks of securities. While BFA generally seeks reasonable trade execution costs, the Fund does not necessarily </span><span>pay the lowest spread or commission available, and payment of the lowest commission or spread is not necessarily </span><span>consistent with obtaining the best price and execution in particular transactions. Subject to applicable legal requirements, </span><span>BFA may select a broker based partly upon brokerage or research services provided to BFA and its clients, including the Fund. </span><span>In return for such services, BFA may cause the Fund to pay a higher commission than other brokers would charge if BFA </span><span>determines in good faith that the commission is reasonable in relation to the services provided.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In selecting brokers or dealers to execute portfolio transactions, BFA seeks to obtain the best price and most favorable </span><span>execution for the Fund and may take into account a variety of factors including: (i) the size, nature and character of the </span><span>security or instrument being traded and the markets in which it is purchased or sold; (ii) the desired timing of the </span><span>transaction; (iii) BFA’s knowledge of the expected commission rates and spreads currently available; (iv) the activity existing </span><span>and expected in the market for the particular security or instrument, including any anticipated execution difficulties; (v) the </span><span>full range of brokerage services provided; (vi) the broker’s or dealer’s capital; (vii) the quality of research and research </span><span>services provided; (viii) the reasonableness of the commission, dealer spread or its equivalent for the specific transaction; and </span><span>(ix) BFA’s knowledge of any actual or apparent operational problems of a broker or dealer. Brokers may also be selected </span><span>because of their ability to handle special or difficult executions, such as may be involved in large block trades, thinly traded </span><span>securities, or other circumstances.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act (</span><span>“</span><span>Section 28(e)</span><span>”</span><span>) permits a U.S. investment adviser, under certain circumstances, to cause an </span><span>account to pay a broker or dealer a commission for effecting a transaction in securities that exceeds the amount another </span><span>broker or dealer would have charged for effecting the same transaction in recognition of the value of brokerage and research </span><span>services provided by that broker or dealer. This includes commissions paid on riskless principal transactions in securities </span><span>under certain conditions.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>53</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>From time to time, the Fund may purchase new issues of securities in a fixed price offering. In these situations, the broker </span><span>may be a member of the selling group that will, in addition to selling securities, provide BFA with research services. FINRA has </span><span>adopted rules expressly permitting these types of arrangements under certain circumstances. Generally, the broker will </span><span>provide research </span><span>“</span><span>credits</span><span>”</span><span> in these situations at a rate that is higher than that available for typical secondary market </span><span>transactions. These arrangements may not fall within the safe harbor of Section 28(e).</span></div> <div> <div><span>OTC issues, including most fixed-income securities such as corporate debt and U.S. Government securities, are normally </span><span>traded on a </span><span>“</span><span>net</span><span>”</span><span> basis without a stated commission, through dealers acting for their own account and not as brokers. The </span><span>Fund will primarily engage in transactions with these dealers or deal directly with the issuer unless a better price or execution </span><span>could be obtained by using a broker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect to both foreign and domestic securities will generally </span><span>include a </span><span>“</span><span>spread,</span><span>”</span><span> which is the difference between the prices at which the dealer is willing to purchase and sell the specific </span><span>security at the time, and includes the dealer’s normal profit.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Under the 1940 Act, persons affiliated with the Fund and persons who are affiliated with such affiliated persons are </span><span>prohibited from dealing with the Fund as principal in the purchase and sale of securities unless a permissive order allowing </span><span>such transactions is obtained from the SEC. Since transactions in the OTC market usually involve transactions with the </span><span>dealers acting as principal for their own accounts, the Fund will not deal with affiliated persons and affiliated persons of such </span><span>affiliated persons in connection with such transactions. The Fund will not purchase securities during the existence of any </span><span>underwriting or selling group relating to such securities of which BFA, BRIL or any affiliated person (as defined in the 1940 </span><span>Act) thereof is a member except pursuant to procedures adopted by the Board in accordance with Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 </span><span>Act.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Purchases of money market instruments by the Fund are made from dealers, underwriters and issuers. The Fund does not </span><span>currently expect to incur any brokerage commission expense on such transactions because money market instruments are </span><span>generally traded on a </span><span>“</span><span>net</span><span>”</span><span> basis with dealers acting as principal for their own accounts without a stated commission. The </span><span>price of the security, however, usually includes a profit to the dealer.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BFA may, from time to time, effect trades on behalf of and for the account of the Fund with brokers or dealers that are </span><span>affiliated with BFA, in conformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under these provisions, </span><span>any commissions paid to affiliated brokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by </span><span>other brokers or dealers in comparable transactions.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Securities purchased in underwritten offerings include a fixed amount of compensation to the underwriter, generally referred </span><span>to as the underwriter’s concession or discount. When securities are purchased or sold directly from or to an issuer, no </span><span>commissions or discounts are paid.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investment decisions for the Fund and for other investment accounts managed by BFA and the other Affiliates are made </span><span>independently of each other in light of differing conditions. A variety of factors will be considered in making investment </span><span>allocations. These factors include: (i) investment objectives or strategies for particular accounts, including sector, industry, </span><span>country or region and capitalization weightings; (ii) tax considerations of an account; (iii) risk or investment concentration </span><span>parameters for an account; (iv) supply or demand for a security at a given price level; (v) size of available investment; (vi) </span><span>cash availability and liquidity requirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory restrictions; (viii) minimum investment size of an </span><span>account; (ix) relative size of account; and (x) such other factors as may be approved by BlackRock’s general counsel. </span><span>Moreover, investments may not be allocated to one client account over another based on any of the following considerations: </span><span>(i) to favor one client account at the expense of another; (ii) to generate higher fees paid by one client account over another </span><span>or to produce greater performance compensation to BlackRock; (iii) to develop or enhance a relationship with a client or </span><span>prospective client; (iv) to compensate a client for past services or benefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce future services </span><span>or benefits to be rendered to BlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize investment performance among different client </span><span>accounts. BFA and the other Affiliates may deal, trade and invest for their own respective accounts in the types of securities </span><span>in which the Fund may invest.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Initial public offerings (</span><span>“</span><span>IPOs</span><span>”</span><span>) of securities may be over-subscribed and subsequently trade at a premium in the secondary </span><span>market. When BFA is given an opportunity to invest in such an initial offering or </span><span>“</span><span>new</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>hot</span><span>”</span><span> issue, the supply of securities </span><span>available for client accounts is often less than the amount of securities the accounts would otherwise take. In order to </span><span>allocate these investments fairly and equitably among client accounts over time, each portfolio manager or a member of his </span><span>or her respective investment team will indicate to BFA’s trading desk their level of interest in a particular offering with respect </span><span>to eligible clients’ accounts for which that team is responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities will be identified as eligible for </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>54</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>particular client accounts that are managed by portfolio teams who have indicated interest in the offering based on market </span><span>capitalization of the issuer of the security and the investment mandate of the client account and in the case of international </span><span>equity securities, the country where the offering is taking place and the investment mandate of the client account. Generally, </span><span>shares received during the IPO will be allocated among participating client accounts within each investment mandate on a </span><span>pro rata</span><span> basis. This </span><span>pro rata</span><span> allocation may result in the Fund receiving less of a particular security than if pro-rating had not </span><span>occurred. All allocations of securities will be subject, where relevant, to share minimums established for accounts and </span><span>compliance constraints. In situations where supply is too limited to be allocated among all accounts for which the </span><span>investment is eligible, portfolio managers may rotate such investment opportunities among one or more accounts so long as </span><span>the rotation system provides for fair access for all client accounts over time. Other allocation methodologies that are </span><span>considered by BFA to be fair and equitable to clients may be used as well.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Because different accounts may have differing investment objectives and policies, BFA may buy and sell the same securities </span><span>at the same time for different clients based on the particular investment objective, guidelines and strategies of those </span><span>accounts. For example, BFA may decide that it may be entirely appropriate for a growth fund to sell a security at the same </span><span>time a value fund is buying that security. To the extent that transactions on behalf of more than one client of BFA or the other </span><span>Affiliates during the same period increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, </span><span>there may be an adverse effect on price. For example, sales of a security by BlackRock on behalf of one or more of its clients </span><span>may decrease the market price of such security, adversely impacting other BlackRock clients that still hold the security. If </span><span>purchases or sales of securities arise for consideration at or about the same time that would involve the Fund or other clients </span><span>or funds for which BFA or another Affiliate act as investment manager, transactions in such securities will be made, insofar as </span><span>feasible, for the respective funds and clients in a manner deemed equitable to all.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In certain instances, BFA may find it efficient for purposes of seeking to obtain best execution, to aggregate or </span><span>“</span><span>bunch</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>certain contemporaneous purchases or sale orders of its advisory accounts and advisory accounts of affiliates. In general, all </span><span>contemporaneous trades for client accounts under management by the same portfolio manager or investment team will be </span><span>bunched in a single order if the trader believes the bunched trade would provide each client with an opportunity to achieve a </span><span>more favorable execution at a potentially lower execution cost. The costs associated with a bunched order will be shared </span><span>pro </span><span>rata</span><span> among the clients in the bunched order. Generally, if an order for a particular portfolio manager or management team is </span><span>filled at several different prices through multiple trades, all accounts participating in the order will receive the average price </span><span>(except in the case of certain international markets where average pricing is not permitted). While in some cases this practice </span><span>could have a detrimental effect upon the price or value of the security as far as the Fund is concerned, in other cases it could </span><span>be beneficial to the Fund. Transactions effected by BFA or the other Affiliates on behalf of more than one of its clients during </span><span>the same period may increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, causing an </span><span>adverse effect on price. The trader will give the bunched order to the broker-dealer that the trader has identified as being able </span><span>to provide the best execution of the order. Orders for purchase or sale of securities will be placed within a reasonable amount </span><span>of time of the order receipt and bunched orders will be kept bunched only long enough to execute the order.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The table below sets forth the brokerage commissions paid by the Fund for the fiscal years noted. Any differences in </span><span>brokerage commissions paid by the Fund from year to year are</span><span> </span><span>principally due to increases or decreases in the Fund’s assets </span><span>over those periods</span><span> </span><span>or the magnitude of changes to the components of a Fund's Underlying Index:</span></div> </div> <div><span> </span></div> <div> <div> </div> </div> <div>

Although the shares are not automatically redeemable upon the occurrence of any specific event, the Declaration of </span><span>Trust provides that the Board will have the unrestricted power to alter the number of shares in a Creation Unit. Therefore, in </span><span>the event of a termination of the Trust or a fund, the Board, in its sole discretion, could determine to permit the shares to be </span><span>redeemable in aggregations smaller than Creation Units or to be individually redeemable. In such circumstance, the Trust or a </span><span>fund may make redemptions in-kind, for cash or for a combination of cash or securities. Further, in the event of a termination </span><span>of the Trust or a fund, the Trust or a fund might elect to pay cash redemptions to all shareholders, with an in-kind election for </span><span>shareholders owning in excess of a certain stated minimum amount.</span></div> <div> <div><span>DTC as Securities Depository for Shares of the Fund. </span><span> </span><span>Shares of the Fund are represented by securities registered in the </span><span>name of DTC or its nominee and deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>DTC was created in 1973 to enable electronic movement of securities between its participants (</span><span>“</span><span>DTC Participants</span><span>”</span><span>), and </span><span>NSCC was established in 1976 to provide a single settlement system for securities clearing and to serve as central </span><span>counterparty for securities trades among DTC Participants. In 1999, DTC and NSCC were consolidated within The Depository </span><span>Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (</span><span>“</span><span>DTCC</span><span>”</span><span>) and became wholly-owned subsidiaries of DTCC. The common stock of DTCC is </span><span>owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and FINRA, through subsidiaries, hold preferred shares in DTCC that provide them </span><span>with the right to elect one member each to the DTCC board of directors. Access to the DTC system is available to entities, </span><span>such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies, that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC </span><span>Participant, either directly or indirectly (</span><span>“</span><span>Indirect Participants</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Beneficial ownership of shares is limited to DTC Participants, Indirect Participants and persons holding interests through DTC </span><span>Participants and Indirect Participants.

Beneficial Owners will receive from or through the DTC </span><span>Participant a written confirmation relating to their purchase of shares. The laws of some jurisdictions may require that certain </span><span>purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. Such laws may impair the ability of certain </span><span>investors to acquire beneficial interests in shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Conveyance of all notices, statements and other communications to Beneficial Owners is effected as follows. Pursuant to the </span><span>Depositary Agreement between the Trust and DTC, DTC is required to make available to the Trust upon request and for a fee </span><span>to be charged to the Trust a listing of the shares of the Fund held by each DTC Participant. The Trust shall inquire of each </span><span>such DTC Participant as to the number of Beneficial Owners holding shares, directly or indirectly, through such DTC </span><span>Participant. The Trust shall provide each such DTC Participant with copies of such notice, statement or other communication, </span><span>in such form, number and at such place as such DTC Participant may reasonably request, in order that such notice, </span><span>statement or communication may be transmitted by such DTC Participant, directly or indirectly, to such Beneficial Owners. In </span><span>addition, the Trust shall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair and reasonable amount as reimbursement for the expenses </span><span>attendant to such transmittal, all subject to applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>57</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The Fund is open for business any day on which the </span><span>Listing Exchange on which the Fund is listed for trading is open for business. As of the date of this SAI, the Listing Exchange </span><span>observes the following holidays, as observed: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Good Friday, </span><span>Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fund Deposit.</span><span>  </span><span>The consideration for purchase of Creation Units of the Fund generally consists of Deposit Securities and the </span><span>Cash Component computed as described below. Together, the Deposit Securities and the Cash Component constitute the </span><span>“</span><span>Fund Deposit,</span><span>”</span><span> which, when combined with the Fund's portfolio securities is designed to generate performance that has a </span><span>collective investment profile similar to that of the Underlying Index. The Fund Deposit represents the minimum initial and </span><span>subsequent investment amount for a Creation Unit of the Fund. Such Fund Deposit is applicable, subject to any adjustments </span><span>as described below, to purchases of Creation Units of shares of the Fund until such time as the next-announced Fund Deposit </span><span>is made available.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Cash Component is an amount equal to the difference between the NAV of the shares (per Creation Unit) and the </span><span>“</span><span>Deposit Amount,</span><span>”</span><span> which is an amount equal to the market value of the Deposit Securities, and serves to compensate for any </span><span>differences between the NAV per Creation Unit and the Deposit Amount. Payment of any stamp duty or other similar fees and </span><span>expenses payable upon transfer of beneficial ownership of the Deposit Securities are the sole responsibility of the Authorized </span><span>Participant purchasing the Creation Unit.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The identity and number of shares of the Deposit Securities change pursuant to changes in the composition of the Fund's </span><span>portfolio and as rebalancing adjustments and corporate action events are reflected from time to time by BFA with a view to </span><span>the investment objective of the Fund. The composition of the Deposit Securities may also change in response to adjustments </span><span>to the weighting or composition of the component securities constituting the Underlying Index.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund Deposit may also be modified to minimize the Cash Component by redistributing the cash to the Deposit Securities </span><span>portion of the Fund Deposit through </span><span>“</span><span>systematic rounding.</span><span>”</span><span> The rounding methodology </span><span>“</span><span>rounds up</span><span>”</span><span> position sizes of </span><span>securities in the Deposit Securities (which in turn reduces the cash portion). However, the methodology limits the maximum </span><span>allowed percentage change in weight and share quantity of any given security in the Fund Deposit.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fund Deposits may also be modified to position a fund towards a forward index rebalance to reflect revisions that account for </span><span>index additions, deletions, and re-weights.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Trust may, in its sole discretion, substitute a </span><span>“</span><span>cash in lieu</span><span>”</span><span> amount to be added to the Cash Component to replace any </span><span>Deposit Security in certain circumstances, including: (i) when instruments are not available in sufficient quantity for delivery; </span><span>(ii) when instruments are not eligible for transfer through DTC or the clearing process (as discussed below); (iii) when </span><span>instruments that the Authorized Participant (or an investor on whose behalf the Authorized Participant is acting) are not able </span><span>to be traded due to a trading restriction; (iv) when delivery of the Deposit Security by the Authorized Participant (or by an </span><span>investor on whose behalf the Authorized Participant is acting) would be restricted under applicable securities or other local </span><span>laws; (v) in connection with distribution payments to be made by the Fund; or (vi) in certain other situations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Cash Purchase Method. </span><span> </span><span>Although the Trust does not generally permit partial or full cash purchases of Creation Units of its </span><span>funds, when partial or full cash purchases of Creation Units are available or specified for the Fund, they will be effected in </span><span>essentially the same manner as in-kind purchases thereof. In the case of a partial or full cash purchase, the Authorized </span><span>Participant must pay the cash equivalent of the Deposit Securities it would otherwise be required to provide through an in-kind</span><span> purchase, plus the same Cash Component required to be paid by an in-kind purchaser.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Procedures for Creation of Creation Units.</span><span>  </span><span>To be eligible to place orders with the Distributor and to create a Creation Unit of </span><span>the Fund, an entity must be: (i) a </span><span>“</span><span>Participating Party,</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>i.e</span><span>., a broker-dealer or other participant in the clearing process through </span><span>the Continuous Net Settlement System of the NSCC (the </span><span>“</span><span>Clearing Process</span><span>”</span><span>), a clearing agency that is registered with the </span><span>SEC, or (ii) a DTC Participant, and must have executed an agreement with the Distributor, with respect to creations and </span><span>redemptions of Creation Units (</span><span>“</span><span>Authorized Participant Agreement</span><span>”</span><span>) (discussed below).

Such Authorized Participant will agree, pursuant to the terms of such Authorized Participant Agreement and on </span><span>behalf of itself or any investor on whose behalf it will act, to certain conditions, including that such Authorized Participant will </span><span>make available in advance of each purchase of shares an amount of cash sufficient to pay the Cash Component, once the </span><span>NAV of a Creation Unit is next determined after receipt of the purchase order in proper form, together with the transaction </span><span>fees described below. An Authorized Participant, acting on behalf of an investor, may require the investor to enter into an </span><span>agreement with such Authorized Participant with respect to certain matters, including payment of the Cash Component. </span><span>Investors who are not Authorized Participants must make appropriate arrangements with an Authorized Participant. Investors </span><span>should be aware that their particular broker may not be a DTC Participant or may not have executed an Authorized </span><span>Participant Agreement and that orders to purchase Creation Units may have to be placed by the investor's broker through an </span><span>Authorized Participant. As a result, purchase orders placed through an Authorized Participant may result in additional </span><span>charges to such investor. The Trust does not expect to enter into an Authorized Participant Agreement with more than a </span><span>small number of DTC Participants. A list of current Authorized Participants may be obtained from the Distributor. The </span><span>Distributor has adopted guidelines regarding Authorized Participants’ transactions in Creation Units that are made available </span><span>to all Authorized Participants. These guidelines set forth the processes and standards for Authorized Participants to transact </span><span>with the Distributor and its agents in connection with creation and redemption transactions. In addition, the Distributor may </span><span>be appointed as the proxy of the Authorized Participant and may be granted a power of attorney under its Authorized </span><span>Participant Agreement.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Purchase Orders.</span><span>  </span><span> To initiate an order for a Creation Unit, an Authorized Participant must submit to the Distributor or its </span><span>agent an irrevocable order to purchase shares of the Fund, in proper form,</span><span> </span><span>generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any </span><span>Business Day to receive that day’s NAV. The Distributor or its agent will notify BFA and the custodian of such order. The </span><span>custodian will then provide such information to any appropriate sub-custodian. Procedures and requirements governing the </span><span>delivery of the Fund Deposit are set forth in the procedures handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time </span><span>to time. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements for a creation request to be </span><span>made through an Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current Authorized Participants </span><span>upon request. Those placing orders to purchase Creation Units through an Authorized Participant should allow sufficient time </span><span>to permit proper submission of the purchase order to the Distributor or its agent by the Cutoff Time (as defined below) on </span><span>such Business Day.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Authorized Participant must also make available on or before the contractual settlement date, by means satisfactory to </span><span>the Fund, immediately available or same day funds estimated by the Fund to be sufficient to pay the Cash Component next </span><span>determined after acceptance of the purchase order, together with the applicable purchase transaction fees. Those placing </span><span>orders should ascertain the deadline for cash transfers by contacting the operations department of the broker or depositary </span><span>institution effectuating the transfer of the Cash Component. This deadline is likely to be significantly earlier than the Cutoff </span><span>Time of the Fund. Investors should be aware that an Authorized Participant may require orders for purchases of shares placed </span><span>with it to be in the particular form required by the individual Authorized Participant.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Authorized Participant is responsible for any and all expenses and costs incurred by the Fund, including any applicable </span><span>cash amounts, in connection with any purchase order.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Timing of Submission of Purchase Orders.</span><span>  </span><span>An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable order to purchase shares </span><span>of the Fund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day in order to receive that day's NAV. Creation Orders </span><span>must be transmitted by an Authorized Participant in the form required by the Fund to the Distributor or its agent pursuant to </span><span>procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Economic or market disruptions or changes, or telephone or </span><span>other communication failure, may impede the ability to reach the Distributor or its agent or an Authorized Participant. The </span><span>Fund's deadline specified above for the submission of purchase orders is referred to as the Fund's </span><span>“</span><span>Cutoff Time.</span><span>”</span><span> The </span><span>Distributor or its agent, in their discretion, may permit the submission of such orders and requests by or through an </span><span>Authorized Participant at any time (including on days on which the Listing Exchange is not open for business) via </span><span>communication through the facilities of the Distributor's or its agent's proprietary website maintained for this purpose. </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>60</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

For example, the </span><span>Fund may reject or revoke a creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor or its agent if (i) the order is not in proper form; </span><span>(ii) the investor(s), upon obtaining the shares ordered, would own 80% or more of the currently outstanding shares of the </span><span>Fund; (iii) the Deposit Securities delivered do not conform to the identity and number of shares specified, as described above; </span><span>(iv) acceptance of the Deposit Securities is not legally required or would, in the opinion of counsel, be unlawful or have an </span><span>adverse effect on the Fund or its shareholders (</span><span>e.g</span><span>., jeopardize the Fund's tax status); or (v) circumstances outside the control </span><span>of the Fund, the Distributor or its agent and BFA make it impracticable to process purchase orders. The Distributor or its </span><span>agent shall notify a prospective purchaser of a Creation Unit and/or the Authorized Participant acting on behalf of such </span><span>purchaser of its rejection of such order. The Fund, JPMorgan, the sub-custodian and the Distributor or its agent are under no </span><span>duty, however, to give notification of any defects or irregularities in the delivery of Fund Deposits nor shall any of them incur </span><span>any liability for failure to give such notification.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Issuance of a Creation Unit.</span><span>  </span><span> Except as provided herein, a Creation Unit will not be issued until the transfer of good title to </span><span>the Fund of the Deposit Securities and the payment of the Cash Component have been completed. When the sub-custodian </span><span>has confirmed to the custodian that the securities included in the Fund Deposit (or the cash value thereof) have been </span><span>delivered to the account of the relevant sub-custodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor or its agent and BFA shall be </span><span>notified of such delivery and the Fund will issue and cause the delivery of the Creation Unit. Creation Units are generally </span><span>issued on a </span><span>“</span><span>T+2 basis</span><span>”</span><span> (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, two Business Days after trade date). The Fund reserves the right to settle Creation Unit </span><span>transactions on a basis other than T+2, including a shorter settlement period, if necessary or appropriate under the </span><span>circumstances and compliant with applicable law.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>To the extent contemplated by an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Distributor, the Fund will issue Creation Units </span><span>to such Authorized Participant, notwithstanding the fact that the corresponding Fund Deposits have not been received in </span><span>part or in whole, in reliance on the undertaking of the Authorized Participant to deliver the missing Deposit Securities as soon </span><span>as possible, which undertaking shall be secured by such Authorized Participant's delivery and maintenance of collateral as set </span><span>forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants. The Trust may use such collateral at any time to buy Deposit Securities for </span><span>the Fund.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A standard creation transaction fee is imposed to offset the transfer and other transaction costs associated with the issuance </span><span>of Creation Units. Under an ETF Services Agreement, the Fund has retained BRIL, an affiliate of BFA, to perform ETF Services. </span><span>BRIL will receive from an Authorized Participant a standard transaction fee on each creation order, which consists of (1) a fee </span><span>for providing the ETF Services (the </span><span>“</span><span>ETF Servicing Fee</span><span>”</span><span>) and (2) transfer, processing and other transaction costs charged by </span><span>the Fund custodian in connection with the issuance of Creation Units for such creation order (</span><span>“</span><span>Custody Transaction Costs</span><span>”</span><span>). </span><span>BRIL is entitled to retain the ETF Servicing Fee pursuant to the ETF Services Agreement, but BRIL will reimburse any Custody </span><span>Transaction Costs to the Fund custodian according to the amounts invoiced by such custodian.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The ETF Servicing Fee is a flat fee per order regardless of the number of Creation Units being purchased, which amount will </span><span>vary among different Funds based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the order and the types of securities or </span><span>instruments included in a Fund’s Creation Basket, among other variables. The actual Custody Transaction Costs vary per </span><span>order based on the number of trades, underlying markets and settlement locations associated with the issuance of a Creation </span><span>Unit. The following table sets forth the actual creation transaction fee that was charged on June 30, 2023. The actual fee that </span><span>was or would have been charged to an Authorized Participant in connection with a creation order will vary over time </span><span>depending on the factors discussed above, and may be higher than the fee set forth below. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In order to defray transaction expenses for the Fund and protect against possible shareholder dilution, if a creation </span><span>transaction consists solely or partially of cash, the Authorized Participant may also be required to cover (up to the maximum </span><span>amount shown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution and other costs and expenses related to the </span><span>execution of trades resulting from such transaction (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of </span><span>transaction costs based on historical data or other inputs, at BlackRock’s discretion, and may include part or all of the spread </span><span>between the expected bid and offer side of the market and anticipated market impact).

The Fund will not redeem shares in amounts less than Creation Units. There can be no assurance, however, </span><span>that there will be sufficient liquidity in the secondary market at any time to permit assembly of a Creation Unit. Investors </span><span>should expect to incur brokerage and other costs in connection with assembling a sufficient number of shares</span><span> </span><span>to constitute a </span><span>Creation Unit that could be redeemed by an Authorized Participant.

Please see the </span><span>Cash Redemption Method</span><span> </span><span>section below and the following discussion summarizing the in-kind method for further information on redeeming Creation </span><span>Units of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund publishes the designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be </span><span>substituted) that will be applicable to redemption requests received in proper form (as defined below) on that day (</span><span>“</span><span>Fund </span><span>Securities</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>Redemption Basket</span><span>”</span><span>), and an amount of cash (the </span><span>“</span><span>Cash Amount,</span><span>”</span><span> as described below) in order to effect </span><span>redemptions of Creation Units of the Fund. Such Fund Securities and Cash Amount will remain in effect until such time as the </span><span>next announced composition of the Fund Securities and Cash Amount is made available.

Fund Securities received on redemption may not be identical to </span><span>Deposit Securities that are applicable to creations of Creation Units. Procedures and requirements governing redemption </span><span>transactions are set forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time to time.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Unless cash redemptions are available or specified for the Fund, the redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit generally </span><span>consist of Fund Securities, plus the Cash Amount, which is an amount equal to the difference between the NAV of the shares </span><span>being redeemed, as next determined after the receipt of a redemption request in proper form, and the value of Fund </span><span>Securities, less a redemption transaction fee (as described below).</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Trust may, in its sole discretion, substitute a </span><span>“</span><span>cash in lieu</span><span>”</span><span> amount to replace any Fund Security in certain circumstances, </span><span>including: (i) when the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant (or to an investor on whose behalf the </span><span>Authorized Participant is acting) would be restricted under applicable securities or other local laws or due to a trading </span><span>restriction; (ii) when the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in the disposition of the Fund </span><span>Security by the Authorized Participant due to restrictions under applicable securities or other local laws; (iii) when the delivery </span><span>of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in unfavorable tax treatment; (iv) when a Fund Security cannot </span><span>be settled or otherwise delivered in time to facilitate an in-kind redemption; or (v) in certain other situations. The amount of </span><span>cash paid out in such cases will be equivalent to the value of the substituted security listed as a Fund Security. In the event </span><span>that the Fund Securities have a value greater than the NAV of the shares, a compensating cash payment equal to the </span><span>difference is required to be made by or through an Authorized Participant by the redeeming shareholder. The Fund generally </span><span>redeems Creation Units for Fund Securities, but the Fund reserves the right to utilize a cash option for redemption of Creation </span><span>Units. The Fund may, in its sole discretion, provide such redeeming Authorized Participant a portfolio of securities that differs </span><span>from the exact composition of the Fund Securities, but does not differ in NAV. The Redemption Basket may also be modified </span><span>to minimize the Cash Component by redistributing the cash to the Fund Securities portion of the Redemption Basket through </span><span>systematically rounding. The rounding methodology allows position sizes of securities in the Fund Securities to be </span><span>“</span><span>rounded </span><span>up,</span><span>”</span><span> while limiting the maximum allowed percentage change in weight and share quantity of any given security in the </span><span>Redemption Basket. Redemption Baskets may also be modified to position a fund towards a forward index rebalance to </span><span>reflect revisions that account for index additions, deletions, and re-weights.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Cash Redemption Method.</span><span>  </span><span> Although the Trust does not generally permit partial or full cash redemptions of Creation Units </span><span>of its funds, when partial or full cash redemptions of Creation Units are available or specified for the Fund, they will be </span><span>effected in essentially the same manner as in-kind redemptions thereof. In the case of partial or full cash redemption, the </span><span>Authorized Participant receives the cash equivalent of the Fund Securities it would otherwise receive through an in-kind </span><span>redemption, plus the same Cash Amount to be paid to an in-kind redeemer.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Costs Associated with Redemption Transactions.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A standard redemption transaction fee is imposed to offset transfer and other transaction costs that may be incurred by the </span><span>Fund.

BRIL will receive from an Authorized Participant a standard transaction fee on each redemption order, </span><span>which consists of (1) the ETF Servicing Fee and (2) Custody Transaction Costs. BRIL is entitled to retain the ETF Servicing Fee </span><span>pursuant to the ETF Services Agreement, but BRIL will reimburse any Custody Transaction Costs to the Fund custodian </span><span>according to the amounts invoiced by such custodian.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The ETF Servicing Fee is a flat fee per order regardless of the number of Creation Units being redeemed, which amount will </span><span>vary among different Funds based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the order and the types of securities or </span><span>instruments included in a Fund’s Redemption Basket, among other variables.

On days </span><span>when the Listing Exchange closes earlier than normal, the Fund may require orders to redeem Creation Units to be placed </span><span>earlier that day.

The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current Authorized </span><span>Participants upon request.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Authorized Participant must transmit the request for redemption in the form required by the Fund to the Distributor or its </span><span>agent in accordance with procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Investors should be aware that their </span><span>particular broker may not have executed an Authorized Participant Agreement and that, therefore, requests to redeem </span><span>Creation Units may have to be placed by the investor's broker through an Authorized Participant who has executed an </span><span>Authorized Participant Agreement. At any time, only a limited number of broker-dealers will have an Authorized Participant </span><span>Agreement in effect. Investors making a redemption request should be aware that such request must be in the form specified </span><span>by such Authorized Participant. Investors making a request to redeem Creation Units should allow sufficient time to permit </span><span>proper submission of the request by an Authorized Participant and transfer of the shares to the Fund's transfer agent; such </span><span>investors should allow for the additional time that may be required to effect redemptions through their banks, brokers or </span><span>other financial intermediaries if such intermediaries are not Authorized Participants.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A redemption request is considered to be in </span><span>“</span><span>proper form</span><span>”</span><span> if: (i) an Authorized Participant has transferred or caused to be </span><span>transferred to the Fund's transfer agent the Creation Unit redeemed through the book-entry system of DTC so as to be </span><span>effective by the Listing Exchange closing time on any Business Day on which the redemption request is submitted; (ii) a </span><span>request in form satisfactory to the Fund is received by the Distributor or its agent from the Authorized Participant on behalf of </span><span>itself or another redeeming investor within the time periods specified above; and (iii) all other procedures set forth in the </span><span>Authorized Participant Agreement are properly followed.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Upon receiving a redemption request, the Distributor or its agent shall notify the Fund and the Fund's transfer agent of such </span><span>redemption request.

If the Fund includes a foreign investment in its basket, and if a local market holiday, or series of </span><span>consecutive holidays, or the extended delivery cycles for transferring foreign investments to redeeming Authorized </span><span>Participants prevents timely delivery of the foreign investment in response to a redemption request, the Fund may delay </span><span>delivery of the foreign investment more than seven days if the Fund delivers the foreign investment as soon as practicable, </span><span>but in no event later than 15 days.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>To the extent contemplated by an Authorized Participant's agreement with the Distributor or its agent, in the event an </span><span>Authorized Participant has submitted a redemption request in proper form but is unable to transfer all or part of the Creation </span><span>Unit to be redeemed to the Fund, at or prior to the time specified by the Fund or its custodian on the Business Day after the </span><span>date of submission of such redemption request, the Distributor or its agent will accept the redemption request in reliance on </span><span>the undertaking by the Authorized Participant to deliver the missing shares as soon as possible. Such undertaking shall be </span><span>secured by the Authorized Participant's delivery and maintenance of collateral as set forth in the handbook for Authorized </span><span>Participants. Such collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by the Fund or its custodian on the Business </span><span>Day after the date of submission of such redemption request and shall be held by JPMorgan and marked-to-market daily. The </span><span>fees of JPMorgan and any sub-custodians in respect of the delivery, maintenance and redelivery of the collateral shall be </span><span>payable by the Authorized Participant. The Authorized Participant Agreement permits the Fund to acquire shares of the Fund </span><span>at any time and subjects the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the aggregate of the cost to the Fund </span><span>of purchasing such shares, plus the value of the Cash Amount, and the value of the collateral together with liability for related </span><span>brokerage and other charges.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The right of redemption may be suspended or the date of payment postponed with respect to the Fund: (i) for any period </span><span>during which the Listing Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday closings); (ii) for any period during </span><span>which trading on the Listing Exchange is suspended or restricted; (iii) for any period during which an emergency exists as a </span><span>result of which disposal of the shares of the Fund's portfolio securities or determination of its NAV is not reasonably </span><span>practicable; or (iv) in such other circumstance as is permitted by the SEC.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Custom Baskets.</span><span>  </span><span>Creation and Redemption baskets may differ and the Fund may accept </span><span>“</span><span>custom baskets.</span><span>”</span><span> A custom basket </span><span>may include any of the following: (i) a basket that is composed of a non-representative selection of the Fund's portfolio </span><span>holdings; (ii) a representative basket that is different from the initial basket used in transactions on the same business day; or </span><span>(iii) a basket that contains bespoke cash substitutions for a single Authorized Participant. The Fund has adopted policies and </span><span>procedures that govern the construction and acceptance of baskets, including heightened requirements for certain types of </span><span>custom baskets. Such policies and procedures provide the parameters for the construction and acceptance of custom </span><span>baskets that are in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders, establish processes for revisions to, or deviations from, </span><span>such parameters, and specify the titles and roles of the employees of BFA who are required to review each custom basket for </span><span>compliance with those parameters. In addition, when constructing custom baskets for redemptions, the tax efficiency of the </span><span>Fund may be taken into account. The policies and procedures distinguish among different types of custom baskets that may </span><span>be used for the Fund and impose different requirements for different types of custom baskets in order to seek to mitigate </span><span>against potential risks of conflicts and/or overreaching by an Authorized Participant. BlackRock has established a governance </span><span>process to oversee basket compliance for the Fund, as set forth in the Fund's policies and procedures.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxation on Creations and Redemptions of Creation Units.</span><span>  </span><span> An Authorized Participant generally will recognize either gain or </span><span>loss upon the exchange of Deposit Securities for Creation Units. This gain or loss is calculated by taking the market value of </span><span>the Creation Units purchased over the Authorized Participant’s aggregate basis in the Deposit Securities exchanged therefor. </span><span>However, the IRS may apply the wash sales rules to determine that any loss realized upon the exchange of Deposit Securities </span><span>for Creation Units is not currently deductible. Authorized Participants should consult their own tax advisors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Current U.S. federal income tax laws dictate that capital gain or loss realized from the redemption of Creation Units will </span><span>generally create long-term capital gain or loss if the Authorized Participant holds the Creation Units for more than one year, </span><span>or short-term capital gain or loss if the Creation Units were held for one year or less, if the Creation Units are held as capital </span><span>assets.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxes</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>The following is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations regarding the purchase, ownership and </span><span>disposition of shares of the Fund.

To qualify for treatment as a RIC, the Fund must annually distribute at least 90% </span><span>of its investment company taxable income (which includes dividends, interest and net short-term capital gains) and meet </span><span>several other requirements. Among such other requirements are the following: (i) at least 90% of the Fund’s annual gross </span><span>income must be derived from dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans, gains from the sale or other </span><span>disposition of stock or securities or non-U.S. currencies, other income (including, but not limited to, gains from options, </span><span>futures or forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies, and net </span><span>income derived from interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships (</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> partnerships that are traded on an established </span><span>securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than partnerships that derive at least 90% of their income from </span><span>interest, dividends, capital gains and other traditionally permitted RIC income); and (ii) at the close of each quarter of the </span><span>Fund's taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the market value of the Fund’s total assets must be represented by cash and cash </span><span>items, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs and other securities, with such other securities limited for purposes </span><span>of this calculation in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of the Fund’s assets and not </span><span>greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (b) not more than 25% of the value of the Fund's </span><span>total assets may be invested in the securities (other than U.S. government securities or the securities of other RICs) of any </span><span>one issuer, of two or more issuers of which 20% or more of the voting stock is held by the Fund and that are engaged in the </span><span>same or similar trades or businesses or related trades or businesses, or the securities of one or more qualified publicly-traded </span><span>partnerships.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund may be able to cure a failure to derive at least 90% of its income from the sources specified above or a failure to </span><span>diversify its holdings in the manner described above by paying a tax</span><span> </span><span>and/or by disposing of certain assets. If, in any taxable </span><span>year, the Fund fails one of these tests and does not timely cure the failure, the Fund will be taxed in the same manner as an </span><span>ordinary corporation and distributions to its shareholders will not be deductible by the Fund in computing its taxable income.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Although, in general, the passive loss rules of the Internal Revenue Code do not apply to RICs, such rules do apply to a RIC </span><span>with respect to items attributable to interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships. The Fund's investments in </span><span>partnerships, including in qualified publicly-traded partnerships, may result in the Fund being subject to state, local, or non-U.S.</span><span> income, franchise or withholding tax liabilities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxation of RICs. </span><span> </span><span>As a RIC, the Fund will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of its taxable investment </span><span>income and capital gains that it distributes to its shareholders, provided that it satisfies a minimum distribution requirement. </span><span>To satisfy the minimum distribution requirement, the Fund must distribute to its shareholders at least the sum of (i) 90% of </span><span>its </span><span>“</span><span>investment company taxable income</span><span>”</span><span> (</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> income other than its net realized long-term capital gain over its net realized </span><span>short-term capital loss), plus or minus certain adjustments, and (ii) 90% of its net tax-exempt income for the taxable year. </span><span>The Fund will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates on any taxable income or gains that it does not distribute to </span><span>its shareholders. If the Fund fails to qualify for any taxable year as a RIC or fails to meet the distribution requirement, all of its </span><span>taxable income will be subject to tax at regular corporate income tax rates without any deduction for distributions to </span><span>shareholders, and such distributions generally will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends to the extent of the </span><span>Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits. In such event, distributions to individuals should be eligible to be </span><span>treated as qualified dividend income and distributions to corporate shareholders generally should be eligible for the dividends </span><span>received deduction. Although the Fund intends to distribute substantially all of its net investment income and its capital gains </span><span>for each taxable year, the Fund may decide to retain a portion of its income or gains if the Fund determines that doing so is in </span><span>the interest of its shareholders. The Fund will be subject to U.S. federal income taxation to the extent any such income or </span><span>gains are not distributed.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Excise Tax.</span><span>  </span><span>The Fund will be subject to a 4% excise tax on certain undistributed income if it does not distribute to its </span><span>shareholders in each calendar year at least 98% of its ordinary income for the calendar year plus at least 98.2% of its capital </span><span>gain net income for the 12 months ended October 31 of such year. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital </span><span>gain net income retained by the Fund that is subject to corporate income tax will be considered to have been distributed by </span><span>year-end. In addition, the minimum amounts that must be distributed in any year to avoid the excise tax will be increased or </span><span>decreased to reflect any underdistribution or overdistribution, as the case may be, from the previous year. The Fund intends </span><span>to declare and distribute dividends and distributions in the amounts and at the times necessary to avoid the application of </span><span>this 4% excise tax.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Net Capital Loss Carryforwards. </span><span> </span><span>Net capital loss carryforwards may be applied against any net realized capital gains in each </span><span>succeeding year, until they have been reduced to zero.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the event that the Fund were to experience an ownership change as defined under the Internal Revenue Code, the loss </span><span>carryforwards and other favorable tax attributes of the Fund, if any, may be subject to limitation.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As of March 31, 2023, the tax year-end of the Fund, the Fund had non-expiring capital loss carryforwards in the amount of </span><span>$7,049,586,471 available to offset future realized capital gains.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxation of U.S. Shareholders.</span><span>  </span><span> Dividends and other distributions by the Fund are generally treated under the Internal </span><span>Revenue Code as received by the shareholders at the time the dividend or distribution is made. However, any dividend or </span><span>distribution declared by the Fund in October, November or December of any calendar year and payable to shareholders of </span><span>record on a specified date in such a month shall be deemed to have been received by each shareholder on December 31 of </span><span>such calendar year and to have been paid by the Fund not later than such December 31, provided such dividend is actually </span><span>paid by the Fund during January of the following calendar year.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund intends to distribute annually to its shareholders substantially all of its investment company taxable income and </span><span>any net realized long-term capital gains in excess of net realized short-term capital losses (including any capital loss </span><span>carryovers). However, if the Fund retains for investment an amount equal to all or a portion of its net long-term capital gains </span><span>in excess of its net short-term capital losses (including any capital loss carryovers), it will be subject to a corporate tax (at a </span><span>flat rate of 21%) on the amount retained. In that event, the Fund will designate such retained amounts as undistributed </span><span>capital gains in a notice to its shareholders who (a) will be required to include in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, </span><span>as long-term capital gains, their proportionate shares of the undistributed amount, (b) will be entitled to credit their </span><span>proportionate shares of the tax paid by the Fund on the undistributed amount against their U.S. federal income tax liabilities, </span><span>if any, and to claim refunds to the extent their credits exceed their liabilities, if any, and (c) will be entitled to increase their tax </span><span>basis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in their shares by an amount equal to the excess of the amount in clause (a) over </span><span>the amount in clause (b). Organizations or persons not subject to U.S. federal income tax on such capital gains will be </span><span>entitled to a refund of their </span><span>pro rata</span><span> share of such taxes paid by the Fund upon filing appropriate returns or claims for refund </span><span>with the IRS.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Distributions of net realized long-term capital gains, if any, that the Fund reports as capital gains dividends are taxable as </span><span>long-term capital gains, whether paid in cash or in shares and regardless of how long a shareholder has held shares of the </span><span>Fund. All other dividends of the Fund (including dividends from short-term capital gains) from its current and accumulated </span><span>earnings and profits (</span><span>“</span><span>regular dividends</span><span>”</span><span>) are generally subject to tax as ordinary income, subject to the discussion of </span><span>qualified dividend income below. Long-term capital gains are eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate</span><span> shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If an individual receives a regular dividend qualifying for the long-term capital gains rates and such dividend constitutes an </span><span>“</span><span>extraordinary dividend,</span><span>”</span><span> and the individual subsequently recognizes a loss on the sale or exchange of stock in respect of </span><span>which the extraordinary dividend was paid, then the loss will be long-term capital loss to the extent of such extraordinary </span><span>dividend. An </span><span>“</span><span>extraordinary dividend</span><span>”</span><span> on common stock for this purpose is generally a dividend (i) in an amount greater than </span><span>or equal to 10% of the taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-dividend </span><span>dates within an 85-day period, or (ii) in an amount greater than 20% of the taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share </span><span>of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates within a 365-day period.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Distributions in excess of the Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits will, as to each shareholder, be treated as </span><span>a tax-free return of capital to the extent of a shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund, and as a capital gain thereafter (if the </span><span>shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets).

Shareholders receiving dividends or distributions in the form of additional shares should be </span><span>treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as receiving a distribution in an amount equal to the amount of money that the </span><span>shareholders receiving cash dividends or distributions will receive and should have a cost basis in the shares received equal to </span><span>such amount.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>A 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on net investment income, including, but not limited to, interest, </span><span>dividends, and net gain from investments, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and </span><span>filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investors considering buying shares just prior to a dividend or capital gain distribution should be aware that, although the </span><span>price of shares purchased at that time may reflect the amount of the forthcoming distribution, such dividend or distribution </span><span>may nevertheless be taxable to them. If the Fund is the holder of record of any security on the record date for any dividends </span><span>payable with respect to such security, such dividends will be included in the Fund’s gross income not as of the date received </span><span>but as of the later of (a) the date such security became ex-dividend with respect to such dividends (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the date on which a </span><span>buyer of the security would not be entitled to receive the declared, but unpaid, dividends); or (b) the date the Fund acquired </span><span>such security. Accordingly, in order to satisfy its income distribution requirements, the Fund may be required to pay dividends </span><span>based on anticipated earnings, and shareholders may receive dividends in an earlier year than would otherwise be the case.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In certain situations, the Fund may, for a taxable year, defer all or a portion of its net capital loss (or if there is no net capital </span><span>loss, then any net long-term or short-term capital loss) realized after October and its late-year ordinary loss (defined as the </span><span>sum of (i) the excess of post-October foreign currency and passive foreign investment company (</span><span>“</span><span>PFIC</span><span>”</span><span>) losses over post-October</span><span> foreign currency and PFIC gains and (ii) the excess of post-December ordinary losses over post-December ordinary </span><span>income) until the next taxable year in computing its investment company taxable income and net capital gain, which will </span><span>defer the recognition of such realized losses. Such deferrals and other rules regarding gains and losses realized after October </span><span>(or December) may affect the tax character of shareholder distributions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Sales of Shares. </span><span> </span><span>Upon the sale or exchange of shares of the Fund, a shareholder will realize a taxable gain or loss equal to the </span><span>difference between the amount realized and the shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund. A redemption of shares by the </span><span>Fund will be treated as a sale for this purpose. Such gain or loss will be treated as capital gain or loss if the shares are capital </span><span>assets in the shareholder’s hands and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the shares are held for more than one year and </span><span>short-term capital gain or loss if the shares are held for one year or less. Any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be </span><span>disallowed to the extent the shares disposed of are replaced, including replacement through the reinvesting of dividends or </span><span>capital gains distributions, or by an option or contract to acquire substantially identical shares, within a 61-day period </span><span>beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after the disposition of the shares. In such a case, the basis of the shares </span><span>acquired will be increased to reflect the disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a shareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by </span><span>the shareholder for six months or less will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a long-term capital loss to the </span><span>extent of any distributions or deemed distributions of long-term capital gains received by the shareholder with respect to </span><span>such share. The Medicare contribution tax described above will apply to the sale of Fund shares.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If a shareholder incurs a sales charge in acquiring shares of the Fund, disposes of those shares within 90 days and then, on or </span><span>before January 31 of the following calendar year, acquires shares in a mutual fund for which the otherwise applicable sales </span><span>charge is reduced by reason of a reinvestment right (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, an exchange privilege), the original sales charge will not be taken </span><span>into account in computing gain/loss on the original shares to the extent the subsequent sales charge is reduced. Instead, the </span><span>disregarded portion of the original sales charge will be added to the tax basis of the newly acquired shares. Furthermore, the </span><span>same rule also applies to a disposition of the newly acquired shares made within 90 days of the second acquisition. This </span><span>provision prevents shareholders from immediately deducting the sales charge by shifting their investments within a family of </span><span>mutual funds.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Backup Withholding. </span><span> </span><span>In certain cases, the Fund will be required to withhold at a 24% rate and remit to the U.S. Treasury </span><span>such amounts withheld from any distributions paid to a shareholder who: (i) has failed to provide a correct taxpayer </span><span>identification number; (ii) is subject to backup withholding by the IRS; (iii) has failed to certify to the Fund that such </span><span>shareholder is not subject to backup withholding; or (iv) has not certified that such shareholder is a U.S. person (including a </span><span>U.S. resident alien). Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amount withheld may be credited against a </span><span>shareholder's U.S. federal income tax liability.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>68</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

If the Fund’s basis in such securities on </span><span>the date of deposit was less than market value on such date, the Fund, upon disposition of the securities, would recognize </span><span>more taxable gain or less taxable loss than if its basis in the securities had been equal to market value. It is not anticipated </span><span>that the Trust will exercise the right of rejection except in a case where the Trust determines that accepting the order could </span><span>result in material adverse tax consequences to the Fund or its shareholders. The Trust also has the right to require </span><span>information necessary to determine beneficial share ownership for purposes of the 80% determination.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Taxation of Certain Derivatives.</span><span>  </span><span>The Fund’s transactions in zero coupon securities, non-U.S. currencies, forward contracts, </span><span>options and futures contracts (including options and futures contracts on non-U.S. currencies), to the extent permitted, will </span><span>be subject to special provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (including provisions relating to </span><span>“</span><span>hedging transactions</span><span>”</span><span> and </span><span>“</span><span>straddles</span><span>”</span><span>) that, among other consequences, may affect the character of gains and losses realized by the Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, may </span><span>affect whether gains or losses are ordinary or capital), accelerate recognition of income to the Fund and defer Fund losses. </span><span>These rules could therefore affect the character, amount and timing of distributions to shareholders. These provisions also </span><span>(a) will require the Fund to mark-to-market certain types of the positions in its portfolio (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, treat them as if they were closed </span><span>out at the end of each year) and (b) may cause the Fund to recognize income without receiving cash with which to pay </span><span>dividends or make distributions in amounts necessary to satisfy the distribution requirements for avoiding income and excise </span><span>taxes. The Fund will monitor its transactions, will make the appropriate tax elections and will make the appropriate entries in </span><span>its books and records when it acquires any zero coupon security, non-U.S. currency, forward contract, option, futures </span><span>contract or hedged investment in order to mitigate the effect of these rules and prevent disqualification of the Fund as a RIC.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund’s investments in so-called </span><span>“</span><span>Section 1256 contracts,</span><span>”</span><span> such as regulated futures contracts, most non-U.S. currency </span><span>forward contracts traded in the interbank market and options on most security indexes, are subject to special tax rules. All </span><span>Section 1256 contracts held by the Fund at the end of its taxable year are required to be marked to their market value, and </span><span>any unrealized gain or loss on those positions will be included in the Fund’s income as if each position had been sold for its </span><span>fair market value at the end of the taxable year. The resulting gain or loss will be combined with any gain or loss realized by </span><span>the Fund from positions in Section 1256 contracts closed during the taxable year. Provided such positions were held as </span><span>capital assets and were not part of a </span><span>“</span><span>hedging transaction</span><span>”</span><span> nor part of a </span><span>“</span><span>straddle,</span><span>”</span><span> 60% of the resulting net gain or loss will </span><span>be treated as long-term capital gain or loss, and 40% of such net gain or loss will be treated as short-term capital gain or </span><span>loss, regardless of the period of time the positions were actually held by the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As a result of entering into swap contracts, the Fund may make or receive periodic net payments. The Fund may also make or </span><span>receive a payment when a swap is terminated prior to maturity through an assignment of the swap or other closing </span><span>transaction. Periodic net payments will generally constitute ordinary income or deductions, while termination of a swap will </span><span>generally result in capital gain or loss (which will be a long-term capital gain or loss if the Fund has been a party to the swap </span><span>for more than one year). With respect to certain types of swaps, the Fund may be required to currently recognize income or </span><span>loss with respect to future payments on such swaps or may elect under certain circumstances to mark such swaps to market </span><span>annually for tax purposes as ordinary income or loss.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Qualified Dividend Income. </span><span> </span><span>Distributions by the Fund of investment company taxable income (including any short-term </span><span>capital gains), whether received in cash or shares, will be taxable either as ordinary income or as qualified dividend income, </span><span>which is eligible to be taxed at long-term capital gain rates to the extent the Fund receives qualified dividend income on the </span><span>securities it holds and the Fund reports the distribution as qualified dividend income. Qualified dividend income is, in general, </span><span>dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations (but generally not from U.S. REITs) and certain non-U.S. corporations (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, </span><span>non-U.S. corporations that are not PFICs and which are incorporated in a possession of the U.S. or in certain countries with a </span><span>comprehensive tax treaty with the U.S., or the stock of which is readily tradable on an established securities market in the </span><span>U.S. (where the dividends are paid with respect to such stock)). Under current IRS guidance, the U.S. has appropriate </span><span>comprehensive income tax treaties with the following countries: Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, Bulgaria, </span><span>Canada, Chile, China (but not with Hong Kong, which is treated as a separate jurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes), Cyprus, the </span><span>Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, </span><span>Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, </span><span>Pakistan, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sri </span><span>Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, the U.K. and Venezuela.</span><span> </span><span>Substitute </span><span>payments received by the Fund for securities lent out by the Fund will not be qualified dividend income.</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>69</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A dividend from the Fund will not be treated as qualified dividend income to the extent that: (i) the shareholder has not held </span><span>the shares on which the dividend was paid for 61 days during the 121-day period that begins on the date that is 60 days </span><span>before the date on which the shares become ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or the Fund fails to satisfy those </span><span>holding period requirements with respect to the securities it holds that paid the dividends distributed to the shareholder (or, </span><span>in the case of certain preferred stocks, the holding requirement of 91 days during the 181-day period beginning on the date </span><span>that is 90 days before the date on which the stock becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend); (ii) the Fund or the </span><span>shareholder is under an obligation (whether pursuant to a short sale or otherwise) to make related payments with respect to </span><span>substantially similar or related property; or (iii) the shareholder elects to treat such dividend as investment income under </span><span>Section 163(d)(4)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code. Dividends received by the Fund from a REIT or another RIC may be </span><span>treated as qualified dividend income only to the extent the dividend distributions are attributable to qualified dividend </span><span>income received by such REIT or other RIC. It is expected that dividends received by the Fund from a REIT and distributed to a </span><span>shareholder generally will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income. However, for tax years beginning after December </span><span>31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, a non-corporate taxpayer who is a direct REIT shareholder may claim a 20% </span><span>“</span><span>qualified </span><span>business income</span><span>”</span><span> deduction for ordinary REIT dividends, and a RIC may report dividends as eligible for this deduction to the </span><span>extent the RIC’s income is derived from ordinary REIT dividends (reduced by allocable RIC expenses). A shareholder may treat </span><span>the dividends as such provided the RIC and the shareholder satisfy applicable holding period requirements. Distributions by </span><span>the Fund of its net short-term capital gains will be taxable as ordinary income.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Corporate Dividends Received Deduction.</span><span>  </span><span>Dividends paid by the Fund that are attributable to dividends received by the </span><span>Fund from U.S. corporations may qualify for the U.S. federal dividends received deduction for corporations. A 46-day </span><span>minimum holding period during the 90-day period that begins 45 days prior to ex-dividend date (or 91-day minimum holding </span><span>period during the 180 period beginning 90 days prior to ex-dividend date for certain preference dividends) during which risk </span><span>of loss may not be diminished is required for the applicable shares, at both the Fund and shareholder level, for a dividend to </span><span>be eligible for the dividends received deduction. Restrictions may apply if indebtedness, including a short sale, is attributable </span><span>to the investment.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Excess Inclusion Income. </span><span> </span><span>Under current law, the Fund serves to block unrelated business taxable income (</span><span>“</span><span>UBTI</span><span>”</span><span>) from </span><span>being realized by its tax-exempt shareholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a tax-exempt shareholder could realize UBTI by </span><span>virtue of its investment in the Fund if shares in the Fund constitute debt-financed property in the hands of the tax-exempt </span><span>shareholder within the meaning of Section 514(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. Certain types of income received by the </span><span>Fund from REITs, real estate mortgage investment conduits, taxable mortgage pools or other investments may cause the </span><span>Fund to report some or all of its distributions as </span><span>“</span><span>excess inclusion income.</span><span>”</span><span> To Fund shareholders, such excess inclusion </span><span>income may: (i) constitute taxable income, as UBTI for those shareholders who would otherwise be tax-exempt such as </span><span>individual retirement accounts, 401(k) accounts, Keogh plans, pension plans and certain charitable entities; (ii) not be offset </span><span>by otherwise allowable deductions for tax purposes; (iii) not be eligible for reduced U.S. withholding for non-U.S. </span><span>shareholders even from tax treaty countries; and (iv) cause the Fund to be subject to tax if certain </span><span>“</span><span>disqualified </span><span>organizations,</span><span>”</span><span> as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, are Fund shareholders. If a charitable remainder annuity trust or a </span><span>charitable remainder unitrust (each as defined in Section 664 of the Internal Revenue Code) has UBTI for a taxable year, a </span><span>100% excise tax on the UBTI is imposed on the trust.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund tries to avoid investing in REITs that are expected to generate excess inclusion income, but the Fund may not </span><span>always be successful in doing so. Because information about a REIT’s investments may be inadequate or inaccurate, or </span><span>because a REIT may change its investment program, the Fund may not be successful in avoiding the consequences described </span><span>above. Avoidance of investments in REITs that generate excess inclusion income may require the Fund to forego otherwise </span><span>attractive investment opportunities.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Non-U.S. Investments. </span><span> </span><span>Under Section 988 of the Internal Revenue Code, gains or losses attributable to fluctuations in </span><span>exchange rates between the time the Fund accrues income or receivables or expenses or other liabilities denominated in a </span><span>non-U.S. currency and the time the Fund actually collects such income or pays such liabilities are generally treated as </span><span>ordinary income or ordinary loss. In general, gains (and losses) realized on debt instruments will be treated as Section 988 </span><span>gain (or loss) to the extent attributable to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which the </span><span>instruments are denominated. Similarly, gains or losses on non-U.S. currency, non-U.S. currency forward contracts and </span><span>certain non-U.S. currency options or futures contracts denominated in non-U.S. currency, to the extent attributable to </span><span>fluctuations in exchange rates between the acquisition and disposition dates, are also treated as ordinary income or loss </span><span>unless the Fund were to elect otherwise.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>70</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

A non-U.S. person invested in the Fund in a year that the Fund elects to </span><span>“</span><span>pass </span><span>through</span><span>”</span><span> its non-U.S. taxes may be treated as receiving additional dividend income subject to U.S. withholding tax. A non-U.S.</span><span> tax credit may not exceed the investor’s U.S. federal income tax otherwise payable with respect to the investor’s non-U.S. </span><span>source income. For this purpose, shareholders must treat as non-U.S. source gross income (i) their proportionate shares of </span><span>non-U.S. taxes paid by the Fund and (ii) the portion of any dividend paid by the Fund that represents income derived from </span><span>non-U.S. sources; the Fund’s gain from the sale of securities will generally be treated as U.S.-source income. Certain </span><span>limitations will be imposed to the extent to which the non-U.S. tax credit may be claimed. If your Fund shares are loaned </span><span>pursuant to securities lending arrangements, you may lose the ability to use any non-U.S. tax credits passed through by the </span><span>Fund or to treat Fund dividends (paid while the shares are held by the borrower) as qualified dividends. Regarding a short sale </span><span>with respect to shares of the Fund, substitute payments made to the lender of such shares may not be deductible under </span><span>certain circumstances.

Additional charges in the nature of interest may be imposed on the Fund in </span><span>respect of deferred taxes arising from such distributions or gains.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If the Fund were to invest in a PFIC and elect to treat the PFIC as a </span><span>“</span><span>qualified electing fund</span><span>”</span><span> under the Internal Revenue Code, </span><span>in lieu of the foregoing requirements, the Fund might be required to include in income each year a portion of the ordinary </span><span>earnings and net capital gains of the qualified electing fund, even if not distributed to the Fund, and such amounts would be </span><span>subject to the 90% and excise tax distribution requirements described above. In order to make this election, the Fund would </span><span>be required to obtain certain annual information from the PFICs in which it invests, which may be difficult or impossible to </span><span>obtain.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Alternatively, the Fund may make a mark-to-market election that would result in the Fund being treated as if it had sold and </span><span>repurchased its PFIC stock at the end of each year. In such case, the Fund would report any such gains as ordinary income </span><span>and would deduct any such losses as ordinary losses to the extent of previously recognized gains. The election must be made </span><span>separately for each PFIC owned by the Fund and, once made, would be effective for all subsequent taxable years, unless </span><span>revoked with the consent of the IRS. By making the election, the Fund could potentially ameliorate the adverse tax </span><span>consequences with respect to its ownership of shares in a PFIC, but in any particular year may be required to recognize </span><span>income in excess of the distributions it receives from PFICs and its proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock. The Fund may </span><span>have to distribute this </span><span>“</span><span>phantom</span><span>”</span><span> income and gain to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement and to avoid imposition of the </span><span>4% excise tax.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund will make the appropriate tax elections, if possible, and take any additional steps that are necessary to mitigate the </span><span>effects of these rules.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Reporting. </span><span> </span><span>If a shareholder recognizes a loss with respect to the Fund’s shares of $2 million or more for an individual </span><span>shareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate shareholder, the shareholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement </span><span>on IRS Form 8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases exempted from this reporting requirement, </span><span>but under current guidance, shareholders of a RIC are not exempted. The fact that a loss is reportable under these </span><span>regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer’s treatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders </span><span>should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual circumstances.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Other Taxes. </span><span> </span><span>Dividends, distributions and redemption proceeds may also be subject to additional state, local and non-U.S. </span><span>taxes depending on each shareholder’s particular situation.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>71</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders. </span><span> </span><span>Dividends paid by the Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are generally subject to </span><span>withholding tax at a 30% rate or a reduced rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty to the extent derived from </span><span>investment income and short-term capital gains. Dividends paid by the Fund from net tax-exempt income or long-term </span><span>capital gains are generally not subject to such withholding tax. In order to obtain a reduced rate of withholding, a non-U.S. </span><span>shareholder will be required to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying its entitlement to benefits </span><span>under a treaty. The withholding tax does not apply to regular dividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who provides an IRS </span><span>Form W-8ECI, certifying that the dividends are effectively connected with the non-U.S. shareholder’s conduct of a trade or </span><span>business within the U.S. Instead, the effectively connected dividends will be subject to regular U.S. income tax as if the non-U.S.</span><span> shareholder were a U.S. shareholder. A non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively connected dividends may also be </span><span>subject to additional </span><span>“</span><span>branch profits tax</span><span>”</span><span> imposed at a rate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S. shareholder who fails to </span><span>provide an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable form may be subject to backup withholding at the </span><span>appropriate rate.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Properly-reported dividends are generally exempt from U.S. federal withholding tax where they (i) are paid in respect of the </span><span>Fund’s </span><span>“</span><span>qualified net interest income</span><span>”</span><span> (generally, the Fund’s U.S. source interest income, other than certain contingent </span><span>interest and interest from obligations of a corporation or partnership in which the Fund is at least a 10% shareholder or </span><span>partner, reduced by expenses that are allocable to such income) or (ii) are paid in respect of the Fund’s </span><span>“</span><span>qualified short-term </span><span>capital gains</span><span>”</span><span> (generally, the excess of the Fund’s net short-term capital gain over the Fund’s long-term capital loss for such </span><span>taxable year). However, depending on its circumstances, the Fund may report all, some or none of its potentially eligible </span><span>dividends as such qualified net interest income or as qualified short-term capital gains and/or treat such dividends, in whole </span><span>or in part, as ineligible for this exemption from withholding. In order to qualify for this exemption from withholding, a non-U.S.</span><span> shareholder will need to comply with applicable certification requirements relating to its non-U.S. status (including, in </span><span>general, furnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or substitute Form). In the case of shares held through an </span><span>intermediary, the intermediary may withhold even if the Fund reports the payment as qualified net interest income or </span><span>qualified short-term capital gain. Non-U.S. shareholders should contact their intermediaries with respect to the application of </span><span>these rules to their accounts.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Special rules may apply to a foreign shareholder receiving a Fund distribution if at least 50% of the Fund's assets consist of </span><span>interests in U.S. real property interests, including certain REITs and U.S. real property holding corporations (as defined in the </span><span>Internal Revenue Code and Treasury regulations). Fund distributions that are attributable to gain from the disposition of a </span><span>U.S. real property interest will be taxable as ordinary dividends and subject to withholding at a 30% or lower treaty rate if the </span><span>foreign shareholder held no more than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of </span><span>the distribution. If the foreign shareholder held at least 5% of the Fund's shares, the distribution would be treated as income </span><span>effectively connected with a trade or business within the U.S. and the foreign shareholder would be subject to withholding </span><span>tax at a rate of 21% and would generally be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Similar consequences would generally apply to a foreign shareholder's gain on the sale of Fund shares unless the Fund is </span><span>domestically controlled (meaning that more than 50% of the value of the Fund's shares is held by U.S. shareholders) or the </span><span>foreign shareholder owns no more than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of </span><span>sale. Finally, a domestically controlled Fund may be required to recognize a portion of its gain on the in-kind distribution of </span><span>certain U.S. real property interests. Shareholders that are nonresident aliens or foreign entities are urged to consult their own </span><span>tax advisors concerning the particular tax consequences to them of an investment in the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The rules laid out in the previous two paragraphs, other than the withholding rules, will apply notwithstanding the Fund's </span><span>participation in a wash sale transaction or its payment of a substitute dividend.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shareholders that are nonresident aliens or foreign entities are urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning the </span><span>particular tax consequences to them of an investment in the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items paid to: (i) </span><span>foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS </span><span>information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders; and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify </span><span>certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will </span><span>need to: (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information, including the names, </span><span>addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders; comply with due diligence </span><span>procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts; report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>72</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Other foreign entities may need to report the name, address, </span><span>and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership </span><span>unless certain exceptions apply.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund held by a non-U.S. shareholder at death will be considered situated within the U.S. and subject to the U.S. </span><span>estate tax.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The foregoing discussion is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations only and is not intended as </span><span>a substitute for careful tax planning.

These do not currently apply to managers established outside of the EU, such as BFA. </span><span>Rather, non-EU managers are only required to comply with certain disclosure, reporting and transparency obligations of </span><span>AIFMD (</span><span>“</span><span>AIFMD Disclosure Provisions</span><span>”</span><span>) if such managers market a fund to EU investors. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Where the AIFMD Disclosure Provisions relate to EU Operative Provisions that do not apply to BFA, no meaningful disclosure </span><span>can be made. These EU Operative Provisions include prescriptive rules on: measuring and capping leverage in line with </span><span>known European standards; the treatment of investors; the use of </span><span>“</span><span>depositaries</span><span>”</span><span>; and coverage for professional liability risks. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>AIFMD imposes certain conditions on the marketing of funds, such as the Fund, to EU investors. AIFMD requires that an </span><span>‘alternative investment fund manager’ (</span><span>“</span><span>AIFM</span><span>”</span><span>) be identified to meet such conditions where such marketing is sought. For </span><span>these purposes BFA, as the legal entity responsible for performing the portfolio and risk management of the Fund, shall be </span><span>the AIFM. </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>73</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>AIFMD requires disclosure on an ongoing basis of certain information relating to the use of special arrangements, leverage, </span><span>rights of reuse of collateral, guarantees granted under leverage arrangements and the use of gates, side pockets and similar </span><span>liquidity management tools. Given that the Fund does not use any special arrangements or allow for collateral reuse, it is not </span><span>intended that such disclosures will need to be made by the Fund. The Fund will, however, to the extent relevant and </span><span>appropriate, disclose in its annual report information on the Fund's leverage, risk profile and risk management systems </span><span>employed by BFA. The Fund will also disclose material changes, if any, to the liquidity management systems and procedures </span><span>employed in respect of the Fund. </span></div> <div> <div><span>BFA has registered the Fund for marketing to investors in Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the U.K.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investors’ Rights. </span><span> </span><span>The Fund relies on the services of BFA and its other service providers, including the Distributor, </span><span>administrator, custodian and transfer agent. Further information about the duties and roles of these service providers is set </span><span>out in this SAI. Investors who acquire shares of the Fund are not parties to the relevant agreement with these service </span><span>providers and do not have express contractual rights against the Fund or its service providers, except certain institutional </span><span>investors that are Authorized Participants may have certain express contractual rights with respect to the Distributor under </span><span>the terms of the relevant Authorized Participant Agreement. Investors may have certain legal rights under federal or state law </span><span>against the Fund or its service providers.

We manage assets on behalf of </span><span>institutional and individual clients, across a full spectrum of investment strategies, asset classes, and regions. Our client base </span><span>includes pension plans, endowments, foundations, charities, official institutions, insurers, and other financial institutions, as </span><span>well as individuals around the world.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Philosophy on investment stewardship</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As part of our fiduciary duty to our clients, we consider it one of our responsibilities to promote sound corporate governance </span><span>as an informed, engaged shareholder on their behalf. At BlackRock, this is the responsibility of the BlackRock Investment </span><span>Stewardship (BIS) team.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In our experience, sound governance is critical to the success of a company, the protection of investors’ interests, and long-term</span><span> financial value creation. We take a constructive, long-term approach with companies and seek to understand how they </span><span>are managing the drivers of risk and financial value creation in their business models. We have observed that well-managed </span><span>companies will effectively evaluate and address risks and opportunities relevant to their businesses, which supports durable, </span><span>long-term financial value creation. As one of many minority shareholders, BlackRock cannot – and does not try to – direct a </span><span>company’s strategy or its implementation.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shareholder rights</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We believe that there are certain fundamental rights attached to shareholding. Shareholders should have the right to:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Elect, remove, and nominate directors, approve the appointment of the auditor, and amend the corporate charter or by-</span><span>laws.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Vote on key board decisions that are material to the protection of their investment, including but not limited to, changes </span><span>to the purpose of the business, dilution levels and pre-emptive rights, and the distribution of income and capital </span><span>structure.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Access sufficient and timely information on material governance, strategic, and business matters to make informed </span><span>decisions.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>In our view, shareholder voting rights should be proportionate to economic ownership—the principle of </span><span>“</span><span>one share, one </span><span>vote</span><span>”</span><span> helps to achieve this balance.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Consistent with these shareholder rights, BlackRock monitors and provides feedback to companies in our role as stewards of </span><span>our clients’ assets. Investment stewardship is how we use our voice as an investor to promote sound corporate governance </span><span>and business practices that support the ability of companies to deliver long-term financial performance for our clients. We do </span><span>this through engagement with companies, proxy voting on behalf of those clients who have given us authority, and </span><span>participating in market-level dialogue to improve corporate governance standards.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Engagement is an important mechanism for providing feedback on company practices and disclosures, particularly where </span><span>our observations indicate that they could be enhanced to support a company’s ability to deliver financial performance. </span><span>Similarly, it provides us with an opportunity to hear directly from company boards and management on how they believe </span><span>their actions are aligned with the long-term economic interests of shareholders. Engagement with companies may also </span><span>inform our proxy voting decisions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As a fiduciary, we vote in the long-term economic interests of our clients. Generally, we support the recommendations of the </span><span>board of directors and management. However, there may be instances where we vote against the election of directors or </span><span>other management proposals, or support shareholder proposals. For instance, we may vote against management </span><span>recommendations where we are concerned that the board may not be acting in the long-term economic interests of </span><span>shareholders, or disclosures do not provide sufficient information to assess how material, strategic risks and opportunities </span><span>are being managed. Our regional proxy voting guidelines are informed by our market-specific approach and standards of </span><span>corporate governance best practices.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Key Themes</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>While accepted standards and norms of corporate governance can differ between markets, in our experience, there are </span><span>certain globally-applicable fundamental elements of governance that contribute to a company’s ability to create long-term </span><span>financial value for shareholders. These global themes are set out in this overarching set of principles (the </span><span>“</span><span>Principles</span><span>”</span><span>), which </span><span>are anchored in transparency and accountability.

Alongside the Principles and regional voting guidelines, BIS </span><span>publishes our </span><span>engagement priorities</span><span> which reflect the </span><span>five themes</span><span> on which we most frequently engage companies, where </span><span>they are relevant, as these can be a source of material business risk or opportunity. Collectively, these BIS policies set out the </span><span>core elements of corporate governance that guide our investment stewardship efforts globally and within each market, </span><span>including when engaging with companies and voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS policies are applied on a case-by-case </span><span>basis, taking into consideration the context within which a company is operating.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Boards and directors</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We believe that an effective and well-functioning board that has appropriate governance structures to facilitate oversight of a </span><span>company's management and strategic initiatives is critical to the long-term financial success of a company and the </span><span>protection of shareholders’ economic interests. In our view, a strong board can be a competitive advantage to a company, </span><span>providing valuable oversight of and perspectives to management on the most important decisions in support of long-term </span><span>financial performance. As part of their responsibilities, board members have a fiduciary duty to shareholders to oversee the </span><span>strategic direction, operations, and risk management of a company. For this reason, BIS sees engagement with and the </span><span>election of directors as one of our most important responsibilities. Disclosure of material risks that may affect a company’s </span><span>long-term strategy and financial value creation, including material sustainability-related factors when relevant, is essential for </span><span>shareholders to appropriately understand and assess how effectively management is identifying, managing, and mitigating </span><span>such risks.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The board should establish and maintain a framework of robust and effective governance mechanisms to support its </span><span>oversight of the company’s strategy and operations consistent with the long-term economic interests of investors. There </span><span>should be clear descriptions of the role of the board and the committees of the board and how directors engage with and </span><span>oversee management. We look to the board to articulate the effectiveness of these mechanisms in overseeing the </span><span>management of business risks and opportunities and the fulfillment of the company’s purpose and strategy.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Where a company has not adequately disclosed and demonstrated that its board has fulfilled these corporate governance </span><span>and risk oversight responsibilities, we will consider voting against the election of directors who, on our assessment, have </span><span>particular responsibility for the issues. We assess director performance on a case-by-case basis and in light of each </span><span>company’s circumstances, taking into consideration their governance, business practices that support durable, long-term </span><span>financial value creation, and performance. Set out below are ways in which boards and directors can demonstrate a </span><span>commitment to acting in the long-term economic interests of all shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Regular accountability through director elections</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>It is our view that directors should stand for election on a regular basis, ideally annually. In our experience, annual director </span><span>elections allow shareholders to reaffirm their support for board members and/or hold them accountable for their decisions in </span><span>a timely manner. When board members are not elected annually, in our experience, it is good practice for boards to have a </span><span>rotation policy to ensure that, through a board cycle, all directors have had their appointment re-confirmed, with a </span><span>proportion of directors being put forward for election at each annual general meeting.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Effective board composition</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Regular director elections also give boards the opportunity to adjust their composition in an orderly way to reflect </span><span>developments in the company’s strategy and the market environment. In our view, it is beneficial for new directors to be </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

We consider the average overall tenure of the board, and seek a balance between the knowledge and </span><span>experience of longer-serving directors and the fresh perspectives of directors who joined more recently. We encourage </span><span>companies to regularly review the effectiveness of their board (including its size), and assess directors nominated for election </span><span>in the context of the composition of the board as a whole. In our view, the company’s assessment should consider a number </span><span>of factors, including each director’s independence and time commitments, as well as the diversity and relevance of director </span><span>experiences and skillsets, and how these factors may contribute to the financial performance of the company.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Similarly, there should be a sufficient number of independent directors, free from conflicts of interest or undue influence from </span><span>connected parties, to ensure objectivity in the decision-making of the board and its ability to oversee management. Common </span><span>impediments to independence may include but are not limited to:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Current or recent employment at the company or a subsidiary</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Being, or representing, a shareholder with a substantial shareholding in the company</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Interlocking directorships</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Having any other interest, business, or other relationship which could, or could reasonably be perceived to, materially </span><span>interfere with a director’s ability to act in the best interests of the company and shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>In our experience, boards are most effective at overseeing and advising management when there is a senior, independent </span><span>board leader. This director may chair the board, or, where the chair is also the CEO (or is otherwise not independent), be </span><span>designated as a lead independent director. The role of this director is to enhance the effectiveness of the independent </span><span>members of the board through shaping the agenda, ensuring adequate information is provided to the board, and </span><span>encouraging independent director participation in board deliberations. The lead independent director or another appropriate </span><span>director should be available to meet with shareholders in those situations where an independent director is best placed to </span><span>explain and contextualize a company’s approach.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>There are matters for which the board has responsibility that may involve a conflict of interest for executives or for affiliated </span><span>directors, or require additional focus. It is our view that objective oversight of such matters is best achieved when the board </span><span>forms committees comprised entirely of independent directors. In many markets, these committees of the board specialize in </span><span>audit, director nominations, and compensation matters. An ad hoc committee might also be formed to decide on a special </span><span>transaction, particularly one involving a related party, or to investigate a significant adverse event.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When nominating directors to the board, we look to companies to provide sufficient information on the individual candidates </span><span>so that shareholders can assess the capabilities and suitability of each individual nominee and their fit within overall board </span><span>composition. These disclosures should give an understanding of how the collective experience and expertise of the board, as </span><span>well as the particular skill-sets of individual directors, aligns with the company’s long-term strategy and business model. </span><span>Highly qualified, engaged directors with professional characteristics relevant to a company’s business and strategy enhance </span><span>the ability of the board to add value and be the voice of shareholders in board discussions.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>It is in this context that we are interested in diversity in the board room. We see it as a means to promoting diversity of </span><span>thought and avoiding </span><span>“</span><span>group think</span><span>”</span><span> when the board advises and oversees management. This position is based on our view </span><span>that diversity of perspective and thought – in the board room, in the management team, and throughout the company – </span><span>leads to better long-term economic outcomes for companies. Academic research has revealed correlations between specific </span><span>dimensions of diversity and effects on decision-making processes and outcomes.</span><span>1</span><span> In our experience, greater diversity in the </span><span>board room can contribute to more robust discussions and more innovative and resilient decisions. Over time, greater </span><span>diversity in the board room can also promote greater diversity and resilience in the leadership team, and the workforce more </span><span>broadly. That diversity can enable companies to develop businesses that better address the needs of the customers and </span><span>communities they serve.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We ask boards to disclose how diversity is considered in board composition, including professional characteristics, such as a </span><span>director’s industry experience, specialist areas of expertise and geographic location; as well as demographic characteristics </span><span>such as gender, race/ethnicity, and age.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We look to understand a board’s diversity in the context of a company’s domicile, market capitalization, business model, and </span><span>strategy. Increasingly, we see the most effective boards nominating directors from diverse backgrounds which helps ensure </span><span>boards can more effectively understand the company's customers, employees, and communities. We note that in many </span><span>markets, policymakers have set board gender diversity goals which we may discuss with companies, particularly if there is a </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> <div><span>For a discussion on the different impacts of diversity see: </span><span>McKinsey</span><span>, </span><span>“</span><span>Diversity Wins: How Inclusion Matters,</span><span>”</span><span> May 2022; </span><span>Harvard Business Review</span><span>, </span><span>“</span><span>Diverse Teams Feel Less Comfortable – and That’s Why They Perform Better,</span><span>”</span><span> September 2016; </span><span>“</span><span>Do Diverse Directors Influence DEI Outcomes</span><span>,</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>September 2022.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-6</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Self-identified board demographic diversity can usefully be disclosed in </span><span>aggregate, consistent with local law. We encourage boards to aspire to meaningful diversity of membership, while </span><span>recognizing that building a strong, diverse board can take time.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Sufficient capacity</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As the role and expectations of a director are increasingly demanding, directors must be able to commit an appropriate </span><span>amount of time to board and committee matters. It is important that directors have the capacity to meet all of their </span><span>responsibilities - including when there are unforeseen events – and therefore, they should not take on an excessive number of </span><span>roles that would impair their ability to fulfill their duties.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Auditors and audit-related issues</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock recognizes the critical importance of financial statements, which should provide a true and fair picture of a </span><span>company’s financial condition. Accordingly, the assumptions made by management and reviewed by the auditor in preparing </span><span>the financial statements should be reasonable and justified.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The accuracy of financial statements, inclusive of financial and non-financial information as required or permitted under </span><span>market-specific accounting rules, is of paramount importance to BlackRock. Investors increasingly recognize that a broader </span><span>range of risks and opportunities have the potential to materially impact financial performance. Over time, we anticipate </span><span>investors and other users of company reporting will increasingly seek to understand and scrutinize the assumptions </span><span>underlying financial statements, particularly those that pertain to the impact of the transition to a low-carbon economy on a </span><span>company’s business model and asset mix. We recognize that this is an area of evolving practice and note that international </span><span>standards setters, such as the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Board and the International Auditing and </span><span>Assurance Standards Board (IAASB), continue to develop their guidance to companies.</span><span>2</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In this context, audit committees, or equivalent, play a vital role in a company’s financial reporting system by providing </span><span>independent oversight of the accounts, material financial and, where appropriate to the jurisdiction, non-financial </span><span>information and internal control frameworks. Moreover, in the absence of a dedicated risk committee, these committees can </span><span>provide oversight of Enterprise Risk Management systems.</span><span>3</span><span> In our view, effective audit committee oversight strengthens the </span><span>quality and reliability of a company’s financial statements and provides an important level of reassurance to shareholders.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We hold members of the audit committee or equivalent responsible for overseeing the management of the audit function. </span><span>Audit committees or equivalent should have clearly articulated charters that set out their responsibilities and have a rotation </span><span>plan in place that allows for a periodic refreshment of the committee membership to introduce fresh perspectives to audit </span><span>oversight. We recognize that audit committees will rely on management, internal audit, and the independent auditor in </span><span>fulfilling their responsibilities but look to committee members to demonstrate they have relevant expertise to monitor and </span><span>oversee the audit process and related activities.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We take particular note of unexplained changes in reporting methodology, cases involving significant financial restatements, </span><span>or ad hoc notifications of material financial weakness. In this respect, audit committees should provide timely disclosure on </span><span>the remediation of Key and Critical Audit Matters identified either by the external auditor or internal audit function.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The integrity of financial statements depends on the auditor being free of any impediments to being an effective check on </span><span>management. To that end, it is important that auditors are, and are seen to be, independent. Where an audit firm provides </span><span>services to the company in addition to the audit, the fees earned should be disclosed and explained. Audit committees </span><span>should have in place a procedure for assessing annually the independence of the auditor and the quality of the external audit </span><span>process.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Comprehensive disclosure provides investors with a sense of the company’s long-term operational risk management </span><span>practices and, more broadly, the quality of the board’s oversight. The audit or risk committee, should periodically review the </span><span>company’s risk assessment and risk management policies and the significant risks and exposures identified by management, </span><span>the internal auditors or the independent auditors and management’s steps to address them. In the absence of detailed </span><span>disclosures, we may reasonably conclude that companies are not adequately managing risk.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> <div><span>IFRS, </span><span>“</span><span>IFRS S1 General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information</span><span>”</span><span>, June 2023, and IAASB, </span><span>“</span><span>IAASB Launches Public </span><span>Consultation on Landmark Proposed Global Sustainability Assurance Standard</span><span>”</span><span>, August 2023.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> <div><span>Enterprise risk management is a process, effected by the entity’s board of directors, management, and other personnel, applied in strategy setting and </span><span>across the enterprise, designed to identify potential events that may affect the entity, and manage risk to be within the risk appetite, to provide </span><span>reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Capital structure, mergers, asset sales, and other special transactions</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>The capital structure of a company is critical to shareholders as it impacts the value of their investment and the priority of </span><span>their interest in the company relative to that of other equity or debt investors. Pre-emptive rights are a key protection for </span><span>shareholders against the dilution of their interests.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Effective voting rights are basic rights of share ownership and a core principle of effective governance. Shareholders, as the </span><span>residual claimants, have the strongest interest in protecting the financial value of the company, and voting rights should </span><span>match economic exposure, i.e. one share, one vote.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In principle, we disagree with the creation of a share class with equivalent economic exposure and preferential, differentiated </span><span>voting rights. In our view, this structure violates the fundamental corporate governance principle of proportionality and </span><span>results in a concentration of power in the hands of a few shareholders, thus disenfranchising other shareholders and </span><span>amplifying any potential conflicts of interest. However, we recognize that in certain markets, at least for a period of time, </span><span>companies may have a valid argument for listing dual classes of shares with differentiated voting rights. In our view, such </span><span>companies should review these share class structures on a regular basis or as company circumstances change. Additionally, </span><span>they should seek shareholder approval of their capital structure on a periodic basis via a management proposal at the </span><span>company’s shareholder meeting. The proposal should give unaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to affirm the current </span><span>structure or establish mechanisms to end or phase out controlling structures at the appropriate time, while minimizing costs </span><span>to shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In assessing mergers, asset sales, or other special transactions, BlackRock’s primary consideration is the long-term economic </span><span>interests of our clients as shareholders. Boards proposing a transaction should clearly explain the economic and strategic </span><span>rationale behind it. We will review a proposed transaction to determine the degree to which it can enhance long-term </span><span>shareholder value. We find long-term investors like our clients typically benefit when proposed transactions have the </span><span>unanimous support of the board and have been negotiated at arm’s length. We may seek reassurance from the board that </span><span>the financial interests of executives and/or board members in a given transaction have not adversely affected their ability to </span><span>place shareholders’ interests before their own. Where the transaction involves related parties, the recommendation to </span><span>support should come from the independent directors, a best practice in most markets, and ideally, the terms should have </span><span>been assessed through an independent appraisal process. In addition, it is good practice that it be approved by a separate </span><span>vote of the non-conflicted parties.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As a matter of sound governance practice, shareholders should have a right to dispose of company shares in the open </span><span>market without unnecessary restriction. In our view, corporate mechanisms designed to limit shareholders’ ability to sell their </span><span>shares are contrary to basic property rights. Such mechanisms can serve to protect and entrench interests other than those </span><span>of the shareholders. In our view, shareholders are broadly capable of making decisions in their own best interests. We </span><span>encourage any so-called </span><span>“</span><span>shareholder rights plans</span><span>”</span><span> proposed by a board to be subject to shareholder approval upon </span><span>introduction and periodically thereafter.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Executive compensation</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In most markets, one of the most important roles for a company’s board of directors is to put in place a compensation </span><span>structure that incentivizes and rewards executives appropriately. There should be a clear link between variable pay and </span><span>operational and financial performance. Performance metrics should be stretching and aligned with a company’s strategy and </span><span>business model. BIS does not have a position on the use of sustainability-related criteria in compensation structures, but in </span><span>our view, where companies choose to include these components, they should be adequately disclosed, material to the </span><span>company’s strategy, and as rigorous as other financial or operational targets. Long-term incentive plans should encompass </span><span>timeframes that 1) are distinct from annual executive compensation structures and metrics, and 2) encourage the delivery of </span><span>strong financial results over a period of years. Compensation committees should guard against contractual arrangements </span><span>that would entitle executives to material compensation for early termination of their employment. Finally, pension </span><span>contributions and other deferred compensation arrangements should be reasonable, in light of market practices.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We are not supportive of one-off or special bonuses unrelated to company or individual performance. Where discretion has </span><span>been used by the compensation committee or its equivalent, we expect disclosure relating to how and why the discretion </span><span>was used, and how the adjusted outcome is aligned with the interests of shareholders. We acknowledge that the use of peer </span><span>group evaluation by compensation committees can help ensure competitive pay; however, we are concerned when the </span><span>rationale for increases in total compensation at a company is solely based on peer benchmarking, rather than a rigorous </span><span>measure of outperformance. We encourage companies to clearly explain how compensation outcomes have rewarded </span><span>performance.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>We encourage boards to consider building clawback provisions into incentive plans such that companies could clawback </span><span>compensation or require executives to forgo awards when compensation was based on faulty financial statements or </span><span>deceptive business practices. We also favor recoupment from or the foregoing of the grant of any awards by any senior </span><span>executive whose behavior caused material financial harm to shareholders, material reputational risk to the company, or </span><span>resulted in a criminal investigation, even if such actions did not ultimately result in a material restatement of past results.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Non-executive directors should be compensated in a manner that is commensurate with the time and effort expended in </span><span>fulfilling their professional responsibilities. Additionally, these compensation arrangements should not risk compromising </span><span>directors’ independence or aligning their interests too closely with those of the management, whom they are charged with </span><span>overseeing.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We use third party research, in addition to our own analysis, to evaluate existing and proposed compensation structures. BIS </span><span>may signal concerns through not supporting management’s proposals to approve compensation, where they are on the </span><span>agenda. We may also vote against members of the compensation committee or equivalent board members for poor </span><span>compensation practices or structures.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Material sustainability-related risks and opportunities</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>It is our view that well-managed companies will effectively evaluate and manage material sustainability-related risks and </span><span>opportunities relevant to their businesses. As with all risks and opportunities in a company's business model, appropriate </span><span>oversight of material sustainability considerations is a core component of having an effective governance framework, which </span><span>supports durable, long-term financial value creation.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Robust disclosure is essential for investors to effectively evaluate companies’ strategy and business practices related to </span><span>material sustainability-related risks and opportunities. Long-term investors like our clients can benefit when companies </span><span>demonstrate that they have a resilient business model through disclosures that cover governance, strategy, risk </span><span>management, and metrics and targets, including industry-specific metrics. The International Sustainability Standards Board </span><span>(ISSB) standards, IFRS S1 and S2,</span><span>4 </span><span>provide companies with a useful guide to preparing this disclosure. The standards build on </span><span>the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework and the standards and metrics developed by the </span><span>Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), which have converged under the ISSB. We recognize that companies may </span><span>phase in reporting aligned with the ISSB standards over several years. We also recognize that some companies may report </span><span>using different standards, which may be required by regulation, or one of a number of voluntary standards. In such cases, we </span><span>ask that companies highlight the metrics that are industry- or company-specific.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We note that climate and other sustainability-related disclosures often require companies to collect and aggregate data from </span><span>various internal and external sources. We recognize that the practical realities of data collection and reporting may not line up </span><span>with financial reporting cycles and companies may require additional time after their fiscal year-end to accurately collect, </span><span>analyze, and report this data to investors.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>That said, to give investors time to assess the data, we encourage companies to produce climate and other sustainability-related</span><span> disclosures sufficiently in advance of their annual meeting, to the best of their abilities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Companies may also choose to adopt or refer to guidance on sustainable and responsible business conduct issued by </span><span>supranational organizations such as the United Nations or the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. </span><span>Further, industry initiatives on managing specific operational risks may provide useful guidance to companies on best </span><span>practices and disclosures. We find it helpful to our understanding of investment risk when companies disclose any relevant </span><span>global climate and other sustainability-related standards adopted, the industry initiatives in which they participate, any peer </span><span>group benchmarking undertaken, and any assurance processes to help investors understand their approach to sustainable </span><span>and responsible business practices. We will express any concerns through our voting where a company’s actions or </span><span>disclosures do not seem adequate in light of the materiality of the business risks.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Climate and nature-related risk</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>While companies in various sectors and geographies may be affected differently by climate-related risks and opportunities, </span><span>the low-carbon transition is an investment factor that can be material for many companies and economies around the globe.</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> <div><span>The objective of </span><span>IFRS S1</span><span> General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information is to require an entity to disclose </span><span>information about its sustainability-related risks and opportunities that is useful to primary users of general-purpose financial reports in making </span><span>decisions relating to providing resources to the entity.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>We seek to understand, from company disclosures and engagement, the strategies companies have in place to manage </span><span>material risks to, and opportunities for, their long-term business model associated with a range of climate-related scenarios, </span><span>including a scenario in which global warming is limited to well below 2°C, considering global ambitions to achieve a limit of </span><span>1.5°C. As one of many shareholders, and typically a minority one, BlackRock does not tell companies what to do. It is the role </span><span>of the board and management to set and implement a company's long-term strategy to deliver long-term financial returns.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Our research shows that the low-carbon transition is a structural shift in the global economy that will be shaped by changes </span><span>in government policies, technology, and consumer preferences, which may be material for many companies.</span><span>5</span><span> Yet the path to </span><span>a low-carbon economy is deeply uncertain and uneven, with different parts of the economy moving at different speeds. BIS </span><span>recognizes that it can be challenging for companies to predict the impact of climate-related risk and opportunity on their </span><span>businesses and operating environments. Many companies are assessing how to navigate the low-carbon transition while </span><span>delivering long-term value to investors. In this context, we encourage companies to publicly disclose, consistent with their </span><span>business model and sector, how they intend to deliver long-term financial performance through the transition to a low-carbon</span><span> economy. Where available, we appreciate companies publishing their transition plan.</span><span>6</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Consistent with the ISSB standards, we are better able to assess preparedness for the low-carbon transition when companies </span><span>disclose short-, medium- and long-term targets, ideally science-based where these are available for their sector, for scope 1 </span><span>and 2 greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reductions and to demonstrate how their targets are consistent with the long-term </span><span>financial interests of their investors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>While we recognize that regulators in some markets are moving to mandate certain disclosures, at this stage, we view scope </span><span>3 emissions differently from scopes 1 and 2, given methodological complexity, regulatory uncertainty, concerns about </span><span>double-counting, and lack of direct control by companies. We welcome disclosures and commitments companies choose to </span><span>make regarding scope 3 emissions and recognize these are provided on a good-faith basis as methodology develops. Our </span><span>publicly available commentary provides more information on our approach to climate-related risks and opportunities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition to climate-related risks and opportunities, the management of nature-related factors is increasingly a component </span><span>of some companies’ ability to generate durable, long-term financial returns for shareholders, particularly where a company’s </span><span>strategy is heavily reliant on the availability of natural capital, or whose supply chains are exposed to locations with nature-related</span><span> risks. We look for such companies to disclose how they manage any reliance and impact on, as well as use of, natural </span><span>capital, including appropriate risk oversight and relevant metrics and targets, to understand how these factors are integrated </span><span>into strategy. We will evaluate these disclosures to inform our view of how a company is managing material nature-related </span><span>risks and opportunities, as well as in our assessment of relevant shareholder proposals. Our publicly available commentary </span><span>provides more information on our approach to natural capital.</span><span>7</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Key stakeholder interests</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In order to advance long-term shareholders’ interests, companies should consider the interests of the various parties on </span><span>whom they depend for their success over time. It is for each company to determine their key stakeholders based on what is </span><span>material to their business and long-term financial performance. For many companies, key stakeholders include employees, </span><span>business partners (such as suppliers and distributors), clients and consumers, regulators, and the communities in which they </span><span>operate.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As a long-term shareholder on behalf of our clients, we find it helpful when companies disclose how they have identified </span><span>their key stakeholders and considered their interests in business decision-making. In addition to understanding broader </span><span>stakeholder relationships, BIS finds it helpful when companies consider the needs of their workforce today, and the skills </span><span>required for their future business strategy. We are also interested to understand the role of the board, which is well positioned </span><span>to ensure that the approach taken is informed by and aligns with the company’s strategy and purpose.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>5</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock Investment Institute, </span><span>“</span><span>Tracking the low-carbon transition</span><span>”</span><span>, July 2023.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>6</span></div> <div><span>We have observed that more companies are developing such plans, and public policy makers in a number of markets are signaling their intentions to </span><span>require them. We view transition plans (TPs) as a method for a company to both internally assess and externally communicate long-term strategy, </span><span>ambition, objectives, and actions to create financial value through the global transition towards a low-carbon economy. While many initiatives across </span><span>jurisdictions outline a framework for TPs, there is no consensus on the key elements these plans should contain. We view useful disclosure as that </span><span>which communicates a company’s approach to managing financially material, business relevant risks and opportunities – including climate-related </span><span>risks – to deliver long-term financial performance, thus enabling investors to make more informed decisions.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>7</span></div> <div><span>Given the growing awareness of the materiality of these issues for certain businesses, enhanced reporting on a company's natural capital </span><span>dependencies and impacts would aid investors’ understanding. In our view, the final recommendations of the </span><span>Taskforce on Nature-related Financial </span><span>Disclosures</span><span> may prove useful to some companies. We recognize that some companies may report using different standards, which may be required </span><span>by regulation, or one of a number of other private sector standards.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-10</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Companies should articulate how they address material adverse impacts that could arise from their business practices and </span><span>affect critical relationships with their stakeholders. We encourage companies to implement, to the extent appropriate, </span><span>monitoring processes (often referred to as due diligence) to identify and mitigate potential adverse impacts and grievance </span><span>mechanisms to remediate any actual adverse material impacts. In our view, maintaining trust within these relationships can </span><span>contribute to a company’s long-term success.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Other corporate governance matters and shareholder protections</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In our view, shareholders have a right to material and timely information on the financial performance and viability of the </span><span>companies in which they invest. In addition, companies should publish information on the governance structures in place </span><span>and the rights of shareholders to influence these structures. The reporting and disclosure provided by companies help </span><span>shareholders assess the effectiveness of the board’s oversight of management and whether investors’ economic interests </span><span>have been protected. We believe shareholders should have the right to vote on key corporate governance matters, including </span><span>changes to governance mechanisms, to submit proposals to the shareholders’ meeting, and to call special meetings of </span><span>shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Corporate form</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In our view, it is the responsibility of the board to determine the corporate form that is most appropriate given the company’s </span><span>purpose and business model.</span><span>8</span><span> Companies proposing to change their corporate form to a public benefit corporation or similar </span><span>entity should put it to a shareholder vote if not already required to do so under applicable law. Supporting documentation </span><span>from companies or shareholder proponents proposing to alter the corporate form should clearly articulate how the interests </span><span>of shareholders and different stakeholders would be impacted as well as the accountability and voting mechanisms that </span><span>would be available to shareholders. As a fiduciary on behalf of clients, we generally support management proposals if our </span><span>analysis indicates that shareholders’ economic interests are adequately protected. Relevant shareholder proposals are </span><span>evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shareholder proposals</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In most markets in which BlackRock invests on behalf of clients, shareholders have the right to submit proposals to be voted </span><span>on by shareholders at a company’s annual or extraordinary meeting, as long as eligibility and procedural requirements are </span><span>met. The matters that we see put forward by shareholders address a wide range of topics, including governance reforms, </span><span>capital management, and improvements in the management or disclosure of sustainability-related risks.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock is subject to legal and regulatory requirements in the U.S. that place restrictions and limitations on how BlackRock </span><span>can interact with the companies in which we invest on behalf of our clients, including our ability to submit shareholder </span><span>proposals. We can vote, on behalf of clients who authorize us to do so, on proposals put forth by others.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When assessing shareholder proposals, we evaluate each proposal on its merit, with a singular focus on its implications for </span><span>long-term financial value creation by that company. We believe it is helpful for companies to disclose the names of the </span><span>proponent or organization that has submitted or advised on the proposal. We consider the business and economic relevance </span><span>of the issue raised, as well as its materiality and the urgency with which our experience indicates it should be addressed. We </span><span>would not support proposals that we believe would result in over-reaching into the basic business decisions of the company. </span><span>We take into consideration the legal effect of the proposal, as shareholder proposals may be advisory or legally binding </span><span>depending on the jurisdiction, while others may make requests that would be deemed illegal in a given jurisdiction.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Where a proposal is focused on a material business risk that we agree needs to be addressed and the intended outcome is </span><span>consistent with long-term financial value creation, we will look to the board and management to demonstrate that the </span><span>company has met the intent of the request made in the shareholder proposal. Where our analysis and/or engagement </span><span>indicate an opportunity for improvement in the company’s approach to the issue, we may support shareholder proposals that </span><span>are reasonable and not unduly prescriptive or constraining on management.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We recognize that some shareholder proposals bundle topics and/or specific requests and include supporting statements </span><span>that explain the reasoning or objectives of the proponent. In voting on behalf of clients, we do not submit or edit proposals or </span><span>the supporting statements – we must vote yes or no on the proposal as phrased by the proponent. Therefore, when we vote </span><span>in support of a proposal, we are not necessarily endorsing every element of the proposal or the reasoning, objectives, or </span><span>supporting statement of the proponent. We may support a proposal for different reasons from those put forth by the </span><span>proponent, when we believe that, overall, it can advance our clients' long-term financial interests. We would normally explain </span><span>to the company our rationale for supporting such proposals.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>8</span></div> <div><span>Corporate form refers to the legal structure by which a business is organized.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Alternatively, or in addition, we may vote against the election of one or more directors if, in our assessment, the board has </span><span>not responded sufficiently or with an appropriate sense of urgency. We may also support a proposal if management is on </span><span>track, but we believe that voting in favor might accelerate efforts to address a material risk.</span></div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock’s oversight of its investment stewardship activities</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Oversight</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock maintains three regional advisory committees (Stewardship Advisory Committees) for a) the Americas; b) Europe, </span><span>the Middle East and Africa; and c) Asia-Pacific, generally consisting of senior BlackRock investment professionals and/or </span><span>senior employees with practical boardroom experience. The regional Stewardship Advisory Committees review and advise on </span><span>amendments to BIS regional proxy voting guidelines (the Guidelines) covering markets within each respective region. The </span><span>advisory committees do not determine voting decisions, which are the responsibility of BIS.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition to the regional Stewardship Advisory Committees, the Investment Stewardship Global Oversight Committee </span><span>(Global Oversight Committee) is a risk-focused committee, comprised of senior representatives from various BlackRock </span><span>investment teams, a senior legal representative, the Global Head of Investment Stewardship (Global Head), and other senior </span><span>executives with relevant experience and team oversight. The Global Committee does not determine voting decisions, which </span><span>are the responsibility of BIS.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Global Head has primary oversight of the activities of BIS, including voting in accordance with the Guidelines, which </span><span>require the application of professional judgment and consideration of each company’s unique circumstances. The Global </span><span>Committee reviews and approves amendments to these Principles. The Global Committee also reviews and approves </span><span>amendments to the regional Guidelines, as proposed by the regional Stewardship Advisory Committees.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, the Global Committee receives and reviews periodic reports regarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as updates on </span><span>material process issues, procedural changes, and other risk oversight considerations. The Global Committee reviews these </span><span>reports in an oversight capacity as informed by the Guidelines.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BIS carries out engagement with companies, executes proxy votes, and conducts vote operations (including maintaining </span><span>records of votes cast) in a manner consistent with the relevant Guidelines. BIS also conducts research on corporate </span><span>governance issues and participates in industry discussions to contribute to and keep abreast of important developments in </span><span>the corporate governance field. BIS may utilize third parties for certain of the foregoing activities and performs oversight of </span><span>those third parties. BIS may raise complicated or particularly controversial matters for internal discussion with the relevant </span><span>investment teams and governance specialists for discussion and guidance prior to making a voting decision.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Vote execution</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock votes on proxy issues when our clients authorize us to do so. When BlackRock has been authorized to vote on </span><span>behalf of our clients, we carefully consider proxies submitted to funds and other fiduciary account(s) (Fund or Funds) for </span><span>which we have voting authority. BlackRock votes (or refrains from voting) proxies for each Fund for which we have voting </span><span>authority based on our evaluation of the alignment of the voting items with the long-term economic interests of our clients, </span><span>in the exercise of our independent business judgment, and without regard to the relationship of the issuer of the proxy (or </span><span>any shareholder proponent or dissident shareholder) to the Fund, the Fund’s affiliates (if any), BlackRock or BlackRock’s </span><span>affiliates, or BlackRock employees (see </span><span>“</span><span>Conflicts management policies and procedures,</span><span>”</span><span> below).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When exercising voting rights, BIS will normally vote on specific proxy issues in accordance with the Guidelines for the </span><span>relevant market, as well as the Global Principles. The Guidelines are reviewed annually and are amended consistent with </span><span>changes in the local market practice, as developments in corporate governance occur, or as otherwise deemed advisable by </span><span>the applicable Stewardship Advisory Committees. BIS analysts may, in the exercise of their professional judgment, conclude </span><span>that the Guidelines do not cover the specific matter upon which a proxy vote is required or that an exception to the </span><span>Guidelines would be in the long-term economic interests of BlackRock’s clients.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the uncommon circumstance of there being a vote with respect to fixed income securities or the securities of privately </span><span>held issuers, the decision generally will be made by a Fund's portfolio managers and/or BIS based on an assessment of the </span><span>particular transactions or other matters at issue.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In certain markets, proxy voting involves logistical issues which can affect BIS’ ability to vote such proxies, as well as the </span><span>desirability of voting such proxies. These issues include, but are not limited to: i) untimely notice of shareholder meetings; ii) </span><span>restrictions on a foreigner’s ability to exercise votes; iii) requirements to vote proxies in person; iv) </span><span>“</span><span>share-blocking</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>(requirements that investors who exercise their voting rights surrender the right to dispose of their holdings for some </span><span>specified period in proximity to the shareholder meeting); v) potential difficulties in translating the proxy; vi) regulatory </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-12</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>constraints; and vii) requirements to provide local agents with unrestricted powers of attorney to facilitate voting </span><span>instructions. We are not supportive of impediments to the exercise of voting rights such as share-blocking or overly </span><span>burdensome administrative requirements.</span></div> <div> <div><span>As a consequence, BlackRock votes proxies in these situations on a </span><span>“</span><span>best-efforts</span><span>”</span><span> basis. In addition, BIS may determine that it </span><span>is generally in the interests of BlackRock’s clients not to vote proxies (or not to vote our full allocation) if the costs (including </span><span>but not limited to opportunity costs associated with share-blocking constraints) associated with exercising a vote are </span><span>expected to outweigh the benefit the client would derive by voting on the proposal.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Active portfolio managers have full discretion to vote the shares in the Funds they manage based on their analysis of the </span><span>economic impact of a particular ballot item on their investors. Portfolio managers may, from time to time, reach differing </span><span>views on how to maximize economic value with respect to a particular investment. Therefore, portfolio managers may, and </span><span>sometimes do, vote shares in the Funds under their management differently from BIS or from one another. However, because </span><span>BlackRock’s clients are mostly long-term investors with long-term economic goals, ballots are generally cast in a uniform </span><span>manner.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Voting Choice</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock offers a Voting Choice program, which provides eligible clients with more opportunities to participate in the proxy </span><span>voting process where legally and operationally viable. BlackRock Voting Choice aims to make proxy voting easier and more </span><span>accessible for eligible clients.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Voting Choice is currently available for eligible clients invested in certain institutional pooled funds in the U.S., UK, Ireland, and </span><span>Canada that utilize equity index investment strategies, as well as eligible clients in certain institutional pooled funds in the </span><span>U.S., UK, and Canada that use systematic active equity (SAE) strategies. Currently, this includes over 650 pooled investment </span><span>funds, including equity index funds and SAE investment funds. In addition, institutional clients in separately managed </span><span>accounts (SMAs) continue to be eligible for BlackRock Voting Choice regardless of their investment strategies.</span><span>9</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As a result, the shares attributed to BlackRock in company share registers may be voted differently depending on whether our </span><span>clients have authorized BIS to vote on their behalf, have authorized BIS to vote in accordance with a third-party policy, or have </span><span>elected to vote shares in accordance with their own policy. Agreements with our clients to allow them greater control over </span><span>their voting, including which policies they have selected, will be treated confidentially consistent with our treatment of similar </span><span>client agreements.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Conflicts management policies and procedures</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BIS maintains policies and procedures that seek to prevent undue influence on BlackRock’s proxy voting activity. Such </span><span>influence might stem from any relationship between the investee company (or any shareholder proponent or dissident </span><span>shareholder) and BlackRock, BlackRock’s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund’s affiliates, or BlackRock employees.

While this </span><span>has occurred in a limited number of cases, the decision to recall securities on loan as part of BlackRock’s securities lending </span><span>program in order to vote is based on an evaluation of various factors that include, but are not limited to, assessing potential </span><span>securities lending revenue alongside the potential long-term financial value to clients of voting those securities (based on the </span><span>information available at the time of recall consideration).</span><span>10</span><span> BIS works with colleagues in the Securities Lending and Risk and </span><span>Quantitative Analysis teams to evaluate the costs and benefits to clients of recalling shares on loan.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In almost all instances, BlackRock anticipates that the potential long-term financial value to the Fund of voting shares would </span><span>be less than the potential revenue the loan may provide the Fund. However, in certain instances, BlackRock may determine, in </span><span>our independent business judgment as a fiduciary, that the value of voting outweighs the securities lending revenue loss to </span><span>clients and would therefore recall shares to be voted in those instances.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Periodically, BlackRock reviews our process for determining whether to recall securities on loan in order to vote and may </span><span>modify it as necessary.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Voting guidelines</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> <div><span>Recalling securities on loan can be impacted by the timing of record dates. In the U.S., for example, the record date of a shareholder meeting typically </span><span>falls before the proxy statements are released. Accordingly, it is not practicable to evaluate a proxy statement, determine that a vote has a material </span><span>impact on a fund and recall any shares on loan in advance of the record date for the annual meeting. As a result, managers must weigh independent </span><span>business judgement as a fiduciary, the benefit to a fund’s shareholders of recalling loaned shares in advance of an estimated record date without </span><span>knowing whether there will be a vote on matters which have a material impact on the fund (thereby forgoing potential securities lending revenue for </span><span>the fund’s shareholders) or leaving shares on loan to potentially earn revenue for the fund (thereby forgoing the opportunity to vote).</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The voting guidelines published for each region/country in which we vote are intended to summarize BlackRock’s general </span><span>philosophy and approach to issues that may commonly arise in the proxy voting context in each market where we invest. The </span><span>Guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. BIS applies the Guidelines on a case-by-case basis, in the context of the </span><span>individual circumstances of each company and the specific issue under review. As such, the Guidelines do not indicate how </span><span>BIS will vote in every instance. Rather, they reflect our view about corporate governance issues generally, and provide insight </span><span>into how we typically approach issues that commonly arise on corporate ballots. As previously discussed, the Guidelines </span><span>should be read in conjunction with the Principles and engagement priorities. Collectively, these </span><span>“</span><span>BIS policies</span><span>”</span><span> set out the core </span><span>elements of corporate governance that guide our investment stewardship efforts globally and within each market, including </span><span>when engaging with companies and voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS policies are applied on a case-by-case basis, </span><span>taking into consideration the context within which a company is operating.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Reporting and vote transparency</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We are committed to transparency in the stewardship work we do on behalf of clients. We inform clients about our </span><span>engagement and voting policies and activities through direct communication and through disclosure on our website. Each </span><span>year we publish an annual report that provides a global overview of our investment stewardship engagement and voting </span><span>activities and a voting spotlight that summarizes our voting over a proxy year.</span><span>11</span><span> Additionally, we make public our regional </span><span>proxy voting guidelines for the benefit of clients and the companies in which we invest on their behalf. We also publish </span><span>commentaries to share our perspective on market developments and emerging key themes.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>At a more granular level, on a quarterly basis, we publish our vote record for each company that held a shareholder meeting </span><span>during the period, showing how BIS voted on each proposal and providing our rationale for any votes against management </span><span>proposals or on shareholder proposals. For shareholder meetings where a vote might be high profile or of significant interest </span><span>to clients, we may publish a vote bulletin after the meeting, disclosing and explaining our vote on key proposals. We also </span><span>publish a quarterly list of all companies with which we engaged and the key topics addressed in the engagement meeting.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In this way, we help inform our clients about the work we do on their behalf in promoting the governance and business </span><span>practices that support durable, long-term financial value creation.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>11</span></div> <div><span>The proxy year runs from July 1 to June 30.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-15</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Guidelines Introduction</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Summary of Changes for 2024</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis evaluates these guidelines on an ongoing basis and formally updates them on an annual basis. This year we’ve </span><span>made noteworthy revisions in the following areas, which are summarized below but discussed in greater detail in the relevant </span><span>section of this document:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Material Weaknesses</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We have included a new discussion on our approach to material weaknesses. Effective internal controls over financial </span><span>reporting should ensure the integrity of companies’ accounting and financial reporting. A material weakness occurs when a </span><span>company identifies a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting, such that there </span><span>is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be </span><span>prevented or detected on a timely basis.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We believe it is the responsibility of audit committees to ensure that material weaknesses are remediated in a timely manner </span><span>and that companies disclose remediation plans that include detailed steps to resolve a given material weakness.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When a material weakness is reported and the company has not disclosed a remediation plan, or when a material weakness </span><span>has been ongoing for more than one year and the company has not disclosed an updated remediation plan that clearly </span><span>outlines the company’s progress toward remediating the material weakness, we will consider recommending that </span><span>shareholders vote against all members of a company’s audit committee who served on the committee during the time when </span><span>the material weakness was identified.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Cyber Risk Oversight</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We have updated our discussion on our approach to cyber risk oversight. On July 26, 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange </span><span>Commission (SEC) announced rules requiring public companies to report cybersecurity incidents deemed material within </span><span>four days of identifying them; furthermore, in annual reports, they must disclose their processes for assessing, identifying, </span><span>and managing material cybersecurity risks, along with their material effects and past incidents' impacts. Similar rules were </span><span>also adopted for foreign private issuers. The final rules became effective on September 5, 2023. Given the continued </span><span>regulatory focus on and the potential adverse outcomes from cyber-related issues, it is our view that cyber risk is material for </span><span>all companies.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the absence of material cybersecurity incidents, we will generally not make voting recommendations on the basis of a </span><span>company’s oversight or disclosure concerning cyber-related issues. However, in instances where cyber-attacks have caused </span><span>significant harm to shareholders, we will closely evaluate the board’s oversight of cybersecurity as well as the company’s </span><span>response and disclosures.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Moreover, in instances where a company has been materially impacted by a cyber-attack, we believe shareholders can </span><span>reasonably expect periodic updates from the company communicating its ongoing progress towards resolving and </span><span>remediating the impact of the cyber-attack. These disclosures should focus on the company’s response to address the </span><span>impacts to affected stakeholders and should not reveal specific and/or technical details that could impede the company’s </span><span>response or remediation of the incident or that could assist threat actors.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In instances where a company has been materially impacted by a cyber-attack, we may recommend against appropriate </span><span>directors should we find the board’s oversight, response or disclosures concerning cybersecurity-related issues to be </span><span>insufficient or are not provided to shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Board Oversight of Environmental and Social Issues</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We have updated our discussion of board oversight of environmental and social issues. Given the importance of the board’s </span><span>role in overseeing environmental and social risks, we believe that this responsibility should be formally designated and </span><span>codified in the appropriate committee charters or other governing documents.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-18</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>When evaluating the board’s role in overseeing environmental and/or social issues, we will examine a company’s committee </span><span>charters and governing documents to determine if the company has codified a meaningful level of oversight of and </span><span>accountability for a company’s material environmental and social impacts.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Board Accountability for Climate-Related Issues</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We have updated our discussion of board accountability for climate-related issues, and how our policy is applied. In 2023, our </span><span>policy on this topic was applied to the largest, most significant emitters; however beginning in 2024, Glass Lewis will apply </span><span>this policy to companies in the S&amp;P 500 index operating in industries where the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board </span><span>(SASB) has determined that the companies’ GHG emissions represent a financially material risk, as well as companies where </span><span>we believe emissions or climate impacts, or stakeholder scrutiny thereof, represent an outsized, financially material risk.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We will assess whether such companies have produced disclosures in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on </span><span>Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). We have further clarified that we will also assess whether these companies </span><span>have disclosed explicit and clearly defined board-level oversight responsibilities for climate-related issues. In instances where </span><span>we find either of these disclosures to be absent of significantly lacking, we may recommend voting against responsible </span><span>directors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Clawback Provisions</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In light of new NYSE and Nasdaq listing requirements to comply with SEC Rule 10D-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of </span><span>1934, Glass Lewis has updated our views on the utility of clawback provisions. Although the negative impacts of excessive </span><span>risk-taking do not always result in financial restatements, they may nonetheless prove harmful to shareholder value. In </span><span>addition to meeting listing requirements, effective clawback policies should provide companies with the power to recoup </span><span>incentive compensation from an executive when there is evidence of problematic decisions or actions, such as material </span><span>misconduct, a material reputational failure, material risk management failure, or a material operational failure, the </span><span>consequences of which have not already been reflected in incentive payments and where recovery is warranted. Such power </span><span>to recoup should be provided regardless of whether the employment of the executive officer was terminated with or without </span><span>cause. In these circumstances, rationale should be provided if the company determines ultimately to refrain from recouping </span><span>compensation as well as disclosure of alternative measures that are instead pursued, such as the exercise of negative </span><span>discretion on future payments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Executive Ownership Guidelines</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We have added a discussion to formally outline our approach to executive ownership guidelines. We believe that companies </span><span>should facilitate an alignment between the interests of the executive leadership with those of long-term shareholders by </span><span>adopting and enforcing minimum share ownership rules for their named executive officers. Companies should provide clear </span><span>disclosure in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of the proxy statement of their executive share ownership </span><span>requirements and how various outstanding equity awards are treated when determining an executive’s level of ownership.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the process of determining an executive’s level of share ownership, counting unearned performance-based full value </span><span>awards and/or unexercised stock options is inappropriate. Companies should provide a cogent rationale should they count </span><span>these awards towards shares held by an executive.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Proposals for Equity Awards for Shareholders</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Regarding proposals seeking approval for individual equity awards, we have included new discussion of provisions that </span><span>require a non-vote, or vote of abstention, from a shareholder if the shareholder is also the recipient of the proposed grant. </span><span>Such provisions help to address potential conflict of interest issues and provide disinterested shareholders with more </span><span>meaningful say over the proposal. The inclusion of such provisions will be viewed positively during our holistic analysis, </span><span>especially when a vote from the recipient of the proposed grant would materially influence the passage of the proposal.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Net Operating Loss (NOL) Pills</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We have updated our discussion of NOL pills to include our concerns with acting in concert provisions. Over the past several </span><span>years, the terms and structures of NOL pills have evolved to include features such as acting in concert provisions, among </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-19</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>other concerning terms, that may disempower shareholders and insulate the board and management. When acting in </span><span>concert provisions are present within the terms of a NOL pill, we believe this may raise concerns as to the true objective of </span><span>the pill.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Acting in concert provisions broaden the definition of beneficial ownership to prohibit parallel conduct, or multiple </span><span>shareholders party to a formal or informal agreement collaborating to influence the board and management of a company, </span><span>and aggregate the ownership of such shareholders towards the triggering threshold.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As such, we have added the inclusion of an acting in concert provision and whether the pill is implemented following the </span><span>filing of a Schedule 13D by a shareholder or there is evidence of hostile activity or shareholder activism as part of our </span><span>considerations to recommend shareholders vote against a management proposed NOL pill.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Control Share Statutes</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We have added a new discussion outlining our approach to control share statutes. Certain states, including Delaware, have </span><span>adopted control share acquisition statutes as an anti-takeover defense for certain closed-end investment companies and </span><span>business development companies. Control share statutes may prevent changes in control by limiting voting rights of a person </span><span>that acquires the ownership of </span><span>“</span><span>control shares.</span><span>”</span><span> Control shares are shares of stock equal to or exceeding specified </span><span>percentages of company voting power, and a control share statute prevents shares in excess of the specified percentage from </span><span>being voted, unless: (i) the board approves them to be voted; or (ii) the holder of the </span><span>“</span><span>control shares</span><span>”</span><span> receives approval from </span><span>a supermajority of </span><span>“</span><span>non-interested</span><span>”</span><span> shareholders.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Depending on the state of incorporation, companies may automatically rely on control share statutes unless the fund’s board </span><span>of trustees eliminates the application of the control share statute to any or all fund share acquisitions, through adoption of a </span><span>provision in the fund's governing instrument or by fund board action alone. In certain other states, companies must adopt </span><span>control share statutes.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In our view, control share statues disenfranchise shareholders by reducing their voting power to a level less than their </span><span>economic interest and effectively function as an anti-takeover device. We believe all shareholders should have an opportunity </span><span>to vote all of their shares. Moreover, we generally believe anti-takeover measures prevent shareholders from receiving a buy-out</span><span> premium for their stock.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As such, we will generally recommend voting for proposals to opt out of control share acquisition statutes, unless doing so </span><span>would allow the completion of a takeover that is not in the best interests of shareholders; and recommend voting against </span><span>proposals to amend the charter to include control share acquisition provisions.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Further, in cases where a closed-end fund or business development company has received a public buyout offer and has </span><span>relied on a control share statute as a defense mechanism in the prior year, we will generally recommend shareholders vote </span><span>against the chair of the nominating and governance committee, absent a compelling rationale as to why a rejected </span><span>acquisition was not in the best interests of shareholders.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Clarifying Amendments</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The following clarifications of our existing policies are included this year:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Board Responsiveness</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We have clarified our discussion of board responsiveness to remove a reference to shareholder proposals from our discussion </span><span>of when 20% or more of shareholders vote contrary to management. In addition, we have clarified that our calculation of </span><span>opposition includes votes cast as either AGAINST and/or ABSTAIN.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Interlocking Directorships</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We have clarified our policy on interlocking directorships to reference that, on a case-by-case basis, we evaluate other types </span><span>of interlocking relationships, such as interlocks with close family members of executives or within group companies.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Board Gender Diversity</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-20</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>We have clarified our policy on board gender diversity to emphasize that when making these voting recommendations, we </span><span>will carefully review a company’s disclosure of its diversity considerations and may refrain from recommending that </span><span>shareholders vote against directors when boards have provided a sufficient rationale or plan to address the lack of diversity </span><span>on the board, including a timeline of when the board intends to appoint additional gender diverse directors (generally by the </span><span>next annual meeting or as soon as is reasonably practicable).</span></div> <div> <div><span>Underrepresented Community Diversity</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We have clarified our policy on underrepresented community diversity to emphasize that when making these voting </span><span>recommendations, we will carefully review a company’s disclosure of its diversity considerations and may refrain from </span><span>recommending that shareholders vote against directors when boards have provided a sufficient rationale or plan to address </span><span>the lack of diversity on the board, including a timeline of when the board intends to appoint additional directors from an </span><span>underrepresented community (generally by the next annual meeting or as soon as is reasonably practicable).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Furthermore, we have revised our definition of </span><span>“</span><span>underrepresented community director</span><span>”</span><span> to replace our reference to an </span><span>individual who self-identifies as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender with an individual who self-identifies as a member of </span><span>the LGBTQIA+ community.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Non-GAAP to GAAP Reconciliation Disclosure</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We have expanded the discussion of our approach to the use of non-GAAP measures in incentive programs in order to </span><span>emphasize the need for thorough and transparent disclosure in the proxy statement that will assist shareholders in </span><span>reconciling the difference between non-GAAP results used for incentive payout determinations and reported GAAP results. </span><span>Particularly in situations where significant adjustments were applied and materially impacts incentive pay outcomes, the lack </span><span>of such disclosure will impact Glass Lewis’ assessment of the quality of executive pay disclosure and may be a factor in our </span><span>recommendation for the say-on-pay.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Pay-Versus-Performance Disclosure</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We have revised our discussion of the pay-for-performance analysis to note that the pay-versus-performance disclosure </span><span>mandated by the SEC may be used as part of our supplemental quantitative assessments supporting our primary pay-for-performance</span><span> grade.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Company Responsiveness for Say-on-Pay Opposition</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For increased clarity, we amended our discussion of company responsiveness to significant levels of say-on-pay opposition to </span><span>note that our calculation of opposition includes votes cast as either AGAINST and/or ABSTAIN, with opposition of 20% or </span><span>higher treated as significant.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A Board of Directors that Serves Shareholder Interest</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Election of Directors</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The purpose of Glass Lewis’ proxy research and advice is to facilitate shareholder voting in favor of governance structures </span><span>that will drive performance, create shareholder value and maintain a proper tone at the top. Glass Lewis looks for talented </span><span>boards with a record of protecting shareholders and delivering value over the medium- and long-term. We believe that a </span><span>board can best protect and enhance the interests of shareholders if it is sufficiently independent, has a record of positive </span><span>performance, and consists of individuals with diverse backgrounds and a breadth and depth of relevant experience.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Independence</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The independence of directors, or lack thereof, is ultimately demonstrated through the decisions they make. In assessing the </span><span>independence of directors, we will take into consideration, when appropriate, whether a director has a track record indicative </span><span>of making objective decisions. Likewise, when assessing the independence of directors we will also examine when a </span><span>director’s track record on multiple boards indicates a lack of objective decision-making. Ultimately, we believe the </span><span>determination of whether a director is independent or not must take into consideration both compliance with the applicable </span><span>independence listing requirements as well as judgments made by the director.</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-21</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>We look at each director nominee to examine the director’s relationships with the company, the company’s executives, and </span><span>other directors. We do this to evaluate whether personal, familial, or financial relationships (not including director </span><span>compensation) may impact the director’s decisions. We believe that such relationships make it difficult for a director to put </span><span>shareholders’ interests above the director’s or the related party’s interests. We also believe that a director who owns more </span><span>than 20% of a company can exert disproportionate influence on the board, and therefore believe such a director’s </span><span>independence may be hampered, in particular when serving on the audit committee.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Thus, we put directors into three categories based on an examination of the type of relationship they have with the company:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Independent Director</span><span> — An independent director has no material financial, familial or other current relationships with </span><span>the company, its executives, or other board members, except for board service and standard fees paid for that service. </span><span>Relationships that existed within three to five years</span><span>1</span><span> before the inquiry are usually considered </span><span>“</span><span>current</span><span>”</span><span> for purposes of </span><span>this test. For material financial relationships with the company, we apply a three-year look back, and for former </span><span>employment relationships with the company, we apply a five-year look back.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Affiliated Director</span><span> — An affiliated director has, (or within the past three years, had) a material financial, familial or other </span><span>relationship with the company or its executives, but is not an employee of the company.</span><span>2</span><span> This includes directors whose </span><span>employers have a material financial relationship with the company.</span><span>3</span><span> In addition, we view a director who either owns or </span><span>controls 20% or more of the company’s voting stock, or is an employee or affiliate of an entity that controls such </span><span>amount, as an affiliate.</span><span>4</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We view 20% shareholders as affiliates because they typically have access to and involvement with the management of a </span><span>company that is fundamentally different from that of ordinary shareholders. More importantly, 20% holders may have </span><span>interests that diverge from those of ordinary holders, for reasons such as the liquidity (or lack thereof) of their holdings, </span><span>personal tax issues, etc.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis applies a three-year look back period to all directors who have an affiliation with the company other than former </span><span>employment, for which we apply a five-year look back.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Definition of </span><span>“</span><span>Material</span><span>”</span><span>: A material relationship is one in which the dollar value exceeds:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>$50,000 (or where no amount is disclosed) for directors who are paid for a service they have agreed</span> <br/><span> </span><span>to perform for the company, outside of their service as a director, including professional or other services. This </span><span>threshold also applies to directors who are the majority or principal owner of a firm that receives such payments; or</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>$120,000 (or where no amount is disclosed) for those directors employed by a professional services firm such as a </span><span>law firm, investment bank, or consulting firm and the company pays the firm, not the individual, for services. </span><span>5</span><span> This </span><span>dollar limit would also apply to charitable contributions to schools where a board member is a professor; or </span><span>charities where a director serves on the board or is an executive; </span><span>6</span><span> and any aircraft and real estate dealings between </span><span>the company and the director’s firm; or</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> <div><span>NASDAQ originally proposed a five-year look-back period but both it and the NYSE ultimately settled on a three-year look-back prior to finalizing their </span><span>rules. A five-year standard for former employment relationships is more appropriate, in our view, because we believe that the unwinding of conflicting </span><span>relationships between former management and board members is more likely to be complete and final after five years. However, Glass Lewis does not </span><span>apply the five-year look-back period to directors who have previously served as executives of the company on an interim basis for less than one year.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> <div><span>If a company does not consider a non-employee director to be independent, Glass Lewis will classify that director as an affiliate.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> <div><span>We allow a five-year grace period for former executives of the company or merged companies who have consulting agreements with the surviving </span><span>company. (We do not automatically recommend voting against directors in such cases for the first five years.) If the consulting agreement persists </span><span>after this five-year grace period, we apply the materiality thresholds outlined in the definition of </span><span>“</span><span>material.</span><span>”</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> <div><span>This includes a director who serves on a board as a representative (as part of his or her basic responsibilities) of an investment firm with greater than </span><span>20% ownership. However, while we will generally consider him/her to be affiliated, we will not recommend voting against unless (i) the investment </span><span>firm has disproportionate board representation or (ii) the director serves on the audit committee.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>5</span></div> <div><span>We may deem such a transaction to be immaterial where the amount represents less than 1% of the firm’s annual revenues and the board provides a </span><span>compelling rationale as to why the director’s independence is not affected by the relationship.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>6</span></div> <div><span>We will generally take into consideration the size and nature of such charitable entities in relation to the company’s size and industry along with any </span><span>other relevant factors such as the director’s role at the charity. However, unlike for other types of related party transactions, Glass Lewis generally </span><span>does not apply a look-back period to affiliated relationships involving charitable contributions; if the relationship between the director and the school </span><span>or charity ceases, or if the company discontinues its donations to the entity, we will consider the director to be independent.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-22</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

A </span><span>director is an affiliate if: i) he or she has a family member who is employed by the company and receives more than </span><span>$120,000</span><span>8</span><span> in annual compensation; or, ii) he or she has a family member who is employed by the company and the company </span><span>does not disclose this individual’s compensation.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Definition of </span><span>“</span><span>Company</span><span>”</span><span> — A company includes any parent or subsidiary in a group with the company or any entity that </span><span>merged with, was acquired by, or acquired the company.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Inside Director </span><span>— An inside director simultaneously serves as a director and as an employee of the company. This </span><span>category may include a board chair who acts as an employee of the company or is paid as an employee of the company. </span><span>In our view, an inside director who derives a greater amount of income as a result of affiliated transactions with the </span><span>company rather than through compensation paid by the company </span><span>(i.e.,</span><span> salary, bonus, etc. as a company employee) faces </span><span>a conflict between making decisions that are in the best interests of the company versus those in the director’s own best </span><span>interests. Therefore, we will recommend voting against such a director.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Additionally, we believe a director who is currently serving in an interim management position should be considered an </span><span>insider, while a director who previously served in an interim management position for less than one year and is no longer </span><span>serving in such capacity is considered independent. Moreover, a director who previously served in an interim management </span><span>position for over one year and is no longer serving in such capacity is considered an affiliate for five years following the date </span><span>of the director’s resignation or departure from the interim management position.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Voting Recommendations on the Basis of Board Independence</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis believes a board will be most effective in protecting shareholders’ interests if it is at least two-thirds independent. </span><span>We note that each of the Business Roundtable, the Conference Board, and the Council of Institutional Investors advocates </span><span>that two-thirds of the board be independent. Where more than one-third of the members are affiliated or inside directors, we </span><span>typically</span><span>9</span><span> recommend voting against some of the inside and/or affiliated directors in order to satisfy the two-thirds threshold.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the case of a less than two-thirds independent board, Glass Lewis strongly supports the existence of a presiding or lead </span><span>director with authority to set the meeting agendas and to lead sessions outside the insider chair’s presence.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, we scrutinize avowedly </span><span>“</span><span>independent</span><span>”</span><span> chairs and lead directors. We believe that they should be unquestionably </span><span>independent, or the company should not tout them as such.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Committee Independence</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We believe that only independent directors should serve on a company’s audit, compensation, nominating, and governance </span><span>committees. </span><span>10</span><span> We typically recommend that shareholders vote against any affiliated or inside director seeking appointment </span><span>to an audit, compensation, nominating, or governance committee, or who has served in that capacity in the past year.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Pursuant to Section 952 of the Dodd-Frank Act, as of January 11, 2013, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) </span><span>approved new listing requirements for both the NYSE and NASDAQ which require that boards apply enhanced standards of </span><span>independence when making an affirmative determination of the independence of compensation committee members. </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>7</span></div> <div><span>This includes cases where a director is employed by, or closely affiliated with, a private equity firm that profits from an acquisition made by the </span><span>company. Unless disclosure suggests otherwise, we presume the director is affiliated.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>8</span></div> <div><span>Pursuant to SEC rule Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act, compensation exceeding $120,000 is the minimum threshold </span><span>deemed material for disclosure of transactions involving family members of directors.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>9</span></div> <div><span>With a staggered board, if the affiliates or insiders that we believe should not be on the board are not up for election, we will express our concern </span><span>regarding those directors, but we will not recommend voting against the other affiliates or insiders who are up for election just to achieve two-thirds </span><span>independence. However, we will consider recommending voting against the directors subject to our concern at their next election if the issue giving </span><span>rise to the concern is not resolved.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> <div><span>We will recommend voting against an audit committee member who owns 20% or more of the company’s stock, and we believe that there should be </span><span>a maximum of one director (or no directors if the committee is composed of less than three directors) who owns 20% or more of the company’s </span><span>stock on the compensation, nominating, and governance committees.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-23</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Specifically, when making this determination, in addition to the factors considered when assessing general director </span><span>independence, the board’s considerations must include: (i) the source of compensation of the director, including any </span><span>consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee paid by the listed company to the director (the </span><span>“</span><span>Fees Factor</span><span>”</span><span>); and (ii) </span><span>whether the director is affiliated with the listing company, its subsidiaries, or affiliates of its subsidiaries (the </span><span>“</span><span>Affiliation </span><span>Factor</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis believes it is important for boards to consider these enhanced independence factors when assessing </span><span>compensation committee members. However, as discussed above in the section titled Independence, we apply our own </span><span>standards when assessing the independence of directors, and these standards also take into account consulting and advisory </span><span>fees paid to the director, as well as the director’s affiliations with the company and its subsidiaries and affiliates. We may </span><span>recommend voting against compensation committee members who are not independent based on our standards.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Independent Chair</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis believes that separating the roles of CEO (or, more rarely, another executive position) and chair creates a better </span><span>governance structure than a combined CEO/chair position. An executive manages the business according to a course the </span><span>board charts. Executives should report to the board regarding their performance in achieving goals set by the board. This is </span><span>needlessly complicated when a CEO chairs the board, since a CEO/chair presumably will have a significant influence over the </span><span>board.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>While many companies have an independent lead or presiding director who performs many of the same functions of an </span><span>independent chair (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, setting the board meeting agenda), we do not believe this alternate form of independent board </span><span>leadership provides as robust protection for shareholders as an independent chair.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>It can become difficult for a board to fulfill its role of overseer and policy setter when a CEO/chair controls the agenda and </span><span>the boardroom discussion. Such control can allow a CEO to have an entrenched position, leading to longer-than-optimal </span><span>terms, fewer checks on management, less scrutiny of the business operation, and limitations on independent, shareholder-focused</span><span> goal-setting by the board.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A CEO should set the strategic course for the company, with the board’s approval, and the board should enable the CEO to </span><span>carry out the CEO’s vision for accomplishing the board’s objectives. Failure to achieve the board’s objectives should lead the </span><span>board to replace that CEO with someone in whom the board has confidence.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Likewise, an independent chair can better oversee executives and set a pro-shareholder agenda without the management </span><span>conflicts that a CEO and other executive insiders often face. Such oversight and concern for shareholders allows for a more </span><span>proactive and effective board of directors that is better able to look out for the interests of shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Further, it is the board’s responsibility to select a chief executive who can best serve a company and its shareholders and to </span><span>replace this person when his or her duties have not been appropriately fulfilled. Such a replacement becomes more difficult </span><span>and happens less frequently when the chief executive is also in the position of overseeing the board.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis believes that the installation of an independent chair is almost always a positive step from a corporate </span><span>governance perspective and promotes the best interests of shareholders. Further, the presence of an independent chair </span><span>fosters the creation of a thoughtful and dynamic board, not dominated by the views of senior management. Encouragingly, </span><span>many companies appear to be moving in this direction — one study indicates that only 10 percent of incoming CEOs in 2014 </span><span>were awarded the chair title, versus 48 percent in 2002.</span><span>11</span><span> Another study finds that 53 percent of S&amp;P 500 boards now </span><span>separate the CEO and chair roles, up from 37 percent in 2009, although the same study found that only 34 percent of S&amp;P </span><span>500 boards have truly independent chairs.</span><span>12</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We do not recommend that shareholders vote against CEOs who chair the board. However, we typically recommend that our </span><span>clients support separating the roles of chair and CEO whenever that question is posed in a proxy (typically in the form of a </span><span>shareholder proposal), as we believe that it is in the long-term best interests of the company and its shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Further, where the company has neither an independent chair nor independent lead director, we will recommend voting </span><span>against the chair of the governance committee.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>11</span></div> <div><span>Ken Favaro, Per-Ola Karlsson and Gary L.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Performance</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>The most crucial test of a board’s commitment to the company and its shareholders lies in the actions of the board and its </span><span>members. We look at the performance of these individuals as directors and executives of the company and of other </span><span>companies where they have served.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We find that a director’s past conduct is often indicative of future conduct and performance. We often find directors with a </span><span>history of overpaying executives or of serving on boards where avoidable disasters have occurred serving on the boards of </span><span>companies with similar problems. Glass Lewis has a proprietary database of directors serving at over 8,000 of the most </span><span>widely held U.S. companies. We use this database to track the performance of directors across companies.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Voting Recommendations on the Basis of Performance</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We typically recommend that shareholders vote against directors who have served on boards or as executives of companies </span><span>with records of poor performance, inadequate risk oversight, excessive compensation, audit- or accounting-related issues, </span><span>and/or other indicators of mismanagement or actions against the interests of</span> <br/><span> </span><span>shareholders. We will reevaluate such directors based on, among other factors, the length of time passed since the incident </span><span>giving rise to the concern, shareholder support for the director, the severity of the issue, the</span> <br/><span> </span><span>director’s role (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, committee membership), director tenure at the subject company, whether ethical lapses accompanied </span><span>the oversight lapse, and evidence of strong oversight at other companies.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Likewise, we examine the backgrounds of those who serve on key board committees to ensure that they have the required </span><span>skills and diverse backgrounds to make informed judgments about the subject matter for which the committee is </span><span>responsible.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We believe shareholders should avoid electing directors who have a record of not fulfilling their responsibilities to </span><span>shareholders at any company where they have held a board or executive position. We typically recommend voting against:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1.</span></div> <div><span>A director who fails to attend a minimum of 75% of board and applicable committee meetings, calculated in the </span><span>aggregate. </span><span>13</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>2.</span></div> <div><span>A director who belatedly filed a significant form(s) 4 or 5, or who has a pattern of late filings if the late filing was the </span><span>director’s fault (we look at these late filing situations on a case-by-case basis).</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>3.</span></div> <div><span>A director who is also the CEO of a company where a serious and material restatement has occurred after the CEO had </span><span>previously certified the pre-restatement financial statements.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>4.</span></div> <div><span>A director who has received two against recommendations from Glass Lewis for identical reasons within the prior year </span><span>at different companies (the same situation must also apply at the company being analyzed).</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Furthermore, with consideration given to the company’s overall corporate governance, pay-for-performance alignment and </span><span>board responsiveness to shareholders, we may recommend voting against directors who served throughout a period in </span><span>which the company performed significantly worse than peers and the directors have not taken reasonable steps to address </span><span>the poor performance.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Board Responsiveness</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis believes that boards should be responsive to shareholders when a significant percentage of shareholders vote </span><span>contrary to the recommendation of management, depending on the issue.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When 20% of more of shareholders vote contrary to management (which occurs when more than 20% of votes on the </span><span>proposal are cast as AGAINST and/or ABSTAIN), we believe that boards should engage with shareholders on the issue and </span><span>demonstrate some initial level of responsiveness. These include instances when 20% or more of shareholders:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>(i)</span></div> <div><span>withhold votes from (or vote against) a director nominee; or</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>(ii)</span></div> <div><span>vote against a management-sponsored proposal.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>13</span></div> <div><span>However, where a director has served for less than one full year, we will typically not recommend voting against for failure to attend 75% of meetings. </span><span>Rather, we will note the poor attendance with a recommendation to track this issue going forward. We will also refrain from recommending to vote </span><span>against directors when the proxy discloses that the director missed the meetings due to serious illness or other extenuating circumstances.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-25</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>In our view, a 20% threshold is significant enough to warrant a close examination of the underlying issues and an evaluation </span><span>of whether the board responded appropriately following the vote, particularly in the case of a compensation or director </span><span>election proposal. While the 20% threshold alone will not automatically generate a negative vote recommendation from </span><span>Glass Lewis on a future proposal (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, to recommend against a director nominee, against a say-on-pay proposal, etc.), it may </span><span>be a contributing factor to our recommendation to vote against management’s recommendation in the event we determine </span><span>that the board did not respond appropriately.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>When a majority of shareholders vote contrary to management, we believe that boards should engage with shareholders on </span><span>the issue and provide a more robust response to fully address shareholder concerns. These include instances when a </span><span>majority or more of shareholders:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>(i)</span></div> <div><span>withhold votes from (or vote against) a director nominee;</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>(ii)</span></div> <div><span>vote against a management-sponsored proposal; or</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>(iii)</span></div> <div><span>vote for a shareholder proposal.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the case of shareholder proposals, we believe clear action is warranted when such proposals receive support from a </span><span>majority of votes cast (excluding abstentions and broker non-votes). In our view, this may include fully implementing the </span><span>request of the shareholder proposal and/or engaging with shareholders on the issue and providing sufficient disclosures to </span><span>address shareholder concerns.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>At controlled companies and companies that have multi-class share structures with unequal voting rights, we will carefully </span><span>examine the level of approval or disapproval attributed to unaffiliated shareholders when determining whether board </span><span>responsiveness is warranted. In the case of companies that have multi-class share structures with unequal voting rights, we </span><span>will generally examine the level of approval or disapproval attributed to unaffiliated shareholders on a </span><span>“</span><span>one share, one vote</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>basis. At controlled and multi-class companies, when at least 20% or more of unaffiliated shareholders vote contrary to </span><span>management, we believe that boards should engage with shareholders and demonstrate some initial level of responsiveness, </span><span>and when a majority or more of unaffiliated shareholders vote contrary to management, we believe that boards should </span><span>engage with shareholders and provide a more robust response to address shareholder concerns.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As a general framework, our evaluation of board responsiveness involves a review of publicly available disclosures (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, the </span><span>proxy statement, annual report, 8-Ks, company website, etc.) released following the date of the company’s last annual </span><span>meeting up through the publication date of our most current Proxy Paper.

As such, many of our committee-specific voting recommendations are against the applicable </span><span>committee chair rather than the entire committee (depending on the seriousness of the issue). In cases where the committee </span><span>chair is not up for election due to a staggered board, and where we have identified multiple concerns, we will generally </span><span>recommend voting against other members of the committee who are up for election, on a case-by-case basis.</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-26</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>In cases where we would ordinarily recommend voting against a committee chair but the chair is not specified, we apply the </span><span>following general rules, which apply throughout our guidelines:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>If there is no committee chair, we recommend voting against the longest-serving committee member or, if the </span><span>longest-serving committee member cannot be determined, the longest-serving board member serving on the </span><span>committee (</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> in either case, the </span><span>“</span><span>senior director</span><span>”</span><span>); and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>If there is no committee chair, but multiple senior directors serving on the committee, we recommend voting </span><span>against both (or all) such senior directors.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>In our view, companies should provide clear disclosure of which director is charged with overseeing each committee. In cases </span><span>where that simple framework is ignored and a reasonable analysis cannot determine which committee member is the </span><span>designated leader, we believe shareholder action against the longest serving committee member(s) is warranted. Again, this </span><span>only applies if we would ordinarily recommend voting against the committee chair but there is either no such position or no </span><span>designated director in such role.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Audit Committees and Performance</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Audit committees play an integral role in overseeing the financial reporting process because stable capital markets depend </span><span>on reliable, transparent, and objective financial information to support an efficient and effective capital market process. Audit </span><span>committees play a vital role in providing this disclosure to shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When assessing an audit committee’s performance, we are aware that an audit committee does not prepare financial </span><span>statements, is not responsible for making the key judgments and assumptions that affect the financial statements, and does </span><span>not audit the numbers or the disclosures provided to investors. Rather, an audit committee member monitors and oversees </span><span>the process and procedures that management and auditors perform. The 1999 Report and Recommendations of the Blue </span><span>Ribbon Committee on Improving the Effectiveness of Corporate Audit Committees stated it best:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A proper and well-functioning system exists, therefore, when the three main groups responsible for financial reporting — </span><span>the full board including the audit committee, financial management including the internal auditors, and the outside </span><span>auditors — form a ‘three legged stool’ that supports responsible financial disclosure and active participatory oversight. </span><span>However, in the view of the Committee, the audit committee must be ‘first among equals’ in this process, since the audit </span><span>committee is an extension of the full board and hence the ultimate monitor of the process.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Standards for Assessing the Audit Committee</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For an audit committee to function effectively on investors’ behalf, it must include members with sufficient knowledge to </span><span>diligently carry out their responsibilities. In its audit and accounting recommendations, the Conference Board Commission on </span><span>Public Trust and Private Enterprise said </span><span>“</span><span>members of the audit committee must be independent and have both knowledge </span><span>and experience in auditing financial matters.</span><span>”</span><span>14</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We are skeptical of audit committees where there are members that lack expertise as a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), </span><span>Chief Financial Officer (CFO) or corporate controller, or similar experience. While we will not necessarily recommend voting </span><span>against members of an audit committee when such expertise is lacking, we are more likely to recommend voting against </span><span>committee members when a problem such as a restatement occurs and such expertise is lacking.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis generally assesses audit committees against the decisions they make with respect to their oversight and </span><span>monitoring role. The quality and integrity of the financial statements and earnings reports, the completeness of disclosures </span><span>necessary for investors to make informed decisions, and the effectiveness of the internal controls should provide reasonable </span><span>assurance that the financial statements are materially free from errors. The independence of the external auditors and the </span><span>results of their work all provide useful information by which to assess the audit committee.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When assessing the decisions and actions of the audit committee, we typically defer to its judgment and generally </span><span>recommend voting in favor of its members. However, we will consider recommending that shareholders vote against the </span><span>following:</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>14</span></div> <div><span>Commission on Public Trust and Private Enterprise.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>We also take a dim view of audit committee reports that are boilerplate, and which provide little or no information or </span><span>transparency to investors. When a problem such as a material weakness, restatement or late filings occurs, in forming our </span><span>judgment with respect to the audit committee we take into consideration the transparency of the audit committee report.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Compensation Committee Performance</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Compensation committees have a critical role in determining the compensation of executives. This includes deciding the </span><span>basis on which compensation is determined, as well as the amounts and types of compensation</span> <br/><span> </span><span>to be paid. This process begins with the hiring and initial establishment of employment agreements, including the terms for </span><span>such items as pay, pensions and severance arrangements. It is important in establishing compensation arrangements that </span><span>compensation be consistent with, and based on the long-term economic performance of, the business’s long-term </span><span>shareholders returns.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Compensation committees are also responsible for the oversight of the transparency of compensation. This oversight </span><span>includes disclosure of compensation arrangements, the matrix used in assessing pay for performance, and the use of </span><span>compensation consultants. In order to ensure the independence of the board’s compensation consultant, we believe the </span><span>compensation committee should only engage a compensation consultant that is not</span> <br/><span> </span><span>also providing any services to the company or management apart from their contract with the compensation committee. It is </span><span>important to investors that they have clear and complete disclosure of all the significant terms of compensation </span><span>arrangements in order to make informed decisions with respect to the oversight and decisions of the compensation </span><span>committee.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Finally, compensation committees are responsible for oversight of internal controls over the executive compensation process. </span><span>This includes controls over gathering information used to determine compensation, establishment of equity award plans, and </span><span>granting of equity awards. For example, the use of a compensation consultant who maintains a business relationship with </span><span>company management may cause the committee to make decisions based on information that is compromised by the </span><span>consultant’s conflict of interests. Lax controls can also contribute to improper awards of compensation such as through </span><span>granting of backdated or spring-loaded options, or granting of bonuses when triggers for bonus payments have not been </span><span>met.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Central to understanding the actions of compensation committee is a careful review of the CD&amp;A report included in each </span><span>company’s proxy. We review the CD&amp;A in our evaluation of the overall compensation practices of a company, as overseen by </span><span>the compensation committee. The CD&amp;A is also integral to the evaluation of compensation proposals at companies, such as </span><span>advisory votes on executive compensation, which allow shareholders to vote on the compensation paid to a company’s top </span><span>executives.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When assessing the performance of compensation committees, we will consider recommending that shareholders vote </span><span>against the following:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1. </span></div> <div><span>All members of a compensation committee during whose tenure the committee failed to address shareholder concerns </span><span>following majority shareholder rejection of the say-on-pay proposal in the previous year. Where the proposal was </span><span>approved but there was a significant shareholder vote (</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> greater than 20% of votes cast) against the say-on-pay </span><span>proposal in the prior year, if the board did not respond sufficiently to the vote including actively engaging shareholders </span><span>on this issue, we will also consider recommending voting against the chair of the compensation committee or all </span><span>members of the compensation committee, depending on the severity and history of the compensation problems and </span><span>the level of shareholder opposition.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>2. </span></div> <div><span>All members of the compensation committee who are up for election and served when the company failed to align pay </span><span>with performance if shareholders are not provided with an advisory vote on executive compensation at the annual </span><span>meeting.</span><span>20</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>3. </span></div> <div><span>Any member of the compensation committee who has served on the compensation committee of at least two other </span><span>public companies that have consistently failed to align pay with performance and whose oversight of compensation at </span><span>the company in question is suspect.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>20</span></div> <div><span>If a company provides shareholders with a say-on-pay proposal, we will initially only recommend voting against the company's say-on-pay proposal </span><span>and will not recommend voting against the members of the compensation committee unless there is a pattern of failing to align pay and performance </span><span>and/or the company exhibits egregious compensation practices. For cases in which the disconnect between pay and performance is marginal and </span><span>the company has outperformed its peers, we will consider not recommending against compensation committee members.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-30</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, we may consider recommending shareholders vote against the chair of the nominating committee where the </span><span>board’s failure to ensure the board has directors with relevant experience, either through periodic director assessment or </span><span>board refreshment, has contributed to a company’s poor performance.

Sound risk </span><span>management, while necessary at all companies, is particularly important at financial firms which inherently maintain </span><span>significant exposure to financial risk. We believe such financial firms should have a chief risk officer reporting directly to the </span><span>board and a dedicated risk committee or a committee of the board charged with risk oversight. Moreover, many non-financial </span><span>firms maintain strategies which involve a high level of exposure to financial risk. Similarly, since many non-financial firms </span><span>have complex hedging or trading strategies, those firms should also have a chief risk officer and a risk committee.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Our views on risk oversight are consistent with those expressed by various regulatory bodies. In its December 2009 Final Rule </span><span>release on Proxy Disclosure Enhancements, the SEC noted that risk oversight is a key competence of the board and that </span><span>additional disclosures would improve investor and shareholder understanding of the role of the board in the organization’s </span><span>risk management practices. The final rules, which became effective on February 28, 2010, now explicitly require companies </span><span>and mutual funds to describe (while allowing for some degree of flexibility) the board’s role in the oversight of risk.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When analyzing the risk management practices of public companies, we take note of any significant losses or writedowns on </span><span>financial assets and/or structured transactions. In cases where a company has disclosed a sizable loss or writedown, and </span><span>where we find that the company’s board-level risk committee’s poor oversight contributed to the loss, we will recommend </span><span>that shareholders vote against such committee members on that basis. In addition, in cases where a company maintains a </span><span>significant level of financial risk exposure but fails to disclose any explicit form of board-level risk oversight (committee or </span><span>otherwise),</span><span>29 </span><span>we will consider recommending to vote against the board chair on that basis. However, we generally would not </span><span>recommend voting against a combined chair/CEO, except in egregious cases.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Board Oversight of Environmental and Social Issues</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis recognizes the importance of ensuring the sustainability of companies’ operations. We believe that insufficient </span><span>oversight of material environmental and social issues can present direct legal, financial, regulatory and reputational risks that </span><span>could serve to harm shareholder interests. Therefore, we believe that these issues should be carefully monitored and </span><span>managed by companies, and that all companies should have an appropriate oversight structure in place to ensure that they </span><span>are mitigating attendant risks and capitalizing on related opportunities to the best extent possible.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>To that end, Glass Lewis believes that companies should ensure that boards maintain clear oversight of material risks to their </span><span>operations, including those that are environmental and social in nature. These risks could include, but are not limited to, </span><span>matters related to climate change, human capital management, diversity, stakeholder relations, and health, safety &amp; </span><span>environment. Given the importance of the board’s role in overseeing environmental and social risks, we believe this </span><span>responsibility should be formally designated and codified in the appropriate committee charters or other governing </span><span>documents.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>While we believe that it is important that these issues are overseen at the board level and that shareholders are afforded </span><span>meaningful disclosure of these oversight responsibilities, we believe that companies should determine the best structure for </span><span>this oversight. In our view, this oversight can be effectively conducted by specific directors, the entire board, a separate </span><span>committee, or combined with the responsibilities of a key committee.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For companies in the Russell 3000 index and in instances where we identify material oversight concerns, Glass Lewis will </span><span>review a company’s overall governance practices and identify which directors or board-level committees have been charged </span><span>with oversight of environmental and/or social issues. Furthermore, given the importance of the board’s role in overseeing </span><span>environmental and social risks, Glass Lewis will generally recommend voting against the governance committee chair of a </span><span>company in the Russell 1000 index that fails to provide explicit disclosure concerning the board’s role in overseeing these </span><span>issues.</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>29</span></div> <div><span>A committee responsible for risk management could be a dedicated risk committee, the audit committee, or the finance committee, depending on a </span><span>given company’s board structure and method of disclosure. At some companies, the entire board is charged with risk management.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-34</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>When evaluating the board’s role in overseeing environmental and/or social issues, we will examine a company’s committee </span><span>charters and governing documents to determine if the company has codified and maintained a meaningful level of oversight </span><span>of and accountability for a company’s material environmental and social impacts.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Cyber Risk Oversight</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Companies and consumers are exposed to a growing risk of cyber-attacks. These attacks can result in customer or employee </span><span>data breaches, harm to a company’s reputation, significant fines or penalties, and interruption to a company’s operations. </span><span>Further, in some instances, cyber breaches can result in national security concerns, such as those impacting companies </span><span>operating as utilities, defense contractors, and energy companies.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In response to these issues, regulators have increasingly been focused on ensuring companies are providing appropriate and </span><span>timely disclosures and protections to stakeholders that could have been adversely impacted by a breach in a company’s cyber </span><span>infrastructure.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>On July 26, 2023, the SEC approved final rules requiring public companies to report cybersecurity incidents deemed material </span><span>within four days of identifying them, detailing their nature, scope, timing, and material impact under Item 1.05 on Form 8-K.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Furthermore, in annual reports, companies must disclose their processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material </span><span>cybersecurity risks, along with their material effects; and describe whether any risks from prior incidents have materially </span><span>affected its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition (or are reasonably likely to), pursuant to Regulation </span><span>S-K Item 106. Item 106 will also require registrants to describe the board of directors’ oversight of risks from cybersecurity </span><span>threats and management’s role and expertise in assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. Similar </span><span>rules were also adopted for foreign private issuers. The final rules became effective on September 5, 2023.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Given the regulatory focus on, and the potential adverse outcomes from, cyber-related issues, it is our view that cyber risk is </span><span>material for all companies. We therefore believe that it is critical that companies evaluate and mitigate these risks to the </span><span>greatest extent possible. With that view, we encourage all issuers to provide clear disclosure concerning the role of the board </span><span>in overseeing issues related to cybersecurity, including how companies are ensuring directors are fully versed on this rapidly </span><span>evolving and dynamic issue. We believe such disclosure can help shareholders understand the seriousness with which </span><span>companies take this issue.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the absence of material cyber incidents, we will generally not make voting recommendations on the basis of a company’s </span><span>oversight or disclosure concerning cyber-related issues. However, in instances where cyber-attacks have caused significant </span><span>harm to shareholders we will closely evaluate the board’s oversight of cybersecurity as well as the company’s response and </span><span>disclosures.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Moreover, in instances where a company has been materially impacted by a cyber-attack, we believe shareholders can </span><span>reasonably expect periodic updates communicating the company’s ongoing progress towards resolving and remediating the </span><span>impact of the cyber-attack. We generally believe shareholders are best served when such updates include (but are not </span><span>necessarily limited to) details such as when the company has fully restored its information systems, when the company has </span><span>returned to normal operations, what resources the company is providing for affected stakeholders, and any other potentially </span><span>relevant information, until the company considers the impact of the cyber-attack to be fully remediated. These disclosures </span><span>should focus on the company’s response to address the impacts to affected stakeholders and should not reveal specific </span><span>and/or technical details that could impede the company’s response or remediation of the incident or that could assist threat </span><span>actors.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In such instances, we may recommend against appropriate directors should we find the board’s oversight, response or </span><span>disclosure concerning cybersecurity-related issues to be insufficient, or are not provided to shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Board Accountability for Environmental and Social Performance</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis carefully monitors companies’ performance with respect to environmental and social issues, including those </span><span>related to climate and human capital management. In situations where we believe that a company has not properly managed </span><span>or mitigated material environmental or social risks to the detriment of shareholder value, or when such mismanagement has </span><span>threatened shareholder value, Glass Lewis may recommend that shareholders vote against the members of the board who </span><span>are responsible for oversight of environmental and social risks. In the absence of explicit board oversight of environmental </span><span>and social issues, Glass Lewis may recommend that shareholders vote against members of the audit committee.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>these determinations, Glass Lewis will carefully review the situation, its effect on shareholder value, as well as any corrective </span><span>action or other response made by the company.</span></div> <div> <div><span>For more information on how Glass Lewis evaluates environmental and social issues, please see Glass Lewis’ Overall </span><span>Approach to ESG as well as our comprehensive Proxy Paper Guidelines for Shareholder Proposals &amp; ESG-Related Issues, </span><span>available at </span><span>www.glasslewis.com/voting-policies-current/</span><span>.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Board Accountability for Climate-related Issues</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Given the exceptionally broad impacts of a changing climate on companies, the economy, and society in general, we view </span><span>climate risk as a material risk for all companies. We therefore believe that boards should be considering and evaluating their </span><span>operational resilience under lower-carbon scenarios. While all companies maintain exposure to climate-related risks, we </span><span>believe that additional consideration should be given to, and that disclosure should be provided by those companies whose </span><span>GHG emissions represent a financially material risk.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We believe that companies with this increased risk exposure should provide clear and comprehensive disclosure regarding </span><span>these risks, including how they are being mitigated and overseen. We believe such information is crucial to allow investors to </span><span>understand the company’s management of this issue, as well as the impact of a lower carbon future on the company’s </span><span>operations.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In line with this view, Glass Lewis will carefully examine the climate-related disclosures provided by companies in the S&amp;P </span><span>500 index with material exposure to climate risk stemming from their own operations</span><span>30</span><span>, as well as companies where we </span><span>believe emissions or climate impacts, or stakeholder scrutiny thereof, represent an outsized, financially material risk, in order </span><span>to assess whether they have produced disclosures in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related </span><span>Financial Disclosures (TCFD). We will also assess whether these companies have disclosed explicit and clearly defined board-level</span><span> oversight responsibilities for climate-related issues. In instances where we find either (or both) of these disclosures to be </span><span>absent or significantly lacking, we may recommend voting against the chair of the committee (or board) charged with </span><span>oversight of climate-related issues, or if no committee has been charged with such oversight, the chair of the governance </span><span>committee. Further, we may extend our recommendation on this basis to additional members of the responsible committee </span><span>in cases where the committee chair is not standing for election due to a classified board, or based on other factors, including </span><span>the company’s size, industry and its overall governance profile.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Director Commitments</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We believe that directors should have the necessary time to fulfill their duties to shareholders. In our view, an overcommitted </span><span>director can pose a material risk to a company’s shareholders, particularly during periods of crisis. In addition, recent </span><span>research indicates that the time commitment associated with being a director has been on a significant upward trend in the </span><span>past decade.</span><span>31</span><span> As a result, we generally recommend that shareholders vote against a director who serves as an executive </span><span>officer (other than executive chair) of any public company</span><span>32</span><span> while serving on more than one external public company board, </span><span>a director who serves as an executive chair of any public company while serving on more than two external public company </span><span>boards, and any other director who serves on more than five public company boards.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Because we believe that executives will primarily devote their attention to executive duties, we generally will not recommend </span><span>that shareholders vote against overcommitted directors at the companies where they serve as an executive.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When determining whether a director’s service on an excessive number of boards may limit the ability of the director to </span><span>devote sufficient time to board duties, we may consider relevant factors such as the size and location of the other companies </span><span>where the director serves on the board, the director’s board roles at the companies in question, whether the director serves </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>30</span></div> <div><span>This policy will generally apply to companies in the following SASB-defined industries: agricultural products, air freight &amp; logistics, airlines, chemicals, </span><span>construction materials, containers &amp; packaging, cruise lines, electric utilities &amp; power generators, food retailers &amp; distributors, health care distributors, </span><span>iron &amp; steel producers, marine transportation, meat, poultry &amp; dairy, metals &amp; mining, non-alcoholic beverages, oil &amp; gas, pulp &amp; paper products, rail </span><span>transportation, road transportation, semiconductors, waste management.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>31</span></div> <div><span>For example, the 2015-2016 NACD Public Company Governance Survey states that, on average, directors spent a total of 248.2 hours annual on </span><span>board-related matters during the past year, which it describes as a </span><span>“</span><span>historically high level</span><span>”</span><span> that is significantly above the average hours recorded in </span><span>2006. Additionally, the 2020 Spencer Stuart Board Index indicates that, while 39% of S&amp;P 500 CEOs serve on one additional public board, just 2% of </span><span>S&amp;P 500 CEOs serve on two additional public boards and only one CEO serves on three.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>32</span></div> <div><span>When the executive officer in question serves only as an executive at a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) we will generally apply the higher </span><span>threshold of five public company directorships.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-36</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

In the case of directors who serve in executive roles other than CEO (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, executive </span><span>chair), we will evaluate the specific duties and responsibilities of that role in determining whether an exception is warranted.</span></div> <div> <div><span>We may also refrain from recommending against certain directors if the company provides sufficient rationale for their </span><span>continued board service. The rationale should allow shareholders to evaluate the scope of the directors’ other commitments, </span><span>as well as their contributions to the board including specialized knowledge of the company’s industry, strategy or key </span><span>markets, the diversity of skills, perspective and background they provide, and other relevant factors. We will also generally </span><span>refrain from recommending to vote against a director who serves on an excessive number of boards within a consolidated </span><span>group of companies in related industries, or a director that represents a firm whose sole purpose is to manage a portfolio of </span><span>investments which include the company.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Other Considerations</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition to the three key characteristics — independence, performance, experience — that we use to evaluate board </span><span>members, we consider conflict-of-interest issues as well as the size of the board of directors when making voting </span><span>recommendations.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Conflicts of Interest</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We believe board members should be wholly free of identifiable and substantial conflicts of interest, regardless of the overall </span><span>level of independent directors on the board. Accordingly, we recommend that shareholders vote against the following types </span><span>of directors:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1. </span></div> <div><span>A CFO who is on the board: In our view, the CFO holds a unique position relative to financial reporting and disclosure to </span><span>shareholders. Due to the critical importance of financial disclosure and reporting, we believe the CFO should report to </span><span>the board and not be a member of it.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>2. </span></div> <div><span>A director who provides — or a director who has an immediate family member who provides — material consulting or </span><span>other material professional services to the company. These services may include legal, consulting,</span><span>33</span><span> or financial </span><span>services. We question the need for the company to have consulting relationships with its directors. We view such </span><span>relationships as creating conflicts for directors, since they may be forced to weigh their own interests against </span><span>shareholder interests when making board decisions. In addition, a company’s decisions regarding where to turn for the </span><span>best professional services may be compromised when doing business with the professional services firm of one of the </span><span>company’s directors.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>3. </span></div> <div><span>A director, or a director who has an immediate family member, engaging in airplane, real estate, or similar deals, </span><span>including perquisite-type grants from the company, amounting to more than $50,000. Directors who receive these </span><span>sorts of payments from the company will have to make unnecessarily complicated decisions that may pit their interests </span><span>against shareholder interests.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>4. </span></div> <div><span>Interlocking directorships: CEOs or other top executives who serve on each other’s boards create an interlock that </span><span>poses conflicts that should be avoided to ensure the promotion of shareholder interests above all else.</span><span>34</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>5. </span></div> <div><span>All board members who served at a time when a poison pill with a term of longer than one year was adopted without </span><span>shareholder approval within the prior twelve months.</span><span>35</span><span> In the event a board is classified and shareholders are therefore </span><span>unable to vote against all directors, we will recommend voting against the remaining directors the next year they are up </span><span>for a shareholder vote. If a poison pill with a term of one year or less was adopted without shareholder approval, and </span><span>without adequate justification, we will consider recommending that shareholders vote against all members of the </span><span>governance committee. If the board has, without seeking shareholder approval, and without adequate justification, </span><span>extended the term of a poison pill by one year or less in two consecutive years, we will consider recommending that </span><span>shareholders vote against the entire board.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>33</span></div> <div><span>We will generally refrain from recommending against a director who provides consulting services for the company if the director is excluded from </span><span>membership on the board’s key committees and we have not identified significant governance concerns with the board.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>34</span></div> <div><span>We do not apply a look-back period for this situation. The interlock policy applies to both public and private companies. On a case-by-case basis, we </span><span>evaluate other types of interlocking relationships, such as interlocks with close family members of executives or within group companies. Further, we </span><span>will also evaluate multiple board interlocks among non-insiders (</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> multiple directors serving on the same boards at other companies), for evidence </span><span>of a pattern of poor oversight.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>35</span></div> <div><span>Refer to the </span><span>“</span><span>Governance Structure and the Shareholder Franchise</span><span>”</span><span> section for further discussion of our policies regarding anti-takeover measures, </span><span>including poison pills.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-37</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Size of the Board of Directors</span></div> <div> <div><span>While we do not believe there is a universally applicable optimal board size, we do believe boards should have at least five </span><span>directors to ensure sufficient diversity in decision-making and to enable the formation of key board committees with </span><span>independent directors. Conversely, we believe that boards with more than 20 members will typically suffer under the weight </span><span>of </span><span>“</span><span>too many cooks in the kitchen</span><span>”</span><span> and have difficulty reaching consensus and</span> <br/><span> </span><span>making timely decisions. Sometimes the presence of too many voices can make it difficult to draw on the wisdom and </span><span>experience in the room by virtue of the need to limit the discussion so that each voice may be heard.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>To that end, we typically recommend voting against the chair of the nominating committee (or the governance committee, in </span><span>the absence of a nominating committee) at a board with fewer than five directors or more than 20 directors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Controlled Companies</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We believe controlled companies warrant certain exceptions to our independence standards. The board’s function is to </span><span>protect shareholder interests; however, when an individual, entity (or group of shareholders party to a formal agreement) </span><span>owns more than 50% of the voting shares, the interests of the majority of shareholders are the interests of that entity or </span><span>individual. Consequently, Glass Lewis does not apply our usual two-thirds board independence rule and therefore we will not </span><span>recommend voting against boards whose composition reflects the makeup of the shareholder population.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Independence Exceptions</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The independence exceptions that we make for controlled companies are as follows:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1. </span></div> <div><span>We do not require that controlled companies have boards that are at least two-thirds independent. So long as the </span><span>insiders and/or affiliates are connected with the controlling entity, we accept the presence of non-independent board </span><span>members.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>2. </span></div> <div><span>The compensation committee and nominating and governance committees do not need to consist solely of </span><span>independent directors.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>We believe that standing nominating and corporate governance committees at controlled companies are </span><span>unnecessary. Although having a committee charged with the duties of searching for, selecting, and </span><span>nominating independent directors can be beneficial, the unique composition of a controlled company’s </span><span>shareholder base makes such committees weak and irrelevant.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Likewise, we believe that independent compensation committees at controlled companies are </span><span>unnecessary. Although independent directors are the best choice for approving and monitoring</span> <br/><span> </span><span>senior executives’ pay, controlled companies serve a unique shareholder population whose voting power </span><span>ensures the protection of its interests. As such, we believe that having affiliated directors on a controlled </span><span>company’s compensation committee is acceptable. However, given that a controlled company has certain </span><span>obligations to minority shareholders we feel that an insider should not serve on the compensation </span><span>committee. Therefore, Glass Lewis will recommend voting against any insider (the CEO or otherwise) </span><span>serving on the compensation committee.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>3. </span></div> <div><span>Controlled companies do not need an independent chair or an independent lead or presiding director. Although an </span><span>independent director in a position of authority on the board — such as chair or presiding director — can best carry out </span><span>the board’s duties, controlled companies serve a unique shareholder population whose voting power ensures the </span><span>protection of its interests.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Size of the Board of Directors</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We have no board size requirements for controlled companies.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Audit Committee Independence</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Despite a controlled company’s status, unlike for the other key committees, we nevertheless believe that audit committees </span><span>should consist solely of independent directors. Regardless of a company’s controlled status, the interests of all shareholders </span><span>must be protected by ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the company’s financial statements. Allowing affiliated directors </span><span>to oversee the preparation of financial reports could create an insurmountable conflict of interest.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-38</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Board Responsiveness at Multi-Class Companies</span></div> <div> <div><span>At controlled companies and companies that have multi-class share structures with unequal voting rights, we will carefully </span><span>examine the level of approval or disapproval attributed to unaffiliated shareholders when determining whether board </span><span>responsiveness is warranted. In the case of companies that have multi-class share structures with unequal voting rights, we </span><span>will generally examine the level of approval or disapproval attributed to unaffiliated shareholders on a </span><span>“</span><span>one share, one vote</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>basis. At controlled and multi-class companies, when at least 20% or more of unaffiliated shareholders vote contrary to </span><span>management, we believe that boards should engage with shareholders and demonstrate some initial level of responsiveness, </span><span>and when a majority or more of unaffiliated shareholders vote contrary to management we believe that boards should </span><span>engage with shareholders and provide a more robust response to fully address shareholder concerns.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Significant Shareholders</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Where an individual or entity holds between 20-50% of a company’s voting power, we believe it is reasonable to allow </span><span>proportional representation on the board and committees (excluding the audit committee) based on the individual or entity’s </span><span>percentage of ownership.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Governance Following an IPO, Spin-Off, or Direct Listing</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We believe companies that have recently completed an initial public offering (IPO), spin-off, or direct listing should be allowed </span><span>adequate time to fully comply with marketplace listing requirements and meet basic corporate governance standards. </span><span>Generally speaking, we refrain from making recommendations on the basis of governance standards (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, board </span><span>independence, committee membership and structure, meeting attendance, etc.) during the one-year period following an IPO.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>However, some cases warrant shareholder action against the board of a company that have completed an IPO, spin-off, or </span><span>direct listing within the past year. When evaluating companies that have recently gone public, Glass Lewis will review the </span><span>terms of the applicable governing documents in order to determine whether shareholder rights are being severely restricted </span><span>indefinitely. We believe boards that approve highly restrictive governing documents have demonstrated that they may subvert </span><span>shareholder interests following the IPO. In conducting this evaluation, Glass Lewis will consider:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1. </span></div> <div><span>The adoption of anti-takeover provisions such as a poison pill or classified board</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>2. </span></div> <div><span>Supermajority vote requirements to amend governing documents</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>3. </span></div> <div><span>The presence of exclusive forum or fee-shifting provisions</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>4. </span></div> <div><span>Whether shareholders can call special meetings or act by written consent</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>5. </span></div> <div><span>The voting standard provided for the election of directors</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>6. </span></div> <div><span>The ability of shareholders to remove directors without cause</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>7. </span></div> <div><span>The presence of evergreen provisions in the company’s equity compensation arrangements</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>8. </span></div> <div><span>The presence of a multi-class share structure which does not afford common shareholders voting power that is aligned </span><span>with their economic interest</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>In cases where Glass Lewis determines that the board has approved overly restrictive governing documents, we will generally </span><span>recommend voting against members of the governance committee. If there is no governance committee, or if a portion of </span><span>such committee members are not standing for election due to a classified board structure, we will expand our </span><span>recommendations to additional director nominees, based on who is standing for election.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In cases where, preceding an IPO, the board adopts a multi-class share structure where voting rights are not aligned with </span><span>economic interest, or an anti-takeover provision, such as a poison pill or classified board, we will generally recommend voting </span><span>against all members of the board who served at the time of the IPO if the board: (i) did not also commit to submitting these </span><span>provisions to a shareholder vote at the company’s first shareholder meeting following the IPO; or (ii) did not provide for a </span><span>reasonable sunset of these provisions (generally three to five years in the case of a classified board or poison pill; or seven </span><span>years or less in the case of a multi-class share structure). In the case of a multi-class share structure, if these provisions are </span><span>put to a shareholder vote, we will examine the level of approval or disapproval attributed to unaffiliated shareholders when </span><span>determining the vote outcome.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In our view, adopting an anti-takeover device unfairly penalizes future shareholders who (except for electing to buy or sell the </span><span>stock) are unable to weigh in on a matter that could potentially negatively impact their ownership interest. This notion is </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-39</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Thus, the business combination represents the private </span><span>company’s de-facto IPO. We believe that some cases warrant shareholder action against the board of a company that have </span><span>completed a business combination with a SPAC within the past year.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>At meetings where shareholders vote on the business combination of a SPAC with a private company, shareholders are </span><span>generally voting on a new corporate charter for the post-combination company as a condition to approval of the business </span><span>combination. In many cases, shareholders are faced with the dilemma of having to approve corporate charters that severely </span><span>restrict shareholder rights to facilitate the business combination. Therefore, when shareholders are required to approve </span><span>binding charters as a condition to approval of a business combination with a SPAC, we believe shareholders should also be </span><span>provided with advisory votes on material charter amendments as a means to voice their opinions on such restrictive </span><span>governance provisions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When evaluating companies that have recently gone public via business combination with a SPAC, Glass Lewis will review the </span><span>terms of the applicable governing documents to determine whether shareholder rights are being severely restricted </span><span>indefinitely and whether these restrictive provisions were put forth for a shareholder vote on an advisory basis at the prior </span><span>meeting where shareholders voted on the business combination.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In cases where, prior to the combined company becoming publicly traded, the board adopts a multi-class share structure </span><span>where voting rights are not aligned with economic interest, or an anti-takeover provision, such as a poison pill or classified </span><span>board, we will generally recommend voting against all members of the board who served at the time of the combined </span><span>company becoming publicly traded if the board: (i) did not also submit these provisions to a shareholder vote on an advisory </span><span>basis at the prior meeting where shareholders voted on the business combination; (ii) did not also commit to submitting </span><span>these provisions to a shareholder vote at the company’s first shareholder meeting following the company becoming publicly </span><span>traded; or (iii) did not provide for a reasonable sunset of these provisions (generally three to five years in the case of a </span><span>classified board or poison pill; or seven years or less in the case of a multi-class share structure).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Consistent with our view on IPOs, adopting an anti-takeover device unfairly penalizes future shareholders who (except for </span><span>electing to buy or sell the stock) are unable to weigh in on a matter that could potentially negatively impact their ownership </span><span>interest.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dual-Listed or Foreign-Incorporated Companies</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For companies that trade on multiple exchanges or are incorporated in foreign jurisdictions but trade only in the U.S., we will </span><span>apply the governance standard most relevant in each situation. We will consider a number of factors in determining which </span><span>Glass Lewis country-specific policy to apply, including but not limited to: (i) the corporate governance structure and features </span><span>of the company including whether the board structure is unique to a particular market; (ii) the nature of the proposals; (iii) </span><span>the location of the company’s primary listing, if one can be determined; (iv) the regulatory/governance regime that the board </span><span>is reporting against; and (v) the availability and completeness of the company’s SEC filings.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>OTC-listed Companies</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Companies trading on the OTC Bulletin Board are not considered </span><span>“</span><span>listed companies</span><span>”</span><span> under SEC rules and therefore not </span><span>subject to the same governance standards as listed companies. However, we believe that more stringent corporate </span><span>governance standards should be applied to these companies given that their shares are still publicly traded.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When reviewing OTC companies, Glass Lewis will review the available disclosure relating to the shareholder meeting to </span><span>determine whether shareholders are able to evaluate several key pieces of information, including: (i) the composition of the </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-40</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>board’s key committees, if any; (ii) the level of share ownership of company insiders or directors; (iii) the board meeting </span><span>attendance record of directors; (iv) executive and non-employee director compensation; (v) related-party transactions </span><span>conducted during the past year; and (vi) the board’s leadership structure and determinations regarding director </span><span>independence.</span></div> <div> <div><span>We are particularly concerned when company disclosure lacks any information regarding the board’s key committees. We </span><span>believe that committees of the board are an essential tool for clarifying how the responsibilities of the board are being </span><span>delegated, and specifically for indicating which directors are accountable for ensuring: (i) the independence and quality of </span><span>directors, and the transparency and integrity of the nominating process; (ii) compensation programs that are fair and </span><span>appropriate; (iii) proper oversight of the company’s accounting, financial reporting, and internal and external audits; and (iv) </span><span>general adherence to principles of good corporate governance.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In cases where shareholders are unable to identify which board members are responsible for ensuring oversight of the above-mentioned</span><span> responsibilities, we may consider recommending against certain members of the board. Ordinarily, we believe it is </span><span>the responsibility of the corporate governance committee to provide thorough disclosure of the board’s governance </span><span>practices. In the absence of such a committee, we believe it is appropriate to hold the board’s chair or, if such individual is an </span><span>executive of the company, the longest-serving non-executive board member accountable.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Mutual Fund Boards</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Mutual funds, or investment companies, are structured differently from regular public companies (</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> operating companies). </span><span>Typically, members of a fund’s advisor are on the board and management takes on a different role from that of regular public </span><span>companies. Thus, we focus on a short list of requirements, although many of our guidelines remain the same.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The following mutual fund policies are similar to the policies for regular public companies:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Size of the board of directors</span><span> — The board should be made up of between five and twenty directors.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>2.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The CFO on the board</span><span> — Neither the CFO of the fund nor the CFO of the fund’s registered investment advisor should </span><span>serve on the board.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>3.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Independence of the audit committee</span><span> — The audit committee should consist solely of independent directors.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>4.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Audit committee financial expert</span><span> — At least one member of the audit committee should be designated as the audit </span><span>committee financial expert.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>The following differences from regular public companies apply at mutual funds:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Independence of the board</span><span> — We believe that three-fourths of an investment company’s board should be made up of </span><span>independent directors. This is consistent with a proposed SEC rule on investment company boards. The Investment </span><span>Company Act requires 40% of the board to be independent, but in 2001, the SEC amended the Exemptive Rules to </span><span>require that a majority of a mutual fund board be independent. In 2005, the SEC proposed increasing the independence </span><span>threshold to 75%. In 2006, a federal appeals court ordered that this rule amendment be put back out for public </span><span>comment, putting it back into </span><span>“</span><span>proposed rule</span><span>”</span><span> status. Since mutual fund boards play a vital role in overseeing the </span><span>relationship between the fund and its investment manager, there is greater need for independent oversight than there is </span><span>for an operating company board.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>2.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>When the auditor is not up for ratification</span><span> — We do not recommend voting against the audit committee if the auditor </span><span>is not up for ratification. Due to the different legal structure of an investment company compared to an operating </span><span>company, the auditor for the investment company (</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> mutual fund)</span> <br/><span> </span><span>does not conduct the same level of financial review for each investment company as for an</span> <br/><span> </span><span>operating company.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>3.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Non-independent chair</span><span> — The SEC has proposed that the chair of the fund board be independent. We agree that the </span><span>roles of a mutual fund’s chair and CEO should be separate. Although we believe this would be best at all companies, we </span><span>recommend voting against the chair of an investment company’s nominating committee as well as the board chair if </span><span>the chair and CEO of a mutual fund are the same person and the fund does not have an independent lead or presiding </span><span>director. Seven former SEC commissioners support the appointment of an independent chair and we agree with them </span><span>that </span><span>“</span><span>an independent board chair would be better able to create conditions favoring the long-term interests of fund </span><span>shareholders than would a chair who is an executive of the advisor.</span><span>”</span><span> (See the comment letter sent to the SEC in support </span><span>of the proposed rule at </span><span>http://www.sec.gov/news/studies/indchair.pdf</span><span>.)</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-41</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Mutual fund directors typically serve on dozens of other mutual fund boards, </span><span>often within the same fund complex. The Investment Company Institute’s (ICI) Overview of Fund Governance Practices, </span><span>1994-2012, indicates that the average number of funds served by an independent director in 2012 was 53. Absent </span><span>evidence that a specific director is hindered from being an effective board member at a fund due to service on other </span><span>funds’ boards, we refrain from maintaining a cap on the number of outside mutual fund boards that we believe a </span><span>director can serve on.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Declassified Boards</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis favors the repeal of staggered boards and the annual election of directors. We believe staggered boards are less </span><span>accountable to shareholders than boards that are elected annually. Furthermore, we feel the annual election of directors </span><span>encourages board members to focus on shareholder interests.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Empirical studies have shown: (i) staggered boards are associated with a reduction in a firm’s valuation; and (ii) in the </span><span>context of hostile takeovers, staggered boards operate as a takeover defense, which entrenches management, discourages </span><span>potential acquirers, and delivers a lower return to target shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In our view, there is no evidence to demonstrate that staggered boards improve shareholder returns in a takeover context. </span><span>Some research has indicated that shareholders are worse off when a staggered board blocks a transaction; further, when a </span><span>staggered board negotiates a friendly transaction, no statistically significant difference in premium occurs.</span><span>36</span><span> Additional </span><span>research found that charter-based staggered boards </span><span>“</span><span>reduce the market value of a firm by 4% to 6% of its market </span><span>capitalization</span><span>”</span><span> and that </span><span>“</span><span>staggered boards bring about and not merely reflect this reduction in market value.</span><span>”</span><span>37</span><span> A subsequent </span><span>study reaffirmed that classified boards reduce shareholder value, finding </span><span>“</span><span>that the ongoing process of dismantling staggered </span><span>boards, encouraged by institutional investors, could well contribute to increasing shareholder wealth.</span><span>”</span><span>38</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shareholders have increasingly come to agree with this view. In 2019, 90% of S&amp;P 500 companies had declassified boards, up </span><span>from 68% in 2009.</span><span>39</span><span> Management proposals to declassify boards are approved with near unanimity and shareholder </span><span>proposals on the topic also receive strong shareholder support; in 2014, shareholder proposals requesting that companies </span><span>declassify their boards received average support of 84% (excluding abstentions and broker non-votes), whereas in 1987, only </span><span>16.4% of votes cast favored board declassification.</span><span>40</span><span> Further, a growing number of companies, nearly half of all those </span><span>targeted by shareholder proposals requesting that all directors stand for election annually, either recommended shareholders </span><span>support the proposal or made no recommendation, a departure from the more traditional management recommendation to </span><span>vote against shareholder proposals.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Given our belief that declassified boards promote director accountability, the empirical evidence suggesting staggered boards </span><span>reduce a company’s value and the established shareholder opposition to such a structure, Glass Lewis supports the </span><span>declassification of boards and the annual election of directors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Board Composition and Refreshment</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis strongly supports routine director evaluation, including independent external reviews, and periodic board </span><span>refreshment to foster the sharing of diverse perspectives in the boardroom and the generation of new ideas and business </span><span>strategies. Further, we believe the board should evaluate the need for changes to board composition based on an analysis of </span><span>skills and experience necessary for the company, as well as the results of</span> <br/><span> </span><span>the director evaluations, as opposed to relying solely on age or tenure limits. When necessary, shareholders can address </span><span>concerns regarding proper board composition through director elections.</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>36</span></div> <div><span>Lucian Bebchuk, John Coates IV, Guhan Subramanian, </span><span>“</span><span>The Powerful Antitakeover Force of Staggered Boards: Further Findings and a Reply to </span><span>Symposium Participants,</span><span>”</span><span> 55 Stanford Law Review 885-917 (2002).</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>37</span></div> <div><span>Lucian Bebchuk, Alma Cohen, </span><span>“</span><span>The Costs of Entrenched Boards</span><span>”</span><span> (2004).</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>38</span></div> <div><span>Lucian Bebchuk, Alma Cohen and Charles C.Y.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>In our view, a director’s experience can be a valuable asset to shareholders because of the complex, critical issues that boards </span><span>face. This said, we recognize that in rare circumstances, a lack of refreshment can contribute to a lack of board </span><span>responsiveness to poor company performance.</span></div> <div> <div><span>We will note as a potential concern instances where the average tenure of non-executive directors is 10 years or more and no </span><span>new directors have joined the board in the past five years. While we will be highlighting this as a potential area of concern, we </span><span>will not be making voting recommendations strictly on this basis, unless we have identified other governance or board </span><span>performance concerns.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>On occasion, age or term limits can be used as a means to remove a director for boards that are unwilling to police their </span><span>membership and enforce turnover. Some shareholders support term limits as a way to force change in such circumstances.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>While we understand that age limits can aid board succession planning, the long-term impact of age limits restricts </span><span>experienced and potentially valuable board members from service through an arbitrary means. We believe that shareholders </span><span>are better off monitoring the board’s overall composition, including the diversity of its members, the alignment of the board’s </span><span>areas of expertise with a company’s strategy, the board’s approach to corporate governance, and its stewardship of company </span><span>performance, rather than imposing inflexible rules that don’t necessarily correlate with returns or benefits for shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>However, if a board adopts term/age limits, it should follow through and not waive such limits. In cases where the board </span><span>waives its term/age limits for two or more consecutive years, Glass Lewis will generally recommend that shareholders vote </span><span>against the nominating and/or governance committee chair, unless a compelling rationale is provided for why the board is </span><span>proposing to waive this rule, such as consummation of a corporate transaction.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Board Diversity</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis recognizes the importance of ensuring that the board is composed of directors who have a diversity of skills, </span><span>thought and experience, as such diversity benefits companies by providing a broad range of perspectives and insights. Glass </span><span>Lewis closely reviews the composition of the board for representation of diverse director candidates.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Board Gender Diversity</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We consider the nominating and governance committee to be responsible for ensuring sufficient board diversity, or for </span><span>publicly communicating its rationale or a plan for increasing diversity. As such, we will generally recommend voting against </span><span>the chair of the nominating committee of a board that is not at least 30 percent gender diverse, or all members of the </span><span>nominating committee of a board with no gender diverse directors, at companies within the Russell 3000 index. For </span><span>companies outside the Russell 3000 index, our policy requires a minimum of one gender diverse director.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When making these voting recommendations, we will carefully review a company’s disclosure of its diversity considerations </span><span>and may refrain from recommending that shareholders vote against directors when boards have provided sufficient rationale </span><span>for the lack of diversity or a plan to address the lack of diversity, including a timeline of when the board intends to appoint </span><span>additional gender diverse directors (generally by the next annual meeting or as soon as reasonably practicable).</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We may extend our gender diversity recommendations to additional members of the nominating committee in cases where </span><span>the committee chair is not standing for election due to a classified board, or based on other factors, including the company’s </span><span>size and industry, applicable laws in its state of headquarters, and its overall governance profile.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Board Underrepresented Community Diversity</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We will generally recommend against the chair of the nominating committee of a board with fewer than one director from an </span><span>underrepresented community on the board at companies within the Russell 1000 index.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We define </span><span>“</span><span>underrepresented community director</span><span>”</span><span> as an individual who self-identifies as Black, African American, North </span><span>African, Middle Eastern, Hispanic, Latino, Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, Native Hawaiian, or Alaskan Native, or who </span><span>self-identifies as a member of the LGBTQIA+ community. For the purposes of this evaluation, we will rely solely on self-identified</span><span> demographic information as disclosed in company proxy statements.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When making these voting recommendations, we will carefully review a company’s disclosure of its diversity considerations </span><span>and may refrain from recommending that shareholders vote against directors when boards have provided a sufficient </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-43</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>rationale or plan to address the lack of diversity on the board, including a timeline to appoint additional directors from an </span><span>underrepresented community (generally by the next annual meeting or as soon as reasonably practicable).</span></div> <div> <div><span>We may extend our underrepresented community diversity recommendations to additional members of the nominating </span><span>committee in cases where the committee chair is not standing for election due to a classified board, or based on other </span><span>factors, including the company’s size and industry, applicable laws in its state of headquarters, and its overall governance </span><span>profile.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>State Laws on Diversity</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Several states have begun to encourage board diversity through legislation. Some state laws imposed mandatory board </span><span>composition requirements, while other states have enacted or are considering legislation that encourages companies to </span><span>diversify their boards but does not mandate board composition requirements. Furthermore, several states have enacted or </span><span>are considering enacting certain disclosure or reporting requirements in filings made with each respective state annually.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis will recommend in accordance with mandatory board composition requirements set forth in applicable state </span><span>laws when they come into effect. We will generally refrain from recommending against directors when applicable state laws </span><span>do not mandate board composition requirements, are non-binding, or solely impose disclosure or reporting requirements.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We note that during 2022, California’s Senate Bill 826 and Assembly Bill 979 regarding board gender and </span><span>“</span><span>underrepresented </span><span>community</span><span>”</span><span> diversity, respectively, were both deemed to violate the equal protection clause of the California state </span><span>constitution. These laws are currently in the appeals process.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Accordingly, where we previously recommended in accordance with mandatory board composition requirements set forth in </span><span>California’s SB 826 and AB 979, we will refrain from providing recommendations pursuant to these state board composition </span><span>requirements until further notice while we continue to monitor the appeals process. However, we will continue to monitor </span><span>compliance with these requirements.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Disclosure of Director Diversity and Skills</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Because company disclosure is critical when measuring the mix of diverse attributes and skills of directors, Glass Lewis </span><span>assesses the quality of such disclosure in companies’ proxy statements. Accordingly, we reflect how a company’s proxy </span><span>statement presents: (i) the board’s current percentage of racial/ethnic diversity; (ii) whether the board’s definition of diversity </span><span>explicitly includes gender and/or race/ethnicity; (iii) whether the board has adopted a policy requiring women and minorities </span><span>to be included in the initial pool of candidates when selecting new director nominees (aka </span><span>“</span><span>Rooney Rule</span><span>”</span><span>); and (iv) board </span><span>skills disclosure. Such ratings will help inform our assessment of a company’s overall governance and may be a contributing </span><span>factor in our recommendations when additional board-related concerns have been identified.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>At companies in the Russell 1000 index that have not provided any disclosure in any of the above categories, we will generally </span><span>recommend voting against the chair of the nominating and/or governance committee. Further, when companies in the </span><span>Russell 1000 index have not provided any disclosure of individual or aggregate racial/ethnic minority board demographic </span><span>information, we will generally recommend voting against the chair of the nominating and/or governance committee.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Stock Exchange Diversity Disclosure Requirements</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>On August 6, 2021, the SEC approved new listing rules regarding board diversity and disclosure for Nasdaq-listed companies. </span><span>Beginning in 2022, companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange are required to disclose certain board diversity statistics </span><span>annually in a standardized format in the proxy statement or on the company's website. Nasdaq-listed companies are required </span><span>to provide this disclosure by the later of (i) August 8, 2022, or (ii) the date the company files its proxy statement for its 2022 </span><span>annual meeting. Accordingly, for annual meetings held after August 8, 2022, of applicable Nasdaq-listed companies, we will </span><span>recommend voting against the chair of the governance committee when the required disclosure has not been provided.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Proxy Access</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In lieu of running their own contested election, proxy access would not only allow certain shareholders to nominate directors </span><span>to company boards but the shareholder nominees would be included on the company’s ballot, significantly enhancing the </span><span>ability of shareholders to play a meaningful role in selecting their representatives.

Glass Lewis considers several factors when evaluating </span><span>whether to support proposals for companies to adopt proxy access including the specified minimum ownership and holding </span><span>requirement for shareholders to nominate one or more directors, as well as company size, performance and responsiveness </span><span>to shareholders.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For a discussion of recent regulatory events in this area, along with a detailed overview of the Glass Lewis approach to </span><span>shareholder proposals regarding Proxy Access, refer to Glass Lewis’ </span><span>Proxy Paper Guidelines for Shareholder Proposals &amp; ESG-Related</span><span> Issues</span><span>, available at www.glasslewis.com.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Majority Vote for Election of Directors</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Majority voting for the election of directors is fast becoming the de facto standard in corporate board elections. In our view, </span><span>the majority voting proposals are an effort to make the case for shareholder impact on director elections on a company-specific</span><span> basis.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>While this proposal would not give shareholders the opportunity to nominate directors or lead to elections where </span><span>shareholders have a choice among director candidates, if implemented, the proposal would allow shareholders to have a </span><span>voice in determining whether the nominees proposed by the board should actually serve as the overseer-representatives of </span><span>shareholders in the boardroom. We believe this would be a favorable outcome for shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The number of shareholder proposals requesting that companies adopt a majority voting standard has declined significantly </span><span>during the past decade, largely as a result of widespread adoption of majority voting or director</span> <br/><span> </span><span>resignation policies at U.S. companies. In 2019, 89% of the S&amp;P 500 Index had implemented a resignation policy for directors </span><span>failing to receive majority shareholder support, compared to 65% in 2009.</span><span>41</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Plurality Vote Standard</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Today, most U.S. companies still elect directors by a plurality vote standard. Under that standard, if one shareholder holding </span><span>only one share votes in favor of a nominee (including that director, if the director is a shareholder), that nominee </span><span>“</span><span>wins</span><span>”</span><span> the </span><span>election and assumes a seat on the board. The common concern among companies with a plurality voting standard is the </span><span>possibility that one or more directors would not receive a majority of votes, resulting in </span><span>“</span><span>failed elections.</span><span>”</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Advantages of a Majority Vote Standard</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If a majority vote standard were implemented, a nominee would have to receive the support of a majority of the shares voted </span><span>in order to be elected. Thus, shareholders could collectively vote to reject a director they believe will not pursue their best </span><span>interests. Given that so few directors (less than 100 a year) do not receive majority support from shareholders, we think that </span><span>a majority vote standard is reasonable since it will neither result in many failed director elections nor reduce the willingness of </span><span>qualified, shareholder-focused directors to serve in the future. Further, most directors who fail to receive a majority </span><span>shareholder vote in favor of their election do not step down, underscoring the need for true majority voting.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We believe that a majority vote standard will likely lead to more attentive directors. Although shareholders only rarely fail to </span><span>support directors, the occasional majority vote against a director’s election will likely deter the election of directors with a </span><span>record of ignoring shareholder interests. Glass Lewis will therefore generally support proposals calling for the election of </span><span>directors by a majority vote, excepting contested director elections.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In response to the high level of support majority voting has garnered, many companies have voluntarily taken steps to </span><span>implement majority voting or modified approaches to majority voting. These steps range from a modified approach requiring </span><span>directors that receive a majority of withheld votes to resign (</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> a resignation policy) to actually requiring a majority vote of </span><span>outstanding shares to elect directors.</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>41</span></div> <div><span>Spencer Stuart Board Index, 2019, p. 15.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-45</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>We feel that the modified approach does not go far enough because requiring a director to resign is not the same as requiring </span><span>a majority vote to elect a director and does not allow shareholders a definitive voice in the election process. Further, under </span><span>the modified approach, the corporate governance committee could reject a resignation and, even if it accepts the resignation, </span><span>the corporate governance committee decides on the director’s replacement. And since the modified approach is usually </span><span>adopted as a policy by the board or a board committee, it could be altered by the same board or committee at any time.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Conflicting and Excluded Proposals</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>SEC Rule 14a-8(i)(9) allows companies to exclude shareholder proposals </span><span>“</span><span>if the proposal directly conflicts with one of the </span><span>company’s own proposals to be submitted to shareholders at the same meeting.</span><span>”</span><span> On October 22, 2015, the SEC issued Staff </span><span>Legal Bulletin No. 14H (SLB 14H) clarifying its rule concerning the exclusion of certain shareholder proposals when similar </span><span>items are also on the ballot. SLB 14H increased the burden on companies to prove to SEC staff that a conflict exists; therefore, </span><span>many companies still chose to place management proposals alongside similar shareholder proposals in many cases.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>During the 2018 proxy season, a new trend in the SEC’s interpretation of this rule emerged. Upon submission of shareholder </span><span>proposals requesting that companies adopt a lower special meeting threshold, several companies petitioned the SEC for no-action</span><span> relief under the premise that the shareholder proposals conflicted with management’s own special meeting proposals, </span><span>even though the management proposals set a higher threshold than those requested by the proponent. No-action relief was </span><span>granted to these companies; however, the SEC stipulated that the companies must state in the rationale for the management </span><span>proposals that a vote in favor of management’s proposal was tantamount to a vote against the adoption of a lower special </span><span>meeting threshold. In certain instances, shareholder proposals to lower an existing special meeting right threshold were </span><span>excluded on the basis that they conflicted with management proposals seeking to ratify the existing special meeting rights. </span><span>We find the exclusion of these shareholder proposals to be especially problematic as, in these instances, shareholders are not </span><span>offered any enhanced shareholder right, nor would the approval (or rejection) of the ratification proposal initiate any type of </span><span>meaningful change to shareholders’ rights.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In instances where companies have excluded shareholder proposals, such as those instances where special meeting </span><span>shareholder proposals are excluded as a result of </span><span>“</span><span>conflicting</span><span>”</span><span> management proposals, Glass Lewis will take a case-by-case </span><span>approach, taking into account the following issues:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The threshold proposed by the shareholder resolution;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The threshold proposed or established by management and the attendant rationale for the threshold;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Whether management’s proposal is seeking to ratify an existing special meeting right or adopt a bylaw that would </span><span>establish a special meeting right; and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The company’s overall governance profile, including its overall responsiveness to and engagement with </span><span>shareholders.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis generally favors a 10-15% special meeting right. Accordingly, Glass Lewis will generally recommend voting for </span><span>management or shareholder proposals that fall within this range. When faced with conflicting proposals, Glass Lewis will </span><span>generally recommend in favor of the lower special meeting right and will recommend voting against the proposal with the </span><span>higher threshold. However, in instances where there are conflicting management and shareholder proposals and a company </span><span>has not established a special meeting right, Glass Lewis may recommend that shareholders vote in favor of the shareholder </span><span>proposal and that they abstain from a management-proposed bylaw amendment seeking to establish a special meeting </span><span>right. We believe that an abstention is appropriate in this instance in order to ensure that shareholders are sending a clear </span><span>signal regarding their preference for the appropriate threshold for a special meeting right, while not directly opposing the </span><span>establishment of such a right.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In cases where the company excludes a shareholder proposal seeking a reduced special meeting right by means of ratifying a </span><span>management proposal that is materially different from the shareholder proposal, we will generally recommend voting against </span><span>the chair or members of the governance committee.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In other instances of conflicting management and shareholder proposals, Glass Lewis will consider the following:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The nature of the underlying issue;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The benefit to shareholders of implementing the proposal;</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The materiality of the differences between the terms of the shareholder proposal and management proposal;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-46</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

We understand that not all shareholder proposals serve the long-term </span><span>interests of shareholders, and value and respect the limitations placed on shareholder proponents, as certain shareholder </span><span>proposals can unduly burden companies. However, Glass Lewis believes that shareholders should be able to vote on issues of </span><span>material importance.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We view the shareholder proposal process as an important part of advancing shareholder rights and encouraging responsible </span><span>and financially sustainable business practices. While recognizing that certain proposals cross the line between the purview of </span><span>shareholders and that of the board, we generally believe that companies should not limit investors’ ability to vote on </span><span>shareholder proposals that advance certain rights or promote beneficial disclosure. Accordingly, Glass Lewis will make note </span><span>of instances where a company has successfully petitioned the SEC to exclude shareholder proposals. If after review we </span><span>believe that the exclusion of a shareholder proposal is detrimental to shareholders, we may, in certain very limited </span><span>circumstances, recommend against members of the governance committee.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Transparency and Integrity in Financial Reporting</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Auditor Ratification</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The auditor’s role as gatekeeper is crucial in ensuring the integrity and transparency of the financial information necessary </span><span>for protecting shareholder value. Shareholders rely on the auditor to ask tough questions and to do a thorough analysis of a </span><span>company’s books to ensure that the information provided to shareholders is complete, accurate, fair, and that it is a </span><span>reasonable representation of a company’s financial position. The only way shareholders can make rational investment </span><span>decisions is if the market is equipped with accurate information about a company’s fiscal health. As stated in the October 6, </span><span>2008 Final Report of the Advisory Committee on the Auditing Profession to the U.S. Department of the Treasury:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>“</span><span>The auditor is expected to offer critical and objective judgment on the financial matters under consideration, and actual </span><span>and perceived absence of conflicts is critical to that expectation. The Committee believes that auditors, investors, public </span><span>companies, and other market participants must understand the independence requirements and their objectives, and </span><span>that auditors must adopt a mindset of skepticism when facing situations that may compromise their independence.</span><span>”</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As such, shareholders should demand an objective, competent and diligent auditor who performs at or above professional </span><span>standards at every company in which the investors hold an interest. Like directors, auditors should be free from conflicts of </span><span>interest and should avoid situations requiring a choice between the auditor’s interests and the public’s interests. Almost </span><span>without exception, shareholders should be able to annually review an auditor’s performance and to annually ratify a board’s </span><span>auditor selection. Moreover, in October 2008, the Advisory Committee on the Auditing Profession went even further, and </span><span>recommended that </span><span>“</span><span>to further enhance audit committee oversight and auditor accountability ... disclosure in the company </span><span>proxy statement regarding shareholder ratification [should] include the name(s) of the senior auditing partner(s) staffed on </span><span>the engagement.</span><span>”</span><span>42</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>On August 16, 2011, the PCAOB issued a Concept Release seeking public comment on ways that auditor independence, </span><span>objectivity and professional skepticism could be enhanced, with a specific emphasis on mandatory audit firm rotation. The </span><span>PCAOB convened several public roundtable meetings during 2012 to further discuss such matters. Glass Lewis believes </span><span>auditor rotation can ensure both the independence of the auditor and the integrity of the audit; we will typically recommend </span><span>supporting proposals to require auditor rotation when the proposal uses a reasonable period of time (usually not less than </span><span>5-7 years), particularly at companies with a history of accounting problems.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>On June 1, 2017, the PCAOB adopted new standards to enhance auditor reports by providing additional important </span><span>information to investors. For companies with fiscal year end dates on or after December 15, 2017, reports were required to </span><span>include the year in which the auditor began serving consecutively as the company’s auditor. For large accelerated filers with </span><span>fiscal year ends of June 30, 2019 or later, and for all other companies with fiscal year ends of December 15, 2020 or later, </span><span>communication of critical audit matters (CAMs) will also be required.

The additional disclosures can provide </span><span>investors with information that is critical to making an informed judgment about an auditor’s independence and </span><span>performance. Furthermore, we believe the additional requirements are an important step toward enhancing the relevance </span><span>and usefulness of auditor reports, which too often are seen as boilerplate compliance documents that lack the relevant </span><span>details to provide meaningful insight into a particular audit.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Voting Recommendations on Auditor Ratification</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We generally support management’s choice of auditor except when we believe the auditor’s independence or audit integrity </span><span>has been compromised. Where a board has not allowed shareholders to review and ratify an auditor, we typically recommend </span><span>voting against the audit committee chair. When there have been material restatements of annual financial statements or </span><span>material weaknesses in internal controls, we usually recommend voting against the entire audit committee.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Reasons why we may not recommend ratification of an auditor include:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1. </span></div> <div><span>When audit fees plus audit-related fees total less than the tax fees and/or other non-audit fees.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>2. </span></div> <div><span>Recent material restatements of annual financial statements, including those resulting in the reporting of material </span><span>weaknesses in internal controls and including late filings by the company where the auditor bears some responsibility </span><span>for the restatement or late filing.</span><span>43</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>3. </span></div> <div><span>When the auditor performs prohibited services such as tax-shelter work, tax services for the CEO or CFO, or contingent-</span><span>fee work, such as a fee based on a percentage of economic benefit to the company.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>4. </span></div> <div><span>When audit fees are excessively low, especially when compared with other companies in the same industry.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>5. </span></div> <div><span>When the company has aggressive accounting policies.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>6. </span></div> <div><span>When the company has poor disclosure or lack of transparency in its financial statements.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>7. </span></div> <div><span>Where the auditor limited its liability through its contract with the company or the audit contract requires the </span><span>corporation to use alternative dispute resolution procedures without adequate justification.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>8. </span></div> <div><span>We also look for other relationships or concerns with the auditor that might suggest a conflict between the auditor’s </span><span>interests and shareholder interests.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>9. </span></div> <div><span>In determining whether shareholders would benefit from rotating the company’s auditor, where relevant we will </span><span>consider factors that may call into question an auditor’s effectiveness, including auditor tenure, a pattern of inaccurate </span><span>audits, and any ongoing litigation or significant controversies. When Glass Lewis considers ongoing litigation and </span><span>significant controversies, it is mindful that such matters may involve unadjudicated allegations. Glass Lewis does not </span><span>assume the truth of such allegations or that the law has been violated. Instead, Glass Lewis focuses more broadly on </span><span>whether, under the particular facts and circumstances presented, the nature and number of such lawsuits or other </span><span>significant controversies reflects on the risk profile of the company or suggests that appropriate risk mitigation </span><span>measures may be warranted.”</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Pension Accounting Issues</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A pension accounting question occasionally raised in proxy proposals is what effect, if any, projected returns on employee </span><span>pension assets should have on a company’s net income. This issue often arises in the executive-compensation context in a </span><span>discussion of the extent to which pension accounting should be reflected in business performance for purposes of </span><span>calculating payments to executives.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis believes that pension credits should not be included in measuring income that is used to award performance-based</span><span> compensation. Because many of the assumptions used in accounting for retirement plans are subject to the </span><span>company’s discretion, management would have an obvious conflict of interest if pay were tied to pension income. In our </span><span>view, projected income from pensions does not truly reflect a company’s performance.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>42</span></div> <div><span>“</span><span>Final Report of the Advisory Committee on the Auditing Profession to the U.S. Department of the Treasury.</span><span>”</span><span> p.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Link Between Compensation and Performance</span></div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis carefully reviews the compensation awarded to senior executives, as we believe that this is an important area in </span><span>which the board’s priorities are revealed. Glass Lewis strongly believes executive compensation should be linked directly with </span><span>the performance of the business the executive is charged with managing. We believe the most effective compensation </span><span>arrangements provide for an appropriate mix of performance-based short- and long-term incentives in addition to fixed pay </span><span>elements while promoting a prudent and sustainable level of risk-taking.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis believes that comprehensive, timely and transparent disclosure of executive pay is critical to allowing </span><span>shareholders to evaluate the extent to which pay is aligned with company performance. When reviewing proxy materials, </span><span>Glass Lewis examines whether the company discloses the performance metrics used to determine executive compensation. </span><span>We recognize performance metrics must necessarily vary depending on the company and industry, among other factors, and </span><span>may include a wide variety of financial measures as well as industry-specific performance indicators. However, we believe </span><span>companies should disclose why the specific performance metrics were selected and how the actions they are designed to </span><span>incentivize will lead to better corporate performance.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Moreover, it is rarely in shareholders’ interests to disclose competitive data about individual salaries below the senior </span><span>executive level. Such disclosure could create internal personnel discord that would be counterproductive for the company </span><span>and its shareholders. While we favor full disclosure for senior executives and we view pay disclosure at the aggregate level </span><span>(</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, the number of employees being paid over a certain amount or in certain categories) as potentially useful, we do not </span><span>believe shareholders need or will benefit from detailed reports about individual management employees other than the most </span><span>senior executives.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation</span> <br/><span> </span><span>(Say-on-Pay)</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the </span><span>“</span><span>Dodd-Frank Act</span><span>”</span><span>) required companies to hold an </span><span>advisory vote on executive compensation at the first shareholder meeting that occurs six months after enactment of the bill </span><span>(January 21, 2011).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>This practice of allowing shareholders a non-binding vote on a company’s compensation report is standard practice in many </span><span>non-U.S. countries, and has been a requirement for most companies in the United Kingdom since 2003 and in Australia since </span><span>2005. Although say-on-pay proposals are non-binding, a high level of</span> <br/><span> </span><span>“</span><span>against</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>abstain</span><span>”</span><span> votes indicates substantial shareholder concern about a company’s compensation policies and </span><span>procedures.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Given the complexity of most companies’ compensation programs, Glass Lewis applies a highly nuanced approach when </span><span>analyzing advisory votes on executive compensation. We review each company’s compensation on a case-by-case basis, </span><span>recognizing that each company must be examined in the context of industry, size, maturity, performance, financial condition, </span><span>its historic pay for performance practices, and any other relevant internal or external factors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We believe that each company should design and apply specific compensation policies and practices that are appropriate to </span><span>the circumstances of the company and, in particular, will attract and retain competent executives and other staff, while </span><span>motivating them to grow the company’s long-term shareholder value.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Where we find those specific policies and practices serve to reasonably align compensation with performance, and such </span><span>practices are adequately disclosed, Glass Lewis will recommend supporting the company’s approach. If, however, those </span><span>specific policies and practices fail to demonstrably link compensation with performance, Glass Lewis will generally </span><span>recommend voting against the say-on-pay proposal.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis reviews say-on-pay proposals on both a qualitative basis and a quantitative basis, with a focus on several main </span><span>areas:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The overall design and structure of the company’s executive compensation programs including selection and </span><span>challenging nature of performance metrics;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The implementation and effectiveness of the company’s executive compensation programs including pay mix and </span><span>use of performance metrics in determining pay levels;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-49</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

In instances where a company has simply failed to provide sufficient disclosure of its policies, </span><span>we may recommend shareholders vote against this proposal solely on this basis, regardless of the appropriateness of </span><span>compensation levels.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In general, most companies will fall within the </span><span>“</span><span>Fair</span><span>”</span><span> range for both structure and disclosure, and Glass Lewis largely uses the </span><span>“</span><span>Good</span><span>”</span><span> and </span><span>“</span><span>Poor</span><span>”</span><span> ratings to highlight outliers.</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-50</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Where we identify egregious compensation practices, we may also recommend voting against the compensation committee </span><span>based on the practices or actions of its members during the year. Such practices may include approving large one-off </span><span>payments, the inappropriate, unjustified use of discretion, or sustained poor pay for performance practices. (Refer to the </span><span>section on </span><span>“</span><span>Compensation Committee Performance</span><span>”</span><span> for more information.)</span></div> <div> <div><span>Company Responsiveness</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When companies receive a significant level of shareholder opposition to a say-on-pay proposal, which occurs when more </span><span>than 20% of votes on the proposal are cast as AGAINST and/or ABSTAIN. we believe the board should demonstrate a </span><span>commensurate level of engagement and responsiveness to the concerns behind the disapproval, with a particular focus on </span><span>responding to shareholder feedback. When assessing the level of opposition to say-on-pay proposals, we may further </span><span>examine the level of opposition among disinterested shareholders as an independent group. While we recognize that </span><span>sweeping changes cannot be made to a compensation program without due consideration, and that often a majority of </span><span>shareholders may have voted in favor of the proposal, given that the average approval rate for say-on-pay proposals is about </span><span>90%, we believe the compensation committee should provide some level of response to a significant vote against. In general, </span><span>our expectations regarding the minimum appropriate levels of responsiveness will correspond with the level of shareholder </span><span>opposition, as expressed both through the magnitude of opposition in a single year, and through the persistence of </span><span>shareholder disapproval over time.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Responses we consider appropriate include engaging with large shareholders, especially dissenting shareholders, to identify </span><span>their concerns, and, where reasonable, implementing changes and/or making commitments that directly address those </span><span>concerns within the company’s compensation program. In cases where particularly egregious pay decisions caused the say </span><span>on pay proposal to fail, Glass Lewis will closely consider whether any changes were made directly relating to the pay decision </span><span>that may address structural concerns that shareholders have. In the absence of any evidence in the disclosure that the board </span><span>is actively engaging shareholders on these issues and responding accordingly, we may recommend holding compensation </span><span>committee members accountable for failing to adequately respond to shareholder opposition. Regarding such </span><span>recommendations, careful consideration will be given to the level of shareholder protest and the severity and history of </span><span>compensation practices.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Pay for Performance</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis believes an integral part of a well-structured compensation package is a successful link between pay and </span><span>performance. Our proprietary pay-for-performance model was developed to better evaluate the link between pay and </span><span>performance. Generally, compensation and performance are measured against a peer group of appropriate companies that </span><span>may overlap, to a certain extent, with a company’s self-disclosed peers. This quantitative analysis provides a consistent </span><span>framework and historical context for our clients to determine how well companies link executive compensation to relative </span><span>performance. Companies that demonstrate a weaker link are more likely to receive a negative recommendation; however, </span><span>other qualitative factors such as overall incentive structure, significant forthcoming changes to the compensation program or </span><span>reasonable long-term payout levels may mitigate our concerns to a certain extent.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>While we assign companies a letter grade of A, B, C, D or F based on the alignment between pay and performance, the grades </span><span>derived from the Glass Lewis pay-for-performance analysis do not follow the traditional U.S. school letter grade system. </span><span>Rather, the grades are generally interpreted as follows:</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Grade of A:</span><span> The company’s percentile rank for pay is significantly less than its percentile rank for performance</span> <br/><span>Grade of B:</span><span> The company’s percentile rank for pay is moderately less than its percentile rank for performance</span> <br/><span>Grade of C:</span><span> The company’s percentile rank for pay is approximately aligned with its percentile rank for performance</span> <br/><span>Grade of D:</span><span> The company’s percentile rank for pay is higher than its percentile rank for performance</span> <br/><span> </span><span>Grade of F:</span><span> The company’s percentile rank for pay is significantly higher than its percentile rank for performance</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Separately, a specific comparison between the company’s executive pay and its peers’ executive pay levels may be discussed </span><span>in the analysis for additional insight into the grade. Likewise, a specific comparison between the company’s performance and </span><span>its peers’ performance is reflected in the analysis for further context.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We also use this analysis to inform our voting decisions on say-on-pay proposals. As such, if a company receives a </span><span>“</span><span>D</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>F</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>from our proprietary model, we are more likely to recommend that shareholders vote against the say-on-pay proposal. </span><span>However, supplemental quantitative factors like analyses of realized pay levels and the </span><span>“</span><span>compensation actually paid</span><span>”</span><span> data </span><span>mandated by the SEC’s 2022 final rule regarding pay versus performance may be considered, and other qualitative factors </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-51</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>such as an effective overall incentive structure, the relevance of selected performance metrics, significant forthcoming </span><span>enhancements or reasonable long-term payout levels may give us cause to recommend in favor of a proposal even when we </span><span>have identified a disconnect between pay and performance.</span></div> <div> <div><span>In determining the peer groups used in our A-F pay-for-performance letter grades, Glass Lewis utilizes a proprietary </span><span>methodology that considers both market and industry peers, along with each company’s network of self-disclosed peers. </span><span>Each component is considered on a weighted basis and is subject to size-based ranking and screening. The peer groups used </span><span>are provided to Glass Lewis by Diligent Intel based on Glass Lewis’ methodology and using Diligent Intel’s data.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Selecting an appropriate peer group to analyze a company’s compensation program is a subjective determination, requiring </span><span>significant judgment and on which there is not a </span><span>“</span><span>correct</span><span>”</span><span> answer. Since the peer group used is based on an independent, </span><span>proprietary technique, it will often differ from the one used by the company which, in turn, will affect the resulting analyses. </span><span>While Glass Lewis believes that the independent, rigorous methodology it uses provides a valuable perspective on the </span><span>company’s compensation program, the company’s self-selected peer group may also presented in the Proxy Paper for </span><span>comparative purposes.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Short-Term Incentives</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A short-term bonus or incentive (STI) should be demonstrably tied to performance. Whenever possible, we believe a mix of </span><span>corporate and individual performance measures is appropriate. We would normally expect performance measures for STI </span><span>plans to be based on company-wide or divisional financial measures as well as non-financial, qualitative or non-formulaic </span><span>factors such as those related to safety, environmental issues, and customer satisfaction. While we recognize that companies </span><span>operating in different sectors or markets may seek to utilize a wide range of metrics, we expect such measures to be </span><span>appropriately tied to a company’s business drivers.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Further, the threshold, target and maximum performance goals and corresponding payout levels that can be achieved under </span><span>STI plans should be disclosed. Shareholders should expect stretching performance targets for the maximum award to be </span><span>achieved. Any increase in the potential target and maximum award should be clearly justified to shareholders, as should any </span><span>decrease in target and maximum performance levels from the previous year.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis recognizes that disclosure of some measures or performance targets may include commercially confidential </span><span>information. Therefore, we believe it may be reasonable to exclude such information in some cases as long as the company </span><span>provides sufficient justification for non-disclosure. However, where a short-term bonus has been paid, companies should </span><span>disclose the extent to which performance has been achieved against relevant targets, including disclosure of the actual target </span><span>achieved.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Where management has received significant short-term incentive payments but overall performance and/or the shareholder </span><span>experience over the measurement year prima facie appears to be poor or negative, we believe the company should provide a </span><span>clear explanation of why these significant short-term payments were made. We also believe any significant changes to the </span><span>program structure should be accompanied by rationalizing disclosure. Further, where a company has applied upward </span><span>discretion, which includes lowering goals mid-year, increasing calculated payouts or retroactively pro-rating performance </span><span>periods, we expect a robust discussion of why the decision was necessary.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, we believe that where companies use non-GAAP or bespoke metrics, clear reconciliations between these figures </span><span>and GAAP figures in audited financial statements should be provided. Adjustments to GAAP figures may be considered in </span><span>Glass Lewis’ assessment of the effectiveness of the incentive at tying executive pay with performance. Moreover, Glass Lewis </span><span>believes that in circumstances where significant adjustments were applied to performance results, thorough, detailed </span><span>discussion of adjustments akin to a GAAP-to-non-GAAP reconciliation and their impact on payouts within the proxy </span><span>statement is warranted. The absence of such enhanced disclosure for significant adjustments will impact Glass Lewis' </span><span>assessment of the quality of disclosure and, in turn, may play a role in the overall recommendation for the advisory vote on </span><span>executive compensation.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis recognizes the importance of the compensation committee’s judicious and responsible exercise of discretion </span><span>over incentive pay outcomes to account for significant, material events that would otherwise be excluded from performance </span><span>results of selected metrics of incentive programs. For instance, major litigation settlement charges may be removed from </span><span>non-GAAP results before the determination of formulaic incentive payouts, or health and safety failures may not be reflected </span><span>in performance results where companies do not expressly include health and safety metrics in incentive plans; such events </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-52</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>may nevertheless be consequential to corporate performance results, impact the shareholder experience, and, in some cases, </span><span>may present material risks. Conversely, certain events may adversely impact formulaic payout results despite being outside </span><span>executives' control. We believe that companies should provide thorough discussion of how such events were considered in </span><span>the committee’s decisions to exercise discretion or refrain from applying discretion over incentive pay outcomes. The </span><span>inclusion of this disclosure may be helpful when we consider concerns around the exercise or absence of committee </span><span>discretion.</span></div> <div> <div><span>We do not generally recommend against a pay program due to the use of a non-formulaic plan. If a company has chosen to </span><span>rely primarily on a subjective assessment or the board’s discretion in determining short-term bonuses, we believe that the </span><span>proxy statement should provide a meaningful discussion of the board’s rationale in determining the bonuses paid as well as a </span><span>rationale for the use of a non-formulaic mechanism. Particularly where the aforementioned disclosures are substantial and </span><span>satisfactory, such a structure will not provoke serious concern in our analysis on its own. However, in conjunction with other </span><span>significant issues in a program’s design or operation, such as a disconnect between pay and performance, the absence of a </span><span>cap on payouts, or a lack of performance-based long-term awards, the use of a non-formulaic bonus may help drive a </span><span>negative recommendation.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Long-Term Incentives</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis recognizes the value of equity-based incentive programs, which are often the primary long-term incentive for </span><span>executives. When used appropriately, they can provide a vehicle for linking an executive’s pay to company performance, </span><span>thereby aligning their interests with those of shareholders. In addition, equity-based compensation can be an effective way to </span><span>attract, retain and motivate key employees.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>There are certain elements that Glass Lewis believes are common to most well-structured long-term incentive (LTI) plans. </span><span>These include:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>No re-testing or lowering of performance conditions;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Performance metrics that cannot be easily manipulated by management;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Two or more performance metrics;</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>At least one relative performance metric that compares the company’s performance to a relevant peer group or </span><span>index;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Performance periods of at least three years;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Stretching metrics that incentivize executives to strive for outstanding performance while not encouraging </span><span>excessive risk-taking;</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Reasonable individual award limits; and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Equity granting practices that are clearly disclosed.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>In evaluating long-term incentive grants, Glass Lewis generally believes that at least half of the grant should consist of </span><span>performance-based awards, putting a material portion of executive compensation at-risk and demonstrably linked to the </span><span>performance of the company. While we will consistently raise concern with programs that do not meet this criterion, we may </span><span>refrain from a negative recommendation in the absence of other significant issues with the program’s design or operation. </span><span>However, in cases where performance-based awards are significantly rolled back or eliminated from a company’s long-term </span><span>incentive plan, such decisions will generally be viewed negatively outside of exceptional circumstances and may lead to a </span><span>recommendation against the proposal.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As with the short-term incentive, Glass Lewis recognizes the importance of the compensation committee’s judicious and </span><span>responsible exercise of discretion over incentive pay outcomes to account for significant events that would otherwise be </span><span>excluded from performance results of selected metrics of incentive programs. We believe that companies should provide </span><span>thorough discussion of how such events were considered in the committee’s decisions to exercise discretion or refrain from </span><span>applying discretion over incentive pay outcomes. Furthermore, considerations related to the use of non-GAAP metrics under </span><span>the STI plan similarly apply to the long-term incentive program.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Performance measures should be carefully selected and should relate to the specific business/industry in which the company </span><span>operates and, especially, to the key value drivers of the company’s business. As with short-term incentive plans, the basis for </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-53</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>any adjustments to metrics or results should be clearly explained, as should the company’s judgment on the use of discretion </span><span>and any significant changes to the performance program structure.</span></div> <div> <div><span>While cognizant of the inherent complexity of certain performance metrics, Glass Lewis generally believes that measuring a </span><span>company’s performance with multiple metrics serves to provide a more complete picture of the company’s performance than </span><span>a single metric. Further, reliance on just one metric may focus too much management attention on a single target and is </span><span>therefore more susceptible to manipulation. When utilized for relative measurements, external benchmarks such as a sector </span><span>index or peer group should be disclosed and transparent. The rationale behind the selection of a specific index or peer group </span><span>should also be disclosed. Internal performance benchmarks should also be disclosed and transparent, unless a cogent case </span><span>for confidentiality is made and fully explained. Similarly, actual performance and vesting levels for previous grants earned </span><span>during the fiscal year should be disclosed.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We also believe shareholders should evaluate the relative success of a company’s compensation programs, particularly with </span><span>regard to existing equity-based incentive plans, in linking pay and performance when evaluating potential changes to LTI </span><span>plans and determining the impact of additional stock awards. We will therefore review the company’s pay-for-performance </span><span>grade (see above for more information) and specifically the proportion of total compensation that is stock-based.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Grants of Front-Loaded Awards</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Many U.S. companies have chosen to provide large grants, usually in the form of equity awards, that are intended to serve as </span><span>compensation for multiple years. This practice, often called front-loading, is taken up either in the regular course of business </span><span>or as a response to specific business conditions and with a predetermined objective. The so-called </span><span>“</span><span>mega-grant</span><span>”</span><span>, an outsized </span><span>award to one individual sometimes valued at over $100 million is sometimes but not always provided as a front-loaded </span><span>award. We believe shareholders should generally be wary of this approach, and we accordingly weigh these grants with </span><span>particular scrutiny.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>While the use of front-loaded awards is intended to lock-in executive service and incentives, the same rigidity also raises the </span><span>risk of effectively tying the hands of the compensation committee. As compared with a more responsive annual granting </span><span>schedule program, front-loaded awards may preclude improvements or changes to reflect evolving business strategies or to </span><span>respond to other unforeseen factors. Additionally, if structured poorly, early vesting of such awards may reduce or eliminate </span><span>the retentive power at great cost to shareholders. The considerable emphasis on a single grant can place intense pressures </span><span>on every facet of its design, amplifying any potential perverse incentives and creating greater room for unintended </span><span>consequences. In particular, provisions around changes of control or separations of service must ensure that executives do </span><span>not receive excessive payouts that do not reflect shareholder experience or company performance.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We consider a company’s rationale for granting awards under this structure and also expect any front-loaded awards to </span><span>include a firm commitment not to grant additional awards for a defined period, as is commonly associated with this practice. </span><span>Even when such a commitment is provided, unexpected circumstances may lead the board to make additional payments or </span><span>awards for retention purposes, or to incentivize management towards more realistic goals or a revised strategy. If a company </span><span>breaks its commitment not to grant further awards, we may recommend against the pay program unless a convincing </span><span>rationale is provided. In situations where the front-loaded award was meant to cover a certain portion of the regular long-term</span><span> incentive grant for each year during the covered period, our analysis of the value of the remaining portion of the regular </span><span>long-term incentives granted during the period covered by the award will account for the annualized value of the front-loaded</span><span> portion, and we expect no supplemental grant be awarded during the vesting period of the front-loaded portion.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The multiyear nature of these awards generally lends itself to significantly higher compensation figures in the year of grant </span><span>than might otherwise be expected. In our qualitative analysis of the grants of front-loaded awards to executives, Glass Lewis </span><span>considers the quantum of the award on an annualized basis and may compare this result to the prior practice and peer data, </span><span>among other benchmarks. Additionally, for awards that are granted in the form of equity, Glass Lewis may consider the total </span><span>potential dilutive effect of such award on shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Linking Executive Pay to Environmental and Social Criteria</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis believes that explicit environmental and/or social (E&amp;S) criteria in executive incentive plans, when used </span><span>appropriately, can serve to provide both executives and shareholders a clear line of sight into a company’s ESG strategy, </span><span>ambitions, and targets. Although we are strongly supportive of companies’ incorporation of material E&amp;S risks and </span><span>opportunities in their long-term strategic planning, we believe that the inclusion of E&amp;S metrics in compensation programs </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-54</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>should be predicated on each company’s unique circumstances. In order to establish a meaningful link between pay and </span><span>performance, companies must consider factors including their industry, size, risk profile, maturity, performance, financial </span><span>condition, and any other relevant internal or external factors.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>When a company is introducing E&amp;S criteria into executive incentive plans, we believe it is important that companies provide </span><span>shareholders with sufficient disclosure to allow them to understand how these criteria align with its strategy. Additionally, </span><span>Glass Lewis recognizes that there may be situations where certain E&amp;S performance criteria are reasonably viewed as </span><span>prerequisites for executive performance, as opposed to behaviors and conditions that need to be incentivized. For example, </span><span>we believe that shareholders should interrogate the use of metrics that award executives for ethical behavior or compliance </span><span>with policies and regulations. It is our view that companies should provide shareholders with disclosures that clearly lay out </span><span>the rationale for selecting specific E&amp;S metrics, the target-setting process, and corresponding payout opportunities. Further, </span><span>particularly in the case of qualitative metrics, we believe that shareholders should be provided with a clear understanding of </span><span>the basis on which the criteria will be assessed. Where quantitative targets have been set, we believe that shareholders are </span><span>best served when these are disclosed on an ex-ante basis, or the board should outline why it believes it is unable to do so.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>While we believe that companies should generally set long-term targets for their environmental and social ambitions, we are </span><span>mindful that not all compensation schemes lend themselves to the inclusion of E&amp;S metrics. We also are of the view that </span><span>companies should retain flexibility in not only choosing to incorporate E&amp;S metrics in their compensation plans, but also in </span><span>the placement of these metrics. For example, some companies may resolve that including E&amp;S criteria in the annual bonus </span><span>may help to incentivize the achievement of short-term milestones and allow for more maneuverability in strategic </span><span>adjustments to long-term goals. Other companies may determine that their long-term sustainability targets are best </span><span>achieved by incentivizing executives through metrics included in their long-term incentive plans.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>One-Time Awards</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis believes shareholders should generally be wary of awards granted outside of the standard incentive schemes, as </span><span>such awards have the potential to undermine the integrity of a company’s regular incentive plans or the link between pay and </span><span>performance, or both. We generally believe that if the existing incentive programs fail to provide adequate incentives to </span><span>executives, companies should redesign their compensation programs rather than make additional grants.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>However, we recognize that in certain circumstances, additional incentives may be appropriate. In these cases, companies </span><span>should provide a thorough description of the awards, including a cogent and convincing explanation of their necessity and </span><span>why existing awards do not provide sufficient motivation and a discussion of how the quantum of the award and its structure </span><span>were determined. Further, such awards should be tied to future service and performance whenever possible.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Additionally, we believe companies making supplemental or one-time awards should also describe if and how the regular </span><span>compensation arrangements will be affected by these additional grants. In reviewing a company’s use of supplemental </span><span>awards, Glass Lewis will evaluate the terms and size of the grants in the context of the company’s overall incentive strategy </span><span>and granting practices, as well as the current operating environment.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Contractual Payments and Arrangements</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Beyond the quantum of contractual payments, Glass Lewis will also consider the design of any entitlements. Certain </span><span>executive employment terms may help to drive a negative recommendation, including, but not limited to:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Excessively broad change in control triggers;</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Inappropriate severance entitlements;</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Inadequately explained or excessive sign-on arrangements;</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Guaranteed bonuses (especially as a multiyear occurrence); and</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Failure to address any concerning practices in amended employment agreements.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>In general, we are wary of terms that are excessively restrictive in favor of the executive, or that could potentially </span><span>incentivize behaviors that are not in a company’s best interest.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Sign-on Awards and Severance Benefits</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-55</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>We acknowledge that there may be certain costs associated with transitions at the executive level. In evaluating the size of </span><span>severance and sign-on arrangements, we may consider the executive’s regular target compensation level, or the sums paid to </span><span>other executives (including the recipient’s predecessor, where applicable) in evaluating the appropriateness of such an </span><span>arrangement.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>We believe sign-on arrangements should be clearly disclosed and accompanied by a meaningful explanation of the payments </span><span>and the process by which the amounts were reached. Further, the details of and basis for any </span><span>“</span><span>make-whole</span><span>”</span><span> payments (paid </span><span>as compensation for awards forfeited from a previous employer) should be provided.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>With respect to severance, we believe companies should abide by predetermined payouts in most circumstances. While in </span><span>limited circumstances some deviations may not be inappropriate, we believe shareholders should be provided with a </span><span>meaningful explanation of any additional or increased benefits agreed upon outside of regular arrangements. However, </span><span>where Glass Lewis determines that such predetermined payouts are particularly problematic or unfavorable to shareholders, </span><span>we may consider the execution of such payments in a negative recommendation for the advisory vote on executive </span><span>compensation.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the U.S. market, most companies maintain severance entitlements based on a multiple of salary and, in many cases, </span><span>bonus. In almost all instances we see, the relevant multiple is three or less, even in the case of a change in control. We believe </span><span>the basis and total value of severance should be reasonable and should not exceed the upper limit of general market practice. </span><span>We consider the inclusion of long-term incentives in cash severance calculations to be inappropriate, particularly given the </span><span>commonality of accelerated vesting and the proportional weight of long-term incentives as a component of total pay. </span><span>Additional considerations, however, will be accounted for when reviewing atypically structured compensation approaches.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Change in Control</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis considers double-trigger change in control arrangements, which require both a change in control and </span><span>termination or constructive termination, to be best practice. Any arrangement that is not explicitly double-trigger may be </span><span>considered a single-trigger or modified single-trigger arrangement.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Further, we believe that excessively broad definitions of change in control are potentially problematic as they may lead to </span><span>situations where executives receive additional compensation where no meaningful change in status or duties has occurred.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Excise Tax Gross-ups</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Among other entitlements, Glass Lewis is strongly opposed to excise tax gross-ups related to IRC § 4999 and their expansion, </span><span>especially where no consideration is given to the safe harbor limit. We believe that under no normal circumstance is the </span><span>inclusion of excise tax gross-up provisions in new agreements or the addition of such provisions to amended agreements </span><span>acceptable. In consideration of the fact that minor increases in change-in-control payments can lead to disproportionately </span><span>large excise taxes, the potential negative impact of tax gross-ups far outweighs any retentive benefit.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Depending on the circumstances, the addition of new gross-ups around this excise tax may lead to negative </span><span>recommendations for a company’s say-on-pay proposal, the chair of the compensation committee, or the entire committee, </span><span>particularly in cases where a company had committed not to provide any such entitlements in the future. For situations in </span><span>which the addition of new excise tax gross ups will be provided in connection with a specific change-in-control transaction, </span><span>this policy may be applied to the say-on-pay proposal, the golden parachute proposal and recommendations related to the </span><span>compensation committee for all involved corporate parties, as appropriate.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Amended Employment Agreements</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Any contractual arrangements providing for problematic pay practices which are not addressed in materially amended </span><span>employment agreements will potentially be viewed by Glass Lewis as a missed opportunity on the part of the company to </span><span>align its policies with current best practices. Such problematic pay practices include, but are not limited to, excessive change </span><span>in control entitlements, modified single-trigger change in control entitlements, excise tax gross-ups, and multi-year </span><span>guaranteed awards.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Recoupment Provisions (Clawbacks)</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-56</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>On October 26, 2022, the SEC adopted Rule 10D-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The rule mandates national </span><span>securities exchanges and associations to promulgate new listing standards requiring companies to maintain recoupment </span><span>policies (</span><span>“</span><span>clawback provisions</span><span>”</span><span>). The final clawback listing standards were approved by the SEC, effective October 2, 2023 </span><span>and required listed companies to adopt a compliant policy by December 1, 2023. Glass Lewis believes that clawback </span><span>provisions play an important role in mitigating excessive risk-taking that may be encouraged by poorly structured variable </span><span>incentive programs. Current listing standards require recoupment of erroneously awarded payouts to current and former </span><span>executive officers in the event of an accounting restatement or correction to previous financial statements that is material to </span><span>the current period, regardless of fault or misconduct.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis recognizes that excessive risk-taking that can materially and adversely impact shareholders may not necessarily </span><span>result in such restatements. We believe that clawback policies should allow recovery from current and former executive </span><span>officers in the event of a restatement of financial results or similar revision of performance indicators upon which the awards </span><span>were based. Additionally, recoupment policies should provide companies with the ability to claw back variable incentive </span><span>payments (whether time-based or performance-based) when there is evidence of problematic decisions or actions, such as </span><span>material misconduct, a material reputational failure, material risk management failure, or a material operational failure, the </span><span>consequences of which have not already been reflected in incentive payments and where recovery is warranted.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In situations where the company ultimately determines not to follow through with recovery, Glass Lewis will assess the </span><span>appropriateness of such determination for each case. A thorough, detailed discussion of the company's decision to not </span><span>pursue recoupment and, if applicable, how the company has otherwise rectified the disconnect between executive pay </span><span>outcomes and negative impacts of their actions on the company and the shareholder experience will be considered. The </span><span>absence of such enhanced disclosure may impact Glass Lewis' assessment of the quality of disclosure and, in turn, may play </span><span>a role in Glass Lewis' overall recommendation for the advisory vote on executive compensation. The clawback policy should </span><span>provide recoupment authority regardless of whether the employment of the executive officer was terminated with or without </span><span>cause.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Hedging of Stock</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis believes that the hedging of shares by executives in the shares of the companies where they are employed severs </span><span>the alignment of interests of the executive with shareholders. We believe companies should adopt strict policies to prohibit </span><span>executives from hedging the economic risk associated with their share ownership in the company.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Pledging of Stock</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis believes that shareholders should examine the facts and circumstances of each company rather than apply a </span><span>one-size-fits-all policy regarding employee stock pledging. Glass Lewis believes that shareholders benefit when employees, </span><span>particularly senior executives, have meaningful financial interest in the success of the company under their management, and </span><span>therefore we recognize the benefits of measures designed to encourage employees to both buy shares out of their own </span><span>pocket and to retain shares they have been granted; blanket policies prohibiting stock pledging may discourage executives </span><span>and employees from doing either.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>However, we also recognize that the pledging of shares can present a risk that, depending on a host of factors, an executive </span><span>with significant pledged shares and limited other assets may have an incentive to take steps to avoid a forced sale of shares </span><span>in the face of a rapid stock price decline. Therefore, to avoid substantial losses from a forced sale to meet the terms of the </span><span>loan, the executive may have an incentive to boost the stock price in the short term in a manner that is unsustainable, thus </span><span>hurting shareholders in the long-term. We also recognize concerns regarding pledging may not apply to less senior </span><span>employees, given the latter group’s significantly more limited influence over a company’s stock price. Therefore, we believe </span><span>that the issue of pledging shares should be reviewed in that context, as should policies that distinguish between the two </span><span>groups.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis believes that the benefits of stock ownership by executives and employees may outweigh the risks of stock </span><span>pledging, depending on many factors. As such, Glass Lewis reviews all relevant factors in evaluating proposed policies, </span><span>limitations and prohibitions on pledging stock, including:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The number of shares pledged;</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The percentage executives’ pledged shares are of outstanding shares;</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The percentage executives’ pledged shares are of each executive’s shares and total assets;</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-57</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Companies should facilitate this relationship through </span><span>the adoption and enforcement of minimum executive share ownership requirements. Companies should clearly disclose their </span><span>executive ownership requirements in their Compensation Discussion and Analysis section and how the various types of </span><span>outstanding equity awards are counted or excluded from the ownership level calculation.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In determining whether executives have met the requirements or not, the inclusion of unearned performance-based full value </span><span>awards and/or unexercised stock options without cogent rationale may be viewed as problematic. While Glass Lewis views </span><span>the inclusion of unearned performance-based equity in the ownership determination as problematic, we continue to believe </span><span>that performance-based equity compensation plays an important role in aligning executive pay with performance.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Compensation Consultant Independence</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As mandated by Section 952 of the Dodd-Frank Act, as of January 11, 2013, the SEC approved listing requirements for both </span><span>the NYSE and NASDAQ which require compensation committees to consider six factors </span><span>(https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2012/33-9330.pdf, p.31-32) in assessing compensation advisor independence. According </span><span>to the SEC, </span><span>“</span><span>no one factor should be viewed as a determinative factor.</span><span>”</span><span> Glass Lewis believes this six-factor assessment is an </span><span>important process for every compensation committee to undertake but believes companies employing a consultant for board </span><span>compensation, consulting and other corporate services should provide clear disclosure beyond just a reference to examining </span><span>the six points, in order to allow shareholders to review the specific aspects of the various consultant relationships.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We believe compensation consultants are engaged to provide objective, disinterested, expert advice to the compensation </span><span>committee. When the consultant or its affiliates receive substantial income from providing other services to the company, we </span><span>believe the potential for a conflict of interest arises and the independence of the consultant may be jeopardized. Therefore, </span><span>Glass Lewis will, when relevant, note the potential for a conflict of interest when the fees paid to the advisor or its affiliates for </span><span>other services exceed those paid for compensation consulting.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>CEO Pay Ratio</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As mandated by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Consumer and Protection Act, beginning in 2018, issuers will </span><span>be required to disclose the median annual total compensation of all employees except the CEO, the total annual </span><span>compensation of the CEO or equivalent position, and the ratio between the two amounts. Glass Lewis will display the pay </span><span>ratio as a data point in our Proxy Papers, as available. While we recognize that the pay ratio has the potential to provide </span><span>additional insight when assessing a company’s pay practices, at this time it will not be a determinative factor in our voting </span><span>recommendations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Frequency of Say-on-Pay</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Dodd-Frank Act also requires companies to allow shareholders a non-binding vote on the frequency of say-on-pay votes </span><span>(</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> every one, two or three years). Additionally, Dodd-Frank requires companies to hold such votes on the frequency of say-on-pay</span><span> votes at least once every six years.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-58</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>We believe companies should submit say-on-pay votes to shareholders every year. We believe that the time and financial </span><span>burdens to a company with regard to an annual vote are relatively small and incremental and are outweighed by the benefits </span><span>to shareholders through more frequent accountability. Implementing biannual or triennial votes on executive compensation </span><span>limits shareholders’ ability to hold the board accountable for its compensation practices through means other than voting </span><span>against the compensation committee. Unless a company provides a compelling rationale or unique circumstances for say-on-pay</span><span> votes less frequent than annually, we will generally recommend that shareholders support annual votes on </span><span>compensation.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Vote on Golden Parachute Arrangements</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Dodd-Frank Act also requires companies to provide shareholders with a separate non-binding vote on approval of </span><span>golden parachute compensation arrangements in connection with certain change-in-control transactions. However, if the </span><span>golden parachute arrangements have previously been subject to a say-on-pay vote which shareholders approved, then this </span><span>required vote is waived.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis believes the narrative and tabular disclosure of golden parachute arrangements benefits all shareholders. Glass </span><span>Lewis analyzes each golden parachute arrangement on a case-by-case basis, taking into account, among other items: the </span><span>nature of the change-in-control transaction, the ultimate value of the payments particularly compared to the value of the </span><span>transaction, any excise tax gross-up obligations, the tenure and position of the executives in question before and after the </span><span>transaction, any new or amended employment agreements entered into in connection with the transaction, and the type of </span><span>triggers involved (</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> single vs. double). In cases where new problematic features, such as excise tax gross-up obligations, </span><span>are introduced in a golden parachute proposal, such features may contribute to a negative recommendation not only for the </span><span>golden parachute proposal under review, but for the next say-on-pay proposal of any involved corporate parties, as well as </span><span>recommendations against their compensation committee as appropriate.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Equity-Based Compensation Proposals</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We believe that equity compensation awards, when not abused, are useful for retaining employees and providing an incentive </span><span>for them to act in a way that will improve company performance. Glass Lewis recognizes that equity-based compensation </span><span>plans are critical components of a company’s overall compensation program, and we analyze such plans accordingly based </span><span>on both quantitative and qualitative factors.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Our quantitative analysis assesses the plan’s cost and the company’s pace of granting utilizing a number of different </span><span>analyses, comparing the program with absolute limits we believe are key to equity value creation and with a carefully chosen </span><span>peer group. In general, our model seeks to determine whether the proposed plan is either absolutely excessive or is more </span><span>than one standard deviation away from the average plan for the peer group on a range of criteria, including dilution to </span><span>shareholders and the projected annual cost relative to the company’s financial performance. Each of the analyses (and their </span><span>constituent parts) is weighted and the plan is scored in accordance with that weight.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We compare the program’s expected annual expense with the business’s operating metrics to help determine whether the </span><span>plan is excessive in light of company performance. We also compare the plan’s expected annual cost to the enterprise value </span><span>of the firm rather than to market capitalization because the employees, managers and directors of the firm contribute to the </span><span>creation of enterprise value but not necessarily market capitalization (the biggest difference is seen where cash represents </span><span>the vast majority of market capitalization). Finally, we do not rely exclusively on relative comparisons with averages because, </span><span>in addition to creeping averages serving to inflate compensation, we believe that some absolute limits are warranted.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We then consider qualitative aspects of the plan such as plan administration, the method and terms of exercise, repricing </span><span>history, express or implied rights to reprice, and the presence of evergreen provisions. We also closely review the choice and </span><span>use of, and difficulty in meeting, the awards’ performance metrics and targets, if any. We believe significant changes to the </span><span>terms of a plan should be explained for shareholders and clearly indicated. Other factors such as a company’s size and </span><span>operating environment may also be relevant in assessing the severity of concerns or the benefits of certain changes. Finally, </span><span>we may consider a company’s executive compensation practices in certain situations, as applicable.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We evaluate equity plans based on certain overarching principles:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Companies should seek more shares only when needed;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Requested share amounts or share reserves should be conservative in size so that companies must seek shareholder </span><span>approval every three to four years (or more frequently);</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-59</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

This </span><span>refers to </span><span>“</span><span>inverse</span><span>”</span><span> full-value award multipliers;</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Selected performance metrics should be challenging and appropriate, and should be subject to relative </span><span>performance measurements; and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Stock grants should be subject to minimum vesting and/or holding periods sufficient to ensure sustainable </span><span>performance and promote retention.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Meanwhile, for individual equity award proposals where the recipient of the proposed grant is also a large shareholder of the </span><span>company whose vote can materially affect the passage of the proposal, we believe that the company should strongly </span><span>consider the level of approval from disinterested shareholders before proceeding with the proposed grant. Glass Lewis </span><span>recognizes potential conflicts of interests when vote outcomes can be heavily influenced by the recipient of the grant. A </span><span>required abstention vote or non-vote from the recipient for an equity award proposal in these situations can help to avoid </span><span>such conflicts. This favorable feature will be weighed alongside the structure, disclosure, dilution, provided rationale, and </span><span>other provisions related to the individual award to assess the award’s alignment with long-term shareholder interests.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Option Exchanges and Repricing</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis is generally opposed to the repricing of employee and director options regardless of how it is accomplished. </span><span>Employees should have some downside risk in their equity-based compensation program and repricing eliminates any such </span><span>risk. As shareholders have substantial risk in owning stock, we believe that the equity compensation of employees and </span><span>directors should be similarly situated to align their interests with those of shareholders. We believe this will facilitate </span><span>appropriate risk- and opportunity-taking for the company by employees.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We are concerned that option grantees who believe they will be </span><span>“</span><span>rescued</span><span>”</span><span> from underwater options will be more inclined to </span><span>take unjustifiable risks. Moreover, a predictable pattern of repricing or exchanges substantially alters a stock option’s value </span><span>because options that will practically never expire deeply out of the money are worth far more than options that carry a risk of </span><span>expiration.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In short, repricings and option exchange programs change the bargain between shareholders and employees after the </span><span>bargain has been struck.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>There is one circumstance in which a repricing or option exchange program may be acceptable: if macroeconomic or </span><span>industry trends, rather than specific company issues, cause a stock’s value to decline dramatically and the repricing is </span><span>necessary to motivate and retain employees. In viewing the company’s stock decline as part of a larger trend, we would </span><span>expect the impact to approximately reflect the market or industry price decline in terms of timing and magnitude. In this </span><span>circumstance, we think it fair to conclude that option grantees may be suffering from a risk that was not foreseeable when </span><span>the original </span><span>“</span><span>bargain</span><span>”</span><span> was struck. In such a scenario, we may opt to support a repricing or option exchange program only if </span><span>sufficient conditions are met. We are largely concerned with the inclusion of the following features:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Officers and board members cannot participate in the program; and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The exchange is value-neutral or value-creative to shareholders using very conservative assumptions.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>In our evaluation of the appropriateness of the program design, we also consider the inclusion of the following </span><span>features:</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The vesting requirements on exchanged or repriced options are extended beyond one year;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-60</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

These practices are similar to repricing </span><span>options and eliminate much of the downside risk inherent in an option grant that is designed to induce recipients to </span><span>maximize shareholder return.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Backdating an option is the act of changing an option’s grant date from the actual grant date to an earlier date when the </span><span>market price of the underlying stock was lower, resulting in a lower exercise price for the option. In past studies, Glass Lewis </span><span>identified over 270 companies that have disclosed internal or government investigations into their past stock-option grants.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Spring-loading is granting stock options while in possession of material, positive information that has not been disclosed </span><span>publicly. Bullet-dodging is delaying the grants of stock options until after the release of material, negative information. This </span><span>can allow option grants to be made at a lower price either before the release of positive news or following the release of </span><span>negative news, assuming the stock’s price will move up or down in response to the information. This raises a concern similar </span><span>to that of insider trading, or the trading on material non-public information.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The exercise price for an option is determined on the day of grant, providing the recipient with the same market risk as an </span><span>investor who bought shares on that date. However, where options were backdated, the executive or the board (or the </span><span>compensation committee) changed the grant date retroactively. The new date may be at or near the lowest price for the year </span><span>or period. This would be like allowing an investor to look back and select the lowest price of the year at which to buy shares.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A 2006 study of option grants made between 1996 and 2005 at 8,000 companies found that option backdating can be an </span><span>indication of poor internal controls. The study found that option backdating was more likely to occur at companies without a </span><span>majority independent board and with a long-serving CEO; both factors, the study concluded, were associated with greater </span><span>CEO influence on the company’s compensation and governance practices.</span><span>44</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Where a company granted backdated options to an executive who is also a director, Glass Lewis will recommend voting </span><span>against that executive/director, regardless of who decided to make the award. In addition, Glass Lewis will recommend </span><span>voting against those directors who either approved or allowed the backdating. Glass Lewis feels that executives and directors </span><span>who either benefited from backdated options or authorized the practice have failed to act in the best interests of </span><span>shareholders.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Given the severe tax and legal liabilities to the company from backdating, Glass Lewis will consider recommending voting </span><span>against members of the audit committee who served when options were backdated, a restatement occurs, material </span><span>weaknesses in internal controls exist and disclosures indicate there was a lack of documentation. These committee members </span><span>failed in their responsibility to ensure the integrity of the company’s financial reports.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When a company has engaged in spring-loading or bullet-dodging, Glass Lewis will consider recommending voting against </span><span>the compensation committee members where there has been a pattern of granting options at or near historic lows. Glass </span><span>Lewis will also recommend voting against executives serving on the board who benefited from the spring-loading or bullet-dodging.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Director Compensation Plans</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis believes that non-employee directors should receive reasonable and appropriate compensation for the time and </span><span>effort they spend serving on the board and its committees. However, a balance is required. Fees should be competitive in </span><span>order to retain and attract qualified individuals, but excessive fees represent a financial cost to the company and potentially </span><span>compromise the objectivity and independence of non-employee directors. We will consider recommending support for </span><span>compensation plans that include option grants or other equity-based awards that help to align the interests of outside </span><span>directors with those of shareholders. However, to ensure directors are not incentivized in the same manner as executives but </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>44</span></div> <div><span>Lucian Bebchuk, Yaniv Grinstein and Urs Peyer. </span><span>“</span><span>LUCKY CEOs.</span><span>”</span><span> November, 2006.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-61</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>rather serve as a check on imprudent risk-taking in executive compensation plan design, equity grants to directors should </span><span>not be performance-based. Where an equity plan exclusively or primarily covers non-employee directors as participants, we </span><span>do not believe that the plan should provide for performance-based awards in any capacity.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>When non-employee director equity grants are covered by the same equity plan that applies to a company’s broader </span><span>employee base, we will use our proprietary model and analyst review of this model to guide our voting recommendations. If </span><span>such a plan broadly allows for performance-based awards to directors or explicitly provides for such grants, we may </span><span>recommend against the overall plan on this basis, particularly if the company has granted performance-based awards to </span><span>directors in past.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Employee Stock Purchase Plans</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis believes that employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs) can provide employees with a sense of ownership in their </span><span>company and help strengthen the alignment between the interests of employees and shareholders. We evaluate ESPPs by </span><span>assessing the expected discount, purchase period, expected purchase activity (if previous activity has been disclosed) and </span><span>whether the plan has a </span><span>“</span><span>lookback</span><span>”</span><span> feature. Except for the most extreme cases, Glass Lewis will generally support these plans </span><span>given the regulatory purchase limit of $25,000 per employee per year, which we believe is reasonable. We also look at the </span><span>number of shares requested to see if a ESPP will significantly contribute to overall shareholder dilution or if shareholders will </span><span>not have a chance to approve the program for an excessive period of time. As such, we will generally recommend against </span><span>ESPPs that contain </span><span>“</span><span>evergreen</span><span>”</span><span> provisions that automatically increase the number of shares available under the ESPP each </span><span>year.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Executive Compensation Tax Deductibility — Amendment to IRC 162(M)</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The </span><span>“</span><span>Tax Cut and Jobs Act</span><span>”</span><span> had significant implications on Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, a provision that </span><span>allowed companies to deduct compensation in excess of $1 million for the CEO and the next three most highly compensated </span><span>executive officers, excluding the CFO, if the compensation is performance-based and is paid under shareholder-approved </span><span>plans. Glass Lewis does not generally view amendments to equity plans and changes to compensation programs in response </span><span>to the elimination of tax deductions under 162(m) as problematic. This specifically holds true if such modifications </span><span>contribute to the maintenance of a sound performance-based compensation program.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As grandfathered contracts may continue to be eligible for tax deductions under the transition rule for Section 162(m), </span><span>companies may therefore submit incentive plans for shareholder approval to take of advantage of the tax deductibility </span><span>afforded under 162(m) for certain types of compensation.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We believe the best practice for companies is to provide robust disclosure to shareholders so that they can make fully </span><span>informed judgments about the reasonableness of the proposed compensation plan. To allow for meaningful shareholder </span><span>review, we prefer that disclosure should include specific performance metrics, a maximum award pool, and a maximum </span><span>award amount per employee. We also believe it is important to analyze the estimated grants to see if they are reasonable and </span><span>in line with the company’s peers.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We typically recommend voting against a 162(m) proposal where: (i) a company fails to provide at least a list of performance </span><span>targets; (ii) a company fails to provide one of either a total maximum or an individual maximum; or (iii) the proposed plan or </span><span>individual maximum award limit is excessive when compared with the plans of the company’s peers.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The company’s record of aligning pay with performance (as evaluated using our proprietary pay-for-performance model) </span><span>also plays a role in our recommendation. Where a company has a record of setting reasonable pay relative to business </span><span>performance, we generally recommend voting in favor of a plan even if the plan caps seem large relative to peers because we </span><span>recognize the value in special pay arrangements for continued</span> <br/><span> </span><span>exceptional performance.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As with all other issues we review, our goal is to provide consistent but contextual advice given the specifics of the company </span><span>and ongoing performance. Overall, we recognize that it is generally not in shareholders’ best interests to vote against such a </span><span>plan and forgo the potential tax benefit since shareholder rejection of such plans will not curtail the awards; it will only </span><span>prevent the tax deduction associated with them.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-62</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

They can reduce management </span><span>accountability by substantially limiting opportunities for corporate takeovers. Rights plans can thus prevent shareholders </span><span>from receiving a buy-out premium for their stock. Typically we recommend that shareholders vote against these plans to </span><span>protect their financial interests and ensure that they have an opportunity to consider any offer for their shares, especially </span><span>those at a premium.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We believe boards should be given wide latitude in directing company activities and in charting the company’s course. </span><span>However, on an issue such as this, where the link between the shareholders’ financial interests and their right to consider and </span><span>accept buyout offers is substantial, we believe that shareholders should be allowed to vote on whether they support such a </span><span>plan’s implementation. This issue is different from other matters that are typically left to board discretion. Its potential impact </span><span>on and relation to shareholders is direct and substantial. It is also an issue in which management interests may be different </span><span>from those of shareholders; thus, ensuring that shareholders have a voice is the only way to safeguard their interests.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In certain circumstances, we will support a poison pill that is limited in scope to accomplish a particular objective, such as the </span><span>closing of an important merger, or a pill that contains what we believe to be a reasonable qualifying offer clause. We will </span><span>consider supporting a poison pill plan if the qualifying offer clause includes each of the following attributes:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The form of offer is not required to be an all-cash transaction;</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The offer is not required to remain open for more than 90 business days;</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The offeror is permitted to amend the offer, reduce the offer, or otherwise change the terms;</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>There is no fairness opinion requirement; and</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>There is a low to no premium requirement.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Where these requirements are met, we typically feel comfortable that shareholders will have the opportunity to voice their </span><span>opinion on any legitimate offer.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>NOL Poison Pills</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Similarly, Glass Lewis may consider supporting a limited poison pill in the event that a company seeks shareholder approval </span><span>of a rights plan for the express purpose of preserving Net Operating Losses (NOLs). While companies with NOLs can </span><span>generally carry these losses forward to offset future taxable income, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code limits </span><span>companies’ ability to use NOLs in the event of a </span><span>“</span><span>change of ownership.</span><span>”</span><span>45</span><span> In this case, a company may adopt or amend a </span><span>poison pill (NOL pill) in order to prevent an inadvertent change of ownership by multiple investors purchasing small chunks </span><span>of stock at the same time, and thereby preserve the ability to carry the NOLs forward. Often such NOL pills have trigger </span><span>thresholds much lower than the common 15% or 20% thresholds, with some NOL pill triggers as low as 5%.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As with traditional poison pills, NOL pills may deter shareholders and potentially serve as entrenchment mechanisms. Certain </span><span>features such as low thresholds combined with acting in concert provisions, among other concerning terms, may </span><span>disempower shareholders and insulate the board and management. When acting in concert provisions are present within the </span><span>terms of a NOL pill, we believe this may raise concerns as to the true objective of the pill.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Acting in concert provisions broaden the definition of beneficial ownership to prohibit parallel conduct, or multiple </span><span>shareholders party to a formal or informal agreement collaborating to influence the board and management of a company, </span><span>and aggregate the ownership of such shareholders towards the triggering threshold. In our view, acting in concert provisions </span><span>broadly limit the voice of shareholders and may diminish their ability to engage in a productive dialogue with the company </span><span>and with other shareholders. When a board adopts defensive measures without engaging with shareholders, we take a dim </span><span>view of the board and the overall governance of the company.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>45</span></div> <div><span>Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code refers to a </span><span>“</span><span>change of ownership</span><span>”</span><span> of more than 50 percentage points by one or more 5% shareholders </span><span>within a three-year period. The statute is intended to deter the </span><span>“</span><span>trafficking</span><span>”</span><span> of net operating losses.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-63</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>As such, Glass Lewis evaluates NOL pills on a strictly case-by-case basis, taking into consideration, among other factors: (i) </span><span>the value of the NOLs to the company; (ii) the likelihood of a change of ownership based on the size of the holdings and the </span><span>nature of the larger shareholders; (iii) the trigger threshold; (iv) the duration of the plan (</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> whether it contains a reasonable </span><span>“</span><span>sunset</span><span>”</span><span> provision, generally one year or less); (v) the inclusion of an acting in concert provision; (vi) whether the pill is </span><span>implemented following the filing of a Schedule 13D by a shareholder or there is evidence of hostile activity or shareholder </span><span>activism; and (vii) if the pill is subject to periodic board review and/or shareholder ratification.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>We believe that shareholders should be offered the opportunity to vote on any adoption or renewal of a NOL pill regardless of </span><span>any potential tax benefit that it offers a company. As such, we will consider recommending voting against those members of </span><span>the board who served at the time when an NOL pill was adopted without shareholder approval within the prior twelve </span><span>months and where the NOL pill is not subject to shareholder ratification.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fair Price Provisions</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fair price provisions, which are rare, require that certain minimum price and procedural requirements be observed by any </span><span>party that acquires more than a specified percentage of a corporation’s common stock. The provision is intended to protect </span><span>minority shareholder value when an acquirer seeks to accomplish a merger or other transaction which would eliminate or </span><span>change the interests of the minority shareholders. The provision is generally applied against the acquirer unless the takeover </span><span>is approved by a majority of </span><span>“</span><span>continuing directors</span><span>”</span><span> and holders of a majority, in some cases a supermajority as high as 80%, </span><span>of the combined voting power of all stock entitled to vote to alter, amend, or repeal the above provisions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The effect of a fair price provision is to require approval of any merger or business combination with an </span><span>“</span><span>interested </span><span>shareholder</span><span>”</span><span> by 51% of the voting stock of the company, excluding the shares held by the interested shareholder. An </span><span>interested shareholder is generally considered to be a holder of 10% or more of the company’s outstanding stock, but the </span><span>trigger can vary.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Generally, provisions are put in place for the ostensible purpose of preventing a back-end merger where the interested </span><span>shareholder would be able to pay a lower price for the remaining shares of the company than he or she paid to gain control. </span><span>The effect of a fair price provision on shareholders, however, is to limit their ability to gain a premium for their shares through </span><span>a partial tender offer or open market acquisition which typically raise the share price, often significantly. A fair price provision </span><span>discourages such transactions because of the potential costs of seeking shareholder approval and because of the restrictions </span><span>on purchase price for completing a merger or other transaction at a later time.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis believes that fair price provisions, while sometimes protecting shareholders from abuse in a takeover situation, </span><span>more often act as an impediment to takeovers, potentially limiting gains to shareholders from a variety of transactions that </span><span>could significantly increase share price. In some cases, even the independent directors of the board cannot make exceptions </span><span>when such exceptions may be in the best interests of shareholders. Given the existence of state law protections for minority </span><span>shareholders such as Section 203 of the Delaware Corporations Code, we believe it is in the best interests of shareholders to </span><span>remove fair price provisions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Control Share Statutes</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain states, including Delaware, have adopted control share acquisition statutes as an anti-takeover defense for certain </span><span>closed-end investment companies and business development companies. Control share statutes may prevent changes in </span><span>control by limiting voting rights of a person that acquires the ownership of </span><span>“</span><span>control shares.</span><span>”</span><span> Control shares are shares of </span><span>stock equal to or exceeding specified percentages of company voting power, and a control share statute prevents shares in </span><span>excess of the specified percentage from being voted, unless: (i) the board approves them to be voted; or (ii) the holder of the </span><span>“</span><span>control shares</span><span>”</span><span> receives approval from a supermajority of </span><span>“</span><span>non-interested</span><span>”</span><span> shareholders.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Depending on the state of incorporation, companies may automatically rely on control share statutes unless the fund’s board </span><span>of trustees eliminates the application of the control share statute to any or all fund share acquisitions, through adoption of a </span><span>provision in the fund's governing instrument or by fund board action alone. In certain other states, companies must adopt </span><span>control share statutes.</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-64</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>In our view, control share statues disenfranchise shareholders by reducing their voting power to a level less than their </span><span>economic interest and effectively function as an anti-takeover device. We believe all shareholders should have an opportunity </span><span>to vote all of their shares. Moreover, anti-takeover measures may prevent shareholders from receiving a buy-out premium for </span><span>their stock.</span></div> <div> <div><span>As such, we will generally recommend voting for proposals to opt out of control share acquisition statutes, unless doing so </span><span>would allow the completion of a takeover that is not in the best interests of shareholders; and against proposals to amend </span><span>the charter to include control share acquisition provisions.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Further, in cases where a closed-end fund or business development company has received a public buyout offer and has </span><span>relied on a control share statute as a defense mechanism in the prior year, we will generally recommend shareholders vote </span><span>against the chair of the nominating and governance committee, absent a compelling rationale as to why a rejected </span><span>acquisition was not in the best interests of shareholders.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Quorum Requirements</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis believes that a company’s quorum requirement should be set at a level high enough to ensure that a broad range </span><span>of shareholders are represented in person or by proxy, but low enough that the company can transact necessary business. </span><span>Companies in the U.S. are generally subject to quorum requirements under the laws of their specific state of incorporation. </span><span>Additionally, those companies listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market are required to specify a quorum in their bylaws, provided </span><span>however that such quorum may not be less than one-third of outstanding shares. Prior to 2013, the New York Stock </span><span>Exchange required a quorum of 50% for listed companies, although this requirement was dropped in recognition of </span><span>individual state requirements and potential confusion for issuers. Delaware, for example, required companies to provide for a </span><span>quorum of no less than one-third of outstanding shares; otherwise such quorum shall default to a majority.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We generally believe a majority of outstanding shares entitled to vote is an appropriate quorum for the transaction of </span><span>business at shareholder meetings. However, should a company seek shareholder approval of a lower quorum requirement we </span><span>will generally support a reduced quorum of at least one-third of shares entitled to vote, either in person or by proxy. When </span><span>evaluating such proposals, we also consider the specific facts and circumstances of the company, such as size and </span><span>shareholder base.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Director and Officer Indemnification</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>While Glass Lewis strongly believes that directors and officers should be held to the highest standard when carrying out their </span><span>duties to shareholders, some protection from liability is reasonable to protect them against certain suits so that these officers </span><span>feel comfortable taking measured risks that may benefit shareholders. As such, we find it appropriate for a company to </span><span>provide indemnification and/or enroll in liability insurance to cover its directors and officers so long as the terms of such </span><span>agreements are reasonable.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Officer Exculpation</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In August 2022, the Delaware General Assembly amended Section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware General Corporation Law </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>DGCL</span><span>”</span><span>) to authorize corporations to adopt a provision in their certificate of incorporation to eliminate or limit monetary </span><span>liability of certain corporate officers for breach of fiduciary duty of care. Previously, the DGCL allowed only exculpation of </span><span>corporate directors from breach of fiduciary duty of care claims if the corporation’s certificate of incorporation includes an </span><span>exculpation provision.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The amendment authorizes corporations to provide for exculpation of the following officers: (i) the corporation’s president, </span><span>chief executive officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, chief legal officer, controller, treasurer or chief accounting </span><span>officer, (ii) </span><span>“</span><span>named executive officers</span><span>”</span><span> identified in the corporation’s SEC filings, and (iii) individuals who have agreed to be </span><span>identified as officers of the corporation.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Corporate exculpation provisions under the DGCL only apply to claims for breach of the duty of care, and not to breaches of </span><span>the duty of loyalty. Exculpation provisions also do not apply to acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional </span><span>misconduct, knowing violations of the law, or transactions involving the receipt of any improper personal benefits. </span><span>Furthermore, officers may not be exculpated from claims brought against them by, or in the right of, the corporation (</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> </span><span>derivative actions).</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-65</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Under Section 102(b)(7), a corporation must affirmatively elect to include an exculpation provision in its certificate of </span><span>incorporation. We will closely evaluate proposals to adopt officer exculpation provisions on a case-by-case basis. We will </span><span>generally recommend voting against such proposals eliminating monetary liability for breaches of the duty of care for certain </span><span>corporate officers, unless compelling rationale for the adoption is provided by the board, and the provisions are reasonable.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Reincorporation</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In general, Glass Lewis believes that the board is in the best position to determine the appropriate jurisdiction of </span><span>incorporation for the company. When examining a management proposal to reincorporate to a different state or country, we </span><span>review the relevant financial benefits, generally related to improved corporate tax treatment, as well as changes in corporate </span><span>governance provisions, especially those relating to shareholder rights, resulting from the change in domicile. Where the </span><span>financial benefits are de minimis and there is a decrease in shareholder rights, we will recommend voting against the </span><span>transaction.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>However, costly, shareholder-initiated reincorporations are typically not the best route to achieve the furtherance of </span><span>shareholder rights. We believe shareholders are generally better served by proposing specific shareholder resolutions </span><span>addressing pertinent issues which may be implemented at a lower cost, and perhaps even with board approval. However, </span><span>when shareholders propose a shift into a jurisdiction with enhanced shareholder rights, Glass Lewis examines the significant </span><span>ways would the company benefit from shifting jurisdictions including the following:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Is the board sufficiently independent?</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Does the company have anti-takeover protections such as a poison pill or classified board in place?</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Has the board been previously unresponsive to shareholders (such as failing to implement a shareholder proposal </span><span>that received majority shareholder support)?</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Do shareholders have the right to call special meetings of shareholders?</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Are there other material governance issues of concern at the company?</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Has the company’s performance matched or exceeded its peers in the past one and three years?</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>How has the company ranked in Glass Lewis’ pay-for-performance analysis during the last three years?</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Does the company have an independent chair?</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>We note, however, that we will only support shareholder proposals to change a company’s place of incorporation in </span><span>exceptional circumstances.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Exclusive Forum and Fee-Shifting Bylaw Provisions</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis recognizes that companies may be subject to frivolous and opportunistic lawsuits, particularly in conjunction </span><span>with a merger or acquisition, that are expensive and distracting. In response, companies have sought ways to prevent or limit </span><span>the risk of such suits by adopting bylaws regarding where the suits must be brought or shifting the burden of the legal </span><span>expenses to the plaintiff, if unsuccessful at trial.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis believes that charter or bylaw provisions limiting a shareholder’s choice of legal venue are not in the best </span><span>interests of shareholders. Such clauses may effectively discourage the use of shareholder claims by increasing their </span><span>associated costs and making them more difficult to pursue. As such, shareholders should be wary about approving any </span><span>limitation on their legal recourse including limiting themselves to a single jurisdiction (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, Delaware or federal courts for </span><span>matters arising under the Securities Act of 1933) without compelling evidence that it will benefit shareholders.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For this reason, we recommend that shareholders vote against any bylaw or charter amendment seeking to adopt an </span><span>exclusive forum provision unless the company: (i) provides a compelling argument on why the provision would directly </span><span>benefit shareholders; (ii) provides evidence of abuse of legal process in other, non-favored jurisdictions; (iii) narrowly tailors </span><span>such provision to the risks involved; and (iv) maintains a strong record of good corporate governance practices.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Moreover, in the event a board seeks shareholder approval of a forum selection clause pursuant to a bundled bylaw </span><span>amendment rather than as a separate proposal, we will weigh the importance of the other bundled provisions when </span><span>determining the vote recommendation on the proposal. We will nonetheless recommend voting against the chair of the </span><span>governance committee for bundling disparate proposals into a single proposal (refer to our discussion of nominating and </span><span>governance committee performance in Section I of the guidelines).</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-66</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Similarly, some companies have adopted bylaws requiring plaintiffs who sue the company and fail to receive a judgment in </span><span>their favor pay the legal expenses of the company. These bylaws, also known as </span><span>“</span><span>fee-shifting</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>loser pays</span><span>”</span><span> bylaws, will </span><span>likely have a chilling effect on even meritorious shareholder lawsuits as shareholders would face an strong financial </span><span>disincentive not to sue a company. Glass Lewis therefore strongly opposes the adoption of such fee-shifting bylaws and, if </span><span>adopted without shareholder approval, will recommend voting against the governance committee. While we note that in June </span><span>of 2015 the State of Delaware banned the adoption of fee-shifting bylaws, such provisions could still be adopted by </span><span>companies incorporated in other states.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Authorized Shares</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis believes that adequate capital stock is important to a company’s operation. When analyzing a</span> <br/><span> </span><span>request for additional shares, we typically review four common reasons why a company might need additional capital stock:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Stock Split</span><span> — We typically consider three metrics when evaluating whether we think a stock split is likely or necessary: </span><span>The historical stock pre-split price, if any; the current price relative to the company’s most common trading price over </span><span>the past 52 weeks; and some absolute limits on stock price that, in our view, either always make a stock split </span><span>appropriate if desired by management or would almost never be a reasonable price at which to split a stock.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>2.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Shareholder Defenses</span><span> — Additional authorized shares could be used to bolster takeover defenses such as a poison pill. </span><span>Proxy filings often discuss the usefulness of additional shares in defending against or discouraging a hostile takeover as </span><span>a reason for a requested increase. Glass Lewis is typically against such defenses and will oppose actions intended to </span><span>bolster such defenses.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>3.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Financing for Acquisitions</span><span> — We look at whether the company has a history of using stock for acquisitions and </span><span>attempt to determine what levels of stock have typically been required to accomplish such transactions. Likewise, we </span><span>look to see whether this is discussed as a reason for additional shares in the proxy.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>4.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Financing for Operations</span><span> — We review the company’s cash position and its ability to secure financing through </span><span>borrowing or other means. We look at the company’s history of capitalization and whether the company has had to use </span><span>stock in the recent past as a means of raising capital.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Issuing additional shares generally dilutes existing holders in most circumstances. Further, the availability of additional </span><span>shares, where the board has discretion to implement a poison pill, can often serve as a deterrent to interested suitors. </span><span>Accordingly, where we find that the company has not detailed a plan for use of the proposed shares, or where the number of </span><span>shares far exceeds those needed to accomplish a detailed plan, we typically recommend against the authorization of </span><span>additional shares. Similar concerns may also lead us to recommend against a proposal to conduct a reverse stock split if the </span><span>board does not state that it will reduce the number of authorized common shares in a ratio proportionate to the split.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>With regard to authorizations and/or increases in preferred shares, Glass Lewis is generally against such authorizations, </span><span>which allow the board to determine the preferences, limitations and rights of the preferred shares (known as </span><span>“</span><span>blank-check </span><span>preferred stock</span><span>”</span><span>). We believe that granting such broad discretion should be of concern to common shareholders, since blank-check</span><span> preferred stock could be used as an anti-takeover device or in some other fashion that adversely affects the voting </span><span>power or financial interests of common shareholders. Therefore, we will generally recommend voting against such requests, </span><span>unless the company discloses a commitment to not use such shares as an anti-takeover defense or in a shareholder rights </span><span>plan, or discloses a commitment to submit any shareholder rights plan to a shareholder vote prior to its adoption.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>While we think that having adequate shares to allow management to make quick decisions and effectively operate the </span><span>business is critical, we prefer that, for significant transactions, management come to shareholders to justify their use of </span><span>additional shares rather than providing a blank check in the form of a large pool of unallocated shares available for any </span><span>purpose.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Advance Notice Requirements</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We typically recommend that shareholders vote against proposals that would require advance notice of shareholder </span><span>proposals or of director nominees.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>These proposals typically attempt to require a certain amount of notice before shareholders are allowed to place proposals </span><span>on the ballot. Notice requirements typically range between three to six months prior to the annual meeting. Advance notice </span><span>requirements typically make it impossible for a shareholder who misses the deadline to present a shareholder proposal or a </span><span>director nominee that might be in the best interests of the company and its shareholders.</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-67</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>We believe shareholders should be able to review and vote on all proposals and director nominees. Shareholders can always </span><span>vote against proposals that appear with little prior notice. Shareholders, as owners of a business, are capable of identifying </span><span>issues on which they have sufficient information and ignoring issues on which they have insufficient information. Setting </span><span>arbitrary notice restrictions limits the opportunity for shareholders to raise issues that may come up after the window closes.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Virtual Shareholder Meetings</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A growing contingent of companies have elected to hold shareholder meetings by virtual means only. Glass Lewis believes </span><span>that virtual meeting technology can be a useful complement to a traditional, in-person shareholder meeting by expanding </span><span>participation of shareholders who are unable to attend a shareholder meeting in person (</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> a </span><span>“</span><span>hybrid meeting</span><span>”</span><span>). However, </span><span>we also believe that virtual-only meetings have the potential to curb the ability of a company’s shareholders to meaningfully </span><span>communicate with the company’s management.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Prominent shareholder rights advocates, including the Council of Institutional Investors, have expressed concerns that such </span><span>virtual-only meetings do not approximate an in-person experience and may serve to reduce the board’s accountability to </span><span>shareholders. When analyzing the governance profile of companies that choose to hold virtual-only meetings, we look for </span><span>robust disclosure in a company’s proxy statement which assures shareholders that they will be afforded the same rights and </span><span>opportunities to participate as they would at an in-person meeting.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Examples of effective disclosure include: (i) addressing the ability of shareholders to ask questions during the meeting, </span><span>including time guidelines for shareholder questions, rules around what types of questions are allowed, and rules for how </span><span>questions and comments will be recognized and disclosed to meeting participants; (ii) procedures, if any, for posting </span><span>appropriate questions received during the meeting and the company’s answers, on the investor page of their website as soon </span><span>as is practical after the meeting; (iii) addressing technical and logistical issues related to accessing the virtual meeting </span><span>platform; and (iv) procedures for accessing technical support to assist in the event of any difficulties accessing the virtual </span><span>meeting.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We will generally recommend voting against members of the governance committee where the board is planning to hold a </span><span>virtual-only shareholder meeting and the company does not provide such disclosure.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Voting Structure</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Multi-Class Share Structures</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis believes multi-class voting structures are typically not in the best interests of common shareholders. Allowing </span><span>one vote per share generally operates as a safeguard for common shareholders by ensuring that those who hold a significant </span><span>minority of shares are able to weigh in on issues set forth by the board.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Furthermore, we believe that the economic stake of each shareholder should match their voting power and that no small </span><span>group of shareholders, family or otherwise, should have voting rights different from those of other shareholders. On matters </span><span>of governance and shareholder rights, we believe shareholders should have the power to speak and the opportunity to effect </span><span>change. That power should not be concentrated in the hands of a few for reasons other than economic stake.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We generally consider a multi-class share structure to reflect negatively on a company’s overall corporate governance. </span><span>Because we believe that companies should have share capital structures that protect the interests of non-controlling </span><span>shareholders as well as any controlling entity, we typically recommend that shareholders vote in favor of recapitalization </span><span>proposals to eliminate dual-class share structures. Similarly, we will generally recommend against proposals to adopt a new </span><span>class of common stock. We will generally recommend voting against the chair of the governance committee at companies </span><span>with a multi-class share structure and unequal voting rights when the company does not provide for a reasonable sunset of </span><span>the multi-class share structure (generally seven years or less).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the case of a board that adopts a multi-class share structure in connection with an IPO, spin-off, or direct listing within the </span><span>past year, we will generally recommend voting against all members of the board who served at the time of the IPO if the </span><span>board: (i) did not also commit to submitting the multi-class structure to a shareholder vote at the company’s first </span><span>shareholder meeting following the IPO; or (ii) did not provide for a reasonable sunset of the multi-class structure (generally </span><span>seven years or less). If the multi-class share structure is put to a shareholder vote, we will examine the level of approval or </span><span>disapproval attributed to unaffiliated shareholders when determining the vote outcome.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-68</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>At companies that have multi-class share structures with unequal voting rights, we will carefully examine the level of </span><span>approval or disapproval attributed to unaffiliated shareholders when determining whether board responsiveness is warranted. </span><span>In the case of companies that have multi-class share structures with unequal voting rights, we will generally examine the </span><span>level of approval or disapproval attributed to unaffiliated shareholders on a </span><span>“</span><span>one share, one vote</span><span>”</span><span> basis. At controlled and </span><span>multi-class companies, when at least 20% or more of unaffiliated shareholders vote contrary to management, we believe that </span><span>boards should engage with shareholders and demonstrate some initial level of responsiveness, and when a majority or more </span><span>of unaffiliated shareholders vote contrary to management we believe that boards should engage with shareholders and </span><span>provide a more robust response to fully address shareholder concerns.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Cumulative Voting</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Cumulative voting increases the ability of minority shareholders to elect a director by allowing shareholders to cast as many </span><span>shares of the stock they own multiplied by the number of directors to be elected. As companies generally have multiple </span><span>nominees up for election, cumulative voting allows shareholders to cast all of their votes for a single nominee, or a smaller </span><span>number of nominees than up for election, thereby raising the likelihood of electing one or more of their preferred nominees </span><span>to the board. It can be important when a board is controlled by insiders or affiliates and where the company’s ownership </span><span>structure includes one or more shareholders who control a majority-voting block of company stock.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis believes that cumulative voting generally acts as a safeguard for shareholders by ensuring that those who hold a </span><span>significant minority of shares can elect a candidate of their choosing to the board. This allows the creation of boards that are </span><span>responsive to the interests of all shareholders rather than just a small group of</span> <br/><span> </span><span>large holders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We review cumulative voting proposals on a case-by-case basis, factoring in the independence of the board and the status of </span><span>the company’s governance structure. But we typically find these proposals on ballots at companies where independence is </span><span>lacking and where the appropriate checks and balances favoring shareholders are not in place. In those instances we typically </span><span>recommend in favor of cumulative voting.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Where a company has adopted a true majority vote standard (</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> where a director must receive a majority of votes cast to be </span><span>elected, as opposed to a modified policy indicated by a resignation policy only), Glass Lewis will recommend voting against </span><span>cumulative voting proposals due to the incompatibility of the two election methods. For companies that have not adopted a </span><span>true majority voting standard but have adopted some form of majority voting, Glass Lewis will also generally recommend </span><span>voting against cumulative voting proposals if the company has not adopted anti-takeover protections and has been </span><span>responsive to shareholders.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Where a company has not adopted a majority voting standard and is facing both a shareholder proposal to adopt majority </span><span>voting and a shareholder proposal to adopt cumulative voting, Glass Lewis will support only the majority voting proposal. </span><span>When a company has both majority voting and cumulative voting in place, there is a higher likelihood of one or more </span><span>directors not being elected as a result of not receiving a majority vote. This is because shareholders exercising the right to </span><span>cumulate their votes could unintentionally cause the failed election of one or more directors for whom shareholders do not </span><span>cumulate votes.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Supermajority Vote Requirements</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis believes that supermajority vote requirements impede shareholder action on ballot items critical to shareholder </span><span>interests. An example is in the takeover context, where supermajority vote requirements can strongly limit the voice of </span><span>shareholders in making decisions on such crucial matters as selling the business. This in turn degrades share value and can </span><span>limit the possibility of buyout premiums to shareholders. Moreover,</span> <br/><span> </span><span>we believe that a supermajority vote requirement can enable a small group of shareholders to overrule the will of the majority </span><span>shareholders. We believe that a simple majority is appropriate to approve all matters presented to shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Transaction of Other Business</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We typically recommend that shareholders not give their proxy to management to vote on any other business items that may </span><span>properly come before an annual or special meeting. In our opinion, granting unfettered discretion is unwise.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-69</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Anti-Greenmail Proposals</span></div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis will support proposals to adopt a provision preventing the payment of greenmail, which would serve to prevent </span><span>companies from buying back company stock at significant premiums from a certain shareholder. Since a large or majority </span><span>shareholder could attempt to compel a board into purchasing its shares at a large premium, the anti-greenmail provision </span><span>would generally require that a majority of shareholders other than the majority shareholder approve the buyback.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Mutual Funds: Investment Policies and Advisory Agreements</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis believes that decisions about a fund’s structure and/or a fund’s relationship with its investment advisor or sub-advisors</span><span> are generally best left to management and the members of the board, absent a showing of egregious or illegal </span><span>conduct that might threaten shareholder value. As such, we focus our analyses of such proposals on the following main </span><span>areas:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The terms of any amended advisory or sub-advisory agreement;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Any changes in the fee structure paid to the investment advisor; and</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Any material changes to the fund’s investment objective or strategy.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>We generally support amendments to a fund’s investment advisory agreement absent a material change that is not in the </span><span>best interests of shareholders. A significant increase in the fees paid to an investment advisor would be reason for us to </span><span>consider recommending voting against a proposed amendment to an investment advisory agreement or fund reorganization. </span><span>However, in certain cases, we are more inclined to support an increase in advisory fees if such increases result from being </span><span>performance-based rather than asset-based. Furthermore, we generally support sub-advisory agreements between a fund’s </span><span>advisor and sub-advisor, primarily because the fees received by the sub-advisor are paid by the advisor, and not by the fund.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In matters pertaining to a fund’s investment objective or strategy, we believe shareholders are best served when a fund’s </span><span>objective or strategy closely resembles the investment discipline shareholders understood and selected when they initially </span><span>bought into the fund. As such, we generally recommend voting against amendments to a fund’s investment objective or </span><span>strategy when the proposed changes would leave shareholders with stakes in a fund that is noticeably different than when </span><span>originally purchased, and which could therefore potentially negatively impact some investors’ diversification strategies.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Real Estate Investment Trusts</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The complex organizational, operational, tax and compliance requirements of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) provide </span><span>for a unique shareholder evaluation. In simple terms, a REIT must have a minimum of 100 shareholders (the 100 Shareholder </span><span>Test) and no more than 50% of the value of its shares can be held by five or fewer individuals (the </span><span>“</span><span>5/50 Test</span><span>”</span><span>). At least 75% </span><span>of a REITs’ assets must be in real estate, it must derive 75% of its gross income from rents or mortgage interest, and it must </span><span>pay out 90% of its taxable earnings as dividends. In addition, as a publicly traded security listed on a stock exchange, a REIT </span><span>must comply with the same general listing requirements as a publicly traded equity.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In order to comply with such requirements, REITs typically include percentage ownership limitations in their organizational </span><span>documents, usually in the range of 5% to 10% of the REITs outstanding shares. Given the complexities of REITs as an asset </span><span>class, Glass Lewis applies a highly nuanced approach in our evaluation of REIT proposals, especially regarding changes in </span><span>authorized share capital, including preferred stock.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Preferred Stock Issuances at REITs</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis is generally against the authorization of </span><span>“</span><span>blank-check preferred stock.</span><span>”</span><span> However, given the requirement that a </span><span>REIT must distribute 90% of its net income annually, it is inhibited from retaining capital to make investments in its business. </span><span>As such, we recognize that equity financing likely plays a key role in a REIT’s growth and creation of shareholder value. </span><span>Moreover, shareholder concern regarding the use of preferred stock as an anti-takeover mechanism may be allayed by the </span><span>fact that most REITs maintain ownership limitations in their certificates of incorporation. For these reasons, along with the </span><span>fact that REITs typically do not engage in private placements of preferred stock (which result in the rights of common </span><span>shareholders being adversely impacted), we may support requests to authorize shares of blank-check preferred stock at </span><span>REITs.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-70</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Business Development Companies</span></div> <div> <div><span>Business Development Companies (BDCs) were created by the U.S. Congress in 1980; they are regulated under the </span><span>Investment Company Act of 1940 and are taxed as regulated investment companies (RICs) under the Internal Revenue Code. </span><span>BDCs typically operate as publicly traded private equity firms that invest in early stage to mature private companies as well as </span><span>small public companies. BDCs realize operating income when their investments are sold off, and therefore maintain complex </span><span>organizational, operational, tax and compliance requirements that are similar to those of REITs—the most evident of which is </span><span>that BDCs must distribute at least 90% of their taxable earnings as dividends.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Authorization to Sell Shares at a Price Below Net Asset Value</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Considering that BDCs are required to distribute nearly all their earnings to shareholders, they sometimes need to offer </span><span>additional shares of common stock in the public markets to finance operations and acquisitions. However, shareholder </span><span>approval is required in order for a BDC to sell shares of common stock at a price below Net Asset Value (NAV). Glass Lewis </span><span>evaluates these proposals using a case-by-case approach, but will recommend supporting such requests if the following </span><span>conditions are met:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The authorization to allow share issuances below NAV has an expiration date of one year or less from the date that </span><span>shareholders approve the underlying proposal (</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> the meeting date);</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The proposed discount below NAV is minimal (ideally no greater than 20%);</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The board specifies that the issuance will have a minimal or modest dilutive effect (ideally no greater than 25% of </span><span>the company’s then-outstanding common stock prior to the issuance); and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>A majority of the company’s independent directors who do not have a financial interest in the issuance approve the </span><span>sale.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>In short, we believe BDCs should demonstrate a responsible approach to issuing shares below NAV, by proactively addressing </span><span>shareholder concerns regarding the potential dilution of the requested share issuance, and explaining if and how the </span><span>company’s past below-NAV share issuances have benefitted the company.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Auditor Ratification and Below-NAV Issuances</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When a BDC submits a below-NAV issuance for shareholder approval, we will refrain from recommending against the audit </span><span>committee chair for not including auditor ratification on the same ballot. Because of the unique way these proposals interact, </span><span>votes may be tabulated in a manner that is not in shareholders’ interests. In cases where these proposals appear on the same </span><span>ballot, auditor ratification is generally the only </span><span>“</span><span>routine proposal,</span><span>”</span><span> the presence of which triggers a scenario where broker </span><span>non-votes may be counted toward shareholder quorum, with unintended consequences.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Under the 1940 Act, below-NAV issuance proposals require relatively high shareholder approval. Specifically, these proposals </span><span>must be approved by the lesser of: (i) 67% of votes cast if a majority of shares are represented at the meeting; or (ii) a </span><span>majority of outstanding shares. Meanwhile, any broker non-votes counted toward quorum will automatically be registered as </span><span>“</span><span>against</span><span>”</span><span> votes for purposes of this proposal. The unintended result can be a case where the issuance proposal is not </span><span>approved, despite sufficient voting shares being cast in favor. Because broker non-votes result from a lack of voting </span><span>instruction by the shareholder, we do not believe shareholders’ ability to weigh in on the selection of auditor outweighs the </span><span>consequences of failing to approve an issuance proposal due to such technicality.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Special Purpose Acquisition Companies</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs), also known as </span><span>“</span><span>blank check companies,</span><span>”</span><span> are publicly traded entities with no </span><span>commercial operations and are formed specifically to pool funds in order to complete a merger or acquisition within a set </span><span>time frame. In general, the acquisition target of a SPAC is either not yet identified or otherwise not explicitly disclosed to the </span><span>public even when the founders of the SPAC may have at least one target in mind. Consequently, IPO investors often do not </span><span>know what company they will ultimately be investing in.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>SPACs are therefore very different from typical operating companies. Shareholders do not have the same expectations </span><span>associated with an ordinary publicly traded company and executive officers of a SPAC typically do not continue in </span><span>employment roles with an acquired company.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-71</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Extension of Business Combination Deadline</span></div> <div> <div><span>Governing documents of SPACs typically provide for the return of IPO proceeds to common shareholders if no qualifying </span><span>business combination is consummated before a certain date. Because the time frames for the consummation of such </span><span>transactions are relatively short, SPACs will sometimes hold special shareholder meetings at which shareholders are asked to </span><span>extend the business combination deadline. In such cases, an acquisition target will typically have been identified, but </span><span>additional time is required to allow management of the SPAC to finalize the terms of the deal.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis believes management and the board are generally in the best position to determine when the extension of a </span><span>business combination deadline is needed. We therefore generally defer to the recommendation of management and support </span><span>reasonable extension requests.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>SPAC Board Independence</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The board of directors of a SPAC’s acquisition target is in many cases already established prior to the business combination. </span><span>In some cases, however, the board’s composition may change in connection with the business combination, including the </span><span>potential addition of individuals who served in management roles with the SPAC. The role of a SPAC executive is unlike that of </span><span>a typical operating company executive. Because the SPAC’s only business is identifying and executing an acquisition deal, the </span><span>interests of a former SPAC executive are also different. Glass Lewis does not automatically consider a former SPAC executive </span><span>to be affiliated with the acquired operating entity when their only position on the board of the combined entity is that of an </span><span>otherwise independent director. Absent any evidence of an employment relationship or continuing material financial interest </span><span>in the combined entity, we will therefore consider such directors to be independent.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Director Commitments of SPAC Executives</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We believe the primary role of executive officers at SPACs is identifying acquisition targets for the SPAC and consummating a </span><span>business combination. Given the nature of these executive roles and the limited business operations of SPACs, when a </span><span>directors’ only executive role is at a SPAC, we will generally apply our higher limit for company directorships. As a result, we </span><span>generally recommend that shareholders vote against a director who serves in an executive role only at a SPAC while serving </span><span>on more than five public company boards.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shareholder Proposals</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis believes that shareholders should seek to promote governance structures that protect shareholders, support </span><span>effective ESG oversight and reporting, and encourage director accountability. Accordingly, Glass Lewis places a significant </span><span>emphasis on promoting transparency, robust governance structures and companies’ responsiveness to and engagement </span><span>with shareholders. We also believe that companies should be transparent on how they are mitigating material ESG risks, </span><span>including those related to climate change, human capital management, and stakeholder relations.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>To that end, we evaluate all shareholder proposals on a case-by-case basis with a view to promoting long-term shareholder </span><span>value. While we are generally supportive of those that promote board accountability, shareholder rights, and transparency, we </span><span>consider all proposals in the context of a company’s unique operations and risk profile.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For a detailed review of our policies concerning compensation, environmental, social, and governance shareholder proposals, </span><span>please refer to our comprehensive </span><span>Proxy Paper Guidelines for Shareholder Proposals &amp; ESG-Related Issues</span><span>, available at </span><span>www.glasslewis.com/voting-policies-current/</span><span>.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Overall Approach to Environmental, Social &amp; Governance Issues</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis evaluates all environmental and social issues through the lens of long-term shareholder value. We believe that </span><span>companies should be considering material environmental and social factors in all aspects of their operations and that </span><span>companies should provide shareholders with disclosures that allow them to understand how these factors are being </span><span>considered and how attendant risks are being mitigated. We also are of the view that governance is a critical factor in how </span><span>companies manage environmental and social risks and opportunities and that a well-governed company will be generally </span><span>managing these issues better than one without a governance structure that promotes board independence and </span><span>accountability.</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-72</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>We believe part of the board’s role is to ensure that management conducts a complete risk analysis of company operations, </span><span>including those that have material environmental and social implications. We believe that directors should monitor </span><span>management’s performance in both capitalizing on environmental and social opportunities and mitigating environmental </span><span>and social risks related to operations in order to best serve the interests of shareholders. Companies face significant financial, </span><span>legal and reputational risks resulting from poor environmental and social practices, or negligent oversight thereof. Therefore, </span><span>in cases where the board or management has neglected to take action on a pressing issue that could negatively impact </span><span>shareholder value, we believe that shareholders should take necessary action in order to effect changes that will safeguard </span><span>their financial interests.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Given the importance of the role of the board in executing a sustainable business strategy that allows for the realization of </span><span>environmental and social opportunities and the mitigation of related risks, relating to environmental risks and opportunities, </span><span>we believe shareholders should seek to promote governance structures that protect shareholders and promote director </span><span>accountability. When management and the board have displayed disregard for environmental or social risks, have engaged in </span><span>egregious or illegal conduct, or have failed to adequately respond to current or imminent environmental and social risks that </span><span>threaten shareholder value, we believe shareholders should consider holding directors accountable. In such instances, we will </span><span>generally recommend against responsible members of the board that are specifically charged with oversight of the issue in </span><span>question.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When evaluating environmental and social factors that may be relevant to a given company, Glass Lewis does so in the </span><span>context of the financial materiality of the issue to the company’s operations. We believe that all companies face risks </span><span>associated with environmental and social issues. However, we recognize that these risks manifest themselves differently at </span><span>each company as a result of a company’s operations, workforce, structure, and geography, among other factors. Accordingly, </span><span>we place a significant emphasis on the financial implications of a company’s actions with regard to impacts on its </span><span>stakeholders and the environment.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When evaluating environmental and social issues, Glass Lewis examines companies’:</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Direct environmental and social risk</span><span> — Companies should evaluate financial exposure to direct environmental risks </span><span>associated with their operations. Examples of direct environmental risks include those associated with oil or gas spills, </span><span>contamination, hazardous leakages, explosions, or reduced water or air quality, among others. Social risks may include non-inclusive</span><span> employment policies, inadequate human rights policies, or issues that adversely affect the company’s stakeholders. </span><span>Further, we believe that firms should consider their exposure to risks emanating from a broad range of issues, over which </span><span>they may have no or only limited control, such as insurance companies being affected by increased storm severity and </span><span>frequency resulting from climate change.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk due to legislation and regulation</span><span> — Companies should evaluate their exposure to changes or potential changes in </span><span>regulation that affect current and planned operations. Regulation should be carefully monitored in all jurisdictions in which </span><span>the company operates. We look closely at relevant and proposed legislation and evaluate whether the company has </span><span>responded proactively.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Legal and reputational risk</span><span> — Failure to take action on important environmental or social issues may carry the risk of inciting </span><span>negative publicity and potentially costly litigation. While the effect of high-profile campaigns on shareholder value may not </span><span>be directly measurable, we believe it is prudent for companies to carefully evaluate the potential impacts of the public </span><span>perception of their impacts on stakeholders and the environment. When considering investigations and lawsuits, Glass Lewis </span><span>is mindful that such matters may involve unadjudicated allegations or other charges that have not been resolved. Glass Lewis </span><span>does not assume the truth of such allegations or charges or that the law has been violated. Instead, Glass Lewis focuses </span><span>more broadly on whether, under the particular facts and circumstances presented, the nature and number of such concerns, </span><span>lawsuits or investigations reflects on the risk profile of the company or suggests that appropriate risk mitigation measures </span><span>may be warranted.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Governance risk</span><span> — Inadequate oversight of environmental and social issues carries significant risks to companies. When </span><span>leadership is ineffective or fails to thoroughly consider potential risks, such risks are likely unmitigated and could thus present </span><span>substantial risks to the company, ultimately leading to loss of shareholder value.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis believes that one of the most crucial factors in analyzing the risks presented to companies in the form of </span><span>environmental and social issues is the level and quality of oversight over such issues. When management and the board have </span><span>displayed disregard for environmental risks, have engaged in egregious or illegal conduct, or have failed to adequately </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-73</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>respond to current or imminent environmental risks that threaten shareholder value, we believe shareholders should consider </span><span>holding directors accountable. When companies have not provided for explicit, board-level oversight of environmental and </span><span>social matters and/or when a substantial environmental or social risk has been ignored or inadequately addressed, we may </span><span>recommend voting against members of the board. In addition, or alternatively, depending on the proposals presented, we </span><span>may also consider recommending voting in favor of relevant shareholder proposals or against other relevant management-proposed</span><span> items, such as the ratification of auditor, a company’s accounts and reports, or ratification of management and </span><span>board acts.</span></div> <div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-74</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Summary of Changes for 2024</span></div> <div> <div><span>Board Diversity</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy has updated its policy concerning gender diversity on boards. The policy has been updated to provide </span><span>that, if less than 30% of the board is female the Climate Policy will vote against the entire incumbent male nominating </span><span>committee members for large- and mid-cap companies; however, where local market standards dictate a higher level of </span><span>expected gender diversity, the Climate Policy will follow the local market requirement. Previously, the Climate Policy would </span><span>vote against members of the nominating committee in instances where large-cap companies did not have at least 30% </span><span>gender diversity and the chair of the nominating committee when mid- and small-cap companies did not have at least one </span><span>woman on their boards. The policy will continue to recommend against male members of the nominating committee when </span><span>small-cap companies do not have at least one woman on their boards.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Stakeholder Considerations</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In order to drive long-term shareholder value, companies require a social license to operate. A lack of consideration for </span><span>stakeholders can present legal, regulatory, and reputational risks. With this view, the Climate Policy has narrowed its focus to </span><span>vote against the chair of the board in instances where companies in major blue chip indices are not signatories or </span><span>participants in the United Nations Global Compact (</span><span>“</span><span>UNGC</span><span>”</span><span>) or have not adopted a human rights policy that is aligned with </span><span>the standards set forth by the International Labour Organization (</span><span>“</span><span>ILO</span><span>”</span><span>) or the Universal Declaration on Human Rights </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>UDHR</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Other Changes</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A number of updates have also been made to the Glass Lewis standard guidelines, which underpin and inform the Climate </span><span>Policy. Further details can be found at </span><span>www.glasslewis.com</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Introduction</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Institutional investors are increasingly recognizing the importance of incorporating material environmental, social, and </span><span>governance (</span><span>“</span><span>ESG</span><span>”</span><span>) factors into their investment processes. Active ownership on ESG issues will typically include also </span><span>applying these considerations to proxy voting practices. Furthermore, climate change is presenting unprecedented risks to </span><span>companies, investors and society, more broadly. As the physical, regulatory, legal and reputational risks associated with </span><span>climate change continue to mount, investors are taking an increasingly active role in engaging companies on how they are </span><span>mitigating their climate impacts and managing the related risks and opportunities to their businesses. One very important </span><span>part of this active engagement is how investors are casting votes in alignment with their portfolio-related climate risk </span><span>strategies and in a manner that mitigates attendant risks to the best extent possible. This policy allows investors to </span><span>incorporate companies’ governance, oversight, management, and reporting of climate risks and opportunities into their </span><span>proxy voting practices.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy was designed for clients with a strong focus on environmental risk mitigation as well as those who look to </span><span>promote enhanced climate disclosure and climate-related risk mitigation strategies. The Climate Policy takes into account a </span><span>company’s size and sector in order ensure that shareholders execute votes that both promote a transition to a low-carbon </span><span>future and that make sense from a financial perspective in the context of a company’s operations. The Climate Policy </span><span>underscores that, while all companies face risks attendant to climate change, these risks will manifest themselves in different </span><span>ways. In addition, it recognizes that the majority of the world’s carbon emissions are emitted by select, systemically important </span><span>emitters. Accordingly, the Climate Policy will apply an additional layer of scrutiny to ensure that those companies have </span><span>effective oversight of and mechanisms to respond to the changing climate.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Specifically, the Climate Policy has identified three tiers of companies:</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Tier 1:</span><span> Climate Action 100+ companies. These companies are the highest-emitting companies and thus have significant </span><span>exposure to climate-related risks. Accordingly, the Climate Policy will ensure that these companies are held to the </span><span>highest standard with respect to the governance afforded to climate change, the disclosures expected by these </span><span>companies and the way that these companies incentivize executives to mitigate climate-related risks.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Tier 2: </span><span>Companies where greenhouse gas emissions represent a material risk, as defined by the Sustainability </span><span>Accounting Standards Board (SASB). For companies that are determined to have significant risk exposure as a result of </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-79</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>their GHG emissions, the Climate Policy will promote enhanced governance and disclosure of climate-related issues, as </span><span>well as the establishment of policies and strategies to help mitigate climate-related risks.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Tier 3:</span><span> All other companies. The Climate Policy recognizes that climate change represents a risk to all businesses, </span><span>regardless of industry or exposure to climate-related regulatory or legal risks. As a result, the Climate Policy will promote </span><span>enhanced disclosure on these climate-related risks as well as enhanced board-level oversight of environmental and </span><span>social issues.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy is guided by a framework established by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), </span><span>which is based on four pillars: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Governance:</span><span> The Climate Policy will closely evaluate the roles and responsibilities of the board and its committees in </span><span>order to understand what level of oversight is afforded to environmental and climate- related risks and opportunities. In </span><span>instances where a company does not afford proper oversight to these issues, the Climate Policy will vote against relevant </span><span>directors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Strategy:</span><span> For heavily-emitting or highly-exposed companies, the Climate Policy will evaluate how a company’s strategy </span><span>has incorporated issues related to climate change, by evaluating whether the company has established GHG reduction </span><span>goals. In instances where such goals are financially material, the Climate Policy will, depending on the market, vote </span><span>against either relevant directors or a company’s Accounts and Reports at companies that have failed to establish </span><span>meaningful emissions reductions targets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk Management:</span><span> In order to determine how risks related to climate change are established throughout an </span><span>organization, the Climate Policy will carefully evaluate the incentive structures driving the top levels of an organization </span><span>and to what extent climate and other environmental risks are built into a company’s reward structures. When companies </span><span>have failed to provide an incentive structure that properly takes into account climate and environmental issues, the </span><span>Climate Policy will vote against a company’s remuneration proposals.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Metrics and Targets:</span><span> Understanding that shareholders require comprehensive disclosure of companies’ climate and </span><span>sustainability-related risks, the Climate Policy will vote against relevant directors in instances where a company has failed </span><span>to provide adequate disclosure to allow shareholders to evaluate how a company is considering issues of climate </span><span>change. For heavily-emitting companies, the Climate Policy will also evaluate if a company has provided disclosure on </span><span>SASB topics and metrics in order to determine to what level the company has provided thorough, financially-material, </span><span>and comparable disclosure to shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy acts as an overlay for Glass Lewis’ benchmark policies. Accordingly, the Climate Policy guidelines are </span><span>underpinned and informed by the Glass Lewis benchmark policy guidelines. Implementation of the Climate Policy may vary </span><span>market-to-market in accordance with regulatory requirements, corporate governance best practices, and other relevant </span><span>standards in individual markets. Detailed information on the contents and implementation of Glass Lewis’ benchmark </span><span>guidelines for all major global markets are publicly available on the Glass Lewis website.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Election of Directors</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Board of Directors</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Boards are established in order to represent shareholders and protect their interests. Glass Lewis seeks boards that have a </span><span>record for protecting shareholders and delivering value over the medium- and long-term. For boards that wish to protect and </span><span>enhance the interests of shareholders they must have sufficient levels of independence (the percentage varies by local market </span><span>practice and regulations), boast a record of positive performance, have directors with diverse backgrounds, and appoint new </span><span>directors that have a depth of relevant experience.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Board Composition</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy examines a variety of elements to the board when voting on director elections. In terms of the directors, </span><span>the policy looks at each individual on the board and explores their relationship with the company, the company’s executives </span><span>and with other board members. This is to ensure and determine whether a director has an existing relationship with the </span><span>company that are likely to impact any decision processes of that board member.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The biographical information provided by the company on the individual director is essential for investors to understand the </span><span>background and skills of the directors of the board. This information should be provided in the company’s documents well in </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-80</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Generally, the </span><span>Climate Policy will vote against responsible directors if the board is less than two-thirds independent, however, this is also </span><span>dependent on the market best practice standards.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Board Committee Composition</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>It is best practice to have independent directors serving on the audit, compensation, nominating and governance </span><span>committees. As such, the Climate Policy will support boards with this structure and encourage change when this is not the </span><span>case. However, board committee independence thresholds may vary depending on the market.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>With respect to the creation of board committees and the composition thereof, the Climate Policy will generally support </span><span>shareholder proposals requesting that companies create a committee to oversee climate-related issues or the appointment </span><span>of climate experts to the board. The Climate Policy will also support shareholder proposals requesting the establishment of </span><span>other environmental or social committees or the appointment of individuals with specific expertise (such as human rights or </span><span>public policy) if the issue is deemed material to the company or if it is evident that the company has provided insufficient </span><span>oversight of the issue in question.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Board Oversight of Environmental and Social Issues</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy is strongly focused on the governance that companies establish around material environmental and social </span><span>risks. The Climate Policy looks to companies to provide some level of board oversight of these risks. Depending on a </span><span>company’s governance structure and that market in which it is domiciled, the Climate Policy will vote against the board chair </span><span>or the chair of the audit committee if a company has not established proper risk oversight of material environmental and </span><span>social risks, including those related to climate change. In executing these votes, the Climate Policy will take into account the </span><span>company’s exposure to climate- related risks when determining whether a company has established appropriate governance </span><span>mechanisms to oversee these issues.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Board Diversity, Tenure and Refreshment</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy acknowledges the importance of ensuring that the board is comprised of directors who have a diversity of </span><span>skills, backgrounds, thoughts, and experiences. As such, having diverse boards benefits companies greatly by encompassing </span><span>an array of different perspectives and insights. The Climate Policy may vote against the chair of the nominating committee </span><span>when the board has failed to address the lack of diverse skills, and experience of the board members or when it fails to meet </span><span>legal requirements or relevant market best practice standards, and when the company has not disclosed any explanation or </span><span>plan regarding its approach to board diversity.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In terms of board tenure and refreshment, the Climate Policy strongly supports routine director evaluations, including </span><span>independent external reviews, and periodic board refreshment in order to enable the company to maintain a fresh set of </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-82</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>ideas and business strategies in an ever-changing world and market. Having directors with diverse experiences and skills can </span><span>strengthen the position of a company within the market. Therefore, the Climate Policy promotes refreshment within boards, </span><span>as a lack of refreshment can lead to poor company performance. Thus, the Climate Policy may consider voting against </span><span>directors with a lengthy tenure (</span><span>e.g</span><span>. over 12 years) when significant performance or governance concerns are identified that </span><span>indicate a fresh perspective would be beneficial and there is no evidence of any plans of future board refreshment.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy will also evaluate a company’s policies and actions with respect to board refreshment and diversity. As a </span><span>part of this evaluation, we will review the diversity of board members and support shareholder proposals to report on or </span><span>increase board diversity. The nominating and governance committee, as an agent for the shareholders, is responsible for the </span><span>governance by the board of the company and its executives. In performing this role, the committee is responsible and </span><span>accountable for selection of objective and competent board members. To that end, the Climate Policy will: (i) vote against </span><span>members of the nominating committee in the event that the board has an average tenure of over ten years and the board has </span><span>not appointed a new nominee to the board in at least five years; (ii) vote against the incumbent male nominating committee </span><span>members in instances where the board of a large- or mid-cap company is comprised of fewer than 30% female directors, or </span><span>the local market requirement for gender diversity where higher; or (iii) vote against the male members of the nominating </span><span>committee where there is not at least one woman on the board of a small-cap company.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy conducts a further level of analysis for U.S. companies included in the Russel 1000 index. For these </span><span>companies, the Climate Policy will vote against members of the nominating and governance committee when they receive a </span><span>“</span><span>Poor</span><span>”</span><span> score in Glass Lewis’ Diversity Disclosure Assessment. The Diversity Disclosure Assessment is an analysis of </span><span>companies’ proxy statement disclosure relating to board diversity, skills and the director nomination process. This </span><span>assessment reflects how a company’s proxy statement presents: (i) the board’s current percentage of racial/ethnic diversity; </span><span>(ii) whether the board’s definition of diversity explicitly includes gender and/or race/ethnicity; (iii) whether the board has </span><span>adopted a policy requiring women and minorities to be included in the initial pool of candidates when selecting new director </span><span>nominees (</span><span>“</span><span>Rooney Rule</span><span>”</span><span>); and (iv) board skills disclosure.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Director Overboarding</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy will generally recommend that shareholders vote against a director who serves as an executive officer </span><span>(other than executive chair) of any public company while serving on more than one external public company board, a </span><span>director who serves as an executive chair of any public company while serving on more than two external public company </span><span>boards, and any other director who serves on more than five public company boards.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Board Size</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Although there is not a universally acceptable optimum board size, boards should have a minimum of five directors to ensure </span><span>sufficient diversity in decision making and to enable the establishment of key committees with independent directors. </span><span>Further, boards should not be composed of more than 20 directors as the board may suffer as a result of too many voices to </span><span>be heard and have difficulty reaching consensus on issues with this number of members. As a result, the Climate Policy will </span><span>generally vote against the chair of the nominating committee at a board with fewer than five directors or more than 20 </span><span>directors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Classified Boards</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy favors the repeal of staggered boards in favor of the annual election of directors. Staggered boards are </span><span>generally less accountable to shareholders than annually elected directors to the board. In addition, the annual election of </span><span>directors encourages board members to focus on protecting the interests of shareholders. Further to this, if shareholders are </span><span>unsatisfied with board members the annual election of directors allows them to voice these concerns.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Controlled Companies</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy allows certain exceptions to the independence standards at controlled companies. The board’s main </span><span>function is to protect shareholder interests, however, when an individual, entity, or group own more than 50% of the voting </span><span>shares, the interests of majority shareholders are the interests of that entity or individual. As a result, the Climate Policy does </span><span>not apply the usual two-thirds independence threshold on controlled companies instead it includes the following guidelines:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>(i) </span></div> <div><span>As long as insiders and/or affiliates are connected to the controlling entity, the Climate Policy will accept the presence </span><span>of non-independent board members.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-83</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The Climate Policy will look at the performance </span><span>of individuals as directors and executives of the company and of other companies where they have served. Often a director’s </span><span>past conduct is indicative of future conduct and performance.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy will typically vote against directors who have served on boards or as executives of companies with records </span><span>of poor performance, inadequate risk oversight, excessive compensation, audit or accounting- related issues, and other </span><span>actions or indicators of mismanagement. However, the Climate Policy will also reevaluate the directors based on factors such </span><span>as the length of time that has passed since the incident, the director’s role, and the severity of the issue.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Environmental and Social Oversight and Performance</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy considers the oversight afforded to environmental and social issues. The Climate Policy looks to ensure </span><span>that companies maintain appropriate board-level oversight of material risks to their operations, including those that are </span><span>environmental and social in nature. When it is clear that these risks have not been properly managed or mitigated, the </span><span>Climate Policy may vote against members of the board who are responsible for the oversight of environmental and social </span><span>risks. In the absence of explicit board oversight of environmental and social issues, the Climate Policy may vote against </span><span>members of the audit committee. In making these determinations, the Climate Policy will take into account the situation at </span><span>hand, its effect on shareholder value, as well as any corrective action or other response made by the company.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Disclosure</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy expects companies to provide a sufficient level of disclosure to shareholders to allow them to understand </span><span>what environmental and social risks face the company and what steps the company is taking to mitigate those risks. </span><span>Shareholders require that companies provide disclosure of financially-material environmental and social risks, such as that </span><span>recommended by the TCFD or SASB, in order to track a company’s performance against these risks as well as how the </span><span>company’s strategies help to reduce a company’s exposure to these risks. Accordingly, the Climate Policy will vote against </span><span>relevant directors when a company has not provided such disclosure. Specifically, the Climate Policy will vote against </span><span>directors charged with oversight of environmental and social issues at companies that do not provide robust sustainability </span><span>information. For companies more exposed to climate-related risks, the Climate Policy will vote against directors responsible </span><span>for overseeing environmental and social issues if they do not provide reporting that is aligned with the recommendations of </span><span>the TCFD or SASB. However, for Climate Action 100+ focus list companies, the Climate Policy expects to see TCFD reporting </span><span>and will vote against directors that oversee environmental and social issues if such reporting has not been produced by the </span><span>company. In all aforementioned cases, if the company does not maintain explicit oversight of environmental and social issue, </span><span>the Climate Policy will instead vote against the chair of the board or the audit committee chair (if the chair and CEO roles are </span><span>combined).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Target Setting</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>While appropriate disclosure of environmental and social risks is very important to shareholders’ understanding of their </span><span>portfolio companies and how they are managing attendant risks, it is also important that companies have outlined a strategy </span><span>to mitigate climate impacts, particularly when they operate in heavily-emitting industries or industries with significant </span><span>exposure to climate-related risks. When companies have such exposure, the Climate Policy will evaluate whether the </span><span>companies have established greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals, and whether those goals are aligned with those set </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-84</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Specifically, the Climate Policy looks to companies in emissions-intensive industries or those </span><span>that are highly exposed to climate-related risks to set a net zero target or ambition. For companies with less exposure to </span><span>emissions-related risks, the Climate Policy will evaluate whether or not they have established any forward-looking GHG </span><span>emissions reductions targets. In instances where companies have failed to establish such goals, the Climate Policy will vote </span><span>against board members responsible for oversight of environmental and social issues. In instances where such oversight is not </span><span>provided, the Climate Policy will vote against the chair of the board. If the chair is combined with the CEO, the Climate Policy </span><span>will vote against the audit committee chair.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Board-Level Oversight of Environmental and Social Risks</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The insufficient oversight of environmental and social issues can present direct legal, financial, regulatory and reputational </span><span>risks that could serve to harm shareholder interests. As a result, the Climate Policy promotes oversight structures that ensure </span><span>that companies are mitigating attendant risks ad capitalizing on related opportunities to the best extent possible.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>To that end, the Climate Policy looks to boards to maintain clear oversight of material risks to their operations, including </span><span>those that are environmental and social in nature. These risks could include, but are not limited to, matters related to climate </span><span>change, human capital management, diversity, stakeholder relations, and health, safety &amp; environment.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Glass Lewis will review a company’s overall governance practices to identify which directors or board-level committees have </span><span>been charged with oversight of environmental and/or social issues. Given the importance of the board’s role in overseeing </span><span>environmental and social risks, the Climate Policy will vote against members of the governance committee that fails to </span><span>provide explicit disclosure concerning the board’s role in overseeing these issues.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Climate Risk</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Given the importance of companies mitigation and management of climate-related risks, the Climate Policy includes specific </span><span>consideration for companies’ disclosure of and policies concerning climate change. For companies included in the Climate </span><span>Action 100+ focus list and those that operate in industries where the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) has </span><span>determined that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions represent a financially material risk, the Climate Policy will vote against the </span><span>chair of the board in instances where a company has not adopted a net zero emissions target or ambition. For all other </span><span>companies, the Climate Policy will vote against the chair of the board in instances where companies have not established any </span><span>forward-looking GHG emissions reduction targets. In both instances, if the chair of the board is also the company’s CEO, the </span><span>Climate Policy will vote against the chair of the audit committee.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy also takes into consideration investors’ growing expectation for robust climate and sustainability </span><span>disclosures. For Climate Action 100+ focus list companies, as well as those where SASB has determined that GHG emissions </span><span>represent a material risk, the Climate Policy will vote against the chair of the board when the company has failed to produce </span><span>reporting that is aligned with the recommendations of the Task force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). For all </span><span>other companies, the Climate Policy may vote against the chair of the board when they have not produced sufficient </span><span>sustainability reporting.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Stakeholder Considerations</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In order to drive long-term shareholder value, companies require a social license to operate. A lack of consideration for </span><span>stakeholders can present legal, regulatory, and reputational risks. With this view, the Climate Policy will vote against the chair </span><span>of the board in instances where companies in major blue-chip indices are not signatories or participants in the United </span><span>Nations Global Compact (</span><span>“</span><span>UNGC</span><span>”</span><span>) or have not adopted a human rights policy that is aligned with the standards set forth by </span><span>the International Labour Organization (</span><span>“</span><span>ILO</span><span>”</span><span>) or the Universal Declaration on Human Rights (</span><span>“</span><span>UDHR</span><span>”</span><span>).</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For U.S. companies listed in the S&amp;P 500 index, the Climate Policy will also evaluate whether companies have provided </span><span>sufficient disclosure concerning their workforce diversity. In instances where these companies have not disclosed their full </span><span>EEO-1 reports, the Climate Policy will vote against the nominating and governance chair.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Review of Risk Management Controls</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy evaluates the risk management function of a public company on a case-by-case basis. Companies, </span><span>particularly financial firms, should have a dedicated risk committee, or a committee on the board in charge of risk oversight, </span><span>as well as a chief risk officer who reports directly to that committee, not to the CEO or another executive of the company. </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-85</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>When analyzing the risk management practices of public companies the Climate Policy takes note of any significant losses or </span><span>write-downs on financial assets and/or structured transactions. In cases where a company has disclosed a sizable loss or </span><span>write-down, and where the company’s board-level risk committee’s poor oversight contributed to the loss, the Climate Policy </span><span>will recommend that shareholders vote against such committee members on that basis. In addition, in cases where a </span><span>company maintains a significant level of financial risk exposure but fails to disclose any explicit form of board-level risk </span><span>oversight (committee or otherwise), the Climate Policy may vote against the chair of the board on that basis.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Slate Elections</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In some countries, in particular Italy, companies elect their board members as a slate, whereby shareholders are unable to </span><span>vote on the election of an individual director, but rather are limited to voting for or against the board as a whole. The Climate </span><span>Policy will generally support the slate if no major governance or board-related concerns have been raised in the analysis, and </span><span>the slate appears to support and protect the best interests of all shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Board Responsiveness</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Any time 20% or more of shareholders vote contrary to the recommendation of management on compensation or director </span><span>elections proposals, the board should, depending on the issue, demonstrate some level of responsiveness to address the </span><span>concerns of shareholders. While the 20% threshold alone will not automatically generate a negative vote from the Climate </span><span>Policy on a future proposal (</span><span>e.g</span><span>., to vote against a director nominee, against a remuneration proposal, etc.), it will be a </span><span>contributing factor to a vote against management's recommendation in the event we determine that the board did not </span><span>respond appropriately.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As a general framework, the evaluation of board responsiveness involves a review of the publicly available disclosures </span><span>released following the date of the company's last annual meeting up through the publication date of the most current Proxy </span><span>Paper.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Separation of the Roles of CEO and Chair</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The separation of the positions of CEO and chair creates a better and more independent governance structure than a </span><span>combined CEO/chair position. The role of executives is to manage the business based on the course charted by the board. </span><span>Executives should be in the position of reporting and answering to the board for their performance in achieving their goals as </span><span>set out by the board. This would become more complicated if they too held the position of chair as it would be difficult for </span><span>them to fulfil the duty of being both the overseer and policy setter when they, the CEO/chair control both the agenda and </span><span>boardroom.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy views an independent chair as better able to oversee the executives of the company and set a pro-shareholder</span><span> agenda without the management conflicts that a CEO and other executive insiders often face. Such oversight </span><span>and concern for shareholders allows for a more proactive and effective board of directors that is better able to look out for the </span><span>interests of shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Furthermore, it is the board’s responsibility to select a chief executive to best serve the company and its shareholders and to </span><span>replace this person when his or her duties have not been appropriately fulfilled. Such a replacement becomes more difficult </span><span>and happens less frequently when the chief executive is also in the position of overseeing the board.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>However, even considering the above, the Climate Policy will not vote against CEOs who also chair the board. The Climate </span><span>Policy will generally support separating the positions of CEO and chair whenever the question is posed in a proxy, as in the </span><span>long-term it is in the best interests of the company.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the absence of an independent chair, the Climate Policy will support the appointment of a presiding or lead independent </span><span>director with authority to set the agenda for the meeting and to lead sessions. In the case where the company has neither an </span><span>independent chair nor independent lead director, the Climate Policy may vote against the chair of the governance committee.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Governance Following an IPO or Spin-Off</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Companies that have recently completed an initial public offering (IPO), or spin-off should be given adequate time to fully </span><span>adjust and comply with marketplace listing requirements and meet basic corporate governance standards.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>generally allows the company a one-year period following the IPO to comply with these requirements and as such refrains </span><span>from voting based on governance standards (</span><span>e.g</span><span>., board independence, committee membership and structure, meeting </span><span>attendance, etc.).</span></div> <div> <div><span>However, there are some cases that warrant shareholder action against the board of a company that have completed an IPO </span><span>or spin-off in the past year. The Climate Policy will evaluate the terms of applicable governing documents when determining </span><span>the recommendations and whether the shareholders rights will be severely restricted. In order to come to a conclusion the </span><span>following points will be considered:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1. </span></div> <div><span>The adoption of anti-takeover provisions such as a poison pill or classified board;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>2. </span></div> <div><span>Supermajority vote requirements to amend governing documents;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>3. </span></div> <div><span>The presence of exclusive forum or fee-shifting provisions;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>4. </span></div> <div><span>Whether shareholders can call special meetings or act by written consent;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>5. </span></div> <div><span>The voting standard provided for the election of directors;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>6. </span></div> <div><span>The ability of shareholders to remove directors without cause;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>7. </span></div> <div><span>The presence of evergreen provisions in the company’s equity compensation arrangements; and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>8. </span></div> <div><span>The presence of a dual-class share structure which does not afford common shareholders voting power that is aligned </span><span>with their economic interest.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Anti-takeover provisions can negatively impact future shareholders who (except for electing to buy or sell the stock) are </span><span>unable to weigh in on matters that might negatively impact their ownership interest. In cases where the anti-takeover </span><span>provision was adopted prior to the IPO, the Climate Policy may against the members of the board who served when it was </span><span>adopted if the board:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>(i) </span></div> <div><span>Did not also commit to submit the anti-takeover provision to a shareholder vote at the company’s next shareholder </span><span>meeting following the IPO; or</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>(ii) </span></div> <div><span>Did not provide a sound rationale or sunset provision for adopting the anti-takeover provision.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Financial Reporting</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Accounts and Reports</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Excluding situations where there are concerns surrounding the integrity of the statements/reports, the Climate Policy will </span><span>generally vote for Accounts and Reports proposals.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Where the required documents have not been published at the time that the vote is cast, the Climate Policy will abstain from </span><span>voting on this proposal.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Income Allocation (Distribution of Dividends)</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy will generally vote for proposals concerning companies’ distribution of dividends. However, particular </span><span>scrutiny will be given to cases where the company’s dividend payout ratio is exceptionally low or excessively high relative to </span><span>its peers, and where the company has not provided a satisfactory explanation for this disparity.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Appointment of Auditors and Authority to Set Fees</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The role of the auditor is crucial in protecting shareholder value. Like directors, auditors should be free from conflicts of </span><span>interest and should assiduously avoid situations that require them to make choices between their own interests and the </span><span>interests of the shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy will generally support management’s recommendation for the selection of an auditor, as well as the </span><span>board’s authority to fix auditor fees. However, there are a number of exceptions to this policy, and the Climate Policy will vote </span><span>against the appointment of the auditor and/or the authorization of the board to set auditor fees in the following scenarios:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The independence of an incumbent auditor or the integrity of the audit has been compromised.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Audit fees combined with audit-related fees total less than one-half of total fees.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-87</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The Climate Policy will also support shareholder resolutions requesting the </span><span>inclusion of sustainability metrics in executive compensation plans.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Long-Term Incentive Plans</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy recognizes the value of equity-based incentive programs. When used appropriately, they provide a means </span><span>of linking an employee’s pay to a company’s performance, thereby aligning their interests with those of shareholders. In </span><span>addition, equity-based compensation is an effective way to attract, retain and motivate key employees.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In order to allow for meaningful shareholder review, incentive programs should generally include:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>(i) </span></div> <div><span>specific and appropriate performance goals;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>(ii) </span></div> <div><span>a maximum award pool; and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>(iii) </span></div> <div><span>a maximum award amount per employee.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, the payments made should be reasonable relative to the performance of the business and total compensation </span><span>paid to those included under the plan should be in line with compensation paid by the company’s peers.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Performance-Based Equity Compensation</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy supports performance-based equity compensation plans for senior executives; where it is warranted by </span><span>both their performance, and that of the company. While it is unnecessary to base equity-based compensation for all </span><span>employees to company performance, placing such limitations on grants to senior executives is considered advisable </span><span>(although in specific scenarios equity-based compensation granted to senior executives without performance criteria is </span><span>acceptable under Glass Lewis guidelines, such as in the case of moderate incentive grants made in an initial offer of </span><span>employment). While it is not uncommon for a board to state that tying equity compensation to performance goals may </span><span>hinder them in attracting, and retaining, talented executives, the Climate Policy takes the stance that performance – based </span><span>compensation aids in aligning executive interests to that of shareholders, and as such will support the company in achieving </span><span>its objectives.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy will generally vote in favor of all performance-based option or share schemes; with the exception of plans </span><span>that include a provision to allow for the re-testing of performance conditions; for which a vote against is recommended.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Director Compensation</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy supports non-employee directors receiving an appropriate form, and level, of compensation for the time </span><span>and effort they spend serving on the board and its committees; and director fees being at a level that allows a company to </span><span>retain and attract qualified individuals. The Climate Policy compares the cost of compensation to that of peer companies with </span><span>similar market capitalizations in the same country so that compensation plans may be evaluated thoroughly, and a fair vote </span><span>outcome reached.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Retirement Benefits for Directors</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy will typically vote against the granting of retirement benefits to non-executive directors. Such extended </span><span>payments can impair the objectivity and independence of these board members. Initial, and annual fees should be of a level </span><span>that provides appropriate compensation to directors throughout their service to the company.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Limits on Executive Compensation</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As a general rule, shareholders should not seek to micromanage executive compensation programs. Such matters should be </span><span>left to the board’s compensation committee. The election of directors, and specifically those who sit on the compensation </span><span>committee, is viewed as an appropriate mechanism for shareholders to express their support, or disapproval, of board policy </span><span>on this issue. Further, companies whose pay-for-performance is in line with their peers should be granted the flexibility to </span><span>compensate their executives in a manner that drives sustainable growth. However, the Climate Policy favors performance-based</span><span> compensation as an effective means of motivating executives to act in the best interests of shareholders. Performance-based</span><span> compensation may be limited if a chief executive’s pay is capped at a low level rather than flexibly tied to the </span><span>performance of the company.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-89</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The </span><span>Climate Policy is generally opposed to bundling several amendments under a single proposal as it prevents shareholders from </span><span>evaluating each amendment on its own merits. In cases, where it is a bundled amendment, the Climate Policy will evaluate </span><span>each amendment individually and only support the proposal if, in the aggregate, the amendments are in the best interests of </span><span>shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Anti-Takeover Measures</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Multi-Class Share Structures</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy views multi-class share structures as not in the best interests of shareholders and instead is in favor of one </span><span>vote per share. This structure operates as a safeguard for common shareholders by ensuring that those who hold a </span><span>significant minority of shares are still able to weigh in on issues set forth by the board. The economic stake of each </span><span>shareholder should match their voting power and that no small group of shareholders, family or otherwise, should have </span><span>differing voting rights from those of all other shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy considers a multi-class share structure as having the potential to negatively impact the overall corporate </span><span>governance of a company. Companies should have share class structures that protect the interests of non-controlling </span><span>shareholders as well as any controlling entity. Therefore, the Climate Policy will generally vote in favor of recapitalization </span><span>proposals to eliminate multi-class share structures. Similarly, the Climate Policy will typically vote against proposals to adopt </span><span>a new class of common stock.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Cumulative Voting</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When voting on cumulative voting proposals, the Climate Policy will factor in the independence of the board and the </span><span>company’s governance structure. Cumulative voting is often found on ballots at companies where independence is lacking </span><span>and where the appropriate balances favoring the interests of shareholders are not in place. However, cumulative voting </span><span>increases the ability of minority shareholders to elect a director by allowing shareholders to cast as many shares of stock they </span><span>own multiplied by the number of directors to be elected.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Cumulative voting allows shareholders to cast all their votes for one single nominee, or a smaller number of nominees than </span><span>up for election, thereby raising the likelihood of electing one or more of their preferred nominees to the board. Accordingly, </span><span>cumulative voting generally acts as a safeguard for shareholders by ensuring that those who hold a significant minority of </span><span>shares can elect a candidate of their choosing to the board. As a result, the Climate Policy will typically vote in favor proposals </span><span>concerning cumulative voting.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the case, where the company has adopted a true majority vote standard (</span><span>i.e</span><span>., where a director must receive a majority of </span><span>votes cast to be elected, as opposed to a modified policy indicated by a resignation policy only), the Climate Policy will vote </span><span>against cumulative voting proposals due to the incompatibility of the two election methods. For companies, that have not </span><span>adopted the true majority vote standard but have some form of majority voting, the Climate Policy will also recommend </span><span>voting against cumulative voting proposals if the company has also not adopted anti-takeover provisions and has been </span><span>responsive to shareholder. In instances where a company has not adopted majority voting standards and is facing both an </span><span>election on the adoption of majority voting and a proposal to adopt cumulative voting, the Climate Policy will support only </span><span>the majority voting proposal.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fair Price Provision</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fair price provisions, which are rare, require that certain minimum price and procedural requirements to be observed by any </span><span>party that acquires more than a specified percentage of a corporation's common stock. The intention of this provision is to </span><span>protect minority shareholder value when an acquirer seeks to accomplish a merger or other transaction which would </span><span>eliminate or change the rights of the shareholder. Fair price provisions sometimes protecting the rights of shareholders in a </span><span>takeover situation. However, more often than not they act as an impediment to takeovers, potentially limiting gains to </span><span>shareholders from a variety of transactions that could potentially increase share price. As a result, the Climate Policy will </span><span>generally vote to fair price provisions.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-90</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Supermajority Vote Requirements</span></div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy favors a simple majority voting structure except where a supermajority voting requirement is explicitly </span><span>intended to protect the rights of minority shareholders in a controlled company. In the case of non- controlled companies, </span><span>supermajority vote requirements act as impediments to shareholder action on ballot items that are critical to their interests. </span><span>For example, supermajority vote requirements can strongly limit the voice of shareholders in making decisions on critical </span><span>matters such as the selling of the business. Supermajority vote requirements can also allow small groups of shareholders to </span><span>overrule and dictate the will of the majority of shareholders. Thus, having a simple majority is appropriate for protecting the </span><span>rights of all shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Poison Pills (Shareholder Rights Plan)</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy will generally oppose companies’ adoption of poison pills, as they can reduce management accountability </span><span>by substantially limiting opportunities for corporate takeovers. As a result, rights plans can prevent shareholders from </span><span>receiving a buy-out premium for their stock. Generally, the Climate Policy will vote against these plans to protect their </span><span>financial interests. While boards should be given wide latitude in directing the activities of the company and charting the </span><span>company’s course, on an issue such as this where the link between the financial interests of shareholders and their right to </span><span>consider and accept buyout offers is so substantial, shareholders should be allowed to vote on whether or not they support </span><span>such a plan’s implementation. In certain limited circumstances, the Climate Policy will support a limited poison pill to </span><span>accomplish a particular objective, such as the closing of an important merger, or a pill that contains what we believe to be a </span><span>reasonable ‘qualifying offer’ clause.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Increase in Authorized Shares</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Adequate capital stock is important to a company’s operation. When analyzing a request for additional shares, the Climate </span><span>Policy will typically review four common reasons why a company may need additional capital stock:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div>

The Climate Policy favors that, when a company is undertaking significant </span><span>transactions, management will justify its use of additional shares rather than providing a blank check in the form of large </span><span>pools of unallocated shares available for any purpose.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Generally, the Climate Policy will support proposals to increase authorized shares up to 100% of the number of shares </span><span>currently authorized unless, after the increase the company would be left with less than 30% of its authorized shares </span><span>outstanding. In markets where such authorities typically also authorize the board to issue new shares without separate </span><span>shareholder approval, the Climate Policy applies the policy described below on the issuance of shares.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-91</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Further, the availability of </span><span>additional shares, where the board has discretion to implement a poison pill, can often serve as a deterrent to interested </span><span>suitors. In cases where a company has not detailed a plan for use of the proposed shares, or where the number of shares far </span><span>exceeds those needed to accomplish a detailed plan, the Climate Policy will typically vote against the authorization of </span><span>additional shares. In the case of a private placement, the Climate Policy will also factor in whether the company is offering a </span><span>discount to its share price.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Generally, the Climate Policy will support proposals to authorize the board to issue shares (with pre-emptive rights) when the </span><span>requested increase is equal to or less than the current issued share capital.

In accordance with the different market practices, the specific thresholds for </span><span>share issuance can vary. And, as a result, the Climate Policy will vote on these proposals on a case-by-case basis.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy will also generally support proposals to suspend pre-emption rights for a maximum of 5-20% of the </span><span>issued ordinary share capital of the company, depending on best practice in the country in which the company is located. </span><span>This authority should not exceed five years, or less for some countries.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Repurchase of Shares</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy typically supports proposals to repurchase shares when the plan includes the following provisions:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>(i) </span></div> <div><span>A maximum number of shares which may be purchased (typically not more than 10-15% of the issued share capital); </span><span>and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>(ii) </span></div> <div><span>A maximum price which may be paid for each share (as a percentage of the market price).</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Reincorporation</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A company is in the best position to determine the appropriate jurisdiction of incorporation. The Climate Policy will factor in </span><span>several elements when a management proposal to reincorporate the company is put to vote.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>These elements include reviewing the relevant financial benefits, generally related to incorporate tax treatment, as well as </span><span>changes in corporate governance provisions, especially those related to shareholder rights, resulting from the change in </span><span>domicile. In cases where the financial benefits are too small to be meaningful and there is a decrease in shareholder rights, </span><span>the Climate Policy will vote against the transaction.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Tax Havens</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy evaluates a company’s potential exposure to risks related to a company’s tax haven policies on an as-needed</span><span> basis and will support shareholder proposals requesting that companies report on the risks associated with their use </span><span>of tax havens or that request that companies adopt policies to discontinue operations or withdraw from tax havens. The </span><span>Climate Policy will also vote against reincorporation proposals when companies have proposed to redomicile in known tax </span><span>havens.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Advance Notice Requirements</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Typically, the Climate Policy will recommend vote against provisions that would require advance notice of shareholder </span><span>proposals or of director nominees. Advance notice requirements typically range between three to six months prior to the </span><span>annual meeting. These requirements often make it impossible for a shareholder who misses the deadline to present a </span><span>shareholder proposal or director nominee that may be in the best interests of the company. Shareholders should be able to </span><span>review and vote on all proposals and director nominees and are able to vote against proposals that appear with little prior </span><span>notice. Therefore, by setting advance notice requirements it limits the opportunity for shareholders to raise issues that may </span><span>arise after the window closes.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Transaction of Other Business</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In general, the Climate Policy will vote against proposals that put the transaction of other business items proposal up for vote </span><span>at an annual or special meeting, as granting unfettered discretion is unwise.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-92</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Anti-Greenmail Proposals</span></div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy will support proposals to adopt a provision preventing the payment of greenmail, which would serve to </span><span>prevent companies from buying back company stock at significant premiums from a certain shareholder. The anti-greenmail </span><span>provision helps to protect the company as it requires that a majority of shareholders other than the majority shareholder </span><span>approve the buyback, thus, eliminating cases where a majority shareholder could attempt to charge a board a large premium </span><span>for the shares.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Virtual-Only Shareholder Meetings</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A growing number of companies have elected to hold shareholder meetings by virtual means only. The Climate Policy </span><span>supports companies allowing a virtual option alongside an in-person meeting, so long as the shareholder interests are not </span><span>compromised. Without proper controls, conducting a virtual-only meeting of shareholders could eliminate or significantly </span><span>limit the rights of shareholders to confront, and ask management on any concerns they may have. When companies decide </span><span>to only hold virtual-only meetings, the Climate Policy will examine the level of disclosure provided by the company on the </span><span>virtual meeting procedures and base the voting outcome on that level of disclosure.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Mergers, Acquisitions &amp; Contested Meetings</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For merger and acquisition proposals, the Climate Policy undertakes a thorough examination of all elements of the </span><span>transactions and determine the transaction’s likelihood of maximizing shareholder return. In order to make a voting </span><span>recommendation, the Climate Policy will examine the process conducted, the specific parties and individuals involved in </span><span>negotiating an agreement, as well as the economic and governance terms of the proposal.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the case of contested merger situations, or board proxy fights, the Climate Policy will evaluate the plan presented by the </span><span>dissident party and how, if elected, it plans to enhance or protect shareholder value. The Climate Policy will also consider any </span><span>concerns presented by the board, including any plans for improving the performance of the company, when making the </span><span>ultimate recommendation.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shareholder Proposals</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy has a strong emphasis on mitigating climate-related risks and promoting climate-related accountability. </span><span>At the same time, the Climate Policy places significant focus on materiality and the protection and enhancement of </span><span>shareholder value. Because not all shareholder proposals, particularly those that deal with environmental and social issues, </span><span>make sense in the context of a company’s unique operations and circumstances, the Climate Policy will carefully examine the </span><span>request of each proposal to ensure that it promotes a company’s environmental and financial sustainability. With the </span><span>exception of shareholder proposals addressed below, the Climate Policy will generally only support proposals that have been </span><span>determined to be financially material for the company. Specifically, for most environmental and social proposals, the Climate </span><span>Policy will support such proposals when: (i) the proposal is deemed to address a material topic for the Company and its </span><span>industry, as determined by SASB; or (ii) Glass Lewis’ standard policy recommends in favor of the resolution.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, in extraordinary cases, when companies have failed to adequately mitigate risks stemming from environmental or </span><span>social practices, the Climate Policy may vote against:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>(i) </span></div> <div><span>Ratification of board and/or management acts;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>(ii) </span></div> <div><span>Approving a company’s accounts and reports; and/or</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>(iii) </span></div> <div><span>Relevant Directors</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Governance Proposals</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy supports increased shareholder participation and access to a company and its board of directors. </span><span>Accordingly, the Climate Policy will vote in favor of initiatives that seek to enhance shareholder rights, such as the </span><span>introduction of majority voting to elect directors, the adoption and amendment of proxy access bylaws, the </span><span>elimination/reduction of supermajority provisions, the declassification of the board, the submission of shareholder rights’ </span><span>plans to a shareholder vote, and the principle of one share, one vote.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy will also support proposals aimed at increasing the diversity of boards or management as well as those </span><span>requesting additional information concerning workforce diversity and the adoption of more inclusive nondiscrimination </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-93</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>policies. Further, the Climate Policy will support enhanced oversight of environmental and social issues at the board level by </span><span>supporting resolutions calling for the creation of an climate-related committee of the board or proposals requesting that the </span><span>board adopt a subject-matter expert, such as one with deep knowledge and experience in climate change-related issues. The </span><span>Climate Policy will also generally vote for proposals seeking to increase disclosure of a company’s business ethics and code of </span><span>conduct, as well as of its activities that relate to social welfare.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Environmental and Climate-Related Proposals</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy will generally support proposals regarding the environment, in particular, those seeking improved </span><span>sustainability reporting and disclosure about company practices which impact the environment. The Climate Policy will vote </span><span>in favor of increased disclosure of a company’s environmental risk through company- specific disclosure as well as </span><span>compliance with international environmental conventions and adherence to environmental principles. Similarly, the Climate </span><span>Policy will support proposals requesting companies develop greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals, comprehensive </span><span>recycling programs, and other proactive means to mitigate a company’s environmental footprint.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy will also support proposals requesting that companies provide certain disclosures or adopt certain policies </span><span>related to mitigating their climate change-related risks. For example, regardless of industry, the Climate Policy will support </span><span>proposals requesting that companies disclose information concerning their scenario analyses or that request the company </span><span>provide disclosure in line with certain reporting recommendations, such as those promulgated by the TCFD. Further, the </span><span>Climate Policy will support proposals requesting that a company consider energy efficiency and renewable energy sources in </span><span>its project development and overall business strategy.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>With respect to issues related to bioengineering and nanotechnology, the Climate Policy will carefully scrutinize any proposals </span><span>requesting that a company adopt a policy concerning these matters. In general, the Climate Policy support proposals that </span><span>seek additional reporting on these topics, as well as the development of safety standards to regulate their use.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy will evaluate a company’s impact on the environment, in addition to the regulatory risk a company may </span><span>face by not adopting environmentally responsible policies. Further, the Climate Policy will consider voting against directors for </span><span>not appropriately overseeing environmental risk.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy will also support proposals seeking to tie executive compensation to climate mitigation activities or those </span><span>that request that companies adjust their compensation practices to ensure that they are more aligned with a transition to a </span><span>low-carbon economy.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Say on Climate</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shareholder Proposals</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Beginning in 2021, companies began placing management proposals on their ballots that ask shareholders to vote on their </span><span>climate transition plans, or a Say on Climate vote. The Climate Policy will generally recommend in favor of shareholder </span><span>proposals requesting that companies adopt a Say on Climate vote.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Management Proposals</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When evaluating management-sponsored votes seeking approval of climate transition plans the Climate Policy looks to the </span><span>board to provide information concerning the governance of the Say on Climate vote. Specifically, the Climate Policy evaluates </span><span>whether companies provide sufficient disclosure concerning the board’s role in setting strategy in light of this vote, and how </span><span>the board intends to interpret the vote results for the proposal. In instances where disclosure concerning the governance of </span><span>the Say on Climate vote is not present, the Climate Policy will either abstain, or, depending on the quality of the plan </span><span>presented, will vote against the proposal.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy also looks to companies to clearly articulate their climate plans in a distinct and easily understandable </span><span>document, which, as a best practice, should generally be aligned with the recommendations of the TCFD. In this disclosure, it </span><span>is important that companies clearly explain their goals, how their GHG emissions targets support achievement of broader </span><span>goals (</span><span>i.e</span><span>. net zero emissions goals), and any foreseeable obstacles that could hinder their progress on these initiatives.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When evaluating these proposals, the Climate Policy will take into account a variety of factors, including: (i) the request of the </span><span>resolution (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, whether companies are asking shareholders to approve its disclosure or its size;</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-94</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>whether the company’s GHG emissions targets and the disclosure of these targets appear reasonable in light of its operations </span><span>and risk profile; and (iv) where the company is on its climate reporting journey (</span><span>e.g</span><span>., whether the company has been </span><span>reporting and engaging with shareholders on climate risk for a number of years or if this is a relatively new initiative). In </span><span>addition, the Climate Policy will determine if sufficient disclosure has been made concerning a company’s capital allocations </span><span>and expenditures in the context of its strategy and will also evaluate any stated net zero ambitions or targets. If either of </span><span>these are absent, the Climate Policy will generally vote against management Say on Climate proposals.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Social Proposals</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy will support proposals requesting that a company develop sustainable business practices, such as animal </span><span>welfare policies, human rights policies, and fair lending policies. Furthermore, the Climate Policy will support reporting and </span><span>reviewing a company’s political and charitable spending as well as its lobbying practices. In addition, the Climate Policy will </span><span>support proposals requesting that companies cease political spending or associated activities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy will also generally support enhancing the rights of workers, as well as considering the communities and </span><span>broader constituents in the areas in which companies do business. Accordingly, the Climate Policy will generally vote for </span><span>proposals requesting that companies provide greater disclosure regarding impact on local stakeholders, workers’ rights and </span><span>human rights in general. In addition, the Climate Policy will support proposals for companies to adopt or comply with certain </span><span>codes of conduct relating to labor standards, human rights conventions, and corporate responsibility at large. The Climate </span><span>Policy will also support proposals requesting independent verification of a company’s contractors’ compliance with labor and </span><span>human rights standards. In addition, the Climate Policy supports the International Labor Organization standards and </span><span>encourage companies to adopt such standards in its business operations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy will provide for a review of the performance and oversight of certain directors in instances in which a </span><span>company is found to have violated international human rights standards. Pursuant to the Climate Policy, if directors have not </span><span>adequately overseen the overall business strategy of the company to ensure that basic human rights standards are met or if a </span><span>company is subject to regulatory or legal action with a foreign government or entity due to human rights violations, the </span><span>Policy may vote against directors taking into account the severity of the violations and the outcome of the claims.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy also generally votes in favor of proposals seeking increased disclosure regarding public health and safety </span><span>issues, including those related to product responsibility. In particular, the Climate Policy supports proposals calling for the </span><span>labeling of the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), the elimination or reduction of toxic emissions and use of toxic </span><span>chemicals in manufacturing, and the prohibition of tobacco sales to minors. The Climate Policy also supports proposals </span><span>seeking a report on a company’s drug reimportation guidelines, as well as on a company’s ethical responsibility as it relates </span><span>to drug distribution and manufacture. The Climate Policy further supports proposals related to worker safety and companies’ </span><span>compliance with internationally recognized human rights or safety standards.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Compensation Proposals</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy recognizes that ESG performance factors should be an important component of the overall consideration </span><span>of proper levels of executive performance and compensation. Therefore, the Climate Policy generally votes in favor of </span><span>proposals seeking to tie executive compensation to performance measures such as compliance with environmental </span><span>regulations, health and safety regulations, nondiscrimination laws and compliance with international human rights </span><span>standards. Furthermore, the Climate Policy will generally support proposals that seek to evaluate overall director performance </span><span>based on environmental and social criteria.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy will support proposals seeking to prohibit or require more disclosure about stock hedging and pledging by </span><span>executives. The Climate Policy will also generally support proposals requesting that companies adopt executive stock </span><span>retention policies and prohibiting the accelerated vesting of equity awards. Furthermore, the Climate Policy will vote in favor </span><span>of shareholder proposals to link pay with performance, to eliminate or require shareholder approval of golden coffins, and to </span><span>clawback unearned bonuses. Finally, the Climate Policy will support proposals requesting disclosure from companies </span><span>regarding gender pay inequity and company initiatives to reduce the gap in compensation paid to women compared to men.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Lobbying and Political Spending Proposals</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For many years, there has been an attempt by many shareholders to promote accountability in companies’ political spending </span><span>and lobbying activities by requesting that companies provide additional information concerning their attendant expenditures </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-95</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>and the oversight provided to these issues. More recently, companies have received these proposals largely on account of </span><span>how they were using corporate resources to influence public policy concerning climate change. This focus extends beyond </span><span>companies’ direct political and lobbying expenditures to the funds that companies are providing to the trade associations of </span><span>which they are members in order to effect changes to climate policy. It is particularly important that companies reconcile any </span><span>divergence between their own public stances on important issues, such as climate change, and the views held by their trade </span><span>associations. Accordingly, the Climate Policy will not only broadly support proposals aimed at enhancing the transparency of </span><span>companies’ political contributions and lobbying expenditures, but it will also broadly support proposals requesting that </span><span>companies provide additional disclosure concerning how they are engaging with trade associations on issues of climate </span><span>change and whether they have identified any differences between their own positions climate change and those held by their </span><span>trade associations.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Trojan Horse Proposals</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy will carefully examine each proposal’s merits in order to ensure it seeks enhanced environmental </span><span>disclosure and/or practices, and is not conversely aimed at limiting environmental or social disclosure or consideration. </span><span>Accordingly, the Climate Policy will not support such proposals, which are often referred to as </span><span>“</span><span>Trojan Horse</span><span>”</span><span> proposals.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Vote-No Campaigns</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Climate Policy will carefully review any </span><span>“</span><span>vote-no</span><span>”</span><span> campaigns launched by shareholders as a result of their concerns </span><span>regarding a company’s failure to adequately oversee environmental and social risks or those related to poor compensation or </span><span>governance practices. When it is determined that such campaigns either address a failure of oversight on behalf of the </span><span>company or that broadly seek to promote more responsible corporate behavior, the Climate Policy may vote in line with the </span><span>recommendations of the shareholder(s) running the vote-no campaign.</span></div> </div> <div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-96</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

While </span><span>the Policy reflects analysis and identification of both financial and corporate governance risk, the Corporate Governance </span><span>Focused Policy also includes consideration of key shareholder rights in making proxy voting decisions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Corporate Governance Focused Policy will vote in favor of governance structures that will drive positive performance or </span><span>enhance shareholder value and believes that policies are generally best left to management and the board absent a showing </span><span>of egregious or illegal conduct that might threaten shareholder value. The most crucial test of a board’s commitment to the </span><span>company and to its shareholders is the performance of the board and its members. The performance of directors in their </span><span>capacity as board members and as executives of the company, when applicable, and in their roles at other companies where </span><span>they serve is critical to this evaluation.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Directors are formed into three categories based on an examination of the type of relationship they have with the company. </span><span>The table below includes a breakdown of how Glass Lewis classifies these director relationships with the company.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div> </div> </div> <div>

Generally, the Corporate Governance </span><span>Focused Policy will vote against responsible directors if the board is less than majority independent, however, this is also </span><span>dependent on the market best practice standards.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Board Committee Composition</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>It is best practice to have independent directors serving on the audit, compensation, nominating and governance </span><span>committees. As such, the Corporate Governance Focused Policy will support boards with this structure and encourage </span><span>change when this is not the case. However, board committee independence thresholds may vary depending on the market.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Director Overboarding</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Corporate Governance Focused Policy will closely review director board commitments and will vote against directors </span><span>serving on more than six total boards, for directors who are not also executives; and against directors serving more than </span><span>three total boards, for a director who serves as an executive of a public company.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Classified Boards</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Corporate Governance Focused Policy favors the repeal of staggered boards in favor of the annual election of directors. </span><span>Staggered boards are generally less accountable to shareholders than annually elected directors to the board. In addition, the </span><span>annual election of directors encourages board members to focus on protecting the interests of shareholders. Further to this, </span><span>if shareholders are unsatisfied with board members the annual election of directors allows them to voice these concerns.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-102</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Financial Reporting</span></div> <div> <div><span>Appointment of Auditors and Authority to Set Fees</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The role of the auditor is crucial in protecting shareholder value. Like directors, auditors should be free from conflicts of </span><span>interest and should assiduously avoid situations that require them to make choices between their own interests and the </span><span>interests of the shareholders.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Corporate Governance Focused Policy will generally support the ratification of the auditor and approval to set the audit </span><span>fees, except in cases where non-audit fees are greater than half of the total fees, or there has been an egregious oversight by </span><span>the auditor that comprises the integrity of their audit or independence.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Compensation</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Compensation Reports and Compensation Policies</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As a general rule, shareholders should not seek to micromanage executive compensation programs. Such matters should be </span><span>left to the board’s compensation committee. The election of directors, and specifically those who sit on the compensation </span><span>committee, is viewed as an appropriate mechanism for shareholders to express their support, or disapproval, of board policy </span><span>on this issue. Further, companies whose pay-for-performance is in line with their peers should be granted the flexibility to </span><span>compensate their executives in a manner that drives sustainable growth. The Corporate Governance Focused Policy favors </span><span>performance-based compensation as an effective means of motivating executives to act in the best interests of shareholders.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In all markets, company filings are evaluated closely to determine how well information pertinent to compensation practices </span><span>has been disclosed, the extent to which overall compensation is tied to performance, which performance metrics have been </span><span>employed, as well as how the company’s remuneration practices compare to that of its peers.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Corporate Governance Focused Policy will vote against the approval of a compensation report or policy in instances </span><span>where the company has poor financial performance over the previous three-year period, there is a severe and sustained </span><span>disconnect between executive pay and performance, and Glass Lewis believes that the compensation plan or policy does not </span><span>warrant shareholder support.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Long-Term Incentive Plans</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Corporate Governance Focused Policy recognizes the value of equity-based incentive programs. When used </span><span>appropriately, they provide a means of linking an employee’s pay to a company’s performance, thereby aligning their interests </span><span>with those of shareholders. In addition, equity-based compensation is an effective way to attract, retain and motivate key </span><span>employees.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In order to allow for meaningful shareholder review, incentive programs should generally include:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>specific and appropriate performance goals;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>a maximum award pool; and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>a maximum award amount per employee.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Corporate Governance Focused Policy generally supports the adoption of and amendment to equity-based incentive </span><span>programs except in cases where adoption of the proposal would result in significant dilution to shareholders. In these </span><span>instances, the size of the company is taken into consideration when determining the appropriate level of dilution. For </span><span>example, small cap companies may be afforded a larger degree of dilution given the unique needs to attract and retain talent </span><span>through equity-based programs, whereas large cap companies are expected to craft incentive plans where dilution does not </span><span>exceed 20%.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Performance-Based Equity Compensation</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Corporate Governance Focused Policy supports performance-based equity compensation plans for senior executives; </span><span>where it is warranted by both their performance, and that of the company. While it is not uncommon for a board to state that </span><span>tying equity compensation to performance goals may hinder them in attracting, and retaining, talented executives, the </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-103</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Corporate Governance Focused Policy takes the stance that performance-based compensation aids in aligning executive </span><span>interests to that of shareholders, and as such will support the company in achieving its objectives.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Governance Structure</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Amendments to the Articles of Association</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Corporate Governance Focused Policy will evaluate proposed amendments to a company’s articles of association on a </span><span>case-by-case basis. In cases where the article amendments are bundled, the Corporate Governance Focused Policy will </span><span>evaluate each amendment individually and may recommend against the proposal if, in the aggregate, the amendments are </span><span>not in the best interests of shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Anti-Takeover </span><span>Devices</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dual-Class Share Structures</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Corporate Governance Focused Policy views dual-class share structures as not in the best interests of shareholders and </span><span>instead is in favor of one vote per share. This structure operates as a safeguard for common shareholders by ensuring that </span><span>those who hold a significant minority of shares are still able to weigh in on issues set forth by the board. The economic stake </span><span>of each shareholder should match their voting power and that no small group of shareholders, family or otherwise, should </span><span>have differing voting rights from those of all other shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Corporate Governance Focused Policy considers a dual-class share structure as having the potential to negatively impact </span><span>the overall corporate governance of a company. Companies should have share class structures that protect the interests of </span><span>non-controlling shareholders as well as any controlling entity. Therefore, the Corporate Governance Focused Policy will </span><span>generally vote in favor of proposals to eliminate dual-class share structures. Similarly, the Corporate Governance Focused </span><span>Policy will typically vote against proposals to adopt a new class of common stock.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Cumulative Voting</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Cumulative voting increases the ability of minority shareholders to elect a director by allowing shareholders to cast as many </span><span>shares of stock they own multiplied by the number of directors to be elected. Cumulative voting allows shareholders to cast </span><span>all their votes for one single nominee, or a smaller number of nominees than up for election, thereby raising the likelihood of </span><span>electing one or more of their preferred nominees to the board. Accordingly, cumulative voting generally acts as a safeguard </span><span>for shareholders by ensuring that those who hold a significant minority of shares can elect a candidate of their choosing to </span><span>the board. The Corporate Governance Focused Policy will generally oppose the adoption of cumulative voting unless the </span><span>company has not adopted any form of majority voting, has adopted anti-takeover provisions, and has been historically </span><span>unresponsive to shareholders.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In instances where a company has not adopted majority voting standards and is facing both a proposal on the adoption of </span><span>majority voting and a proposal to adopt cumulative voting, the Corporate Governance Focused Policy will support only the </span><span>majority voting proposal.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fair Price Provision</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fair price provisions, which are rare, require certain minimum price and procedural requirements to be observed by any party </span><span>that acquires more than a specified percentage of a corporation's common stock. The intention of this provision is to protect </span><span>minority shareholder value when an acquirer seeks to accomplish a merger or other transaction which would eliminate or </span><span>change the rights of the shareholder. Fair price provisions sometimes protect the rights of shareholders in a takeover </span><span>situation. However, more often than not they act as an impediment to takeovers, potentially limiting gains to shareholders </span><span>from a variety of transactions that could potentially increase share price. As a result, the Corporate Governance Focused </span><span>Policy will generally vote to remove fair price provisions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Supermajority Vote Requirements</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Corporate Governance Focused Policy favors a simple majority voting structure except where a supermajority voting </span><span>requirement is explicitly intended to protect the rights of minority shareholders in a controlled company. In the case of non-controlled</span><span> companies, supermajority vote requirements act as impediments to shareholder action on ballot items that are </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-104</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>critical to their interests. For example, supermajority vote requirements can strongly limit the voice of shareholders in making </span><span>decisions on critical matters such as the selling of the business. Supermajority vote requirements can also allow small groups </span><span>of shareholders to overrule and dictate the will of the majority of shareholders. Thus, having a simple majority is appropriate </span><span>for protecting the rights of all shareholders.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Poison Pills (Shareholder Rights Plan)</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Corporate Governance Focused Policy will generally oppose companies’ adoption of poison pills, as they can reduce </span><span>management accountability by substantially limiting opportunities for corporate takeovers. As a result, rights plans can </span><span>prevent shareholders from receiving a buy-out premium for their stock. Generally, the Corporate Governance Focused Policy </span><span>will vote against these plans to protect shareholders’ financial interests. While boards should be given wide latitude in </span><span>directing the activities of the company and charting the company’s course, on an issue such as this where the link between </span><span>the financial interests of shareholders and their right to consider and accept buyout offers is so substantial, shareholders </span><span>should be allowed to vote on whether or not they support such a plan’s implementation. In certain limited circumstances, the </span><span>Corporate Governance Focused Policy will support a limited poison pill to accomplish a particular objective, such as the </span><span>closing of an important merger, or a pill that contains what we believe to be a reasonable ‘qualifying offer’ clause.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Increase in Authorized Shares</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Adequate capital stock is important to a company’s operation. When analyzing a request for additional shares, the Corporate </span><span>Governance Focused Policy will typically review four common reasons why a company may need additional capital stock: (i) </span><span>stock split; (ii) shareholder defenses; (iii) financing for acquisitions; and (iv) financing for operations.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Corporate Governance Focused Policy believes that having adequate shares to allow management to make quick </span><span>decisions and effectively operate the business is critical. The Corporate Governance Focused Policy favors that, when a </span><span>company is undertaking significant transactions, management will justify its use of additional shares rather than providing a </span><span>blank check in the form of large pools of unallocated shares available for any purpose. The Corporate Governance Focused </span><span>Policy will support proposals to increase authorized shares up to 100% of the number of shares currently authorized unless, </span><span>after the increase the company would be left with less than 30% of its authorized shares outstanding. In markets where such </span><span>authorities typically also authorize the board to issue new shares without separate shareholder approval, the Corporate </span><span>Governance Focused Policy applies the policy described below on the issuance of shares.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Issuance of Shares</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Generally, the Corporate Governance Focused Policy will support proposals to authorize the board to issue shares (with pre-emptive</span><span> rights) up to 100% of issued share capital. The authority of these shares should not exceed five years unless that is </span><span>the market best practice. In accordance with the different market practices, the specific thresholds for share issuance can </span><span>vary. As a result, the Corporate Governance Focused Policy will vote on these proposals on a case-by-case basis.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Corporate Governance Focused Policy will also generally support proposals to suspend pre-emption rights for a </span><span>maximum of 5-20% of the issued ordinary share capital of the company, depending on best practice in the country in which </span><span>the company is located. This authority should not exceed five years, or less for some countries.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Repurchase of Shares</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Corporate Governance Focused Policy typically supports proposals to repurchase shares when the plan includes the </span><span>following provisions:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>(i) </span></div> <div><span>A maximum number of shares which may be purchased; and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>(ii) </span></div> <div><span>A maximum price which may be paid for each share (as a percentage of the market price).</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Reincorporation</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A company is in the best position to determine the appropriate jurisdiction of incorporation. The Corporate Governance </span><span>Focused Policy will factor in several elements when a management proposal to reincorporate the company is put to vote. </span><span>These elements include reviewing the relevant financial benefits, generally related to incorporate tax treatment, as well as </span><span>changes in corporate governance provisions, especially those related to shareholder rights, resulting from the change in </span><span>domicile.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-105</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Advance Notice Requirements</span></div> <div> <div><span>Typically, the Corporate Governance Focused Policy will vote against provisions that would require advance notice of </span><span>shareholder proposals or of director nominees. Advance notice requirements typically range between three to six months </span><span>prior to the annual meeting. These requirements often make it impossible for a shareholder who misses the deadline to </span><span>present a shareholder proposal or director nominee that may be in the best interests of the company. Shareholders should be </span><span>able to review and vote on all proposals and director nominees and are able to vote against proposals that appear with little </span><span>prior notice. Therefore, by setting advance notice requirements it limits the opportunity for shareholders to raise issues that </span><span>may arise after the window closes.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Anti-Greenmail Proposals</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Corporate Governance Focused Policy will support proposals to adopt a provision preventing the payment of greenmail, </span><span>which would serve to prevent companies from buying back company stock at significant premiums from a certain </span><span>shareholder. The anti-greenmail provision helps to protect the company as it requires that a majority of shareholders other </span><span>than the majority shareholder approve the buyback, thus, eliminating cases where a majority shareholder could attempt to </span><span>charge a board a large premium for the shares.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Virtual-Only Shareholder Meetings</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A growing number of companies have elected to hold shareholder meetings by virtual means only. The Corporate </span><span>Governance Focused Policy supports companies allowing a virtual option alongside an in-person meeting, so long as the </span><span>shareholder interests are not compromised. Without proper controls, conducting a virtual-only meeting of shareholders </span><span>could eliminate or significantly limit the rights of shareholders to confront, and ask management on any concerns they may </span><span>have. When companies decide to only hold virtual-only meetings, the Corporate Governance Focused Policy will examine the </span><span>level of disclosure assuring that shareholders will be afforded the same rights and opportunities to participate as they would </span><span>at an in-person meeting.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Mergers, Acquisitions and Contested Meetings</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For merger and acquisition proposals, the Corporate Governance Focused Policy undertakes a thorough examination of all </span><span>elements of the transactions and determine the transaction’s likelihood of maximizing shareholder return. In order to make a </span><span>voting recommendation, the Corporate Governance Focused Policy will examine the process conducted, the specific parties </span><span>and individuals involved in negotiating an agreement, as well as the economic and governance terms of the proposal.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the case of contested merger situations, or board proxy fights, the Corporate Governance Focused Policy will evaluate the </span><span>plan presented by the dissident party and how, if elected, it plans to enhance or protect shareholder value. The Corporate </span><span>Governance Focused Policy will also consider any concerns presented by the board, including any plans for improving the </span><span>performance of the company, when making the ultimate recommendation. In addition, the Corporate Governance Focused </span><span>Policy will support shareholder proposals asking a company to consider the effects of a merger, spin-off, or other transaction </span><span>on its employees and other stakeholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shareholder Proposals</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Corporate Governance Focused Policy has a strong emphasis on electing a qualified board to manage the strategic </span><span>direction of the company. The Corporate Governance Focused Policy believes that directors who are conscientiously </span><span>exercising their fiduciary duties will typically have more and better information about the Company and its situation than </span><span>shareholders. Those directors are also charged with making business decisions and overseeing management. The default </span><span>view, therefore, is that the board and management, absent a suspicion of illegal or unethical conduct, will make decisions </span><span>that are in the best interests of shareholders. Shareholder proposals are carefully reviewed to determine if the action or report </span><span>requested is necessary in light of the company’s current practices.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Governance Proposals</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Corporate Governance Focused Policy supports increased shareholder participation and access to a company and its </span><span>board of directors. Accordingly, the Corporate Governance Focused Policy will vote in favor of initiatives that seek to enhance </span><span>shareholder rights, such as the introduction of majority voting to elect directors, the adoption of proxy access bylaws, the </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-106</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>elimination/reduction of supermajority provisions, the declassification of the board, the submission of shareholder rights’ </span><span>plans to a shareholder vote, and the principle of one share, one vote.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>The Corporate Governance Focused Policy will support shareholders’ right to call a special meeting and act by written </span><span>consent; however, only one of those provisions is necessary. As such, the Corporate Governance Focused Policy will </span><span>recommend against shareholder proposals to adopt special meeting or written consent provisions where one such provision </span><span>already exists. Similarly, the Corporate Governance Focused Policy will support the board-sponsored special meeting or </span><span>written consent proposal when competing management and shareholder proposals are on the same agenda.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Corporate Governance Focused Policy generally opposes shareholder proposals to separate the role of chair and CEO, </span><span>except in limited circumstances where there is no independent oversight of the board through a role such as lead director, </span><span>and where Glass Lewis’ review of the company’s circumstances warrants supporting the proposal.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Compensation Proposals</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Corporate Governance Focused Policy does not believe shareholders should be directly involved in the design and </span><span>negotiation of compensation packages. Such matters should be left to the board's wholly-independent compensation </span><span>committee, which can be held accountable for its decisions through the election of directors. Further, in many markets, </span><span>shareholders have the opportunity to voice their approval or dissatisfaction with respect to Company's executive </span><span>compensation policies, practice, and disclosure through a vote on the company’s executive compensation plan and policy. </span><span>The board generally has more and better information concerning a company's strategies and is thus in the best position to </span><span>determine issues including the specifics of executive compensation plans and the principles that guide such compensation.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>General Approach to Environmental and Social Shareholder Proposals</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In general, the Corporate Governance Focused Policy believes it is prudent for management to assess its potential exposure </span><span>to all risks, including environmental issues and regulations pertaining thereto in order to incorporate this information into its </span><span>overall business risk profile. However, the Corporate Governance Focused Policy believes that the management and reporting </span><span>of environmental issues associated with business operations are generally best left to management and the directors who </span><span>can be held accountable for failure to address relevant risks on these issues when they face re-election. As such, the </span><span>Corporate Governance Focused Policy will generally recommend in line with management on environmental and social </span><span>issues.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-107</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>INTRODUCTION</span></div> <div> <div><span>ISS’ Catholic Advisory Services division recognizes that faith-based and other socially responsible investors have dual </span><span>objectives: financial and social. Religious and socially responsible investors invest for economic gain, as do all investors, but </span><span>they also require that companies in which they invest conduct their business in a socially and environmentally responsible </span><span>manner.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The dual objectives carry through to proxy voting activity, after the security selection process is completed. In voting their </span><span>shares, faith-based socially responsible institutional shareholders are concerned not only with sustainable economic returns </span><span>to shareholders and good corporate governance, but also with the ethical behavior of corporations and the social and </span><span>environmental impact of their actions.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Catholic Advisory Services has, therefore, developed faith-based proxy voting guidelines for Catholic and other Christian </span><span>religious institutions that are consistent with the objectives of socially responsible shareholders as well as the teachings of </span><span>Catholicism and Christianity as a whole. On matters of social and environmental impact, the guidelines seek to reflect a broad </span><span>consensus of the faith-based socially responsible investing community. Generally, we take as our frame of reference policies </span><span>and proposals promulgated by the Catholic Bishops’ Pastoral on economics, the Socially Responsible Investment Guidelines </span><span>adopted by the Bishops, and the policies developed by members of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>On matters of corporate governance, executive compensation, and corporate structure, these faith-based proxy voting </span><span>guidelines are based on a commitment to create and preserve economic value and to advance principles of best practice </span><span>corporate governance and shareholder rights, consistent with responsibilities to society and the environment as a whole.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The guidelines provide an overview of Catholic Advisory Services’ faith-based proxy voting policy for Catholic and other </span><span>Christian denomination institutions. We note there may be cases in which the final vote recommendation varies from the </span><span>vote guideline due to the fact that we closely examine the merits of each proposal and consider relevant information and </span><span>company-specific circumstances in arriving at our decisions. These guidelines are revised on an annual basis to take into </span><span>account emerging issues and trends on environmental, social and corporate governance topics, as well as the evolution of </span><span>market standards, regulatory changes and client feedback.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>1. Board of Directors</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A corporation’s board of directors sits at the apogee of the corporate governance system. Though they normally delegate </span><span>responsibility for the management of the business to the senior executives they select and oversee, directors bear ultimate </span><span>responsibility for the conduct of the corporation’s business. The role of directors in publicly held corporations has undergone </span><span>considerable change in recent years. Once derided as rubber stamps for management, directors of public corporations today </span><span>are expected to serve as effective guardians of shareholders’ interests.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Voting on directors and board-related issues is the most important use of the shareholder franchise, not simply a routine </span><span>proxy item. Although uncontested director elections do not present alternative nominees from whom to choose, a high </span><span>percentage of opposition votes is an expression of shareholder dissatisfaction and should be sufficient to elicit a meaningful </span><span>response from management.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The role and responsibilities of directors has increasingly been the subject of much discussion and debate, given the current </span><span>economic climate and the difficulties many companies now face in their respective markets. Influential organizations, </span><span>including the American Law Institute, the American Bar Association, the National Association of Corporate Directors, and the </span><span>Business Roundtable have issued reports and recommendations regarding the duties and accountability of corporate boards. </span><span>Both mainstream and alternative media outlets have highlighted the numerous gaps within risk oversight of company boards </span><span>and individual directors, and many institutional investors, in response, have capitalized on their rights as stakeholders to </span><span>prompt changes. Corporations have taken notice, implementing many of the reforms championed by their shareholders.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Although differences of opinion remain, a fairly strong consensus has emerged on a number of key issues. It is widely agreed </span><span>that the board’s most important responsibility is to ensure that the corporation is managed in the shareholders’ best long-term</span><span> economic interest. This will often require boards to consider the impact of their actions on other constituencies, </span><span>including employees, customers, local communities, and the environment.</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The board’s principal functions are widely agreed to consist of the following:</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>To select, evaluate, and if necessary, replace management, including the chief executive officer;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-111</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>To review and approve major strategies and financial objectives;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>To advise management on significant issues;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>To assure that effective controls are in place to safeguard corporate assets, manage risk, and comply with the law; and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>To nominate directors and otherwise ensure that the board functions effectively.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Boards are expected to have a majority of directors independent of management. The independent directors are expected to </span><span>organize much of the board’s work, even if the chief executive officer also serves as Chair of the board. Key committees of the </span><span>board are expected to be entirely independent of management. It is expected that boards will engage in critical self-evaluation</span><span> of themselves and of individual members. Individual directors, in turn, are expected to devote significant amounts </span><span>of time to their duties, to limit the number of directorships they accept, and to own a meaningful amount of stock in </span><span>companies on whose boards they serve. Directors are ultimately responsible to the corporation’s shareholders. The most </span><span>direct expression of this responsibility is the requirement that directors be elected to their positions by the shareholders. </span><span>Shareholders are also asked to vote on a number of other matters regarding the role, structure, and composition of the </span><span>board. Catholic Advisory Services classifies directors as either executive, non-independent non-executive, or independent </span><span>directors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Uncontested Election of Directors</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Four broad principles apply when determining votes on director nominees:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1.</span></div> <div><span>Board Accountability</span><span>: Accountability refers to the promotion of transparency into a company’s governance practices </span><span>and annual board elections and the provision to shareholders the ability to remove problematic directors and to vote on </span><span>takeover defenses or other charter/bylaw amendments. These practices help reduce the opportunity for management </span><span>entrenchment.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>2.</span></div> <div><span>Board Responsiveness</span><span>: Directors should be responsive to shareholders, particularly in regard to shareholder proposals </span><span>that receive a majority vote or management proposals that receive significant opposition and to tender offers where a </span><span>majority of shares are tendered. Furthermore, shareholders should expect directors to devote sufficient time and </span><span>resources to oversight of the company.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>3.</span></div> <div><span>Director Independence</span><span>: Without independence from management, the board may be unwilling or unable to effectively </span><span>set company strategy and scrutinize performance or executive compensation.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>4.</span></div> <div><span>Director Diversity/Competence</span><span>: Companies should seek a diverse board of directors who can add value to the board </span><span>through their specific skills or expertise and who can devote sufficient time and commitment to serve effectively. Boards </span><span>should be of a size appropriate to accommodate diversity, expertise, and independence, while ensuring active and </span><span>collaborative participation by all members. Boards should be sufficiently diverse to ensure consideration of a wide range </span><span>of perspectives.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Catholic Advisory Services Recommendation:</span><span> Generally vote for director nominees, except under the following </span><span>circumstances (with new nominees</span><span>1</span><span> considered on a case-by-case basis):</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Board Accountability</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Vote against</span><span>2</span><span> or withhold from the entire board of directors (except new nominees, who should be considered case-by-case) </span><span>for the following:</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Problematic Takeover Defenses, Capital Structure, and Governance Structure</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Classified Board Structure:</span><span> The board is classified, and a continuing director responsible for a problematic governance issue </span><span>at the board/committee level that would warrant a withhold/against vote recommendation is not up for election. All </span><span>appropriate nominees (except new) may be held accountable.</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> <div><span>A </span><span>“</span><span>new nominee</span><span>”</span><span> is a director who is being presented for election by shareholders for the first time. Recommendations on new nominees who have </span><span>served for less than one year are made on a case-by-case basis depending on the timing of their appointment and the problematic governance issue </span><span>in question.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> <div><span>In general, companies with a plurality vote standard use </span><span>“</span><span>Withhold</span><span>”</span><span> as the contrary vote option in director elections; companies with a majority vote </span><span>standard use </span><span>“</span><span>Against</span><span>”</span><span>. However, it will vary by company and the proxy must be checked to determine the valid contrary vote option for the particular </span><span>company.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-112</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Removal of Shareholder Discretion on Classified Boards:</span><span> The company has opted into, or failed to opt out of, state laws </span><span>requiring a classified board structure.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Director Performance Evaluation:</span><span> The board lacks mechanisms to promote accountability and oversight, coupled with </span><span>sustained poor performance relative to peers. Sustained poor performance is measured by one-, three-, and five-year total </span><span>shareholder returns in the bottom half of a company's four-digit GICS industry group (Russell 3000 companies only). Take </span><span>into consideration the company's operational metrics and other factors as warranted.

Although staggered boards can provide continuity for companies at the board </span><span>level, there are also a number of downsides to the structure. First, a classified board can also be used to entrench </span><span>management and effectively preclude most takeover bids or proxy contests. Board classification forces dissidents and would-be</span><span> acquirers to negotiate with the incumbent board, which has the authority to decide on offers without a shareholder vote. </span><span>In addition, when a board is classified, it is difficult to remove individual members for either poor attendance or poor </span><span>performance; shareholders would only have the chance to vote on a given director every third year when he or she comes up </span><span>for election. The classified board structure can also limit shareholders’ ability to withhold votes from inside directors that sit </span><span>on key board committee, or to withhold votes from an entire board slate to protest the lack of board diversity. According to </span><span>ISS’ 2012 Board Practices study, the number of S&amp;P 500 companies with classified boards has continued to fall. In 2015, only </span><span>17 percent of S&amp;P 500 companies maintained staggered boards, compared to 2 percent in 2014, 30 percent in 2013, 41 </span><span>percent in 2009 and 53 percent in 2005. While we recognize that there are some advantages to classified boards, based on </span><span>the latest studies on classified boards, the fact that classified boards can make it more difficult for shareholders to remove </span><span>individual directors, and the fact that classified boards can be used as an antitakeover device, Catholic Advisory Services </span><span>recommends against the adoption of classified boards.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Catholic Advisory Services Recommendation:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Vote for proposals to repeal classified boards and to elect all directors annually.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Vote against proposals to classify (stagger) the board of directors.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Majority Vote Threshold for Director Elections</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Catholic Advisory Services Recommendation:</span><span> Generally vote for management proposals to adopt a majority of votes cast </span><span>standard for directors in uncontested elections.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Vote against if no carve-out for plurality in contested elections is included.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Cumulative Voting</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Most corporations provide that shareholders are entitled to cast one vote for each share owned.

Catholic Advisory Services believes that proposing a rotation period less than five years is unreasonably restrictive and </span><span>may negatively affect audit quality and service while increasing expense.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>3.  Takeover Defenses / Shareholder Rights</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Corporate takeover attempts come in various guises. Usually, a would-be acquirer makes a direct offer to the board of </span><span>directors of a targeted corporation. The bidder may offer to purchase the company for cash and/or stock. If the board </span><span>approves the offer, a friendly transaction is completed and presented to shareholders for approval. If, however, the board of </span><span>directors rejects the bid, the acquirer can make a tender offer for the shares directly to the targeted corporation’s </span><span>shareholders. Such offers are referred to as hostile tender bids.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Not wishing to wait until they are subjects of hostile takeover attempts, many corporations have adopted antitakeover </span><span>measures designed to deter unfriendly bids or buy time. The most common defenses are the shareholders rights protection </span><span>plan, also known as the poison pill, and charter amendments that create barriers to acceptance of hostile bids. In the U.S., </span><span>poison pills do not require shareholder approval. However, shareholders must approve charter amendments, such as </span><span>classified boards or supermajority vote requirements. In brief, the very existence of defensive measures can foreclose the </span><span>possibility of tenders and hence, opportunities to premium prices for shareholders.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-126</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Anti-takeover statutes generally increase management's potential for insulating itself and warding off hostile takeovers that </span><span>may be beneficial to shareholders. While it may be true that some boards use such devices to obtain higher bids and to </span><span>enhance shareholder value, it is more likely that such provisions are used to entrench management. The majority of historical </span><span>evidence on individual corporate anti-takeover measures indicates that heavily insulated companies generally realize lower </span><span>returns than those having managements that are more accountable to shareholders and the market. The evidence also </span><span>suggests that when states adopt their own anti-takeover devices, or endorse those employed by firms, shareholder returns </span><span>are harmed. Moreover, the body of evidence appears to indicate that companies in states with the strongest anti-takeover </span><span>laws experience lower returns than they would absent such statutes.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Takeover Defenses and Shareholder Rights-Related Management Proposals</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Poison Pills (Shareholder Rights Plans)</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Poison pills are corporate-sponsored financial devices that, when triggered by potential acquirers, do one or more of the </span><span>following: 1) dilute the acquirer’s equity holdings in the target company; 2) dilute the acquirer’s voting interests in the target </span><span>company; or 3) dilute the acquirer’s equity holdings in the post-merger company. Poison pills generally allow shareholders to </span><span>purchase shares from, or sell shares back to, the target company (flip-in pill) and/or the potential acquirer (flip-out pill) at a </span><span>price far out of line with fair market value. Depending on the type of pill, the triggering event can either transfer wealth from </span><span>the target company or dilute the equity holdings of current shareholders. Poison pills insulate management from the threat of </span><span>a change in control and provide the target board with veto power over takeover bids. Because poison pills greatly alter the </span><span>balance of power between shareholders and management, shareholders should be allowed to make their own evaluation of </span><span>such plans.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Catholic Advisory Services Recommendation:</span><span> Vote case-by-case on management proposals on poison pill ratification, </span><span>focusing on the features of the shareholder rights plan.

In examining the request </span><span>for the pill, take into consideration the company’s existing governance structure, including: board independence, existing </span><span>takeover defenses, and any problematic governance concerns.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Net Operating Loss (NOL) Poison Pills/Protective Amendments</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The financial crisis has prompted widespread losses in certain industries.

While Catholic Advisory Services </span><span>acknowledges the high estimated tax value of NOLs, which benefit shareholders, the ownership acquisition limitations </span><span>contained in an NOL pill/protective amendment coupled with a company's problematic governance structure could serve as </span><span>an antitakeover device.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Given the fact that shareholders will want to ensure that such an amendment does not remain in effect permanently, Catholic </span><span>Advisory Services will also closely review whether the pill/amendment contains a sunset provision or a commitment to cause </span><span>the expiration of the NOL pill/protective amendment upon exhaustion or expiration of the NOLs.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Catholic Advisory Services Recommendation:</span><span> Vote against proposals to adopt a poison pill for the stated purpose of </span><span>protecting a company's net operating losses (</span><span>“</span><span>NOLs</span><span>”</span><span>) if the term of the pill would exceed the shorter of three years and the </span><span>exhaustion of the NOL.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-127</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

In an open voting system, management can determine who has </span><span>voted against its nominees or proposals and then re-solicit those votes before the final vote count. As a result, shareholders </span><span>can be pressured to vote with management at companies with which they maintain, or would like to establish, a business </span><span>relationship.

Consequently, the pros and cons of these proposals necessitate a case-by-case evaluation.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Factors that increase the cost (or have the potential to increase the cost) of plans to shareholders include: excessive dilution, </span><span>options awarded at below-market discounts, permissive policies on pyramiding, restricted stock giveaways that reward </span><span>tenure rather than results, sales of shares on concessionary terms, blank-check authority for administering committees, </span><span>option repricing or option replacements, accelerated vesting of awards in the event of defined changes in corporate control, </span><span>stand-alone stock appreciation rights, loans or other forms of assistance, or evidence of improvident award policies.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Positive plan features that can offset costly features include: plans with modest dilution potential (i.e. appreciably below </span><span>double-digit levels), bars to pyramiding and related safeguards for investor interests. Also favorable are performance </span><span>programs with a duration of two or more years, bonus schemes that pay off in non-dilutive, fully deductible cash, 401K and </span><span>other thrift or profit sharing plans, and tax-favored employee stock purchase plans. In general, we believe that stock plans </span><span>should afford incentives, not sure-fire, risk-free rewards.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-146</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Given that many </span><span>directors are high-level executives whose personal income levels are generally high, cash compensation may hold little </span><span>appeal. Stock-based incentives on the other hand reinforce the directors' role of protecting and enhancing shareholder value. </span><span>The stock-based component of director compensation should be large enough to ensure that when faced with a situation in </span><span>which the interests of shareholders and management differ, the board will have a financial incentive to think as a shareholder. </span><span>Additionally, many companies have instituted equity ownership programs for directors. Catholic Advisory Services </span><span>recommends that directors receive stock grants equal to three times of their annual retainer, as it is a reasonable starting </span><span>point for companies of all sizes and industries.

While the number of bankruptcies has risen over the past year as evidenced by many firms, including General </span><span>Motors and Lehman Brothers, the prevalence of these reorganizations can vary year over year due to, among other things, </span><span>market conditions and a company's ability to sustain its operations. Additionally, the amount of time that lapses between a </span><span>particular company's entrance into Chapter 11 and its submission of a plan of reorganization varies significantly depending </span><span>on the complexity, timing, and jurisdiction of the particular case.

SPACs generally lack an independent fairness opinion and the </span><span>financials on the target may be limited. Compare the conversion price with the intrinsic value of the target company </span><span>provided in the fairness opinion. Also, evaluate the proportionate value of the combined entity attributable to the SPAC </span><span>IPO shareholders versus the pre-merger value of SPAC.

Evaluate the valuation, market reaction, and potential conflicts of </span><span>interest for deals that are announced close to the liquidation date.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Negotiations and process: What was the process undertaken to identify potential target companies within specified </span><span>industry or location specified in charter?

Potential conflicts </span><span>could arise if a fairness opinion is issued by the insiders to qualify the deal rather than a third party or if management is </span><span>encouraged to pay a higher price for the target because of an 80 percent rule (the charter requires that the fair market </span><span>value of the target is at least equal to 80 percent of net assets of the SPAC). Also, there may be sense of urgency by the </span><span>management team of the SPAC to close the deal since its charter typically requires a transaction to be completed within </span><span>the 18-24 month timeframe.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Voting agreements</span><span>: Are the sponsors entering into enter into any voting agreements/tender offers with shareholders </span><span>who are likely to vote against the proposed merger or exercise conversion rights?</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Governance</span><span>: What is the impact of having the SPAC CEO or founder on key committees following the proposed merger?</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Stakeholder Impact</span><span>: Impact on community stakeholders and workforce including impact on stakeholders, such as job </span><span>loss, community lending, equal opportunity, impact on environment etc.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Special Purpose Acquisition Corporations (SPACs) - Proposals for Extensions</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Catholic Advisory Services Recommendation</span><span>: Vote case-by-case on SPAC extension proposals taking into account the </span><span>length of the requested extension, the status of any pending transaction(s) or progression of the acquisition process, any </span><span>added incentive for non-redeeming shareholders, and any prior extension requests.</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Length of request</span><span>: Typically, extension requests range from two to six months, depending on the progression of the </span><span>SPAC's acquistion process.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Pending transaction(s) or progression of the acquisition process</span><span>: Sometimes an intial business combination was already </span><span>put to a shareholder vote, but, for varying reasons, the transaction could not be consummated by the termination date </span><span>and the SPAC is requesting an extension.

The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits </span><span>discrimination based on race, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, and nationality. However, discrimination on the </span><span>basis of federally protected characteristics continues. The SEC’s revised disclosure rules now require information on how </span><span>boards factor diversity into the director nomination process, as well as disclosure on how the board assesses the </span><span>effectiveness of its diversity policy.

In instances where companies themselves operate factories in developing </span><span>countries for example, these advocates have asked that the companies adopt global corporate standards that guarantee </span><span>sustainable wages and safe working conditions for their workers abroad. Companies that contract out portions of their </span><span>manufacturing operations to foreign companies have been asked to ensure that the products they receive from those </span><span>contractors have not been made using forced labor, child labor, or other forms of modern slavery. These companies are asked </span><span>to adopt formal vendor standards that, among other things, include some sort of monitoring mechanism. Globalization, </span><span>relocation of production overseas, and widespread use of subcontractors and vendors, often make it difficult to obtain a </span><span>complete picture of a company’s labor practices in global markets. Deadly accidents at factories, notably in Bangladesh and </span><span>Pakistan, have continued to intensify these concerns. Many investors believe that companies would benefit from adopting a </span><span>human rights policy based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization’s Core </span><span>Labor Standards. Efforts that seek greater disclosure on a company’s global labor practices, including its supply chain, and </span><span>that seek to establish minimum standards for a company’s operations will be supported. In addition, requests for </span><span>independent monitoring of overseas operations will be supported.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Catholic Advisory Services generally supports proposals that call for the adoption and/or enforcement of principles or codes </span><span>relating to countries in which there are systematic violations of human rights; such as the use of slave, child, or prison labor; </span><span>a government that is illegitimate; or there is a call by human rights advocates, pro-democracy organizations, or legitimately-elected</span><span> representatives for economic sanctions. The use of child labor, or forced labor is unethical and can damage corporate </span><span>reputations. Poor labor practices can lead to litigation against the company, which can be costly and time consuming.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Codes of Conduct and Vendor Standards</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shareholders have submitted proposals that pertain to the adoption of codes of conduct or provision, greater disclosure on a </span><span>company’s international workplace standards, or that request human rights risk assessment. Companies have been asked to </span><span>adopt a number of different types of codes, including a workplace code of conduct, standards for international business </span><span>operations, human rights standards, International Labour Organization (ILO) standards and the SA 8000 principles. The ILO </span><span>is an independent agency of the United Nations which consists of 187 member nations represented by workers, employers, </span><span>and governments. The ILO’s general mandate is to promote a decent workplace for all individuals. The ILO sets international </span><span>labor standards in the form of its conventions and then monitors compliance with the standards. The seven conventions of </span><span>the ILO fall under four broad categories: Right to organize and bargain collectively, Nondiscrimination in employment, </span><span>Abolition of forced labor, and End of child labor. Each of the 187 member-nations of the ILO is bound to respect and promote </span><span>these rights to the best of their abilities. SA 8000 is a set of labor standards, based on the principles of the ILO conventions </span><span>and other human rights conventions, and covers eight workplace conditions, including: child labor, forced labor, health and </span><span>safety, freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, discrimination, disciplinary practices, working hours and </span><span>compensation. Companies have also turned to the United Nations </span><span>“</span><span>Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights,</span><span>”</span><span> a set </span><span>of guidelines that create a framework for states to protect human rights, corporations to respect human rights, and rights-holders</span><span> to access remediation.</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-166</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

In addition, </span><span>some proponents cite the negative financial implications for companies with poor environmental practices, including </span><span>liabilities associated with site clean-ups and lawsuits, as well as arguments that energy efficient products and clean </span><span>environmental practices are sustainable business practices that will contribute to long-term shareholder value.

Increasingly, companies have </span><span>begun reporting on environmental and sustainability issues using the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards. The GRI </span><span>was established in 1997 with the mission of developing globally applicable guidelines for reporting on economic, </span><span>environmental, and social performance. The GRI was developed by Ceres (formerly known as the Coalition for </span><span>Environmentally Responsible Economies) in partnership with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Ceres was formed in the wake of the March 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, when a consortium of investors, environmental </span><span>groups, and religious organizations drafted what were originally named the Valdez Principles. Later named the Ceres </span><span>Principles, and now branded the Ceres Roadmap 2030, corporate signatories of the Ceres Roadmap 2030 pledge to institute </span><span>accountability mechanisms that integrate sustainability considerations into core business systems and decision-making on </span><span>topics such as governance, stakeholder engagement and disclosure. Signatories also pledge to build systems across a </span><span>corporation’s value chain to enable ongoing improvements in three priority environmental and social impact areas (Climate </span><span>Change, Natural Resources, and Human Rights).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Equator Principles are the financial industry’s benchmark for determining, assessing and managing social and </span><span>environmental risk in project financing. First launched in June 2003, the Principles were ultimately adopted by over forty </span><span>financial institutions over a three-year implementation period. Since its adoption, the Principles have undergone a number of </span><span>revisions, expanding the use of performance standards and signatory banks’ banks' commitments to social responsibility, </span><span>including human rights, climate change, and transparency. The fourth iteration of the Principles was launched in November </span><span>2019, incorporating amendments and new commitment to human rights, climate change, Indigenous Peoples and </span><span>biodiversity related topics. Financial institutions adopt these principles to ensure that the projects they finance are developed </span><span>in a socially responsible manner and reflect sound environmental management practices. As of 2019, 101 financial </span><span>institutions have officially adopted the Equator Principles.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-172</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Alberta’s oil sands contain a reserve largely thought to be one of the world’s largest potential </span><span>energy sources. Rising oil sands production in Alberta has been paralleled with concerns from a variety of stakeholders—</span><span>including environmental groups, local residents, and shareholders—regarding the environmental impacts of the complicated </span><span>extraction and upgrading processes required to convert oil sands into a synthetic crude oil. The high viscosity of bitumen </span><span>makes its extraction a challenging and resource-intensive process; the most common extraction technique involves pumping </span><span>steam into the oil sands to lower the viscosity of bitumen in order to pump it to the surface.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>One of the most prominent issues concerning oil sands is the large volume of greenhouse gases (GHG) associated with </span><span>production. Oil sands are by far one of the most energy-intensive forms of oil production, releasing three times more GHG </span><span>emissions from production than conventional oil.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shareholders have kept up pressure on the issue of potential long-term risks to companies posed by the environmental, </span><span>social, and economic challenges associated with Canadian oil sands operations.

In the past, </span><span>legislation proposed in both the House and Senate that, if passed, would allow a portion of this area to be leased to private </span><span>companies for development and production of oil, has been witnessed. Oil companies have expressed an interest in bidding </span><span>for these leases given the opportunity. In response, shareholder activists have filed resolutions asking these companies to </span><span>cancel any plans to drill in the ANWR and cease their lobbying efforts to open the area for drilling. Proponents of shareholder </span><span>proposals on this issue argue that the Coastal Plain section of the ANWR is the most environmentally sensitive area of the </span><span>refuge, that the majority of Alaska’s North Slope that is not federally designated wilderness already provides the oil industry </span><span>with sufficient resources for oil production, and that advocates of drilling in ANWR overstate the benefit to be derived from </span><span>opening the wilderness to oil production. Those in favor of opening the area up to drilling note that only a small portion of </span><span>ANWR would be considered for exploration, and if drilling were to take place, it would be on less than one percent of the </span><span>entire area, that modern technology reduces the environmental impact of oil drilling on both the land and surrounding </span><span>wildlife, and that oil production in ANWR would have considerable benefit to company shareholders, Alaskans, and the </span><span>United States as a whole.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Catholic Advisory Services Recommendation:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Vote for requests for reports on potential environmental damage as a result of company operations in protected regions.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Vote for shareholder proposals asking companies to prepare reports or adopt policies on operations that include mining, </span><span>drilling or logging in environmentally sensitive areas.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Vote for shareholder proposals seeking to curb or reduce the sale of products manufactured from materials extracted </span><span>from environmentally sensitive areas such as old growth forests.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Hydraulic Fracturing</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shareholder proponents have elevated concerns on the use of hydraulic fracturing, an increasingly controversial process in </span><span>which water, sand, and a mix of chemicals are blasted horizontally into tight layers of shale rock to extract natural gas.

The shareholder sponsors of the resolutions look to companies to review </span><span>current compensation practices and to include social or environmental performance criteria such as accounting for </span><span>“</span><span>poor </span><span>corporate citizenship</span><span>”</span><span> and meeting environmental or workplace safety objectives and metrics when evaluating executive </span><span>compensation. Some of the non-financial criteria that proponents of these resolutions seek to be incorporated in </span><span>compensation program design include workplace safety, environmental stewardship, or diversity and customer/employee </span><span>satisfaction – as part of a written policy used to align compensation with performance on non-financial factors alongside </span><span>financial criteria.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Proponents believe that factors such as poor environmental performance, workplace lawsuits, etc. could have a significant </span><span>adverse impact on a company’s financial performance if not proactively and adequately addressed, and that these factors </span><span>should be considered along with traditional financial considerations when determining executive pay. The significant stock </span><span>price declines and massive losses in shareholder value stemming from the BP Deepwater Horizon oil rig disaster and the </span><span>tragic explosion at Massey Energy’s Upper Big Branch mine that killed 29 employees is a sobering reminder of the need to </span><span>have the right management incentives in place to ensure that social and environmental risks are actively managed and </span><span>mitigated against.

On environmental or social matters, the Global Board-Aligned Policy will </span><span>generally be in line with the board's recommendations, with support limited to circumstances where it is considered that </span><span>greater disclosure will directly enhance or protect shareholder value and is reflective of a clearly established reporting </span><span>standard in the market. Details are as further described in these guidelines. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>1. Board of Directors</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Voting on Director Nominees in Uncontested Elections</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Four fundamental principles apply when determining votes on director nominees:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Independence</span><span>: Boards should be sufficiently independent from management (and significant shareholders) to ensure that </span><span>they are able and motivated to effectively supervise management's performance for the benefit of all shareholders, including </span><span>in setting and monitoring the execution of corporate strategy, with appropriate use of shareholder capital, and in setting and </span><span>monitoring executive compensation programs that support that strategy. The chair of the board should ideally be an </span><span>independent director, and all boards should have an independent leadership position or a similar role in order to help provide </span><span>appropriate counterbalance to executive management, as well as having sufficiently independent committees that focus on </span><span>key governance concerns such as audit, compensation, and nomination of directors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Composition</span><span>: Companies should ensure that directors add value to the board through their specific skills and expertise and </span><span>by having sufficient time and commitment to serve effectively. Boards should be of a size appropriate to accommodate </span><span>diversity, expertise, and independence, while ensuring active and collaborative participation by all members. Boards should be </span><span>sufficiently diverse to ensure consideration of a wide range of perspectives.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Responsiveness</span><span>: Directors should respond to investor input, such as that expressed through significant opposition to </span><span>management proposals, significant support for shareholder proposals (whether binding or non-binding), and tender offers </span><span>where a majority of shares are tendered.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Accountability</span><span>: Boards should be sufficiently accountable to shareholders, including through transparency of the company's </span><span>governance practices and regular board elections, by the provision of sufficient information for shareholders to be able to </span><span>assess directors and board composition, and through the ability of shareholders to remove directors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>General Recommendation</span><span>: Generally vote for director nominees, except under the following circumstances (with new </span><span>nominees</span><span>1</span><span> considered on case-by-case basis):</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Independence</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Vote against</span><span>2</span><span> or withhold from non-independent directors (Executive Directors and Non-Independent Non-Executive </span><span>Directors per ISS’ Classification of Directors) when:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Independent directors comprise 50 percent or less of the board;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The non-independent director serves on the audit, compensation, or nominating committee;</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The company lacks an audit, compensation, or nominating committee so that the full board functions as that </span><span>committee; or</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> <div><span>A </span><span>“</span><span>new nominee</span><span>”</span><span> is a director who is being presented for election by shareholders for the first time.

Current interim officers are included in </span><span>this category. For private companies, the equivalent positions are applicable. A non-employee director serving as an officer due to statutory </span><span>requirements (e.g. corporate secretary) will generally be classified as a Non-Independent Non-Executive Director under </span><span>“</span><span>Any material relationship </span><span>with the company.</span><span>”</span><span> However, if the company provides explicit disclosure that the director is not receiving additional compensation exceeding </span><span>$10,000 per year for serving in that capacity, then the director will be classified as an Independent Director.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>2. </span></div> <div><span>Affiliate” includes a subsidiary, sibling company, or parent company. ISS uses 50 percent control ownership by the parent company as the standard </span><span>for applying its affiliate designation. The manager/advisor of an externally managed issuer (EMI) is considered an affiliate.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>3. </span></div> <div><span>Includes any former CEO of the company prior to the company’s initial public offering (IPO).</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>4. </span></div> <div><span>When there is a former CEO of a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) serving on the board of an acquired company, ISS will generally </span><span>classify such directors as independent unless determined otherwise taking into account the following factors: the applicable listing standards </span><span>determination of such director’s independence; any operating ties to the firm; and the existence of any other conflicting relationships or related </span><span>party transactions.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>5. </span></div> <div><span>ISS will look at the terms of the interim officer’s employment contract to determine if it contains severance pay, long-term health and pension </span><span>benefits, or other such standard provisions typically contained in contracts of permanent, non-temporary CEOs. ISS will also consider if a formal </span><span>search process was under way for a full-time officer at the time.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>6. </span></div> <div><span>Immediate family member” follows the SEC’s definition of such and covers spouses, parents, children, step-parents, step-children, siblings, in-laws, </span><span>and any person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing the household of any director, nominee for director, executive officer, or significant </span><span>shareholder of the company.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>7. </span></div> <div><span>Professional services can be characterized as advisory in nature, generally involve access to sensitive company information or to strategic decision-</span><span>making, and typically have a commission- or fee-based payment structure. Professional services generally include but are not limited to the </span><span>following: investment banking/financial advisory services, commercial banking (beyond deposit services), investment services, insurance services, </span><span>accounting/audit services, consulting services, marketing services, legal services, property management services, realtor services, lobbying services, </span><span>executive search services, and IT consulting services. The following would generally be considered transactional relationships and not professional </span><span>services: deposit services, IT tech support services, educational services, and construction services. The case of participation in a banking syndicate </span><span>by a non-lead bank should be considered a transactional (and hence subject to the associated materiality test) rather than a professional </span><span>relationship. </span><span>“</span><span>Of Counsel</span><span>”</span><span> relationships are only considered immaterial if the individual does not receive any form of compensation (in excess of </span><span>$10,000 per year) from, or is a retired partner of, the firm providing the professional service. The case of a company providing a professional service </span><span>to one of its directors or to an entity with which one of its directors is affiliated, will be considered a transactional rather than a professional </span><span>relationship. Insurance services and marketing services are assumed to be professional services unless the company explains why such services are </span><span>not advisory.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>8. </span></div> <div><span>A material transactional relationship, including grants to non-profit organizations, exists if the company makes annual payments to, or receives </span><span>annual payments from, another entity, exceeding the greater of: $200,000 or 5 percent of the recipient’s gross revenues, for a company that follows </span><span>NASDAQ listing standards; or the greater of $1,000,000 or 2 percent of the recipient’s gross revenues, for a company that follows NYSE listing </span><span>standards. For a company that follows neither of the preceding standards, ISS will apply the NASDAQ-based materiality test. (The recipient is the </span><span>party receiving the financial proceeds from the transaction).</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>9. </span></div> <div><span>Dissident directors who are parties to a voting agreement pursuant to a settlement or similar arrangement may be classified as Independent </span><span>Directors if an analysis of the following factors indicates that the voting agreement does not compromise their alignment with all shareholders’ </span><span>interests: the terms of the agreement; the duration of the standstill provision in the agreement; the limitations and requirements of actions that are </span><span>agreed upon; if the dissident director nominee(s) is subject to the standstill; and if there any conflicting relationships or related party transactions.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>10. </span></div> <div><span>Interlocks include: executive officers serving as directors on each other’s compensation or similar committees (or, in the absence of such a </span><span>committee, on the board); or executive officers sitting on each other’s boards and at least one serves on the other’s compensation or similar </span><span>committees (or, in the absence of such a committee, on the board).</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>11. </span></div> <div><span>The operating involvement of the founder with the company will be considered; if the founder was never employed by the company, ISS may deem </span><span>him or her an Independent Director.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>12. </span></div> <div><span>For purposes of ISS’s director independence classification, </span><span>“</span><span>material</span><span>”</span><span> will be defined as a standard of relationship (financial, personal, or otherwise) </span><span>that a reasonable person might conclude could potentially influence one’s objectivity in the boardroom in a manner that would have a meaningful </span><span>impact on an individual's ability to satisfy requisite fiduciary standards on behalf of shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-191</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Was the process fair and </span><span>equitable? A fair process helps to ensure the best price for shareholders. Significant negotiation </span><span>“</span><span>wins</span><span>”</span><span> can also signify </span><span>the deal makers' competency.

As the result of potential conflicts, the directors and officers of the company may be more </span><span>likely to vote to approve a merger than if they did not hold these interests. Consider whether these interests may have </span><span>influenced these directors and officers to support or recommend the merger.

The benchmark is determined as follows: The top quartile performers in each industry </span><span>group (using the Global Industry Classification Standard: GICS) are identified. Benchmark SVT levels for each industry are </span><span>established based on these top performers’ historic SVT. Regression analyses are run on each industry group to identify the </span><span>variables most strongly correlated to SVT. The benchmark industry SVT level is then adjusted upwards or downwards for the </span><span>specific company by plugging the company-specific performance measures, size, and cash compensation into the industry </span><span>cap equations to arrive at the company’s benchmark.</span><span>21</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Three-Year Value-Adjusted Burn Rate</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A </span><span>“</span><span>Value-Adjusted Burn Rate</span><span>”</span><span> is used for stock plan evaluations.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>INTRODUCTION</span></div> <div> <div><span>ISS’ Social Advisory Services division recognizes that socially responsible investors have dual objectives: financial and social. </span><span>Socially responsible investors invest for economic gain, as do all investors, but they also require that the companies in which </span><span>they invest conduct their business in a socially and environmentally responsible manner.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>These dual objectives carry through to socially responsible investors' proxy voting activity once the security selection process </span><span>is completed. In voting their shares, socially responsible institutional shareholders are concerned not only with sustainable </span><span>economic returns to shareholders and good corporate governance but also with the ethical behavior of corporations and the </span><span>social and environmental impact of their actions.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Social Advisory Services has, therefore, developed proxy voting guidelines that are consistent with the dual objectives of </span><span>socially responsible shareholders. On matters of social and environmental import, the guidelines seek to reflect a broad </span><span>consensus of the socially responsible investing community. Generally, we take as our frame of reference policies that have </span><span>been developed by groups such as the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, the General Board of Pension and Health </span><span>Benefits of the United Methodist Church, Domini Social Investments, and other leading church shareholders and socially </span><span>responsible mutual fund companies. Additionally, we incorporate the active ownership and investment philosophies of </span><span>leading globally recognized initiatives such as the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI), the </span><span>United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UNPRI), the United Nations Global Compact, and environmental and </span><span>social European Union Directives.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>On matters of corporate governance, executive compensation, and corporate structure, Social Advisory Services guidelines </span><span>are based on a commitment to create and preserve economic value and to advance principles of good corporate governance </span><span>consistent with responsibilities to society as a whole.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The guidelines provide an overview of how Social Advisory Services recommends that its clients vote. We note that there may </span><span>be cases in which the final vote recommendation on a particular company varies from the vote guideline due to the fact that </span><span>we closely examine the merits of each proposal and consider relevant information and company-specific circumstances in </span><span>arriving at our decisions. Where Social Advisory Services acts as voting agent for its clients, it follows each client’s voting </span><span>policy, which may differ in some cases from the policies outlined in this document. Social Advisory Services updates its </span><span>guidelines on an annual basis to take into account emerging issues and trends on environmental, social, and corporate </span><span>governance topics, in addition to evolving market standards, regulatory changes, and client feedback. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>1. Board of Directors</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A corporation’s board of directors sits at the apogee of the corporate governance system. Though they normally delegate </span><span>responsibility for the management of the business to the senior executives they select and oversee, directors bear ultimate </span><span>responsibility for the conduct of the corporation’s business. The role of directors in publicly held corporations has undergone </span><span>considerable change in recent years. Once derided as rubber stamps for management, directors of public corporations today </span><span>are expected to serve as effective guardians of shareholders’ interests.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Voting on directors and board-related issues is the most important use of the shareholder franchise, not simply a routine </span><span>proxy item. Although uncontested director elections do not present alternative nominees from whom to choose, a high </span><span>percentage of opposition votes is an expression of shareholder dissatisfaction and should be sufficient to elicit a meaningful </span><span>response from management.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The role and responsibilities of directors has increasingly been the subject of much discussion and debate, given the current </span><span>economic climate and the difficulties many companies now face in their respective markets. Influential organizations, </span><span>including the American Law Institute, the American Bar Association, the National Association of Corporate Directors, and the </span><span>Business Roundtable have issued reports and recommendations regarding the duties and accountability of corporate boards. </span><span>Both mainstream and alternative media outlets have highlighted the numerous gaps within risk oversight of company boards </span><span>and individual directors, and many institutional investors, in response, have capitalized on their rights as stakeholders to </span><span>prompt changes. Corporations have taken notice, implementing many of the reforms championed by their shareholders.</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-240</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Although differences of opinion remain, a fairly strong consensus has emerged on a number of key issues. It is widely agreed </span><span>that the board’s most important responsibility is to ensure that the corporation is managed in the shareholders’ best long-term</span><span> economic interest. This will often require boards to consider the impact of their actions on other constituencies, </span><span>including employees, customers, local communities, and the environment.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The board’s principal functions are widely agreed to consist of the following:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>To select, evaluate, and if necessary, replace management, including the chief executive officer;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>To review and approve major strategies and financial objectives;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>To advise management on significant issues;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>To assure that effective controls are in place to safeguard corporate assets, manage risk, and comply with the law; and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>To nominate directors and otherwise ensure that the board functions effectively.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Boards are expected to have a majority of directors independent of management. The independent directors are expected to </span><span>organize much of the board’s work, even if the chief executive officer also serves as Chairman of the board. Key committees </span><span>of the board are expected to be entirely independent of management. It is expected that boards will engage in critical self-evaluation</span><span> of themselves and of individual members. Individual directors, in turn, are expected to devote significant amounts </span><span>of time to their duties, to limit the number of directorships they accept, and to own a meaningful amount of stock in </span><span>companies on whose boards they serve. Directors are ultimately responsible to the corporation’s shareholders. The most </span><span>direct expression of this responsibility is the requirement that directors be elected to their positions by the shareholders. </span><span>Shareholders are also asked to vote on a number of other matters regarding the role, structure, and composition of the </span><span>board. Social Advisory Services classifies directors as either executive, non-independent non-executive, or independent </span><span>directors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Uncontested Election of Directors</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Four broad principles apply when determining votes on director nominees:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1.</span></div> <div><span>Board Accountability</span><span>: Accountability refers to the promotion of transparency into a company’s governance practices </span><span>and annual board elections and the provision to shareholders the ability to remove problematic directors and to vote on </span><span>takeover defenses or other charter/bylaw amendments. These practices help reduce the opportunity for management </span><span>entrenchment.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>2.</span></div> <div><span>Board Responsiveness</span><span>: Directors should be responsive to shareholders, particularly in regard to shareholder proposals </span><span>that receive a majority vote or management proposals that receive significant opposition and to tender offers where a </span><span>majority of shares are tendered. Furthermore, shareholders should expect directors to devote sufficient time and </span><span>resources to oversight of the company.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>3.</span></div> <div><span>Director Independence</span><span>: Without independence from management, the board may be unwilling or unable to effectively </span><span>set company strategy and scrutinize performance or executive compensation.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>4.</span></div> <div><span>Director Diversity/Competence</span><span>: Companies should seek a diverse board of directors who can add value to the board </span><span>through their specific skills or expertise and who can devote sufficient time and commitment to serve effectively. Boards </span><span>should be of a size appropriate to accommodate diversity, expertise, and independence, while ensuring active and </span><span>collaborative participation by all members. Boards should be sufficiently diverse to ensure consideration of a wide range </span><span>of perspectives.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Social Advisory Services Recommendation</span><span>: Generally vote for director nominees, except under the following circumstances </span><span>(with new nominees</span><span>1</span><span> considered on a case-by-case basis):</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Board Accountability</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Vote against or withhold from the entire board of directors (except new nominees, who should be considered case-by-case) </span><span>for the following:</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> <div><span>A </span><span>“</span><span>new nominee</span><span>”</span><span> is a director who is being presented for election by shareholders for the first time. Recommendations on new nominees who have </span><span>served for less than one year are made on a case-by-case basis depending on the timing of their appointment and the problematic governance issue </span><span>in question.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-241</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Problematic Takeover Defenses, Capital Structure, and Governance Structures</span></div> <div> <div><span>Classified Board Structure</span><span>: The board is classified, and a continuing director responsible for a problematic governance issue </span><span>at the board/committee level that would warrant an against/withhold recommendation is not up for election. All appropriate </span><span>nominees (except new) may be held accountable.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Removal of Shareholder Discretion on Classified Boards</span><span>: The company has opted into, or failed to opt out of, state laws </span><span>requiring a classified board structure.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Director Performance Evaluation</span><span>: The board lacks mechanisms to promote accountability and oversight, coupled with </span><span>sustained poor performance relative to peers. Sustained poor performance is measured by one-, three-, and five-year total </span><span>shareholder returns in the bottom half of a company’s four-digit GICS industry group (Russell 3000 companies only). Take </span><span>into consideration the company’s operational metrics and other factors as warranted. Problematic provisions include but are </span><span>not limited to a classified board structure, supermajority vote requirements, a majority vote standard for director elections </span><span>with no carve out for contested elections, inability for shareholders to call special meetings or act by written consent, a multi-class</span><span> capital structure, and/or a non-shareholder approved poison pill.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Poison Pills</span><span>: Generally vote against or withhold from all nominees (except new nominees</span><span>1</span><span>, who should be considered case-by-case)</span><span> if:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The company has a poison pill with a deadhand or slowhand feature</span><span>2</span><span>;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The board makes a material adverse modification to an existing pill, including, but not limited to, extension, renewal, or </span><span>lowering the trigger, without shareholder approval; or</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The company has a long-term poison pill (with a term of over one year) that was not approved by the public </span><span>shareholders</span><span>3</span><span>.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Vote case-by-case on nominees if the board adopts an initial short-term pill (with a term of one year or less) without </span><span>shareholder approval, taking into consideration:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The disclosed rationale for the adoption;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The trigger;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The company's market capitalization (including absolute level and sudden changes);</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>A commitment to put any renewal to a shareholder vote; and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Other factors as relevant.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Unilateral Bylaw/Charter Amendments</span><span>: Generally vote against or withhold from directors individually, committee members, </span><span>or the entire board (except new nominees, who should be considered case-by-case) if the board amends the company's </span><span>bylaws or charter without shareholder approval in a manner that materially diminishes shareholders' rights or that could </span><span>adversely impact shareholders.

Professional services generally include, but are not limited to the </span><span>following: investment banking/financial advisory services; commercial banking (beyond deposit services); investment services; insurance services; </span><span>accounting/audit services; consulting services; marketing services; legal services; property management services; realtor services; lobbying services; </span><span>executive search services; and IT consulting services. The following would generally be considered transactional relationships and not professional </span><span>services: deposit services; IT tech support services; educational services; and construction services. The case of participation in a banking syndicate </span><span>by a non-lead bank should be considered a transactional (and hence subject to the associated materiality test) rather than a professional </span><span>relationship. </span><span>“</span><span>Of Counsel</span><span>”</span><span> relationships are only considered immaterial if the individual does not receive any form of compensation (in excess of </span><span>$10,000 per year) from, or is a retired partner of, the firm providing the professional service. The case of a company providing a professional service </span><span>to one of its directors or to an entity with which one of its directors is affiliated, will be considered a transactional rather than a professional </span><span>relationship. Insurance services and marketing services are assumed to be professional services unless the company explains why such services are </span><span>not advisory.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>viii </span></div> <div><span>A material transactional relationship, including grants to non-profit organizations, exists if the company makes annual payments to, or receives </span><span>annual payments from, another entity exceeding the greater of $200,000 or 5 percent of the recipient’s gross revenues, in the case of a company </span><span>which follows NASDAQ listing standards; or the greater of $1,000,000 or 2 percent of the recipient’s gross revenues, in the case of a company which </span><span>follows NYSE listing standards.

Although staggered boards can provide continuity for companies at the board </span><span>level, there are also a number of downsides to the structure. First, a classified board can also be used to entrench </span><span>management and effectively preclude most takeover bids or proxy contests. Board classification forces dissidents and would-be</span><span> acquirers to negotiate with the incumbent board, which has the authority to decide on offers without a shareholder vote. </span><span>In addition, when a board is classified, it is difficult to remove individual members for either poor attendance or poor </span><span>performance; shareholders would only have the chance to vote on a given director every third year when he or she comes up </span><span>for election. The classified board structure can also limit shareholders’ ability to withhold votes from inside directors that sit </span><span>on key board committee, or to withhold votes from an entire board slate to protest the lack of board diversity. According to </span><span>ISS’ 2012 Board Practices study, the number of S&amp;P 500 companies with classified boards has continued to fall. In 2015, only </span><span>17 percent of S&amp;P 500 companies maintained staggered boards, compared to 25 percent in 2014, 30 percent in 2013, and 39 </span><span>percent in 2010. While we recognize that there are some advantages to classified boards, based on the latest studies on </span><span>classified boards, the fact that classified boards can make it more difficult for shareholders to remove individual directors, and </span><span>the fact that classified boards can be used as an antitakeover device, Social Advisory Services recommends against the </span><span>adoption of classified boards.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Social Advisory Services Recommendation:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Vote for proposals to repeal classified boards and to elect all directors annually.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Vote against proposals to classify (stagger) the board of directors.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Majority Vote Threshold for Director Elections</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Social Advisory Services Recommendation: Generally vote for management proposals to adopt a majority of votes cast </span><span>standard for directors in uncontested elections.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Vote against if no carve-out for plurality in contested elections is included.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-249</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

By increasing the size of the board, management can make it more difficult for dissidents to gain </span><span>control of the board.

While it is recognized that the company is in the best </span><span>position to evaluate the competence of the outside accountants, we believe that outside accountants must ultimately be </span><span>accountable to shareholders. A Blue Ribbon Commission report concluded that audit committees must improve their current </span><span>level of oversight of independent accountants. Given the rash of accounting misdeeds that were not detected by audit panels </span><span>or auditors, shareholder ratification is an essential step in restoring investor confidence. Shareholders should have the right </span><span>to weigh in on the choice of the audit firm, and all companies should put ratification on the ballot of their annual meeting. </span><span>Special consideration will be given when non-audit fees exceed audit fees, as high non-audit fees can compromise the </span><span>independence of the auditor. Social Advisory Services will also monitor both auditor tenure and whether auditor ratification </span><span>has been pulled from the ballot.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Social Advisory Services Recommendation</span><span>: Vote for proposals to ratify auditors, unless any of the following apply:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The non-audit fees paid represent 25 percent or more of the total fees paid to the auditor;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>An auditor has a financial interest in or association with the company, and is therefore not independent;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>There is reason to believe that the independent auditor has rendered an opinion that is neither accurate nor indicative of </span><span>the company’s financial position; or</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Poor accounting practices are identified that rise to a serious level of concern, such as: fraud; misapplication of GAAP; </span><span>and material weaknesses identified in Section 404 disclosures.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Auditor-Related Shareholder Proposals</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Ratify Auditors/Ensure Auditor Independence</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>These shareholder proposals request that the board allow shareholders to ratify the company’s auditor at each annual </span><span>meeting.

Social Advisory Services believes that shareholders should have the ability to </span><span>ratify the auditor on an annual basis.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Social Advisory Services Recommendation:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Vote for shareholder proposals to allow shareholders to vote on auditor ratification.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Vote for proposals that ask a company to adopt a policy on auditor independence.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Vote for proposals that seek to limit the non-audit services provided by the company’s auditor.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Auditor Rotation</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>To minimize any conflict of interest that may rise between the company and its auditor, Social Advisory Services supports the </span><span>rotation of auditors.

However, Social Advisory </span><span>Services also believes that the long tenure of audit firms at U.S. companies can be problematic.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Social Advisory Services Recommendation</span><span>: Vote for shareholder proposals to rotate company’s auditor every five years or </span><span>more.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>3.  Takeover Defenses / Shareholder Rights</span></div> <div> <div><span>Corporate takeover attempts come in various guises. Usually, a would-be acquirer makes a direct offer to the board of </span><span>directors of a targeted corporation. The bidder may offer to purchase the company for cash and/or stock. If the board </span><span>approves the offer, a friendly transaction is completed and presented to shareholders for approval. If, however, the board of </span><span>directors rejects the bid, the acquirer can make a tender offer for the shares directly to the targeted corporation’s </span><span>shareholders. Such offers are referred to as hostile tender bids.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Not wishing to wait until they are subjects of hostile takeover attempts, many corporations have adopted antitakeover </span><span>measures designed to deter unfriendly bids or buy time. The most common defenses are the shareholders rights protection </span><span>plan, also known as the poison pill, and charter amendments that create barriers to acceptance of hostile bids. In the U.S., </span><span>poison pills do not require shareholder approval. However, shareholders must approve charter amendments, such as </span><span>classified boards or supermajority vote requirements. In brief, the very existence of defensive measures can foreclose the </span><span>possibility of tenders and hence, opportunities to premium prices for shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Anti-takeover statutes generally increase management's potential for insulating itself and warding off hostile takeovers that </span><span>may be beneficial to shareholders. While it may be true that some boards use such devices to obtain higher bids and to </span><span>enhance shareholder value, it is more likely that such provisions are used to entrench management. The majority of historical </span><span>evidence on individual corporate anti-takeover measures indicates that heavily insulated companies generally realize lower </span><span>returns than those having managements that are more accountable to shareholders and the market. The evidence also </span><span>suggests that when states adopt their own anti-takeover devices, or endorse those employed by firms, shareholder returns </span><span>are harmed. Moreover, the body of evidence appears to indicate that companies in states with the strongest anti-takeover </span><span>laws experience lower returns than they would absent such statutes.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Takeover Defenses and Shareholder Rights-Related Management Proposals</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Poison Pills (Shareholder Rights Plans)</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Poison pills are corporate-sponsored financial devices that, when triggered by potential acquirers, do one or more of the </span><span>following: 1) dilute the acquirer’s equity holdings in the target company; 2) dilute the acquirer’s voting interests in the target </span><span>company; or 3) dilute the acquirer’s equity holdings in the post-merger company. Poison pills generally allow shareholders to </span><span>purchase shares from, or sell shares back to, the target company (flip-in pill) and/or the potential acquirer (flip-out pill) at a </span><span>price far out of line with fair market value. Depending on the type of pill, the triggering event can either transfer wealth from </span><span>the target company or dilute the equity holdings of current shareholders. Poison pills insulate management from the threat of </span><span>a change in control and provide the target board with veto power over takeover bids. Because poison pills greatly alter the </span><span>balance of power between shareholders and management, shareholders should be allowed to make their own evaluation of </span><span>such plans.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Social Advisory Services Recommendation</span><span>: Vote case-by-case on management proposals on poison pill ratification, </span><span>focusing on the features of the shareholder rights plan. Rights plans should contain the following attributes:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>No lower than a 20 percent trigger, flip-in or flip-over provision;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>A term of no more than three years;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>No deadhand, slowhand, no-hand or similar feature that limits the ability of a future board to redeem the pill;</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Shareholder redemption feature (qualifying offer clause); if the board refuses to redeem the pill 90 days after a qualifying </span><span>offer is announced, 10 percent of the shares may call a special meeting or seek a written consent to vote on rescinding </span><span>the pill.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, the rationale for adopting the pill should be thoroughly explained by the company. In examining the request for </span><span>the pill, take into consideration the company’s existing governance structure, including: board independence, existing </span><span>takeover defenses, and any problematic governance concerns.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Net Operating Loss (NOL) Poison Pills/Protective Amendments</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The financial crisis has prompted widespread losses in certain industries. This has resulted in previously profitable companies </span><span>considering the adoption of a poison pill and/or NOL protective amendment to protect their NOL tax assets, which may be </span><span>lost upon an acquisition of 5 percent of a company's shares.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-256</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Advance Notice Requirements for Shareholder Proposals/Nominations</span></div> <div> <div><span>In 2008, the Delaware courts handed down two decisions, which, read together, indicate a judicial move toward a narrower </span><span>interpretation of companies' advance notice bylaws. These recent court decisions have encouraged companies to take a </span><span>closer look at their bylaw provisions to ensure that broad language does not provide loopholes for activist investors. </span><span>Specifically, companies are including language designed to provide more detailed advance notice provisions and to ensure </span><span>full disclosure of economic and voting interests in a shareholder's notice of proposals, including derivatives and hedged </span><span>positions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Social Advisory Services Recommendation</span><span>: Vote case-by-case on advance notice proposals, giving support to those </span><span>proposals which allow shareholders to submit proposals/nominations as close to the meeting date as reasonably possible </span><span>and within the broadest window possible, recognizing the need to allow sufficient notice for company, regulatory and </span><span>shareholder review.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>To be reasonable, the company's deadline for shareholder notice of a proposal/ nominations must be no earlier than 120 </span><span>days prior to the anniversary of the previous year’s meeting and have a submittal window of no shorter than 30 days from </span><span>the beginning of the notice period (also known as a 90-120 day window).The submittal window is the period under which </span><span>shareholders must file their proposals/nominations prior to the deadline.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In general, support additional efforts by companies to ensure full disclosure in regard to a proponent’s economic and voting </span><span>position in the company so long as the informational requirements are reasonable and aimed at providing shareholders with </span><span>the necessary information to review such proposals.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fair Price Provisions</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fair price provisions were originally designed to specifically defend against the most coercive of takeover devises, the two-tiered,</span><span> front-end loaded tender offer. In such a hostile takeover, the bidder offers cash for enough shares to gain control of the </span><span>target. At the same time the acquirer states that once control has been obtained, the target’s remaining shares will be </span><span>purchased with cash, cash and securities or only securities. Since the payment offered for the remaining stock is, by design </span><span>less valuable than the original offer for the controlling shares, shareholders are forced to sell out early to maximize their value. </span><span>Standard fair price provisions require that, absent board or shareholder approval of the acquisition, the bidder must pay the </span><span>remaining shareholders the same price for their shares that brought control.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Social Advisory Services Recommendation:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Vote case-by-case on proposals to adopt fair price provisions evaluating factors such as the vote required to approve the </span><span>proposed acquisition, the vote required to repeal the fair price provision, and the mechanism for determining the fair </span><span>price.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Generally, vote against fair price provisions with shareholder vote requirements greater than a majority of disinterested </span><span>shares.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Greenmail</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Greenmail payments are targeted share repurchases by management of company stock from individuals or groups seeking </span><span>control of the company. Since only the hostile party receives payment, usually at a substantial premium over the market value </span><span>of shares, the practice discriminates against most shareholders. This transferred cash, absent the greenmail payment, could </span><span>be put to much better use for reinvestment in the company, payment of dividends, or to fund a public share repurchase </span><span>program.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Social Advisory Services Recommendation:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Vote for proposals to adopt antigreenmail charter or bylaw amendments or otherwise restrict a company's ability to </span><span>make greenmail payments.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Review on a case-by-case basis antigreenmail proposals when they are bundled with other charter or bylaw </span><span>amendments.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-259</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

It ensures that all votes </span><span>are based on the merits of proposals and cast in the best interests of fiduciary clients and pension plan beneficiaries. In a </span><span>confidential voting system, only vote tabulators and inspectors of election may examine individual proxies and ballots; </span><span>management and shareholders are given only vote totals. In an open voting system, management can determine who has </span><span>voted against its nominees or proposals and then re-solicit those votes before the final vote count. As a result, shareholders </span><span>can be pressured to vote with management at companies with which they maintain, or would like to establish, a business </span><span>relationship. Confidential voting also protects employee shareholders from retaliation.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>6.  Executive and Director Compensation</span></div> <div> <div><span>The global financial crisis resulted in significant erosion of shareholder value and highlighted the need for greater assurance </span><span>that executive compensation is principally performance-based, fair, reasonable, and not designed in a manner that would </span><span>incentivize excessive risk-taking by managements. The financial crisis raised questions about the role of pay incentives in </span><span>influencing executive behavior and motivating inappropriate or excessive risk-taking that could threaten a corporation‘s </span><span>long-term viability. The safety lapses that led to the disastrous explosions at BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil rig and Massey </span><span>Energy’s Upper Big Branch mine, and the resulting unprecedented losses in shareholder value; a) underscore the importance </span><span>of incorporating meaningful economic incentives around social and environmental considerations in compensation program </span><span>design, and b) exemplify the costly liabilities of failing to do so.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Evolving disclosure requirements have opened a wider window into compensation practices and processes, giving </span><span>shareholders more opportunity and responsibility to ensure that pay is designed to create and sustain value. Companies in </span><span>the U.S. are now required to evaluate and discuss potential risks arising from misguided or misaligned compensation </span><span>programs. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires advisory shareholder votes on </span><span>executive compensation (management </span><span>“</span><span>say on pay</span><span>”</span><span>), an advisory vote on the frequency of say on pay, as well as a </span><span>shareholder advisory vote on golden parachute compensation. The advent of </span><span>“</span><span>say on pay</span><span>”</span><span> votes for shareholders in the U.S. </span><span>has provided a new communication mechanism and impetus for constructive engagement between shareholders and </span><span>managers/directors on pay issues.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The socially responsible investing community contends that corporations should be held accountable for their actions and </span><span>decisions, including those around executive compensation. Social Advisory Services believes that executive pay programs </span><span>should be fair, competitive, reasonable, and create appropriate incentives, and that pay for performance should be a central </span><span>tenet in executive compensation philosophy. Most investors expect corporations to adhere to certain best practice pay </span><span>considerations in designing and administering executive and director compensation programs, including:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Appropriate pay-for-performance alignment with emphasis on long-term shareholder value</span><span>: executive pay practices </span><span>must be designed to attract, retain, and appropriately motivate the key employees who drive shareholder value creation </span><span>over the long term. Evaluating appropriate alignment of pay incentives with shareholder value creation includes taking </span><span>into consideration, among other factors, the link between pay and performance, the mix between fixed and variable pay, </span><span>equity-based plan costs, and performance goals - including goals tied to social and environmental considerations.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Avoiding arrangements that risk </span><span>“</span><span>pay for failure</span><span>”</span><span>: this includes assessing the appropriateness of long or indefinite </span><span>contracts, excessive severance packages, guaranteed compensation, and practices or policies that fail to adequately </span><span>mitigate against or address environmental, social and governance failures.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Independent and effective compensation committees</span><span>: oversight of executive pay programs by directors with appropriate </span><span>skills, knowledge, experience, and a sound process for compensation decision-making (e.g., including access to </span><span>independent expertise and advice when needed) should be promoted.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Clear and comprehensive compensation disclosures</span><span>: shareholders expect companies to provide informative and timely </span><span>disclosures that enable shareholders to evaluate executive pay practices fully and fairly.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Avoiding inappropriate pay to non-executive directors</span><span>: compensation to outside directors should not compromise their </span><span>independence and ability to make appropriate judgments in overseeing managers’ pay and performance. At the market </span><span>level, this may incorporate a variety of generally accepted best practices.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>A non-exhaustive list of best pay practices includes:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Employment contracts</span><span>: Companies should enter into employment contracts under limited circumstances for a short </span><span>time period (e.g., new executive hires for a three-year contract) for limited executives. The contracts should not have </span><span>automatic renewal feature and should have a specified termination date.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Severance agreements</span><span>: Severance provisions should not be so appealing that it becomes an incentive for the executive </span><span>to be terminated. Severance provisions should exclude excise tax gross-up. The severance formula should be reasonable </span><span>and not overly generous to the executive (e.g., severance multiples of 1X, 2X, or 3X and use pro-rated target/average </span><span>historical bonus and not maximum bonus). Failure to renew employment contract, termination under questionable </span><span>events, or poor performance should not be considered as appropriate reasons for severance payments.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Change-in-control payments</span><span>: Change-in-control payments should only be made when there is a significant change in </span><span>company ownership structure, and when there is a loss of employment or substantial change in job duties associated </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-270</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>with the change in company ownership structure (</span><span>“</span><span>double-triggered</span><span>”</span><span>). Change-in-control provisions should exclude </span><span>excise tax gross-up and eliminate the acceleration of vesting of equity awards upon a change in control unless provided </span><span>under a double-trigger scenario. Similarly, change in control provisions in equity plans should be double-triggered. A </span><span>change in control event should not result in an acceleration of vesting of all unvested stock options or removal of </span><span>vesting/performance requirements on restricted stock/performance shares, unless there is a loss of employment or </span><span>substantial change in job duties.</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Supplemental executive retirement plans (SERPs)</span><span>: SERPS should not include sweeteners that can increase the SERP value </span><span>significantly or even exponentially, such as additional years of service credited for pension calculation, inclusion of </span><span>variable pay (e.g. bonuses and equity awards) into the formula. Pension formula should not include extraordinary annual </span><span>bonuses paid close to retirement years, and should be based on the average, not the maximum level of compensation </span><span>earned.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Deferred compensation</span><span>: Above-market returns or guaranteed minimum returns should not be applied on deferred </span><span>compensation.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Disclosure practices</span><span>: The Compensation Discussion &amp; Analysis should be written in plain English, with as little </span><span>“</span><span>legalese</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>as possible and formatted using section headers, bulleted lists, tables, and charts where possible to ease reader </span><span>comprehension. Ultimately, the document should provide detail and rationale regarding compensation, strategy, pay </span><span>mix, goals/metrics, challenges, competition and pay for performance linkage, etc. in a narrative fashion.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Responsible use of company stock</span><span>: Companies should adopt policies that prohibit executives from speculating in </span><span>company’s stock or using company stock in hedging activities, such as </span><span>“</span><span>cashless</span><span>”</span><span> collars, forward sales, equity swaps or </span><span>other similar arrangements. Such behavior undermines the ultimate alignment with long-term shareholders’ interests. In </span><span>addition, the policy should prohibit or discourage the use of company stock as collateral for margin loans, to avoid any </span><span>potential sudden stock sales (required upon margin calls), that could have a negative impact on the company's stock </span><span>price.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Long-term focus</span><span>: Executive compensation programs should be designed to support companies’ long-term strategic </span><span>goals. A short-term focus on performance does not necessarily create sustainable shareholder value, since long-term </span><span>goals may be sacrificed to achieve short-term expectations. Compensation programs embedding a long-term focus with </span><span>respect to company goals better align with the long-term interests of shareholders. Granting stock options and </span><span>restricted stock to executives that vest in five years do not necessarily provide a long-term focus, as executives can sell </span><span>the company shares once they vest. However, requiring senior executives to hold company stock until they retire can </span><span>encourage a long-term focus on company performance.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Criteria for Evaluating Executive Pay</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Pay-for-Performance Evaluation</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Social Advisory Services conducts a five-part pay analysis to evaluate the degree of alignment between the CEO’s pay with </span><span>the company's performance over a sustained period. From a shareholders’ perspective, performance is predominantly </span><span>gauged by the company’s stock performance over time. Even when financial, non-financial or operational measures are </span><span>utilized in incentive awards, the achievement related to these measures should ultimately translate into superior shareholder </span><span>returns in the long-term.

SVT </span><span>is expressed as both a dollar amount and as a percentage of market value, and includes the new shares proposed, shares </span><span>available under existing plans, and shares granted but unexercised (using two measures, in the case of plans subject to the </span><span>Equity Plan Scorecard evaluation, as noted above). All award types are valued. For omnibus plans, unless limitations are </span><span>placed on the most expensive types of awards (for example, full value awards), the assumption is made that all awards to be </span><span>granted will be the most expensive types. See discussion of specific types of awards.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Except for proposals subject to Equity Plan Scorecard evaluation, Shareholder Value Transfer is reasonable if it falls below a </span><span>company-specific benchmark. The benchmark is determined as follows: The top quartile performers in each industry group </span><span>(using the Global Industry Classification Standard: GICS) are identified. Benchmark SVT levels for each industry are </span><span>established based on these top performers’ historic SVT. Regression analyses are run on each industry group to identify the </span><span>variables most strongly correlated to SVT. The benchmark industry SVT level is then adjusted upwards or downwards for the </span><span>specific company by plugging the company-specific performance measures, size and cash compensation into the industry </span><span>cap equations to arrive at the company’s benchmark.</span><span>21</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Repricing Provisions</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Vote against plans that expressly permit the repricing or exchange of underwater stock options/stock appreciate rights </span><span>(SARs) without prior shareholder approval. </span><span>”</span><span>Repricing</span><span>“</span><span> includes the ability to do any of the following:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Amend the terms of outstanding options or SARs to reduce the exercise price of such outstanding options or SARs;</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Cancel outstanding options or SARs in exchange for options or SARs with an exercise price that is less than the exercise </span><span>price of the original options or SARs.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The cancellation of underwater options in exchange for stock awards; or</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Cash buyouts of underwater options.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>While the above cover most types of repricing, Social Advisory Services may view other provisions as akin to repricing </span><span>depending on the facts and circumstances.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Also, vote against or withhold from members of the compensation committee who approved repricing (as defined above or </span><span>otherwise determined by Social Advisory Services), without prior shareholder approval, even if such repricings are allowed in </span><span>their equity plan.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Vote against plans if the company has a history of repricing without shareholder approval, and the applicable listing </span><span>standards would not preclude them from doing so.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Pay-for-Performance Misalignment – Application to Equity Plans</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If the equity plan on the ballot is a vehicle for problematic pay practices, vote against the plan.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Social Advisory Services may recommend a vote against the equity plan if the plan is determined to be a vehicle for pay-for-performance</span><span> misalignment.

In its simplest form, an </span><span>employee can elect to have a portion of his salary invested in a 401(k) plan before any income taxes are assessed. The money </span><span>can only be withdrawn before retirement under penalty. However, because the money contributed to the plan is withdrawn </span><span>before taxes (reducing the employee's income tax), a properly planned 401(k) plan will enable an employee to make larger </span><span>contributions to a 401(k) plan than to a savings plan, and still take the same amount home.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Social Advisory Services Recommendation</span><span>: Vote for proposals to implement a 401(k) savings plan for employees.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Severance Agreements for Executives/Golden Parachutes</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Social Advisory Services Recommendation</span><span>: Vote on a case-by-case basis on proposals to ratify or cancel golden parachutes. </span><span>An acceptable parachute should include, but is not limited to, the following:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The triggering mechanism should be beyond the control of management;</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-281</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Directors themselves oversee the process for evaluating board performance and </span><span>establishing pay packages for board members.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shareholders provide limited oversight of directors by electing individuals who are primarily selected by the board, or a board </span><span>nominating committee, and by voting on stock-based plans for directors designed by the board compensation committee. </span><span>Additionally, shareholders may submit and vote on their own resolutions seeking to limit or restructure director pay. While </span><span>the cost of compensating non-employee directors is small in absolute terms, compared to the cost of compensating </span><span>executives, it is still a critical aspect of a company's overall corporate governance structure.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Overall, director pay levels are rising in part because of the new forms of pay in use at many companies, as well as because of </span><span>the increased responsibilities arising from the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act requirements. In addition to an annual retainer fee, </span><span>many companies also pay fees for attending board and committee meetings, fees for chairing a committee, or a retainer fee </span><span>for chairing a committee.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Director compensation packages should be designed to provide value to directors for their contribution. Given that many </span><span>directors are high-level executives whose personal income levels are generally high, cash compensation may hold little </span><span>appeal. Stock-based incentives on the other hand reinforce the directors' role of protecting and enhancing shareholder value. </span><span>The stock-based component of director compensation should be large enough to ensure that when faced with a situation in </span><span>which the interests of shareholders and management differ, the board will have a financial incentive to think as a shareholder. </span><span>Additionally, many companies have instituted equity ownership programs for directors. Social Advisory Services recommends </span><span>that directors receive stock grants equal to three times of their annual retainer, as it is a reasonable starting point for </span><span>companies of all sizes and industries. A vesting schedule for director grants helps directors to meet the stock ownership </span><span>guidelines and maintains their long-term interests in the firm.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Director compensation packages should also be designed to attract and retain competent directors who are willing to risk </span><span>becoming a defendant in a lawsuit and suffer potentially adverse publicity if the company runs into financial difficulties or is </span><span>mismanaged.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shareholder Ratification of Director Pay Programs</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Social Advisory Services Recommendation</span><span>: Vote case-by-case on management proposals seeking ratification of non-employee</span><span> director compensation, based on the following factors:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>If the equity plan under which non-employee director grants are made is on the ballot, whether or not it warrants </span><span>support; and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>An assessment of the following qualitative factors:</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The relative magnitude of director compensation as compared to companies of a similar profile;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The presence of problematic pay practices relating to director compensation;</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Director stock ownership guidelines and holding requirements;</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Equity award vesting schedules;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The mix of cash and equity-based compensation;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Meaningful limits on director compensation;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The availability of retirement benefits or perquisites; and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The quality of disclosure surrounding director compensation.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-282</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Shareholders of </span><span>the target may be concerned that the deal undervalues their interests.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Vote recommendation will be based on primarily an analysis of shareholder value, which itself can be affected by ancillary </span><span>factors such as the negotiation process.

While the number of bankruptcies has risen over the past year as evidenced by many firms, including General </span><span>Motors and Lehman Brothers, the prevalence of these reorganizations can vary year over year due to, among other things, </span><span>market conditions and a company's ability to sustain its operations. Additionally, the amount of time that lapses between a </span><span>particular company's entrance into Chapter 11 and its submission of a plan of reorganization varies significantly depending </span><span>on the complexity, timing, and jurisdiction of the particular case.

SPACs generally lack an independent fairness opinion and the </span><span>financials on the target may be limited. Compare the conversion price with the intrinsic value of the target company </span><span>provided in the fairness opinion. Also, evaluate the proportionate value of the combined entity attributable to the SPAC </span><span>IPO shareholders versus the pre-merger value of SPAC.

Requests to report such </span><span>information will merit support. Requests to establish special committees of the board to address broad corporate policy and </span><span>provide forums for ongoing dialogue on issues including, but not limited to shareholder relations, the environment, human </span><span>rights, occupational health and safety, and executive compensation, will generally be supported, particularly when they </span><span>appear to offer a potentially effective method for enhancing shareholder value. We will closely evaluate proposals that ask the </span><span>company to cease certain actions that the proponent believes are harmful to society or some segment of society with special </span><span>attention to the company’s legal and ethical obligations, its ability to remain profitable, and potential negative publicity if the </span><span>company fails to honor the request.

The ILO’s general mandate is to promote a decent workplace for all individuals. The ILO sets international </span><span>labor standards in the form of its conventions and then monitors compliance with the standards. The seven conventions of </span><span>the ILO fall under four broad categories: Right to organize and bargain collectively, Nondiscrimination in employment, </span><span>Abolition of forced labor, and End of child labor. Each of the 187 member-nations of the ILO is bound to respect and promote </span><span>these rights to the best of their abilities. SA 8000 is a set of labor standards, based on the principles of the ILO conventions </span><span>and other human rights conventions, and covers eight workplace conditions, including: child labor, forced labor, health and </span><span>safety, freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, discrimination, disciplinary practices, working hours and </span><span>compensation. Companies have also turned to the United Nations </span><span>“</span><span>Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights,</span><span>”</span><span> - a </span><span>set of guidelines that create a framework for states to protect human rights, corporations to respect human rights, and </span><span>rights-holders to access remediation.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Social Advisory Services Recommendation:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Vote for shareholder proposals to implement human rights standards and workplace codes of conduct.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Vote for shareholder proposals calling for the implementation and reporting on ILO codes of conduct, SA 8000 </span><span>Standards, or human rights due diligence practices.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Vote for shareholder proposals that call for the adoption of principles or codes of conduct relating to company </span><span>investments in countries with patterns of human rights abuses.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Vote for shareholder proposals that call for independent monitoring programs in conjunction with local and respected </span><span>religious and human rights groups to monitor supplier and licensee compliance with codes.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Vote for shareholder proposals that seek publication of a </span><span>“</span><span>Code of Conduct</span><span>”</span><span> by the company’s foreign suppliers and </span><span>licensees, requiring that they satisfy all applicable standards and laws protecting employees’ wages, benefits, working </span><span>conditions, freedom of association, and other rights.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Vote for proposals requesting that a company conduct an assessment of the human rights risks in its operations or in its </span><span>supply chain, or report on its human rights risk assessment process.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Vote for shareholder proposals seeking reports on, or the adoption of, vendor standards including: reporting on </span><span>incentives to encourage suppliers to raise standards rather than terminate contracts and providing public disclosure of </span><span>contract supplier reviews on a regular basis.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Vote for shareholder proposals to adopt labor standards for foreign and domestic suppliers to ensure that the company </span><span>will not do business with foreign suppliers that manufacture products for sale in the U.S. using forced labor, child labor, </span><span>or that fail to comply with applicable laws protecting employee’s wages and working conditions.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Adopt/Report on MacBride Principles</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>These resolutions have called for the adoption of the MacBride Principles for operations located in Northern Ireland.

Proponents contend that </span><span>operations in these countries may lead to potential reputational, regulatory, and/or supply chain risks as a result of </span><span>operational disruptions. Concerned shareholders have requested investment withdrawals or cessation of operations in high-risk</span><span> markets as well as reports on operations in high-risk markets.

Alberta’s oil sands contain a reserve largely thought to be one of the world’s largest potential </span><span>energy sources. Rising oil sands production in Alberta has been paralleled with concerns from a variety of stakeholders—</span><span>including environmental groups, local residents, and shareholders—regarding the environmental impacts of the complicated </span><span>extraction and upgrading processes required to convert oil sands into a synthetic crude oil. The high viscosity of bitumen </span><span>makes its extraction a challenging and resource-intensive process; the most common extraction technique involves pumping </span><span>steam into the oil sands to lower the viscosity of bitumen in order to pump it to the surface.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>One of the most prominent issues concerning oil sands is the large volume of greenhouse gases (GHG) associated with </span><span>production.

Oil companies have expressed an interest in bidding </span><span>for these leases given the opportunity. In response, shareholder activists have filed resolutions asking these companies to </span><span>cancel any plans to drill in the ANWR and cease their lobbying efforts to open the area for drilling. Proponents of shareholder </span><span>proposals on this issue argue that the Coastal Plain section of the ANWR is the most environmentally sensitive area of the </span><span>refuge, that the majority of Alaska’s North Slope that is not federally designated wilderness already provides the oil industry </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-302</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

In addition to charitable </span><span>contribution proposals, anti-social proposals addressing climate change, sustainability, and conflicts of interest may be seen </span><span>at shareholder meetings. Despite implicitly different motivations in some of these proposals, the underlying requests for </span><span>increased disclosure, in some cases, may be worth shareholder support.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Social Advisory Services Recommendation:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Vote against shareholder proposals that do not seek to ultimately advance the goals of the social investment community.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Vote case-by-case on anti-social shareholder proposals seeking a review or report on the company's charitable </span><span>contributions.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Violence and Adult Themes in Video Games</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Perceptions of increased sex and violence in video games have led certain shareholders to question the availability of adult-themed</span><span> content to children and teens.

Some of the non-financial criteria that proponents of these resolutions seek to be incorporated in </span><span>compensation program design include workplace safety, environmental stewardship, or diversity and customer/employee </span><span>satisfaction – as part of a written policy used to align compensation with performance on non-financial factors alongside </span><span>financial criteria.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Proponents believe that factors such as poor environmental performance, workplace lawsuits, etc. could have a significant </span><span>adverse impact on a company’s financial performance if not proactively and adequately addressed, and that these factors </span><span>should be considered along with traditional financial considerations when determining executive pay. The significant stock </span><span>price declines and massive losses in shareholder value stemming from the BP Deepwater Horizon oil rig disaster and the </span><span>tragic explosion at Massey Energy’s Upper Big Branch mine that killed 29 employees is a sobering reminder of the need to </span><span>have the right management incentives in place to ensure that social and environmental risks are actively managed and </span><span>mitigated against. Given the proliferation of derivative lawsuits targeted at firms such as Halliburton, Transocean and </span><span>Cameron International that were suppliers to or partners with BP in a capacity that ignored safety considerations or that </span><span>contributed to the economic and ecological disaster, investors are increasingly mindful of the far-reaching implications that </span><span>exposure to social or environmental risks could have on shareholder value at portfolio companies.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Social Advisory Services Recommendation:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Vote for shareholder proposals calling for linkage of executive pay to non-financial factors including performance </span><span>against social and environmental goals, customer/employee satisfaction, corporate downsizing, community </span><span>involvement, human rights, or predatory lending.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Vote for shareholder proposals seeking reports on linking executive pay to non-financial factors.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-311</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

(the </span><span>“</span><span>Index Provider</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>MSCI</span><span>”</span><span>). The Underlying Index is a subset of the MSCI USA Index (the </span><span>“</span><span>Parent Index</span><span>”</span><span>), which is designed to measure the performance of the large- and mid-capitalization segments of the U.S. </span><span>equity market, as defined by the Index Provider.

The Index Provider then selects securities with higher growth scores until approximately 50% of the </span><span>aggregate market capitalization of the Parent Index is reached, subject to certain constraints.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The process for weighting the selected securities in the Underlying Index involves calculating a </span><span>“</span><span>tilt score</span><span>”</span><span> for each security. </span><span>Two components of the tilt score are value and quality scores, which are calculated for each security relative to its peers </span><span>within the corresponding Global Industry Classification Standards sector. The value score is based on three metrics: price-to-book</span><span> value, forward price-to-earnings ratio, and the ratio of enterprise value to cash flow from operations. The quality score </span><span>is based on three metrics: return on equity, debt-to-equity ratio, and earnings variability.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A security’s tilt score is based on the following:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>whether the security is in the top 50% or bottom 50% of the cumulative weight of the selected securities calculated </span><span>using free float-adjusted market capitalization;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>whether the security’s value score is in the top 50% or bottom 50% of the scores of the selected securities; and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>the particular quartile in which the security’s quality score falls.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Tilt scores are generally lower for securities with larger market capitalizations and higher for securities with more favorable </span><span>value and quality scores. To determine a security’s weight in the Underlying Index, its tilt score is multiplied by the security’s </span><span>market capitalization weight in the Parent Index. The maximum weight of any individual issuer is 5%. The Index Provider also </span><span>applies constraints on turnover and on sector weights after the tilt score is applied, relative to the sector weights of the </span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Stocks included in the Underlying Index are deemed by the Index Provider to be quality stocks, but there </span><span>is no guarantee that the past performance of these stocks will continue. Companies that issue these stocks may experience </span><span>lower than expected returns or may experience negative growth, as well as increased leverage, resulting in lower than </span><span>expected or negative returns to Fund shareholders. Many factors can affect a stock’s quality and performance, and the </span><span>impact of these factors on a stock or its price can be difficult to predict.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Value Securities Risk</span><span>. Value securities are those issued by companies that may be perceived as undervalued. Such securities </span><span>may decline in price or fail to appreciate for long periods of time, and they may never realize their full potential value.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Quality Stocks Risk.</span><span> The Fund invests in stocks that are deemed by the Index Provider to be of high quality based on a </span><span>number of factors, but there is no guarantee that the past performance of these stocks will continue. The Index Provider may </span><span>be unsuccessful in creating an index that reflects the quality of individual stocks. Companies that issue these stocks may not </span><span>be able to sustain consistently high returns on equity, earnings and growth year after year and may need to borrow money or </span><span>issue debt despite their prior history. Earnings, growth and other measures of a stock’s quality can be adversely affected by </span><span>market, regulatory, political, environmental and other factors. The price of a stock also may be affected by factors other than </span><span>those factors considered by the Index Provider. The degree to which these factors affect a stock’s performance can be </span><span>difficult to predict.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Value Securities Risk</span><span>. Value securities are those issued by companies that may be perceived as undervalued. Such securities </span><span>may decline in price or fail to appreciate for long periods of time, and they may never realize their full potential value because </span><span>the market fails to recognize the stock’s intrinsic worth. Value securities may underperform growth securities and other types </span><span>of assets as well as the overall stock market. Although value securities have generally performed better than non-value </span><span>securities during periods of economic recovery, there is no assurance that they will continue to do so. Value securities may go </span><span>in and out of favor over time, which could affect the performance of a Fund with such holdings.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Changes to the Fund’s </span><span>“</span><span>Management</span><span>”</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The third paragraph of the section entitled </span><span>“</span><span>Investment Adviser</span><span>”</span><span> on page 15 of the Prospectus is deleted in its entirety </span><span>and replaced with the following:</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Effective April 1, 2024, for its investment advisory services to the Fund, BFA is paid a management fee from the Fund, as a </span><span>percentage of the Fund’s average daily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.15%.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>MSCI’s Global Investable Market Indexes (the </span><span>“</span><span>MSCI GIMI</span><span>”</span><span>) provide coverage and non-overlapping market segmentation by </span><span>market capitalization size and by style. The MSCI GIMI intend to target approximately 99% coverage of the free float-adjusted </span><span>market capitalization in each market of large-, mid- and small-cap securities.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Defining the Equity Universe.</span><span> MSCI begins with securities listed in countries in the MSCI GIMI. All listed equity securities and </span><span>listed securities that exhibit characteristics of equity securities, except mutual funds, ETFs, equity derivatives, limited </span><span>partnerships and most investment trusts, are eligible for inclusion in the equity universe. REITs in some countries and certain </span><span>income trusts in Canada are also eligible for inclusion. Each company and its securities (i.e., share classes) are classified in </span><span>only one country.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Determining Market Capitalization Size Segments for Each Market.</span><span> In order to create size components that can be </span><span>meaningfully aggregated into composites, individual market size segments balance the following two objectives:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Achieving global size integrity by ensuring that companies of comparable and relevant sizes are included in a given </span><span>size segment across all markets in a composite index; and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Achieving consistent market coverage by ensuring that each market’s size segment is represented in its </span><span>proportional weight in the composite universe.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Applying Final Size Segment Investability Requirements.</span><span> In order to enhance replicability of the indexes, MSCI applies </span><span>additional size segment investability requirements, which include minimum free float-adjusted market capitalization, </span><span>minimum liquidity, minimum foreign limits and minimum length of trading.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Weighting. </span><span>All indexes of the MSCI GIMI are free float weighted, i.e., companies are included in the indexes at the value of </span><span>their free public float (free float multiplied by security price).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Free Float.</span><span> MSCI defines the free float of a security as the proportion of shares outstanding that are deemed to be available </span><span>for purchase in the public equity markets by international investors. In practice, limitations on free float available to </span><span>international investors include: (i) strategic and other shareholdings not considered part of available free float; and (ii) limits </span><span>on share ownership for foreigners.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>MSCI calculates the free float-adjusted market capitalization of each security in the equity index universe by (i) defining and </span><span>estimating the free float available to foreign investors; (ii) assigning a free float-adjustment factor to each security; and (iii) </span><span>calculating the free float-adjusted market capitalization of each security.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Under MSCI’s free float-adjustment methodology, a constituent’s inclusion factor is equal to its estimated free float, rounded </span><span>up to the closest 5% for constituents with free float equal to or exceeding 15%. For example, a constituent security with a </span><span>free float of 23.2% will be included in the index at 25% of its market capitalization. For securities with a free float of less than </span><span>15%, the estimated free float is adjusted to the nearest 1%.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Price and Exchange Rates</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Prices.</span><span> The prices used to calculate all MSCI indexes are the official exchange closing prices or those figures accepted as </span><span>such. MSCI reserves the right to use an alternative pricing source on any given day.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Exchange Rates. </span><span>MSCI uses the World Markets/Reuters Closing Spot Rates taken at 4:00 p.m. London time. In case World </span><span>Markets/Reuters does not provide rates for specific markets on given days (for example, Christmas Day and New Year’s Day), </span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>the previous business day’s rates are normally used. MSCI independently monitors the exchange rates on all its indexes. </span><span>MSCI may under exceptional circumstances elect to use alternative sources of exchange rates if the World Markets/Reuters </span><span>rates are not available, or if MSCI determines that the World Markets/Reuters rates are not reflective of market circumstances </span><span>for a given currency on a particular day. In such circumstances, an announcement would be sent to clients with the related </span><span>information. If appropriate, MSCI may conduct a consultation with the investment community to gather feedback on the </span><span>most relevant exchange rate.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Changes to the Indexes. </span><span>The MSCI GIMI are maintained with the objective of reflecting, on a timely basis, the evolution of </span><span>the underlying equity markets. In maintaining the MSCI indexes, emphasis is also placed on continuity, replicability and </span><span>minimizing turnover in the indexes. Maintaining the MSCI indexes involves many aspects, including: (i) additions to, and </span><span>deletions from, the indexes; (ii) changes in number of shares; and (iii) changes in inclusion factors as a result of updated free </span><span>float estimates.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Index maintenance can be described by three broad categories of changes:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Semi-Annual Index Reviews (</span><span>“</span><span>SAIRs</span><span>”</span><span>), conducted on a fixed semi-annual timetable that systematically reassess the </span><span>various dimensions of the equity universe for all markets;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Quarterly Index Reviews (</span><span>“</span><span>QIRs</span><span>”</span><span>), aimed at promptly reflecting other significant market events; and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Ongoing event-related changes, such as mergers, acquisitions, spin-offs, bankruptcies, reorganizations and other </span><span>similar corporate events, which generally are implemented in the indexes as they occur.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Potential changes in the status of countries (stand-alone, frontier, emerging and developed) follow their own implementation </span><span>time tables. In addition, reviews of company involvement in ESG controversies, when applicable, may differ by index and </span><span>severity of the ESG controversy as determined by MSCI.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>MSCI conducts SAIRs generally as of the close of the last business day of May and November. During the SAIRs, MSCI </span><span>updates the investable equity universe and reassesses size segmentation investability requirements. MSCI also conducts QIRs </span><span>generally as of the close of the last business day of February and August. During the QIRs, MSCI reflects changes in the index </span><span>that were not captured at the time of their actual occurrence, but are significant enough to be included before the next SAIR. </span><span>The results of the SAIR and QIR are generally announced at least ten business days in advance of implementation.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Creation of Sector and Industry Indexes using the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS</span><span>®</span><span>)</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>All securities in the Global Investable Equity Universe are assigned to the industry that best describes their business activities </span><span>using the GICS. The GICS classification consists of sectors, industry groups, industries and sub-industries. Each company is </span><span>assigned to one unique sub-industry according to its principal business activity (generally defined as the business activity </span><span>that generates 60% or more of the company’s revenues). Narrower indexes may be derived based on industry classification </span><span>and may contain securities belonging to specific sectors, industry groups, industries, sub-industries or a combination thereof.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>MSCI USA Quality GARP Select Index</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Number of Components: approximately 170</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Index Description: </span><span>The MSCI USA Quality GARP Select Index is a subset of the MSCI USA Index (the </span><span>“</span><span>Parent Index</span><span>”</span><span>), which </span><span>is designed to measure the performance of the large- and mid-capitalization segments of the U.S. equity market, as defined </span></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The Underlying Index’s </span><span>“</span><span>growth at a reasonable price</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>GARP</span><span>”</span><span> strategy seeks to measure the </span><span>performance of securities in the Parent Index that exhibit stronger growth characteristics, with weighting based on relatively </span><span>favorable value and quality characteristics.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Index Methodology.</span><span> The Index Provider begins by calculating a </span><span>“</span><span>growth score</span><span>”</span><span> for each security in the Parent Index using </span><span>five metrics: long-term forward earnings per share (</span><span>“</span><span>EPS</span><span>”</span><span>) growth rate; short-term forward EPS growth rate; current internal </span><span>growth rate (based on return on equity and dividend payout metrics); long-term historical EPS growth trend; and long-term </span><span>historical sales per share growth trend. The values of the metrics are standardized to reduce the effect of outliers on the </span><span>calculation of the growth scores. The Index Provider then selects securities with higher growth scores until approximately </span><span>50% of the aggregate market capitalization of the Parent Index is reached, subject to certain constraints.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The process for weighting the selected securities in the Underlying Index involves calculating a </span><span>“</span><span>tilt score</span><span>”</span><span> for each security. </span><span>Two components of the tilt score are value and quality scores, which are calculated for each security relative to its peers </span><span>within the corresponding GICS sector. The value score is based on three metrics: price-to-book value, forward price-to-earnings</span><span> ratio, and the ratio of enterprise value to cash flow from operations. The quality score is based on three metrics: </span><span>return on equity, debt-to-equity ratio, and earnings variability. The values of the metrics are standardized to reduce the effect </span><span>of outliers on the calculation of the value and quality scores.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A security’s tilt score is based on the following:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>whether the security is in the top 50% or bottom 50% of the cumulative weight of the selected securities calculated </span><span>using free float-adjusted market capitalization;</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>whether the security’s value score is in the top 50% or bottom 50% of the scores of the selected securities; and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>the particular quartile in which the security’s quality score falls.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Tilt scores are generally lower for securities with larger market capitalizations and higher for securities with more favorable </span><span>value and quality scores. To determine a security’s weight in the Underlying Index, its tilt score is multiplied by the security’s </span><span>market capitalization weight in the Parent Index. The maximum weight of any individual issuer is 5%. The sector weights </span><span>after the tilt score is applied will not deviate more than +/- 5% from the sector weights of the Underlying Index before the tilt </span><span>score is applied (i.e., with sector weights based on the free float-adjusted market capitalization of the selected securities) at </span><span>the time of rebalancing. The Index Provider also applies constraints to reduce turnover. The Underlying Index is rebalanced </span><span>on a quarterly basis.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Changes in the Fund’s </span><span>“</span><span>Investment Advisory, Administrative and Distribution Services</span><span>”</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the management fee table on pages 109-110 of the SAI, the following footnote is added to the Fund:</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Effective April 1, 2024, the management fee for the iShares MSCI USA Quality GARP ETF is 0.15%.

The discussion below supplements, and should be read in </span><span>conjunction with, that section of the applicable Prospectus.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shares of each Fund are listed for trading, and trade throughout the day, on the applicable Listing Exchange and in other </span><span>secondary markets. Shares of certain Funds may also be listed on certain non-U.S. exchanges. There can be no assurance </span><span>that the requirements of the Listing Exchange necessary to maintain the listing of shares of any Fund will continue to be met. </span><span>The Listing Exchange may, but is not required to, remove the shares of a Fund from listing if, among other things: (i) a Fund is </span><span>no longer eligible to operate in reliance on Rule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act; (ii) any of the other listing </span><span>requirements are not continuously maintained; or (iii) any event shall occur or condition shall exist that, in the opinion of the </span><span>Listing Exchange, makes further dealings on the Listing Exchange inadvisable. The Listing Exchange will also remove shares </span><span>of a Fund from listing and trading upon termination of the Fund.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As in the case of other publicly-traded securities, when you buy or sell shares of a Fund through a broker, you may incur a </span><span>brokerage commission determined by that broker, as well as other charges.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Trust reserves the right to adjust the share price of the Funds in the future to maintain convenient trading ranges for </span><span>investors. Any adjustments would be accomplished through stock splits or reverse stock splits, which would have no effect </span><span>on the net assets of the Funds or an investor's equity interest in the Funds.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investment Strategies and Risks</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Each Fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing primarily in securities issued by issuers that compose its relevant </span><span>Underlying Index and in investments that provide substantially similar exposure to securities in the Underlying Index. Each </span><span>Fund operates as an index fund and is not actively managed. Adverse performance of a security in a Fund’s portfolio will </span><span>ordinarily not result in the elimination of the security from the Fund’s portfolio.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Each Fund engages in representative sampling, which is investing in a sample of securities selected by BFA to have a </span><span>collective investment profile similar to that of the Fund's Underlying Index. Securities selected have aggregate investment </span><span>characteristics (based on market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return </span><span>variability, earnings valuation and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of the Fund’s Underlying Index. A fund that </span><span>uses representative sampling generally does not hold all of the securities that are in its underlying index.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Although the Funds do not seek leveraged returns, certain instruments used by the Funds may have a leveraging effect as </span><span>described below.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Borrowing. </span><span> </span><span>Each Fund may borrow for temporary or emergency purposes, including to meet payments due from </span><span>redemptions or to facilitate the settlement of securities or other transactions. The iShares JPX-Nikkei 400 ETF and iShares </span><span>Semiconductor ETF, along with certain other iShares funds, have entered into a syndicated line of credit with the Bank of New </span><span>York Mellon (</span><span>“</span><span>BNY</span><span>”</span><span>), which serves as administrative agent for itself and the other banks. The syndicated line of credit may be </span><span>used for temporary or emergency purposes, including redemption, settlement of trades and rebalancing of portfolio holdings.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Interest rates related to the syndicated line of credit are based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (</span><span>“</span><span>SOFR</span><span>”</span><span>) published </span><span>by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plus a spread. Pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement, if SOFR were to cease </span><span>being published or representative, it would be replaced by a rate based on an alternate benchmark selected by BNY.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The purchase of securities while borrowings are outstanding may have the effect of leveraging a Fund. The incurrence of </span><span>leverage increases a Fund’s exposure to risk, and borrowed funds are subject to interest costs that will reduce net income. </span><span>Purchasing securities while borrowings are outstanding creates special risks, such as the potential for greater volatility in the </span><span>NAV of Fund shares and in the yield on a Fund’s portfolio. In addition, the interest expenses from borrowings may exceed the </span><span>income generated by a Fund’s portfolio and, therefore, the amount available (if any) for distribution to shareholders as </span><span>dividends may be reduced. BFA may determine to maintain outstanding borrowings if it expects that the benefits to a Fund’s </span><span>shareholders will outweigh the current reduced return.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Certain types of borrowings by a Fund must be made from a bank or may result in a Fund being subject to covenants in </span><span>credit agreements relating to asset coverage, portfolio composition requirements and other matters. It is not anticipated that </span><span>observance of such covenants would impede BFA’s management of a Fund’s portfolio in accordance with a Fund’s </span><span>investment objectives and policies. However, a breach of any such covenants not cured within the specified cure period may </span><span>result in acceleration of outstanding indebtedness and require a Fund to dispose of portfolio investments at a time when it </span><span>may be disadvantageous to do so.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Currency Transactions.</span><span>  </span><span>A currency forward contract is an over-the-counter (</span><span>“</span><span>OTC</span><span>”</span><span>) obligation to purchase or sell a specific </span><span>currency at a future date, which may be any fixed number of days greater than two days from the date on which the contract </span><span>is agreed upon by the parties, at a price set at the time of the contract. A non-deliverable currency forward is an OTC </span><span>currency forward settled in a specified currency, on a specified date, based on the difference between the agreed-upon </span><span>exchange rate and the market exchange rate. A currency futures contract is a contract that trades on an organized futures </span><span>exchange involving an obligation to deliver or acquire a specified amount of a specific currency, at a specified price and at a </span><span>specified future time. Currency futures contracts may be settled on a net cash payment basis rather than by the sale and </span><span>delivery of the underlying currency. Certain of the Funds do not expect to engage in currency transactions for the purpose of </span><span>hedging against declines in the value of the Funds' assets that are denominated in a non-U.S. currency. A Fund may enter </span><span>into non-U.S. currency forwards, non-deliverable currency forwards and non-U.S. currency futures transactions to facilitate </span><span>local securities settlements or to protect against currency exposure in connection with its distributions to shareholders, but </span><span>may not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Foreign exchange transactions involve a significant degree of risk and the markets in which foreign exchange transactions are </span><span>effected may be highly volatile, highly specialized and highly technical. Significant changes, including changes in liquidity and </span><span>prices, can occur in such markets within very short periods of time, often within minutes. Foreign exchange trading risks </span><span>include, but are not limited to, exchange rate risk, counterparty risk, maturity gap, interest rate risk, and potential interference </span><span>by foreign governments through regulation of local exchange markets, foreign investment or particular transactions in non-U.S.</span><span> currency. If BFA utilizes foreign exchange transactions at an inappropriate time or judges market conditions, trends or </span><span>correlations incorrectly, foreign exchange transactions may not serve their intended purpose of improving the correlation of a </span><span>Fund's return with the performance of its Underlying Index and may lower the Fund’s return. A Fund could experience losses </span><span>if the value of its currency forwards, options or futures positions were poorly correlated with its other investments or if it </span><span>could not close out its positions because of an illiquid market or otherwise. In addition, a Fund could incur transaction costs, </span><span>including trading commissions, in connection with certain non-U.S. currency transactions.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Diversification Status.</span><span>  </span><span>The following table sets forth the diversification status of each Fund:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div> </div> </div> <div>

However, while </span><span>the iShares Core S&amp;P U.S. Growth ETF, iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF, iShares Russell Top 200 Growth ETF, iShares S&amp;P </span><span>100 ETF and iShares S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF are classified as </span><span>“</span><span>diversified,</span><span>”</span><span> under applicable no-action relief from the SEC staff, </span><span>the funds may become non-diversified, as defined in the 1940 Act, solely as a result of a change in relative market </span><span>capitalization or index weighting of one or more constituents of their Underlying Indexes and such a change does not require </span><span>shareholder approval.</span></div> <div> <div><span> </span><span>A </span><span>“</span><span>non-diversified</span><span>”</span><span> fund is a fund that is not limited by the 1940 Act with regard to the percentage of its assets that may be </span><span>invested in the securities of a single issuer. The securities of a particular issuer (or securities of issuers in particular industries) </span><span>may constitute a significant percentage of the underlying index of such a fund and, consequently, the fund’s investment </span><span>portfolio. This may adversely affect a fund’s performance or subject the fund’s shares to greater price volatility than that </span><span>experienced by more diversified investment companies.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Each Fund (whether diversified or non-diversified) intends to maintain the required level of diversification and otherwise </span><span>conduct its operations so as to qualify as a regulated investment company (</span><span>“</span><span>RIC</span><span>”</span><span>) for purposes of the U.S. Internal Revenue </span><span>Code of 1986, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>Internal Revenue Code</span><span>”</span><span>), and to relieve the Fund of any liability for U.S. federal income tax to </span><span>the extent that its earnings are distributed to shareholders, provided that the Fund satisfies a minimum distribution </span><span>requirement. Compliance with the diversification requirements of the Internal Revenue Code may limit the investment </span><span>flexibility of the Funds and may make it less likely that the Funds will meet their respective investment objectives.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Futures, Options on Futures and Securities Options.</span><span>  </span><span>Futures contracts, options on futures and securities options may be </span><span>used by a Fund to simulate investment in its Underlying Index, to facilitate trading or to reduce transaction costs. Each Fund </span><span>may enter into futures contracts and options on futures that are traded on a U.S. or non-U.S. futures exchange. Each Fund </span><span>will not use futures, options on futures or securities options for speculative purposes. Each Fund intends to use futures and </span><span>options on futures in accordance with Rule 4.5 of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the </span><span>“</span><span>CFTC</span><span>”</span><span>) promulgated </span><span>under the Commodity Exchange Act (</span><span>“</span><span>CEA</span><span>”</span><span>). BFA, with respect to certain Funds, has claimed an exclusion from the definition </span><span>of the term </span><span>“</span><span>commodity pool operator</span><span>”</span><span> in accordance with Rule 4.5 so that BFA, with respect to such Funds, is not subject to </span><span>registration or regulation as a commodity pool operator under the CEA. See the </span><span>Regulation Regarding Derivatives </span><span>section of </span><span>this SAI for more information.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Futures contracts provide for the future sale by one party and purchase by another party of a specified amount of a specific </span><span>instrument or index at a specified future time and at a specified price. Stock index contracts are based on investments that </span><span>reflect the market value of common stock of the firms included in the investments. Each Fund may enter into futures </span><span>contracts to purchase securities indexes when BFA anticipates purchasing the underlying securities and believes prices will </span><span>rise before the purchase will be made. Upon entering into a futures contract, a Fund will be required to deposit with the </span><span>broker an amount of cash or cash equivalents known as </span><span>“</span><span>initial margin,</span><span>”</span><span> which is similar to a performance bond or good faith </span><span>deposit on the contract and is returned to the Fund upon termination of the futures contract if all contractual obligations </span><span>have been satisfied. Subsequent payments, known as </span><span>“</span><span>variation margin,</span><span>”</span><span> will be made to and from the broker daily as the </span><span>price of the instrument or index underlying the futures contract fluctuates, making the long and short positions in the futures </span><span>contract more or less valuable, a process known as </span><span>“</span><span>marking-to-market.</span><span>”</span><span> At any time prior to the expiration of a futures </span><span>contract, each Fund may elect to close the position by taking an opposite position, which will operate to terminate the Fund’s </span><span>existing position in the contract. An option on a futures contract, as contrasted with a direct investment in such a contract, </span><span>gives the purchaser the right, but no obligation, in return for the premium paid, to assume a position in the underlying </span><span>futures contract at a specified exercise price at any time prior to the expiration date of the option. Upon exercise of an option, </span><span>the delivery of the futures position by the writer of the option to the holder of the option will be accompanied by delivery of </span><span>the accumulated balance in the writer’s futures margin account that represents the amount by which the market price of the </span><span>futures contract exceeds (in the case of a call) or is less than (in the case of a put) the exercise price of the option on the </span><span>futures contract.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The potential for loss related to the purchase of an option on a futures contract is limited to the premium paid for the option </span><span>plus transaction costs. Because the value of the option is fixed at the point of sale, there are no daily cash payments by the </span><span>purchaser to reflect changes in the value of the underlying contract; however, the value of the option changes daily and that </span><span>change would be reflected in the NAV of each Fund. The potential for loss related to writing call options is unlimited. The </span><span>potential for loss related to writing put options is limited to the agreed-upon price per share, also known as the </span><span>“</span><span>strike price,</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>less the premium received from writing the put. Certain of the Funds may purchase and write put and call options on futures </span><span>contracts that are traded on an exchange as a hedge against changes in value of their portfolio securities or in anticipation of </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>6</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

There is no guarantee that such closing transactions can be effected.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Securities options may be used by a Fund to obtain access to securities in its Underlying Index or to dispose of securities in </span><span>its Underlying Index at favorable prices, to invest cash in a securities index that offers similar exposure to that provided by its </span><span>Underlying Index or otherwise to achieve the Fund’s objective of tracking its Underlying Index.</span><span> </span><span>A call option gives a holder the </span><span>right to purchase a specific security at a specified price (</span><span>“</span><span>exercise price</span><span>”</span><span>) within a specified period of time. A put option gives </span><span>a holder the right to sell a specific security at an exercise price within a specified period of time. The initial purchaser of a call </span><span>option pays the </span><span>“</span><span>writer</span><span>”</span><span> a premium, which is paid at the time of purchase and is retained by the writer whether or not such </span><span>option is exercised. Each Fund may purchase put options to hedge its portfolio against the risk of a decline in the market </span><span>value of securities held and may purchase call options to hedge against an increase in the price of securities it is committed </span><span>to purchase. Each Fund may write put and call options along with a long position in options to increase its ability to hedge </span><span>against a change in the market value of the securities it holds or is committed to purchase. Each Fund may purchase or sell </span><span>securities options on a U.S. or non-U.S. securities exchange or in the OTC market through a transaction with a dealer. Options </span><span>on a securities index are typically settled on a net basis based on the appreciation or depreciation of the index level over the </span><span>strike price. Options on single name securities may be cash- or physically-settled, depending upon the market in which they </span><span>are traded. Options may be structured so as to be exercisable only on certain dates or on a daily basis. Options may also be </span><span>structured to have conditions to exercise (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, </span><span>“</span><span>Knock-in Events</span><span>”</span><span>) or conditions that trigger termination (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, </span><span>“</span><span>Knock-out </span><span>Events</span><span>”</span><span>).</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Lending Portfolio Securities.</span><span>  </span><span>Each Fund may lend portfolio securities to certain borrowers that BFA determines to be </span><span>creditworthy, including borrowers affiliated with BFA. The borrowers provide collateral that is maintained in an amount at </span><span>least equal to the current market value of the securities loaned. No securities loan shall be made on behalf of a Fund if, as a </span><span>result, the aggregate value of all securities loans of the particular Fund exceeds one-third of the value of such Fund's total </span><span>assets (including the value of the collateral received). A Fund may terminate a loan at any time and obtain the return of the </span><span>securities loaned. Each Fund receives, by way of substitute payment, the value of any interest or cash or non-cash </span><span>distributions paid on the loaned securities that it would have otherwise received if the securities were not on loan.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>With respect to loans that are collateralized by cash, the borrower may be entitled to receive a fee based on the amount of </span><span>cash collateral. The Funds are compensated by any positive difference between the amount earned on the reinvestment of </span><span>cash collateral and the fee paid to the borrower. In the case of collateral other than cash, a Fund is compensated by a fee paid </span><span>by the borrower equal to a percentage of the market value of the loaned securities. Any cash collateral received by the Fund </span><span>for such loans, and uninvested cash, may be reinvested in certain short-term instruments either directly on behalf of each </span><span>Fund or through one or more joint accounts or money market funds, including those affiliated with BFA; such investments </span><span>are subject to investment risk.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Each Fund conducts its securities lending pursuant to an exemptive order from the SEC permitting it to lend portfolio </span><span>securities to borrowers affiliated with the Fund and to retain an affiliate of the Fund to act as securities lending agent. To the </span><span>extent that a Fund engages in securities lending, BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>BTC</span><span>”</span><span>) acts as securities </span><span>lending agent for the Fund, subject to the overall supervision of BFA. BTC administers the lending program in accordance </span><span>with guidelines approved by the Trust's Board of Trustees (the </span><span>“</span><span>Board,</span><span>”</span><span> the trustees of which are the </span><span>“</span><span>Trustees</span><span>”</span><span>). JPMorgan </span><span>Chase Bank, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>JPMorgan</span><span>”</span><span>) serves as custodian for the Funds in connection with certain securities lending activities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Securities lending involves exposure to certain risks, including operational risk (i.e., the risk of losses resulting from problems </span><span>in the settlement and accounting process), </span><span>“</span><span>gap</span><span>”</span><span> risk (i.e., the risk of a mismatch between the return on cash collateral </span><span>reinvestments and the fees a Fund has agreed to pay a borrower), foreign exchange risk (i.e., the risk of a shortfall at default </span><span>when a cash collateral investment is denominated in a currency other than the currency of the assets being loaned due to </span><span>movements in foreign exchange rates), and credit, legal, counterparty and market risks (including the risk that market events, </span><span>including but not limited to corporate actions, could lead the Fund to lend securities that are trading at a premium due to </span><span>increased demand, or to recall loaned securities or to lend less or not at all, which could lead to reduced securities lending </span><span>revenue). If a Fund were to lend out securities that are subject to a corporate action and commit to the borrower a particular </span><span>election as determined by the Funds’ investment adviser, the benefit the Fund would receive in respect of committing to such </span><span>election may or may not be less than the benefit the Fund would have received from making a different election in such </span><span>corporate action. If a securities lending counterparty were to default, a Fund would be subject to the risk of a possible delay </span><span>in receiving collateral or in recovering the loaned securities, or to a possible loss of rights in the collateral. In the event a </span><span>borrower does not return a Fund’s securities as agreed, the Fund’s ability to participate in a corporate action event may be </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>7</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

This latter event could trigger adverse tax consequences for a Fund. A Fund could lose money if its </span><span>short-term investment of the collateral declines in value over the period of the loan. Substitute payments received by a Fund </span><span>representing dividends paid on securities loaned out by the Fund will not be considered qualified dividend income. BTC will </span><span>take into account the tax effects on shareholders caused by this difference in connection with a Fund’s securities lending </span><span>program. Substitute payments received on tax-exempt securities loaned out will not be tax-exempt income. There could also </span><span>be changes in the status of issuers under applicable laws and regulations, including tax regulations, that may impact the </span><span>regulatory or tax treatment of loaned securities and could, for example, result in a delay in the payment of dividend </span><span>equivalent payments owed to a Fund (as permitted by applicable law).</span></div> <div> <div><span>Regulations adopted by global prudential regulators require certain bank-regulated counterparties and certain of their </span><span>affiliates to include in certain financial contracts, including many securities lending agreements, terms that delay or restrict </span><span>the rights of counterparties, such as the Fund, to terminate such agreements, foreclose upon collateral, exercise other default </span><span>rights or restrict transfers of credit support in the event that the counterparty and/or its affiliates are subject to certain types </span><span>of resolution or insolvency proceedings. It is possible that these requirements, as well as potential additional government </span><span>regulation and other developments in the market, could adversely affect the Fund’s ability to terminate existing securities </span><span>lending agreements or to realize amounts to be received under such agreements.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Liquidity Risk Management.</span><span>  </span><span>Rule 22e-4 under the Investment Company Act (the </span><span>“</span><span>Liquidity Rule</span><span>”</span><span>) requires open-end funds, </span><span>including exchange-traded funds (</span><span>“</span><span>ETFs</span><span>”</span><span>) such as the Funds, to establish a liquidity risk management program (the </span><span>“</span><span>Liquidity Program</span><span>”</span><span>) and enhance disclosures regarding fund liquidity. As required by the Liquidity Rule, the Funds have </span><span>implemented a Liquidity Program, and the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees of the Trust, has </span><span>appointed BFA as the administrator of the Liquidity Program. Under the Liquidity Program, BFA assesses, manages, and </span><span>periodically reviews each Fund’s liquidity risk and classifies each investment held by a Fund as a </span><span>“</span><span>highly liquid investment,</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>“</span><span>moderately liquid investment,</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>“</span><span>less liquid investment</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>illiquid investment.</span><span>”</span><span> The Liquidity Rule defines </span><span>“</span><span>liquidity risk</span><span>”</span><span> as </span><span>the risk that a Fund could not meet requests to redeem shares issued by a Fund without significant dilution of the remaining </span><span>investors’ interest in a Fund. The liquidity of a Fund's portfolio investments is determined based on relevant market, trading </span><span>and investment-specific considerations under the Liquidity Program. There are exclusions from certain portions of the </span><span>liquidity risk management program requirements for </span><span>“</span><span>in-kind</span><span>”</span><span> ETFs, as defined in the Liquidity Rule. To the extent that an </span><span>investment is deemed to be an illiquid investment or a less liquid investment, a Fund can expect to be exposed to greater </span><span>liquidity risk.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Non-U.S. Securities.</span><span>  </span><span>Certain Funds purchase publicly traded common stocks of non-U.S. issuers. To the extent a Fund </span><span>invests in stocks of non-U.S. issuers, certain of the Fund's investments in such stocks may be in the form of American </span><span>Depositary Receipts (</span><span>“</span><span>ADRs</span><span>”</span><span>), Global Depositary Receipts (</span><span>“</span><span>GDRs</span><span>”</span><span>) and European Depositary Receipts (</span><span>“</span><span>EDRs</span><span>”</span><span>) (collectively, </span><span>“</span><span>depositary receipts</span><span>”</span><span>). Depositary receipts are receipts, typically issued by a bank or trust issuer, which evidence ownership of </span><span>underlying securities issued by a non-U.S. issuer. Depositary receipts may not necessarily be denominated in the same </span><span>currency as their underlying securities. ADRs typically are issued by a U.S. bank or trust company and evidence ownership of </span><span>underlying securities issued by a non-U.S. issuer. EDRs, which are sometimes referred to as continental depositary receipts, </span><span>are receipts issued in Europe, typically by foreign banks and trust companies, that evidence ownership of either foreign or </span><span>domestic underlying securities. GDRs are depositary receipts structured like global debt issues to facilitate trading on an </span><span>international basis. Generally, ADRs, issued in registered form, are designed for use in the U.S. securities markets, and EDRs, </span><span>issued in bearer form, are designed for use in European securities markets. GDRs are tradable both in the U.S. and in Europe </span><span>and are designed for use throughout the world.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Depositary receipts are generally subject to the same risks as the foreign securities that they evidence or into which they may </span><span>be converted. In addition to investment risks associated with the underlying issuer, depositary receipts expose a Fund to </span><span>additional risks associated with the non-uniform terms that apply to depositary receipt programs, credit exposure to the </span><span>depository bank and to the sponsors and other parties with whom the depository bank establishes the programs, currency </span><span>risk and liquidity risk. Unsponsored programs, which are not sanctioned by the issuer of the underlying common stock, </span><span>generally expose investors to greater risks than sponsored programs and do not provide holders with many of the </span><span>shareholder benefits that come from investing in a sponsored depositary receipts.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investing in the securities of non-U.S. issuers involves special risks and considerations not typically associated with investing </span><span>in U.S. issuers. These include differences in accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards; the possibility of </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>expropriation or confiscatory taxation; adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations; political instability, </span><span>which could affect U.S. investments in non-U.S. countries; and potential restrictions on the flow of international capital. Non-U.S.</span><span> issuers may be subject to less governmental regulation than U.S. issuers. Moreover, individual non-U.S. economies may </span><span>differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy in such respects as growth of gross domestic product (</span><span>“</span><span>GDP</span><span>”</span><span>), rate of </span><span>inflation, capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency and balance of payment positions.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Regulation Regarding Derivatives.</span><span>  </span><span>The CFTC subjects advisers to registered investment companies to regulation by the </span><span>CFTC if a fund that is advised by the adviser either (i) invests, directly or indirectly, more than a prescribed level of its </span><span>liquidation value in CFTC-regulated futures, options and swaps</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>CFTC Derivatives</span><span>”</span><span>) or (ii) markets itself as providing </span><span>investment exposure to such instruments. The CFTC also subjects advisers to registered investment companies to regulation </span><span>by the CFTC if the registered investment company invests in one or more commodity pools.

Rule 18f-4, among other things, requires a Fund to adopt and implement a </span><span>comprehensive written derivatives risk management program (</span><span>“</span><span>DRMP</span><span>”</span><span>) and comply with a relative or absolute limit on Fund </span><span>leverage risk calculated based on value-at-risk (</span><span>“</span><span>VaR</span><span>”</span><span>). The DRMP is administered by a </span><span>“</span><span>derivatives risk manager,</span><span>”</span><span> who is </span><span>appointed by the Board, including a majority of Independent Directors/Trustees, and periodically reviews the DRMP and </span><span>reports to the Board.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Rule 18f-4 provides an exception from the DRMP, VaR limit and certain other requirements if a Fund's </span><span>“</span><span>derivatives exposure</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>(as defined in Rule 18f-4) is limited to 10% of its net assets (as calculated in accordance with Rule 18f-4) and the Fund </span><span>adopts and implements written policies and procedures reasonably designed to manage its derivatives risks (the </span><span>“</span><span>Limited </span><span>Derivatives User Exception</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Repurchase Agreements.</span><span>  </span><span>A repurchase agreement is an instrument under which the purchaser (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, a Fund) acquires a </span><span>security and the seller agrees, at the time of the sale, to repurchase the security at a mutually agreed-upon time and price, </span><span>thereby determining the yield during the purchaser’s holding period. Repurchase agreements may be construed to be </span><span>collateralized loans by the purchaser to the seller secured by the securities transferred to the purchaser. If a repurchase </span><span>agreement is construed to be a collateralized loan, the underlying securities will not be considered to be owned by a Fund but </span><span>only to constitute collateral for the seller’s obligation to pay the repurchase price, and, in the event of a default by the seller, </span><span>the Fund may suffer time delays and incur costs or losses in connection with the disposition of the collateral.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In any repurchase transaction, the collateral for a repurchase agreement may include: (i) cash items; (ii) obligations issued by </span><span>the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities; or (iii) obligations that, at the time the repurchase agreement is </span><span>entered into, are determined to (A) have exceptionally strong capacity to meet their financial obligations and (B) are </span><span>sufficiently liquid such that they can be sold at approximately their carrying value in the ordinary course of business within </span><span>seven days.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Repurchase agreements pose certain risks for a Fund that utilizes them. Such risks are not unique to the Funds, but are </span><span>inherent in repurchase agreements. The Funds seek to minimize such risks, but because of the inherent legal uncertainties </span><span>involved in repurchase agreements, such risks cannot be eliminated. Lower quality collateral and collateral with a longer </span><span>maturity may be subject to greater price fluctuations than higher quality collateral and collateral with a shorter maturity. If </span><span>the repurchase agreement counterparty were to default, lower quality collateral may be more difficult to liquidate than higher </span><span>quality collateral. Should the counterparty default and the amount of collateral not be sufficient to cover the counterparty’s </span><span>repurchase obligation, a Fund would likely retain the status of an unsecured creditor of the counterparty (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the position a </span><span>Fund would normally be in if it were to hold, pursuant to its investment policies, other unsecured debt securities of the </span><span>defaulting counterparty) with respect to the amount of the shortfall. As an unsecured creditor, a Fund would be at risk of </span><span>losing some or all of the principal and income involved in the transaction.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Reverse Repurchase Agreements.</span><span>  </span><span>Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities with an agreement to </span><span>repurchase the securities at an agreed-upon price, date and interest payment and have the characteristics of borrowing. </span><span>Generally, the effect of such transactions is that a Fund can recover all or most of the cash invested in the portfolio securities </span><span>involved during the term of the reverse repurchase agreement, while in many cases the Fund is able to keep some of the </span><span>interest income associated with those securities. Such transactions are advantageous only if a Fund has an opportunity to </span><span>earn a rate of interest on the cash derived from these transactions that is greater than the interest cost of obtaining the same </span><span>amount of cash. Opportunities to realize earnings from the use of the proceeds equal to or greater than the interest required </span><span>to be paid may not always be available, and a Fund intends to use the reverse repurchase technique only when BFA believes it </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The use of reverse repurchase agreements may exaggerate any increase or decrease in the </span><span>value of a Fund’s assets. The use of reverse repurchase agreements is a form of leverage, and the proceeds obtained by a </span><span>Fund through reverse repurchase agreements may be invested in additional securities.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Rule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act permits a Fund to enter into reverse repurchase agreements and similar </span><span>financing transactions (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> recourse and non-recourse tender option bonds, borrowed bonds) notwithstanding the </span><span>limitation on the issuance of senior securities in Section 18 of the Investment Company Act, provided that a Fund either (i) </span><span>complies with the 300% asset coverage ratio with respect to such transactions and any other borrowings in the aggregate, or </span><span>(ii) treats such transactions as Derivatives Transactions under Rule 18f-4. (See </span><span>“</span><span>Regulation Regarding Derivatives</span><span>”</span><span> above.)</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Securities of Investment Companies.</span><span>  </span><span>Each Fund may invest in the securities of other investment companies (including </span><span>money market funds) to the extent permitted by law. Pursuant to the 1940 Act, a Fund’s investment in registered investment </span><span>companies is generally limited to, subject to certain exceptions: (i) 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of any one </span><span>investment company; (ii) 5% of a Fund’s total assets with respect to any one investment company; and (iii) 10% of a Fund’s </span><span>total assets with respect to investment companies in the aggregate. To the extent allowed by law or regulation, each Fund </span><span>intends from time to time to invest its assets in the securities of investment companies, including, but not limited to, money </span><span>market funds, including those advised by or otherwise affiliated with BFA, in excess of the general limits discussed above. </span><span>Other investment companies in which a Fund may invest can be expected to incur fees and expenses for operations, such as </span><span>investment advisory and administration fees, which would be in addition to those incurred by the Fund. Pursuant to guidance </span><span>issued by the SEC staff, fees and expenses of money market funds used for cash collateral received in connection with loans </span><span>of securities are not treated as Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, which reflect a Fund’s </span><span>pro rata</span><span> share of the fees and </span><span>expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies (as disclosed in the Prospectus, as applicable).</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Short-Term Instruments and Temporary Investments.</span><span>  </span><span>Each Fund may invest in short-term instruments, including money </span><span>market instruments, on an ongoing basis to provide liquidity or for other reasons. Money market instruments are generally </span><span>short-term investments that may include, but are not limited to: (i) shares of money market funds (including those advised </span><span>by BFA or otherwise affiliated with BFA); (ii) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or </span><span>instrumentalities (including government-sponsored enterprises); (iii) negotiable certificates of deposit (</span><span>“</span><span>CDs</span><span>”</span><span>), bankers’ </span><span>acceptances, fixed-time deposits and other obligations of U.S. and non-U.S. banks (including non-U.S. branches) and similar </span><span>institutions; (iv) commercial paper rated, at the date of purchase, </span><span>“</span><span>Prime-1</span><span>”</span><span> by Moody's</span><span>®</span><span> Investors Service, Inc., </span><span>“</span><span>F-1</span><span>”</span><span> by </span><span>Fitch Ratings, Inc., or </span><span>“</span><span>A-1</span><span>”</span><span> by Standard &amp; Poor's</span><span>®</span><span> Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of S&amp;P Global, Inc. (S&amp;P Global </span><span>Ratings), or if unrated, of comparable quality as determined by BFA; (v) non-convertible corporate debt securities (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, bonds </span><span>and debentures) with remaining maturities at the date of purchase of not more than 397 days and that have been </span><span>determined to present minimal credit risks, in accordance with the requirements set forth in Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act; </span><span>(vi) repurchase agreements; and (vii) short-term U.S. dollar-denominated obligations of non-U.S. banks (including U.S. </span><span>branches) that, in the opinion of BFA, are of comparable quality to obligations of U.S. banks that may be purchased by a </span><span>Fund. Any of these instruments may be purchased on a current or forward-settled basis. Time deposits are non-negotiable </span><span>deposits maintained in banking institutions for specified periods of time at stated interest rates. Bankers’ acceptances are </span><span>time drafts drawn on commercial banks by borrowers, usually in connection with international transactions.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Swap Agreements.</span><span>  </span><span>Swap agreements are contracts between parties in which one party agrees to make periodic payments to </span><span>the other party based on a pre-determined underlying investment or notional amount. In return, the other party agrees to </span><span>make periodic payments to the first party based on the return (or a differential in rate of return) earned or realized on the </span><span>underlying investment or notional amount. Swap agreements will usually be performed on a net basis, with a Fund receiving </span><span>or paying only the net amount of the two payments. The net amount of the excess, if any, of a Fund’s obligations over its </span><span>entitlements with respect to each swap is accrued on a daily basis.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain of the Funds may enter into swap agreements, including currency swaps, interest rate swaps and index swaps, or for </span><span>the iShares Core S&amp;P Mid-Cap ETF, iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF, iShares ESG Screened S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF, iShares S&amp;P </span><span>Mid-Cap 400 Growth ETF, iShares S&amp;P Mid-Cap 400 Value ETF, iShares S&amp;P Small-Cap 600 Growth ETF, iShares S&amp;P Small-Cap</span><span> 600 Value ETF and iShares U.S. Infrastructure ETF, total return swaps (some of which may be referred to as contracts for </span><span>difference or </span><span>“</span><span>CFDs</span><span>”</span><span>). The use of swaps is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different </span><span>from those associated with ordinary portfolio security transactions. These transactions generally do not involve the delivery </span><span>of securities or other underlying assets.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The </span><span>tracking stock may pay dividends to shareholders independent of the parent company. The parent company, rather than the </span><span>business unit or division, generally is the issuer of tracking stock. However, holders of the tracking stock may not have the </span><span>same rights as holders of the company’s common stock.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Future Developments.</span><span>  </span><span>The Board may, in the future, authorize each Fund to invest in securities contracts and investments, </span><span>other than those listed in this SAI and in the applicable Prospectus, provided they are consistent with each Fund's investment </span><span>objective and do not violate any of its investment restrictions or policies.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>General Considerations and Risks</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A discussion of some of the principal risks associated with an investment in a Fund is contained in the applicable Prospectus.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>An investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding that the value of the Fund’s portfolio</span><span> </span><span>securities may </span><span>fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the issuers of the portfolio securities, the value of preferred </span><span>or common stocks in general, and other factors that affect the market. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate </span><span>the significance of any particular risk factor.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Borrowing Risk. </span><span> </span><span>Borrowing may exaggerate changes in the NAV of Fund shares and in the return on a Fund’s portfolio. </span><span>Borrowing will cause a Fund to incur interest expense and other fees. The costs of borrowing may reduce a Fund’s return. </span><span>Borrowing may cause a Fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Custody Risk. </span><span> </span><span>Custody risk refers to the risks inherent in the process of clearing and settling trades and to the holding of </span><span>securities, cash and other assets by local banks, agents and depositories. Low trading volumes and volatile prices in less </span><span>developed markets make trades harder to complete and settle, and governments or trade groups may compel local agents to </span><span>hold securities in designated depositories that may not be subject to independent evaluation. Local agents are held only to </span><span>the standards of care of their local markets, and thus may be subject to limited or no government oversight. Communications </span><span>between the U.S. and emerging market countries may be unreliable, increasing the risk of delayed settlements or losses of </span><span>security certificates. In general, the less developed a country’s securities market is, the greater the likelihood of custody </span><span>problems. Practices in relation to the settlement of securities transactions in emerging markets involve higher risks than </span><span>those in developed markets, in part because of the use of brokers and counterparties that are often less well capitalized, and </span><span>custody and registration of assets in some countries may be unreliable. The possibility of fraud, negligence or undue </span><span>influence being exerted by the issuer or refusal to recognize ownership exists in some emerging markets, and, along with </span><span>other factors, could result in ownership registration being lost. In addition, the laws of certain countries may put limits on a </span><span>Fund’s ability to recover its assets if a foreign bank or depository or issuer of a security or an agent of any of the foregoing </span><span>goes bankrupt. A Fund would absorb any loss resulting from such custody problems and may have no successful claim for </span><span>compensation.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Dividend-Paying Stock Risk. </span><span> </span><span>Investing in dividend-paying stocks involves the risk that such stocks may fall out of favor with </span><span>investors and underperform the broader market. Companies that issue dividend-paying stocks are not required to pay or </span><span>continue paying dividends on such stocks. It is possible that issuers of the stocks held by a Fund will not declare dividends in </span><span>the future or will reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends (including reducing or eliminating anticipated accelerations or </span><span>increases in the payment of dividends) in the future.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Illiquid Investments Risk.</span><span>  </span><span>Each Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, immediately after the acquisition, the Fund </span><span>would have invested more than 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that a </span><span>Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less without </span><span>significantly changing the market value of the investment. The liquidity of an investment will be determined based on </span><span>relevant market, trading and investment specific considerations as set out in the Liquidity Program as required by the </span><span>Liquidity Rule. Illiquid investments may trade at a discount to comparable, more liquid investments and a Fund may not be </span><span>able to dispose of illiquid investments in a timely fashion or at their expected prices. If illiquid investments exceed 15% of a </span><span>Fund’s net assets, the Liquidity Rule and the Liquidity Program will require that certain remedial actions be taken.</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>12</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>LIBOR Replacement Risk. </span><span> </span><span>A Fund may be exposed to financial instruments that are tied to the London Interbank Offered </span><span>Rate (</span><span>“</span><span>LIBOR</span><span>”</span><span>) to determine payment obligations, financing terms, hedging strategies or investment value. The United </span><span>Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that a majority of USD LIBOR settings will no </span><span>longer be published after June 30, 2023. All other LIBOR settings and certain other interbank offered rates ceased to be </span><span>published after December 31, 2021. The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (</span><span>“</span><span>SOFR</span><span>”</span><span>), which is a broad measure of the cost of </span><span>borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities in the repurchase agreement market, has been used </span><span>increasingly on a voluntary basis in new instruments and transactions. Under U.S. regulations that implement a statutory </span><span>fallback mechanism to replace LIBOR, benchmark rates based on SOFR will replace LIBOR in different categories of financial </span><span>contracts after June 30, 2023.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Neither the effect of the LIBOR transition process nor its ultimate success can yet be known. While some existing LIBOR-based</span><span> instruments may contemplate a scenario where LIBOR is no longer available by providing for an alternative rate-setting </span><span>methodology, there may be significant uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of any such alternative methodologies to </span><span>replicate LIBOR. Not all existing LIBOR-based instruments may have alternative rate-setting provisions and there remains </span><span>uncertainty regarding the willingness and ability of issuers to add alternative rate-setting provisions in certain existing </span><span>instruments. Parties to contracts, securities, or other instruments using LIBOR may disagree on transition rates or the </span><span>application of transition regulation, potentially resulting in uncertainty of performance and the possibility of litigation. A Fund </span><span>may have instruments linked to other interbank offered rates that may also cease to be published in the future.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Money Market Instruments Risk. </span><span> </span><span>A Fund may hold money market instruments. The value of money market instruments </span><span>may be affected by changes in interest rates or in the credit ratings of the investments, among other things. If a significant </span><span>amount of a Fund's assets is invested in money market instruments, it may be more difficult for the Fund to achieve its </span><span>investment objective. An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance </span><span>Corporation or any other government agency. It is possible to lose money by investing in a money market fund. Money </span><span>market funds other than U.S. government money market funds and retail money market funds </span><span>“</span><span>float</span><span>”</span><span> their NAV instead of </span><span>using a stable $1.00 per share price.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>National Closed Market Trading Risk. </span><span> </span><span>To the extent that the underlying securities held by a Fund trade on foreign exchanges </span><span>or in foreign markets that are closed when the securities exchange on which a Fund’s shares trade is open, there are likely to </span><span>be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security </span><span>(</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, a Fund’s quote from the closed foreign market). The impact of a closed foreign market on a Fund is likely to be greater </span><span>where a large portion of a Fund’s underlying securities and/or other assets trade on that closed foreign market or when the </span><span>foreign market is closed for unscheduled reasons. These deviations may result in premiums or discounts to a Fund’s NAV </span><span>that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Operational Risk.</span><span>  </span><span>BFA and a Fund's other service providers may experience disruptions or operating errors such as </span><span>processing errors or human errors, inadequate or failed internal or external processes, or systems or technology failures, that </span><span>could negatively impact the Funds. While service providers are required to have appropriate operational risk management </span><span>policies and procedures, their methods of operational risk management may differ from a Fund’s in the setting of priorities, </span><span>the personnel and resources available or the effectiveness of relevant controls. BFA, through its monitoring and oversight of </span><span>service providers, seeks to ensure that service providers take appropriate precautions to avoid and mitigate risks that could </span><span>lead to disruptions and operating errors. However, it is not possible for BFA or the other Fund service providers to identify all </span><span>of the operational risks that may affect a Fund or to develop processes and controls to completely eliminate or mitigate their </span><span>occurrence or effects.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Derivatives.</span><span>  </span><span>A derivative is a financial contract, the value of which depends on, or is derived from, the value of an </span><span>underlying asset, such as a security, a commodity (such as gold or silver), a currency or an index (a measure of value or rates, </span><span>such as the S&amp;P 500</span><span>®</span><span> or the prime lending rate). A Fund may invest in futures contracts, securities options, CFDs (for the </span><span>iShares Core S&amp;P Mid-Cap ETF, iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF, iShares ESG Screened S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF, iShares S&amp;P Mid-Cap</span><span> 400 Growth ETF, iShares S&amp;P Mid-Cap 400 Value ETF, iShares S&amp;P Small-Cap 600 Growth ETF, iShares S&amp;P Small-Cap </span><span>600 Value ETF and iShares U.S. Infrastructure ETF) and other derivatives. Compared to securities, derivatives can be more </span><span>sensitive to changes in interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in market prices and thus a Fund’s losses may be greater if it </span><span>invests in derivatives than if it invests only in conventional securities. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which </span><span>is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligations. Derivatives generally involve the </span><span>incurrence of leverage.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>13</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>When a derivative is used as a hedge against a position that a Fund holds or is committed to purchase, any loss generated by </span><span>the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can </span><span>reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains, and in some cases, hedging can cause losses that are not </span><span>offset by gains, and the Fund will recognize losses on both the investment and the hedge. Hedges are sometimes subject to </span><span>imperfect matching between the derivative and the underlying security, and there can be no assurance that a Fund's hedging </span><span>transactions, which entail additional transaction costs, will be effective.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Equity Securities.</span><span>  </span><span>An investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding of the risks inherent in an </span><span>investment in equity securities, including the risk that the financial condition of issuers may become impaired or that the </span><span>general condition of stock markets may deteriorate (either of which may cause a decrease in the value of the portfolio </span><span>securities and thus in the value of shares of the Fund). Common stocks are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations </span><span>and to increases and decreases in value as market confidence and perceptions of their issuers change. These investor </span><span>perceptions are based on various and unpredictable factors, including expectations regarding government, economic, </span><span>monetary and fiscal policies, inflation and interest rates, economic expansion or contraction, and global or regional political, </span><span>economic or banking crises. Common stocks may experience extreme price volatility due to actions taken by particular </span><span>investors or groups of investors (for example, retail investors influenced by social media activity or other media coverage or </span><span>significant </span><span>“</span><span>short</span><span>”</span><span> positions taken by institutional investors).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Holders of common stocks incur more risks than holders of preferred stocks and debt obligations because common </span><span>stockholders generally have rights to receive payments from stock issuers that are inferior to the rights of creditors, or </span><span>holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks. Further, unlike debt securities, which typically have a stated principal amount </span><span>payable at maturity (the value of which, however, is subject to market fluctuations prior to maturity), or preferred stocks, </span><span>which typically have a liquidation preference and which may have stated optional or mandatory redemption provisions, </span><span>common stocks have neither a fixed principal amount nor a maturity date. In addition, issuers may, in times of distress or at </span><span>their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock price to decline.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF invests a significant portion of its assets in preferred stock, although all of </span><span>the Funds may invest in preferred stock. A Fund that invests in preferred stock may be exposed to certain risks not typically </span><span>encountered by investing in common stock. Many preferred stocks pay dividends at a fixed rate, therefore, a preferred stock’s </span><span>market price may be sensitive to changes in interest rates in a manner similar to bonds — that is, as interest rates rise, the </span><span>value of the preferred stock is likely to decline. Many preferred stocks also allow holders to convert the preferred stock into </span><span>common stock of the issuer; the market price of such preferred stocks may be sensitive to changes in the value of the </span><span>issuer’s common stock. In addition, the ability of an issuer of preferred stock to pay dividends may deteriorate or the issuer </span><span>may default (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, fail to make scheduled dividend payments on the preferred stock or scheduled interest payments on other </span><span>obligations of the issuer), which would negatively affect the value of any such holding. Dividend payments on a preferred </span><span>stock typically must be declared by the issuer’s board of directors. An issuer’s board of directors is generally not under any </span><span>obligation to pay a dividend (even if such dividends have accrued), and may suspend payment of dividends on preferred </span><span>stock at any time. Preferred stock is also subject to market volatility and the price of preferred stock will fluctuate based on </span><span>market demand. Preferred stock often has a call feature which allows the issuer to redeem the security at its discretion. </span><span>Therefore, preferred stocks having a higher than average yield may be called by the issuer, which may cause a decrease in the </span><span>yield of a Fund that invested in the preferred stock.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Although most of the securities in each Underlying Index are listed on a securities exchange, the principal trading market for </span><span>some of the securities may be in the OTC market. The existence of a liquid trading market for certain securities may depend </span><span>on whether dealers will make a market in such securities. There can be no assurance that a market will be made or </span><span>maintained or that any such market will be or remain liquid. The price at which securities may be sold and the value of a </span><span>Fund’s shares will be adversely affected if trading markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities are limited or absent, or if </span><span>bid/ask spreads are wide.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Futures and Options on Futures Transactions.</span><span>  </span><span>There are several risks accompanying the utilization of futures </span><span>contracts and options on futures contracts. A position in futures contracts and options on futures contracts may be closed </span><span>only on the exchange on which the contract was made (or a linked exchange). While each Fund plans to utilize futures </span><span>contracts only if an active market exists for such contracts, there is no guarantee that a liquid market will exist for the </span><span>contract at a specified time. Futures contracts, by definition, project price levels in the future and not current levels of </span><span>valuation; therefore, market circumstances may result in a discrepancy between the price of the future and the movement in </span><span>a Fund's Underlying Index. In the event of adverse price movements, a Fund would continue to be required to make daily </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>cash payments to maintain its required margin. In such situations, if a Fund has insufficient cash, it may have to sell portfolio </span><span>securities to meet daily margin requirements at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. In addition, a Fund may be </span><span>required to deliver the instruments underlying the futures contracts it has sold.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The risk of loss in trading futures contracts or uncovered call options in some strategies (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, selling uncovered stock index </span><span>futures contracts) is potentially unlimited. The Funds do not plan to use futures and options contracts in this way. The risk of </span><span>a futures position may still be large as traditionally measured due to the low margin deposits required. In many cases, a </span><span>relatively small price movement in a futures contract may result in immediate and substantial loss or gain to the investor </span><span>relative to the size of a required margin deposit. The Funds, however, intend to utilize futures and options contracts in a </span><span>manner designed to limit their risk exposure to levels comparable to a direct investment in the types of stocks in which they </span><span>invest.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Utilization of futures and options on futures by a Fund involves the risk of imperfect or even negative correlation to its </span><span>Underlying Index if the index underlying the futures contract differs from the Underlying Index. There is also the risk of loss of </span><span>margin deposits in the event of bankruptcy of a broker with whom a Fund has an open position in the futures contract or </span><span>option. The purchase of put or call options will be based upon predictions by BFA as to anticipated trends, which predictions </span><span>could prove to be incorrect.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Because the futures market generally imposes less burdensome margin requirements than the securities market, an </span><span>increased amount of participation by speculators in the futures market could result in price fluctuations. Certain financial </span><span>futures exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures contract prices during a single trading day. The daily </span><span>limit establishes the maximum amount by which the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the </span><span>previous day’s settlement price at the end of a trading session. Once the daily limit has been reached in a particular type of </span><span>contract, no trades may be made on that day at a price beyond that limit. It is possible that futures contract prices could </span><span>move to the daily limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading, thereby preventing prompt liquidation of </span><span>futures positions and subjecting each Fund to substantial losses. In the event of adverse price movements, each Fund would </span><span>be required to make daily cash payments of variation margin.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Non-U.S. Equity Securities. </span><span> </span><span>An investment in any of the Funds that invest, directly or indirectly, in non-U.S.</span><span> equity securities involves risks similar to those of investing in portfolios of equity securities traded on non-U.S. </span><span>exchanges. These risks include market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic and political developments in those </span><span>foreign countries, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in stock prices. Investing in securities issued by issuers </span><span>domiciled in countries other than the domicile of the investor and denominated in currencies other than an investor’s local </span><span>currency entails certain considerations and risks not typically encountered by the investor in making investments in its home </span><span>country and in that country’s currency. These considerations include favorable or unfavorable changes in interest rates, </span><span>currency exchange rates, exchange control regulations and the costs that may be incurred in connection with conversions </span><span>between various currencies. Investing in any of these Funds also involves certain risks and considerations not typically </span><span>associated with investing in a fund whose portfolio contains exclusively securities of U.S. issuers. These risks include </span><span>generally less liquid and less efficient securities markets; generally greater price volatility; less publicly available information </span><span>about issuers; the imposition of withholding or other taxes; the imposition of restrictions on the expatriation of funds or </span><span>other assets of the Funds; higher transaction and custody costs; delays and risks attendant in settlement procedures; </span><span>difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations; lower liquidity and significantly smaller market capitalization; different </span><span>accounting and disclosure standards; lower levels of regulation of the securities markets; more substantial government </span><span>interference with the economy and businesses; higher rates of inflation; greater social, economic, and political uncertainty; </span><span>the risk of nationalization or expropriation of assets; and the risk of war.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Mid-Capitalization Companies.</span><span>  </span><span>Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile than </span><span>those of large-capitalization companies, and, therefore, a Fund’s share price may be more volatile than that of funds that </span><span>invest a larger percentage of their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of mid-capitalization </span><span>companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business or economic </span><span>developments, and the stocks of mid-capitalization companies may be less liquid than those of large-capitalization </span><span>companies, making it more difficult for the Funds to buy and sell shares of mid-capitalization companies. In addition, mid-capitalization</span><span> companies generally have less diverse product lines than large-capitalization companies and are more </span><span>susceptible to adverse developments related to their products.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>15</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Non-U.S. Preferred Stock. </span><span> </span><span>A Fund that invests in preferred stock may be exposed to certain risks not typically </span><span>encountered by investing in common stock. Many preferred stocks pay dividends at a fixed rate, therefore, a preferred stock’s </span><span>market price may be sensitive to changes in interest rates in a manner similar to bonds — that is, as interest rates rise, the </span><span>value of the preferred stock is likely to decline. Many preferred stocks also allow holders to convert the preferred stock into </span><span>common stock of the issuer; the market price of such preferred stocks can be sensitive to changes in the value of the issuer’s </span><span>common stock. In addition, the ability of an issuer of preferred stock to pay dividends may deteriorate or the issuer may </span><span>default (</span><span>i.e</span><span>., fail to make scheduled dividend payments on the preferred stock or scheduled interest payments on other </span><span>obligations of the issuer), which would negatively affect the value of any such holding. Dividend payments on a preferred </span><span>stock typically must be declared by the issuer’s board of directors. An issuer’s board of directors is generally not under any </span><span>obligation to pay a dividend (even if such dividends have accrued), and may suspend payment of dividends on preferred </span><span>stock at any time. Preferred stock is also subject to market volatility and the price of preferred stock will fluctuate based on </span><span>market demand. Preferred stock often has a call feature which allows the issuer to redeem the security at its discretion. </span><span>Therefore, preferred stocks having a higher than average yield may be called by the issuer, which may cause a decrease in the </span><span>yield of a fund that invested in the preferred stock. Also, non U.S. preferred stock may have different rights or privileges than </span><span>those commonly associated with U.S. preferred stock. In addition to the risks listed above, investors in non U.S. preferred </span><span>stock may experience difficulty or uncertainty in determining and enforcing their rights related to preferred stock.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Swap Agreements.</span><span>  </span><span>The risk of loss with respect to swaps is generally limited to the net amount of payments that a </span><span>Fund is contractually obligated to make. Swap agreements are subject to the risk that the swap counterparty will default on </span><span>its obligations</span><span> </span><span>to pay a Fund and the risk that a Fund will not be able to meet its obligations to pay the other party to the </span><span>agreement. If such a default occurs, the parties will have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the </span><span>transaction. However, such remedies may be subject to bankruptcy and insolvency laws, which could affect such Fund’s </span><span>rights as a creditor (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, a Fund may not receive the net amount of payments that it is contractually entitled to receive). Swap </span><span>agreements may also involve the risk that there is an imperfect correlation between the return on the Fund’s obligation to its </span><span>counterparty and the return on the referenced asset. In addition, swap agreements are subject to market and liquidity risk, </span><span>leverage risk and hedging risk.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A Fund is required to post and collect variation margin and initial margin (comprised of specified liquid securities subject to </span><span>haircuts) in connection with trading of OTC swaps. These requirements may raise the costs for a Fund’s investment in swaps.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Tracking Error Risk.</span><span>  </span><span>A Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of a Fund’s performance from that of </span><span>the applicable underlying index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities and other </span><span>instruments held in a Fund’s portfolio and those included in its applicable underlying index, pricing differences, transaction </span><span>costs incurred by a Fund, a Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of </span><span>dividends or interest received by a Fund or distributions paid to a Fund’s shareholders, the requirements to maintain pass-through</span><span> tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, </span><span>acceptance of custom baskets, changes to the applicable underlying index or the costs to a Fund of complying with various </span><span>new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other </span><span>unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because a Fund incurs fees and expenses, while its applicable </span><span>underlying index does not. Tracking error may occur due to differences between the methodologies used in calculating the </span><span>value of the applicable Underlying Index and determining a Fund’s NAV.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When an issuer is introduced by an index provider into an index tracked by a Fund, BFA may conduct an analysis on such </span><span>issuer’s securities to identify and screen for outlier high risk behavior (such as rapid or unusual price growth that does not </span><span>appear to be supported by publicly available information on the business and assets of the issuer, unusual or significant short </span><span>interest or lending activity, negative sentiment, suspended trading or incorrect free-float calculations, which could be </span><span>indicators of possible irregularities, miscalculations or even fraud). If it identifies such behavior, BFA may, where appropriate, </span><span>alert the index provider as to the alleged issue. The index provider has sole discretion for the determination as to whether to </span><span>continue to include the issuer’s securities in the rebalancing of its index. If the securities continue to be included in the index, </span><span>BFA may underweight or exclude such securities from a Fund’s portfolio and, if it does so, such a fund will be subject to </span><span>increased tracking error due to the divergence in the securities included in its portfolio from its underlying index. BFA’s </span><span>underweighting or excluding such securities may result in a decline in a Fund’s net asset value. The application of the </span><span>abovementioned analysis and screening to a Fund and its Underlying Index is in the sole discretion of BFA and its affiliates </span><span>(without any guarantees). The analysis and screening may not exclude any or all high risk securities from an Underlying </span><span>Index or a Fund’s portfolio, and the inclusion of such securities will result in an adverse impact to a Fund’s net asset value if </span><span>one or more such securities declines in value.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>16</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Asia.</span><span>  </span><span> Investments in securities of issuers in certain Asian countries involve risks not typically associated </span><span>with investments in securities of issuers in other regions. Such heightened risks</span><span> </span><span>include, among others, expropriation and/or </span><span>nationalization of assets, confiscatory taxation, piracy of intellectual property, data and other security breaches (especially of </span><span>data stored electronically), political instability, including authoritarian and/or military involvement in governmental decision-making,</span><span> armed conflict and social instability as a result of religious, ethnic and/or socio-economic unrest. Certain Asian </span><span>economies have experienced rapid rates of economic growth and industrialization in recent years, and there is no assurance </span><span>that these rates of economic growth and industrialization will be maintained.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Certain Asian countries have democracies with relatively short histories, which may increase the risk of political instability. </span><span>These countries have faced political and military unrest, and further unrest could present a risk to their local economies and </span><span>securities markets. Indonesia and the Philippines have each experienced violence and terrorism, which has negatively </span><span>impacted their economies. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial military capabilities, and historical tensions </span><span>between the two countries present the risk of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of </span><span>hostilities between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on </span><span>the entire Asian region. Certain Asian countries have also developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if </span><span>these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. Political, religious, and </span><span>border disputes persist in India. India has recently experienced and may continue to experience civil unrest and hostilities </span><span>with certain of its neighboring countries. Increased political and social unrest in these geographic areas could adversely affect </span><span>the performance of investments in this region.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain governments in this region administer prices on several basic goods, including fuel and electricity, within their </span><span>respective countries. Certain governments may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector in their </span><span>respective countries and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on </span><span>the economic conditions in this region, which in turn could have a negative impact on private sector companies. There is also </span><span>the possibility of diplomatic developments adversely affecting investments in the region.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Corruption and the perceived lack of a rule of law in dealings with international companies in certain Asian countries may </span><span>discourage foreign investment and could negatively impact the long-term growth of certain economies in this region. In </span><span>addition, certain countries in the region are experiencing high unemployment and corruption, and have fragile banking </span><span>sectors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Some economies in this region are dependent on a range of commodities, including oil, natural gas and coal. Accordingly, </span><span>they are strongly affected by international commodity prices and particularly vulnerable to any weakening in global demand </span><span>for these products. The market for securities in this region may also be directly influenced by the flow of international capital, </span><span>and by the economic and market conditions of neighboring countries. China is a key trading partner of many Asian countries </span><span>and any changes in trading relationships between China and other Asian countries may affect the region as a whole. Adverse </span><span>economic conditions or developments in neighboring countries may increase investors' perception of the risk of investing in </span><span>the region as a whole, which may adversely impact the market value of the securities issued by companies in the region.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Australasia. </span><span> </span><span>The economies of Australasia, which include Australia and New Zealand, are dependent on </span><span>exports from the agricultural and mining sectors. This makes Australasian economies susceptible to fluctuations in the </span><span>commodity markets. Australasian economies are also increasingly dependent on their growing service industries. Australia </span><span>and New Zealand are located in a part of the world that has historically been prone to natural disasters, such as drought and </span><span>flooding. Any such event in the future could have a significant adverse impact on the economies of Australia and New </span><span>Zealand and affect the value of securities held by a Fund. The economies of Australia and New Zealand are dependent on </span><span>trading with certain key trading partners, including Asia and the U.S. Economic events in the U.S., Asia, or in other key trading </span><span>countries can have a significant economic effect on the Australasian economies. The economies of Australia and New </span><span>Zealand are heavily dependent on the mining sector. Passage of new regulations limiting foreign ownership of companies in </span><span>the mining sector or imposition of new taxes on profits of mining companies may dissuade foreign investment, and as a </span><span>result, have a negative impact on companies to which a Fund has exposure.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Canada. </span><span> </span><span>The U.S. is Canada’s largest trading and investment partner, and the Canadian economy is </span><span>significantly affected by developments in the U.S. economy. Since the implementation of the North American Free Trade </span><span>Agreement (</span><span>“</span><span>NAFTA</span><span>”</span><span>) in 1994 among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, total two-way merchandise trade between the U.S. and </span><span>Canada has more than doubled. Any downturn in U.S. or Mexican economic activity is likely to have an adverse impact on the </span><span>Canadian economy. Political developments, including the implementation of tariffs by the U.S. and the renegotiation of </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>17</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>NAFTA in the form of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (</span><span>“</span><span>USMCA</span><span>”</span><span>), which replaced NAFTA on or around July 1, </span><span>2020, could have an adverse impact on Canadian securities. The Canadian economy is also dependent upon external trade </span><span>with other key trading partners, specifically China and the United Kingdom</span><span> </span><span>(the </span><span>“</span><span>U.K.</span><span>”</span><span>). As a result, Canada is dependent on </span><span>the economies of these other countries. In addition, Canada is a large supplier of natural resources (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, oil, natural gas and </span><span>agricultural products). As a result, the Canadian economy is sensitive to fluctuations in certain commodity prices.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. </span><span> </span><span>Many countries with developed markets have recently experienced significant </span><span>economic pressures. These countries generally tend to rely on the services sectors (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, the financial services sector) as the </span><span>primary source of economic growth and may be susceptible to the risks of individual service sectors. For example, companies </span><span>in the financial services sector are subject to governmental regulation and, recently, government intervention, which may </span><span>adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge and amount of capital they must maintain. </span><span>Dislocations in the financial sector and perceived or actual governmental influence over certain financial companies may lead </span><span>to credit rating downgrades and, as a result, impact, among other things, revenue growth for such companies. If financial </span><span>companies experience a prolonged decline in revenue growth, certain developed countries that rely heavily on financial </span><span>companies as an economic driver may experience a correlative slowdown. Concerns have emerged with respect to the </span><span>economic health of certain developed countries. These concerns primarily stem from heavy indebtedness of many developed </span><span>countries and their perceived inability to continue to service high debt loads without simultaneously implementing stringent </span><span>austerity measures. Such concerns have led to tremendous downward pressure on the economies of these countries. As a </span><span>result, it is possible that interest rates on debt of certain developed countries may rise to levels that make it difficult for such </span><span>countries to service such debt. Spending on health care and retirement pensions in most developed countries has risen </span><span>dramatically. Medical innovation, extended life expectancy and higher public expectations are likely to continue the increase </span><span>in health care and pension costs. Any increase in health care and pension costs will likely have a negative impact on the </span><span>economic growth of many developed countries. Certain developed countries rely on imports of certain key items, such as </span><span>crude oil, natural gas, and other commodities. As a result, an increase in demand for, or price fluctuations of, certain </span><span>commodities may negatively affect developed country economies. Developed market countries generally are dependent on </span><span>the economies of certain key trading partners. Changes in any one economy may cause an adverse impact on several </span><span>developed countries. In addition, heavy regulation of, among others, labor and product markets may have an adverse effect </span><span>on certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause prolonged periods of recession. Such </span><span>risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of a Fund’s investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets. </span><span> </span><span>Investments in emerging market countries may be subject to greater risks than </span><span>investments in developed countries. These risks include: (i) less social, political, and economic stability; (ii) greater illiquidity </span><span>and price volatility due to smaller or limited local capital markets for such securities, or low or non-existent trading volumes; </span><span>(iii) companies, custodians, clearinghouses, foreign exchanges and broker-dealers may be subject to less scrutiny and </span><span>regulation by local authorities; (iv) local governments may decide to seize or confiscate securities held by foreign investors </span><span>and/or local governments may decide to suspend or limit an issuer's ability to make dividend or interest payments; (v) local </span><span>governments may limit or entirely restrict repatriation of invested capital, profits, and dividends; (vi) capital gains may be </span><span>subject to local taxation, including on a retroactive basis; (vii) issuers facing restrictions on standard payments imposed by </span><span>local governments may attempt to make dividend or interest payments to foreign investors in the local currency; (viii) there </span><span>may be significant obstacles to obtaining information necessary for investigations into or litigation against companies and </span><span>investors may experience difficulty in enforcing legal claims related to the securities and/or local judges may favor the </span><span>interests of the issuer over those of foreign parties; (ix) bankruptcy judgments may only be permitted to be paid in the local </span><span>currency; (x) limited public information regarding the issuer may result in greater difficulty in determining market valuations </span><span>of the securities; and (xi) lack of financial reporting on a regular basis, substandard disclosure and differences in accounting </span><span>standards may make it difficult to ascertain the financial health of an issuer. The Funds are not actively managed and do not </span><span>select investments based on investor protection considerations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Emerging market securities markets are typically marked by a high concentration of market capitalization and trading volume </span><span>in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries, as well as a high concentration of ownership of </span><span>such securities by a limited number of investors. In addition, brokerage and other costs associated with transactions in </span><span>emerging market securities can be higher, sometimes significantly, than similar costs incurred in securities markets in </span><span>developed countries. Although some emerging markets have become more established and tend to issue securities of higher </span><span>credit quality, the markets for securities in other emerging market countries are in the earliest stages of their development, </span><span>and these countries issue securities across the credit spectrum. Even the markets for relatively widely traded securities in </span><span>emerging market countries may not be able to absorb, without price disruptions, a significant increase in trading volume or </span><span>trades of a size customarily undertaken by institutional investors in the securities markets of developed countries.

<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>size of many of these securities markets can cause prices to be erratic for reasons apart from factors that affect the </span><span>soundness and competitiveness of the securities issuers. For example, prices may be unduly influenced by traders who </span><span>control large positions in these markets. Additionally, market making and arbitrage activities are generally less extensive in </span><span>such markets, which may contribute to increased volatility and reduced liquidity of such markets. The limited liquidity of </span><span>emerging market country securities may also affect a Fund's ability to accurately value its portfolio securities or to acquire or </span><span>dispose of securities at the price and time it wishes to do so or in order to meet redemption requests.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Many emerging market countries suffer from uncertainty and corruption in their legal frameworks. Legislation may be </span><span>difficult to interpret and laws may be too new to provide any precedential value. Laws regarding foreign investment and </span><span>private property may be weak or non-existent. Sudden changes in governments may result in policies which are less </span><span>favorable to investors such as policies designed to expropriate or nationalize </span><span>“</span><span>sovereign</span><span>”</span><span> assets. Certain emerging market </span><span>countries in the past have expropriated large amounts of private property, in many cases with little or no compensation, and </span><span>there can be no assurance that such expropriation will not occur in the future.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investment in the securities markets of certain emerging market countries is restricted or controlled to varying degrees. </span><span>These restrictions may limit a Fund's investment in certain emerging market countries and may increase the expenses of the </span><span>Fund. Certain emerging market countries require governmental approval prior to investments by foreign persons or limit </span><span>investment by foreign persons to only a specified percentage of an issuer's outstanding securities or a specific class of </span><span>securities which may have less advantageous terms (including price) than securities of the company available for purchase </span><span>by nationals.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Many emerging market countries lack the social, political, and economic stability characteristic of the U.S. Political instability </span><span>among emerging market countries can be common and may be caused by an uneven distribution of wealth, social unrest, </span><span>labor strikes, civil wars, and religious oppression. Economic instability in emerging market countries may take the form of: (i) </span><span>high interest rates; (ii) high levels of inflation, including hyperinflation; (iii) high levels of unemployment or </span><span>underemployment; (iv) changes in government economic and tax policies, including confiscatory taxation; and (v) </span><span>imposition of trade barriers.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A Fund's income and, in some cases, capital gains from foreign securities will be subject to applicable taxation in certain of </span><span>the emerging market countries in which it invests, and treaties between the U.S. and such countries may not be available in </span><span>some cases to reduce the otherwise applicable tax rates.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Emerging markets also have different clearance and settlement procedures, and in certain of these emerging markets there </span><span>have been times when settlements have been unable to keep pace with the volume of securities transactions, making it </span><span>difficult to conduct such transactions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the past, certain governments in emerging market countries have become overly reliant on the international capital </span><span>markets and other forms of foreign credit to finance large public spending programs, which in the past have caused huge </span><span>budget deficits. Often, interest payments have become too overwhelming for a government to meet, representing a large </span><span>percentage of total GDP. These foreign obligations have become the subject of political debate and served as fuel for political </span><span>parties of the opposition, which pressure the government not to make payments to foreign creditors, but instead to use these </span><span>funds for, among other things, social programs. Either due to an inability to pay or submission to political pressure, foreign </span><span>governments have been forced to seek a restructuring of their loan and/or bond obligations, have declared a temporary </span><span>suspension of interest payments or have defaulted. These events have adversely affected the values of securities issued by </span><span>foreign governments and corporations domiciled in those countries and have negatively affected not only their cost of </span><span>borrowing, but their ability to borrow in the future as well.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Europe. </span><span> </span><span>Investing in European countries may expose a Fund to the economic and political risks </span><span>associated with Europe in general and the specific European countries in which it invests. The economies and markets of </span><span>European countries are often closely connected and interdependent, and events in one European country can have an </span><span>adverse impact on other European countries. A Fund makes investments in securities of issuers that are domiciled in, have </span><span>significant operations in, or that are listed on at least one securities exchange within member states of the European Union </span><span>(the </span><span>“</span><span>EU</span><span>”</span><span>). A number of countries within the EU are also members of the Economic and Monetary Union (the </span><span>“</span><span>eurozone</span><span>”</span><span>) </span><span>and have adopted the euro as their currency. Eurozone membership requires member states to comply with restrictions on </span><span>inflation rates, deficits, interest rates, debt levels and fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect </span><span>every country in Europe. Changes in import or export tariffs, changes in governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in </span><span>the exchange rate of the euro and other currencies of certain EU countries which are not in the eurozone, the default or </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>19</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>threat of default by an EU member state on its sovereign debt, and/or an economic recession in an EU member state may </span><span>have a significant adverse effect on the economies of other EU member states and their trading partners. Although certain </span><span>European countries are not in the eurozone, many of these countries are obliged to meet the criteria for joining the eurozone.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Consequently, these countries must comply with many of the restrictions noted above. The European financial markets have </span><span>experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns, government debt levels and the </span><span>possible default of government debt in several European countries, including, but not limited to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, </span><span>France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. In order to prevent further economic deterioration, certain </span><span>countries, without prior warning, can institute </span><span>“</span><span>capital controls.</span><span>”</span><span> Countries may use these controls to restrict volatile </span><span>movements of capital entering and exiting their country. Such controls may negatively affect a Fund’s investments. A default </span><span>or debt restructuring by any European country would adversely impact holders of that country’s debt and sellers of credit </span><span>default swaps linked to that country’s creditworthiness, which may be located in countries other than those listed above. In </span><span>addition, the credit ratings of certain European countries were downgraded in the past. These events have adversely affected </span><span>the value and exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect the economies of every country in Europe, </span><span>including countries that do not use the euro and non-EU member states. Responses to the financial problems by European </span><span>governments, central banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may </span><span>result in social unrest and may limit future growth and economic recovery or have other unintended consequences. Further </span><span>defaults or restructurings by governments and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on </span><span>economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more countries may abandon the </span><span>euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The impact of these actions, especially if they occur in a disorderly fashion, is not clear </span><span>but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely impact the value of a Fund’s investments in the region.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The U.K. left the EU (</span><span>“</span><span>Brexit</span><span>”</span><span>) on January 31, 2020. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, </span><span>economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and </span><span>financial markets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain European countries have also developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were </span><span>to worsen, they could adversely affect European issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The national politics of countries in </span><span>Europe have been unpredictable and subject to influence by disruptive political groups and ideologies, including for example, </span><span>secessionist movements. The governments of European countries may be subject to change and such countries may </span><span>experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments may result in sudden and </span><span>significant investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe or war in the region also could impact </span><span>financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching</span><span> </span><span>and could adversely affect </span><span>the value and liquidity of a Fund's investments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Russian Invasion of Ukraine</span><span>. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The extent and duration </span><span>of the military action, resulting sanctions and resulting future market disruptions, including declines in its stock markets and </span><span>the value of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but could be significant. Disruptions caused by Russian </span><span>military action or other actions (including cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting actual and threatened responses to such </span><span>activity, including purchasing and financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer or purchaser preferences, </span><span>sanctions, import and export restrictions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Russian government, Russian companies or Russian </span><span>individuals, including politicians, may impact Russia's economy, Russian issuers of securities in which a Fund invests, or the </span><span>economies of Europe as a whole. Actual and threatened responses to Russian military action may also impact the markets for </span><span>certain Russian commodities, such as oil and natural gas, as well as other sectors of the Russian economy, and are likely to </span><span>have collateral impacts on such sectors across Europe and globally.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Japan. </span><span> </span><span>Japan may be subject to political, economic, labor and other risks. Any of these risks, individually </span><span>or in the aggregate, can impact an investment made in Japan.</span> <br/><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Currency Risk</span><span>. The Japanese yen has fluctuated widely at times and any increase in its value may cause a decline in exports </span><span>that could weaken the Japanese economy. Japan has, in the past, intervened in the currency markets to attempt to maintain </span><span>or reduce the value of the yen. Japanese intervention in the currency markets could cause the value of the yen to fluctuate </span><span>sharply and unpredictably and could cause losses to investors.</span> <br/><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Economic Risk</span><span>. The growth of Japan’s economy has recently lagged that of its Asian neighbors and other major developed </span><span>economies. Since 2000, Japan’s economic growth rate has generally remained low relative to other advanced economies, and </span><span>it may remain low in the future. The Japanese economy is heavily dependent on international trade and has been adversely </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>20</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>affected by trade tariffs, other protectionist measures, competition from emerging economies and the economic conditions </span><span>of its trading partners. Japan is also heavily dependent on oil imports, and higher commodity prices could therefore have a </span><span>negative impact on the Japanese economy.</span> <br/><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Geographic Risk</span><span>. Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, typhoons and tsunamis, could occur in Japan or </span><span>surrounding areas and could negatively affect the Japanese economy, and, in turn, could negatively affect a Fund.</span> <br/><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Labor Risk</span><span>. Japan has an aging workforce and has experienced a significant population decline in recent years. Japan’s labor </span><span>market appears to be undergoing fundamental structural changes, as a labor market traditionally accustomed to lifetime </span><span>employment adjusts to meet the need for increased labor mobility, which may adversely affect Japan’s economic </span><span>competitiveness.</span> <br/></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Large Government and Corporate Debt Risk</span><span>. The Japanese economy faces several concerns, including a financial system with </span><span>large levels of nonperforming loans, over-leveraged corporate balance sheets, extensive cross-ownership by major </span><span>corporations, a changing corporate governance structure, and large government deficits. These issues may cause a </span><span>slowdown of the Japanese economy.</span> <br/><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Political Risk</span><span>. Historically, Japan has had unpredictable national politics and may experience frequent political turnover. Future </span><span>political developments may lead to changes in policy that might adversely affect a Fund’s investments. In addition, China has </span><span>become an important trading partner with Japan. Japan’s political relationship with China, however, has been strained. Should </span><span>political tension increase, it could adversely affect the Japanese economy and destabilize the region as a whole.</span> <br/><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Security Risk.</span><span> Japan's relations with its neighbors, particularly China, North Korea, South Korea and Russia, have at times been </span><span>strained due to territorial disputes, historical animosities and defense concerns. Most recently, the Japanese government has </span><span>shown concern over the increased nuclear and military activity by North Korea and China. Strained relations may cause </span><span>uncertainty in the Japanese markets and adversely affect the overall Japanese economy, particularly in times of crisis.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in North America. </span><span> </span><span>A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations or an economic recession </span><span>in any North American country can have a significant economic effect on the entire North American region and on some or </span><span>all of the North American countries in which a Fund invests. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The U.S. is Canada's and Mexico's largest trading and investment partner. The Canadian and Mexican economies are </span><span>significantly affected by developments in the U.S. economy. Since the implementation of NAFTA in 1994 among Canada, the </span><span>U.S. and Mexico, total merchandise trade among the three countries has increased. However, political developments </span><span>including the implementation of tariffs by the U.S., and the renegotiation of NAFTA in the form of the United States-Mexico-Canada</span><span> Agreement (</span><span>“</span><span>USMCA</span><span>”</span><span>), which replaced NAFTA on July 1, 2020, could negatively affect North America’s economic </span><span>outlook and, as a result, the value of securities held by a Fund. Policy and legislative changes in one country may have a </span><span>significant effect on North American markets generally, as well as on the value of certain securities held by a Fund. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the United Kingdom.</span><span>  </span><span>Investment in U.K. issuers may subject a Fund to regulatory, political, currency, </span><span>security, and economic risks specific to the U.K. The U.K. economy relies heavily on the export of financial services to the U.S. </span><span>and other European countries. A prolonged slowdown in the financial services sector may have a negative impact on the </span><span>U.K.’s economy. In the past, the U.K. has been a target of terrorism. Acts of terrorism in the U.K. or against U.K. interests </span><span>abroad may cause uncertainty in the U.K. financial markets</span><span> </span><span>and adversely affect the performance of the issuers to which a </span><span>Fund has exposure. Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain and the independence movement in </span><span>Scotland, may have an adverse effect on the U.K. economy.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>On January 31, 2020, the U.K. officially left the EU (Brexit), subject to a transitional period that ended December 31, 2020. The </span><span>U.K. and EU have reached an agreement on the terms of their future trading relationship effective January 1, 2021, which </span><span>principally relates to the trading of goods rather than services, including financial services. Further discussions are to be held </span><span>between the U.K. and the EU in relation to matters not covered by the trade agreement, such as financial services. A Fund will </span><span>face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and consequences that may follow Brexit, including with respect to </span><span>volatility in exchange rates and interest rates. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, </span><span>economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and </span><span>financial markets. Brexit has also led to legal uncertainty and could lead to politically divergent national laws and regulations </span><span>as a new relationship between the U.K. and EU is defined and the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any </span><span>of these effects of Brexit could adversely affect any of the companies to which a Fund has exposure and any other assets that </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>21</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>a Fund invests in. The political, economic and legal consequences of Brexit are not yet known. In the short term, financial </span><span>markets may experience heightened volatility, particularly those in the U.K. and Europe, but possibly worldwide. The U.K. and </span><span>Europe may be less stable than they have been in recent years, and investments in the U.K. and the EU may be difficult to </span><span>value or subject to greater or more frequent volatility. In the longer term, there is likely to be a period of significant political, </span><span>regulatory and commercial uncertainty as the U.K. continues to negotiate the terms of its future trading relationships. </span><span>Recently, the U.K.'s real estate sector has experienced significant volatility and declines in the value of many real estate </span><span>securities, including real estate funds, real estate investment trusts (</span><span>“</span><span>REITs</span><span>”</span><span>) and real estate holding companies. Increased </span><span>volatility and investor redemption requests in real estate funds may result in the continued decline in the value and liquidity </span><span>of real estate securities, which may impair the ability of a Fund to buy, sell, receive or deliver those securities.</span></div> <div> <div><span>U.S. Economic Trading Partners Risk. </span><span> </span><span>The U.S. is a significant, and in some cases the most significant, trading partner of, or </span><span>foreign investor in, certain countries in which a Fund invests. As a result, economic conditions of such countries may be </span><span>particularly affected by changes in the U.S. economy. A decrease in U.S. imports or exports, new trade and financial </span><span>regulations or tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate or an economic slowdown in the U.S. may have a material </span><span>adverse effect on a country’s economic conditions and, as a result, securities to which a Fund has exposure. Circumstances </span><span>could arise that could prevent the timely payment of interest or principal on U.S. government debt, such as reaching the </span><span>legislative </span><span>“</span><span>debt ceiling.</span><span>”</span><span> Such non-payment would result in substantial negative consequences for the U.S. economy and the </span><span>global financial system.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>There are strained relations between the U.S. and a number of foreign countries, including traditional allies, such as certain </span><span>European countries, and historical adversaries, such as North Korea, Iran, China and Russia. If these relations were to worsen, </span><span>it could adversely affect U.S. issuers as well as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also experienced </span><span>increased internal unrest and discord. If these trends were to continue, it may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy </span><span>and many of the issuers in which a Fund invests.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Aerospace and Defense Industry. </span><span> </span><span>The aerospace and defense industry can be significantly affected </span><span>by government defense and aerospace regulation and spending policies. The aerospace industry in particular has recently </span><span>been affected by adverse economic conditions and consolidation within the industry.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Basic Materials Industry. </span><span> </span><span>Issuers in the basic materials industry could be adversely affected by </span><span>commodity price volatility, exchange rate fluctuations, social and political unrest, import controls and increased competition. </span><span>Companies in the basic materials industry may be subject to swift fluctuations in supply and demand. Fluctuations may be </span><span>caused by events relating to political and economic developments, the environmental impact of basic materials operations, </span><span>and the success of exploration projects. Production of industrial materials often exceeds demand as a result of over-building </span><span>or economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns. Issuers in the basic materials industry are at risk for </span><span>environmental damage and product liability claims and may be adversely affected by depletion of resources, delays in </span><span>technical progress, labor relations, tax and government regulations related to changes to, among other things, energy and </span><span>environmental policies.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Biotechnology Industry. </span><span> </span><span>Biotechnology companies depend on the successful development of new </span><span>and proprietary technologies. There can be no assurance that the development of new technologies will be successful or that </span><span>intellectual property rights will be obtained with respect to new technologies. The loss or impairment of intellectual property </span><span>rights may adversely affect the profitability of biotechnology companies. In addition, companies in the biotechnology </span><span>industry spend heavily on research and development and their products or services may not prove commercially successful </span><span>or may become obsolete quickly. The risks of high development costs may be exacerbated by the inability to raise prices as a </span><span>result of managed care pressure, government regulation or price controls. Biotechnology companies can suffer persistent </span><span>losses during the transition of new products from development to production or when products are or may be subject to </span><span>regulatory approval processes or regulatory scrutiny and, as a consequence, the earnings of biotechnology companies may </span><span>be erratic. Companies in the biotechnology industry are also exposed to the risk that they will be subject to products liability </span><span>claims. Companies involved in the biotechnology industry may be subject to extensive government regulations by the U.S. </span><span>Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, among </span><span>other foreign and domestic regulators. Such regulation may significantly affect and limit biotechnology research, product </span><span>development and approval of products.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>22</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Communication Services Sector. </span><span> </span><span>The communication services sector consists of both companies in </span><span>the telecommunication services industry as well as those in the media and entertainment industry. Examples of companies in </span><span>the telecommunication services industry group include providers of fiber-optic, fixed-line, cellular and wireless </span><span>telecommunications networks. Companies in the media and entertainment industry group encompass a variety of services </span><span>and products including television broadcasting, gaming products, social media, networking platforms, online classifieds, </span><span>online review websites, and Internet search engines. Companies in the communication services sector may be affected by </span><span>industry competition, substantial capital requirements, government regulation, and obsolescence of communications </span><span>products and services due to technological advancement. Fluctuating domestic and international demand, shifting </span><span>demographics and often unpredictable changes in consumer tastes can drastically affect a communication services </span><span>company's profitability. In addition, while all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies </span><span>in the communication services sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or consumer </span><span>information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses. </span></div> <div> <div><span>The communication services sector of a country’s economy is often subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of </span><span>complying with governmental regulations, delays or failure to receive required regulatory approvals, or the enactment of new </span><span>regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of communications companies. Government actions around the </span><span>world, specifically in the area of pre-marketing clearance of products and prices, can be arbitrary and unpredictable. The </span><span>communications services industry can also be significantly affected by intense competition for market share, including </span><span>competition with alternative technologies such as wireless communications, product compatibility and standardization, </span><span>consumer preferences, rapid product obsolescence, research and development of new products, lack of standardization or </span><span>compatibility with existing technologies, and a dependency on patent and copyright protections. Companies in the </span><span>communication services sector may encounter distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet </span><span>increasing competition, particularly in developing new products and services using new technology. Technological </span><span>innovations may make the products and services of certain communications companies obsolete.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Telecommunications providers with exposure to the U.S. are generally required to obtain franchises or licenses in order to </span><span>provide services in a given location. Licensing and franchise rights in the telecommunications sector are limited, which may </span><span>provide an advantage to certain participants. Limited availability of such rights, high barriers to market entry and regulatory </span><span>oversight, among other factors, have led to consolidation of companies within the sector, which could lead to further </span><span>regulation or other negative effects in the future. Telecommunication providers investing in non-U.S. countries may be </span><span>subject to similar risks. Additional risks include those related to competitive challenges in the U.S. from non-U.S. competitors </span><span>engaged in strategic joint ventures with U.S. companies and in non-U.S. markets from both U.S. and non-U.S. competitors. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Companies in the media and entertainment industries can be significantly affected by several factors, including competition, </span><span>particularly in formulation of products and services using new technologies, cyclicality of revenues and earnings, a potential </span><span>decrease in the discretionary income of targeted individuals, changing consumer tastes and interests, and the potential </span><span>increase in government regulation. Companies in the media and entertainment industries may become obsolete quickly. </span><span>Advertising spending can be an important revenue source for media and entertainment companies. During economic </span><span>downturns advertising spending typically decreases and, as a result, media and entertainment companies tend to generate </span><span>less revenue.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Discretionary Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies engaged in the design, production or distribution of </span><span>products or services for the consumer discretionary sector (including, without limitation, television and radio broadcasting, </span><span>manufacturing, publishing, recording and musical instruments, motion pictures, photography, amusement and theme parks, </span><span>gaming casinos, sporting goods and sports arenas, camping and recreational equipment, toys and games, apparel, travel-related</span><span> services, automobiles, hotels and motels, and fast food and other restaurants) are subject to the risk that their </span><span>products or services may become obsolete quickly. The success of these companies can depend heavily on disposable </span><span>household income and consumer spending. During periods of an expanding economy, the consumer discretionary sector </span><span>may outperform the consumer staples sector, but may underperform when economic conditions worsen. Moreover, the </span><span>consumer discretionary sector can be significantly affected by several factors, including, without limitation, the performance </span><span>of domestic and international economies, exchange rates, changing consumer preferences, demographics, marketing </span><span>campaigns, cyclical revenue generation, consumer confidence, commodity price volatility, labor relations, interest rates, </span><span>import and export controls, intense competition, technological developments and government regulation.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>23</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Staples Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the consumer staples sector may be adversely affected by </span><span>changes in the global economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, and production </span><span>spending. Companies in the consumer staples sector may also be affected by changes in global economic, environmental </span><span>and political events, economic conditions, the depletion of resources, and government regulation. For instance, government </span><span>regulations may affect the permissibility of using various food additives and production methods of companies that make </span><span>food products, which could affect company profitability. In addition, tobacco companies may be adversely affected by the </span><span>adoption of proposed legislation and/or by litigation. Companies in the consumer staples sector also may be subject to risks </span><span>pertaining to the supply of, demand for and prices of raw materials. The prices of raw materials fluctuate in response to a </span><span>number of factors, including, without limitation, changes in government agricultural support programs, exchange rates, </span><span>import and export controls, changes in international agricultural and trading policies, and seasonal and weather conditions. </span><span>Companies in the consumer staples sector may be subject to severe competition, which may also have an adverse impact on </span><span>their profitability.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Energy Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the energy sector are strongly affected by the changes in and volatility </span><span>of global energy prices, energy supply and demand, government regulations and policies, energy production and </span><span>conservation efforts, technological change, development of alternative energy sources, and other factors that they cannot </span><span>control. Energy companies may have relatively high levels of debt and may be more likely to restructure their businesses if </span><span>there are downturns in energy markets or in the global economy. If an energy company in a Fund's portfolio becomes </span><span>distressed, a Fund could lose all or a substantial portion of its investment. The energy sector is cyclical and is highly </span><span>dependent on commodity prices. Prices and supplies of energy may fluctuate significantly over short and long periods of </span><span>time due to, among other things, national and international political changes, Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>OPEC</span><span>”</span><span>) policies, changes in relationships among OPEC members and between OPEC and oil-importing nations, the </span><span>regulatory environment, taxation policies, the enactment or cessation of trade sanctions, war or other geopolitical conflicts, </span><span>and the economies of key energy-consuming countries. Companies in the energy sector may be adversely affected by </span><span>terrorism, cyber incidents, natural disasters or other catastrophes. Companies in the energy sector are at risk of liability from </span><span>accidents resulting in injury, loss of life or property, pollution or other environmental damage claims. Significant oil and gas </span><span>deposits are located in emerging markets countries where corruption and security may raise significant risks, in addition to </span><span>the other risks of investing in emerging markets. Additionally, the Middle East, where many companies in the energy sector </span><span>may operate, has experienced conflict and unrest. Companies in the energy sector may also be adversely affected by changes </span><span>in exchange rates, interest rates, economic conditions, tax treatment, government regulation and intervention, negative </span><span>perception, efforts at energy conservation and world events in the regions in which the companies operate (</span><span>e.g</span><span>., </span><span>expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments </span><span>and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest, violence or labor unrest). Because a significant portion of revenues of </span><span>companies in this sector is derived from a relatively small number of customers that are largely composed of governmental </span><span>entities and utilities, governmental budget constraints may have a significant impact on companies in this sector. The energy </span><span>sector is highly regulated. Entities operating in the energy sector are subject to significant regulation of nearly every aspect of </span><span>their operations by governmental agencies. Such regulation can change rapidly or over time in both scope and intensity. </span><span>Stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be enacted, which would likely increase compliance costs and may </span><span>materially adversely affect the financial performance of companies in the energy sector.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The energy sector may experience significant market volatility. For example, Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine on </span><span>February 24, 2022 led to further disruptions and increased volatility in the energy and commodity futures markets due to </span><span>actual and potential disruptions in the supply and demand for certain commodities, including oil and natural gas. The U.S. </span><span>and other actors have enacted various sanctions and restrictions on business dealings with Russia, which include restrictions </span><span>on imports of oil, natural gas and coal. The effect of the current sanctions and restrictions, as well as the extent and duration </span><span>of the Russian military action, additional sanctions and associated market disruptions on the energy sector, are impossible to </span><span>predict and depend on a number of factors. The effect of these events or any related developments could be significant and </span><span>may have a severe adverse effect on the performance of a Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Financials Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the financials sector include small, regional and money center </span><span>banks, securities brokerage firms, asset management companies, savings banks and thrift institutions, specialty finance </span><span>companies (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, credit card, mortgage providers), insurance and insurance brokerage firms, consumer finance firms, </span><span>financial conglomerates and foreign banking and financial companies.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Most financial companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which limits their activities and may affect their </span><span>ability to earn a profit from a given line of business. Government regulation may change frequently and may have significant </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>24</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>adverse consequences for companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by the regulation. Direct </span><span>governmental intervention in the operations of financial companies and financial markets may materially and adversely affect </span><span>the companies in which a Fund invests, including legislation in many countries that may increase government regulation, </span><span>repatriation and other intervention. The impact of governmental intervention and legislative changes on any individual </span><span>financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. The valuation of financial companies has been </span><span>and continues to be subject to unprecedented volatility and may be influenced by unpredictable factors, including interest </span><span>rate risk and sovereign debt default. Certain financial businesses are subject to intense competitive pressures, including </span><span>market share and price competition. Financial companies in foreign countries are subject to market-specific and general </span><span>regulatory and interest rate concerns. In particular, government regulation in certain foreign countries may include taxes and </span><span>controls on interest rates, credit availability, minimum capital requirements, bans on short sales, limits on prices and </span><span>restrictions on currency transfers. In addition, companies in the financials sector may be the targets of hacking and potential </span><span>theft of proprietary or customer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their </span><span>businesses.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>The profitability of banks, savings and loan associations and other financial companies is largely dependent on the availability </span><span>and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change; for instance, when interest rates go up, </span><span>the value of securities issued by many types of companies in the financials sector generally goes down. In other words, </span><span>financial companies may be adversely affected in certain market cycles, including, without limitation, during periods of rising </span><span>interest rates, which may restrict the availability and increase the cost of capital, and during periods of declining economic </span><span>conditions, which may cause, among other things, credit losses due to financial difficulties of borrowers.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, general economic conditions are important to the operations of these companies, and financial difficulties of </span><span>borrowers may have an adverse effect on the profitability of financial companies. Companies in the financials sector are </span><span>exposed directly to the credit risk of their borrowers and counterparties, who may be leveraged to an unknown degree, </span><span>including through swaps and other derivatives products, and who at times may be unable to meet their obligations to the </span><span>financial services companies. Financial services companies may have significant exposure to the same borrowers and </span><span>counterparties, with the result that a borrower’s or counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations to one company may affect </span><span>other companies with exposure to the same borrower or counterparty. This interconnectedness of risk, including cross-default</span><span> risk, may result in significant negative impacts to the financial condition and reputation of companies with direct </span><span>exposure to the defaulting counterparty as well as adverse cascading effects in the markets and the financials sector </span><span>generally. Financial companies can be highly dependent upon access to capital markets, and any impediments to such </span><span>access, such as adverse overall economic conditions or a negative perception in the capital markets of a financial company’s </span><span>financial condition or prospects, could adversely affect its business. Deterioration of credit markets can have an adverse </span><span>impact on a broad range of financial markets, causing certain financial companies to incur large losses. In these conditions, </span><span>companies in the financials sector may experience significant declines in the valuation of their assets, take actions to raise </span><span>capital and even cease operations. Some financial companies may also be required to accept or borrow significant amounts </span><span>of capital from government sources and may face future government-imposed restrictions on their businesses or increased </span><span>government intervention. In addition, there is no guarantee that governments will provide any such relief in the future. These </span><span>actions may cause the securities of many companies in the financials sector to decline in value.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Healthcare Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the healthcare sector are often issuers whose profitability may be </span><span>affected by extensive government regulation, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising or </span><span>falling costs of medical products and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, a limited </span><span>number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market developments. Many healthcare </span><span>companies are heavily dependent on patent protection and the actual or perceived safety and efficiency of their products.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Patents have a limited duration, and, upon expiration, other companies may market substantially similar </span><span>“</span><span>generic</span><span>”</span><span> products </span><span>that are typically sold at a lower price than the patented product, which can cause the original developer of the product to </span><span>lose market share and/or reduce the price charged for the product, resulting in lower profits for the original developer. As a </span><span>result, the expiration of patents may adversely affect the profitability of these companies.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, because the products and services of many companies in the healthcare sector affect the health and well-being </span><span>of many individuals, these companies are especially susceptible to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar </span><span>claims. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may </span><span>result in price discounting. Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The process </span><span>of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, which can result in increased development costs, delayed cost recovery </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>25</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>and loss of competitive advantage to the extent that rival companies have developed competing products or procedures, </span><span>adversely affecting the company’s revenues and profitability. In other words, delays in the regulatory approval process may </span><span>diminish the opportunity for a company to profit from a new product or to bring a new product to market, which could have </span><span>a material adverse effect on a company’s business. Healthcare companies may also be strongly affected by scientific </span><span>biotechnology or technological developments, and their products may quickly become obsolete. Also, many healthcare </span><span>companies offer products and services that are subject to governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by changes </span><span>in governmental policies or laws. Changes in governmental policies or laws may span a wide range of topics, including cost </span><span>control, national health insurance, incentives for compensation in the provision of healthcare services, tax incentives and </span><span>penalties related to healthcare insurance premiums, and promotion of prepaid healthcare plans. In addition, a number of </span><span>legislative proposals concerning healthcare have been considered by the U.S. Congress in recent years. It is unclear what </span><span>proposals will ultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect they may have on companies in the healthcare sector.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Additionally, the expansion of facilities by healthcare-related providers may be subject to </span><span>“</span><span>determinations of need</span><span>”</span><span> by certain </span><span>government authorities. This process not only generally increases the time and costs involved in these expansions, but also </span><span>makes expansion plans uncertain, limiting the revenue and profitability growth potential of healthcare-related facilities </span><span>operators and negatively affecting the prices of their securities. Moreover, in recent years, both local and national </span><span>governmental budgets have come under pressure to reduce spending and control healthcare costs, which could both </span><span>adversely affect regulatory processes and public funding available for healthcare products, services and facilities.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Home Construction Industry. </span><span> </span><span>The home construction industry may be significantly affected by </span><span>changes in government spending, zoning laws, economic conditions, interest rates, commodity prices, consumer confidence </span><span>and spending, taxation, demographic patterns, real estate values, overbuilding, housing starts, and new and existing home </span><span>sales. Rising interest rates, reductions in mortgage availability to consumers, increasing foreclosure rates or increases in the </span><span>costs of owning a home could reduce the market for new homes and adversely affect the profitability of home construction </span><span>companies. Different segments of the home construction industry can be significantly affected by environmental clean-up </span><span>costs and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts. Home construction companies may lack </span><span>diversification, due to ownership of a limited number of properties and concentration in a particular geographic region or </span><span>property type.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Industrials Sector. </span><span> </span><span>The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be </span><span>adversely affected by supply of and demand for both their specific products or services and for industrials sector products in </span><span>general. The products of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and </span><span>frequent new product introduction. Government regulations, trade disputes, world events and economic conditions may </span><span>affect the performance of companies in the industrials sector. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by </span><span>changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors.</span><span> </span><span>Aerospace and defense </span><span>companies, a component of the industrials sector, can be significantly affected by government spending policies because </span><span>companies involved in this industry rely, to a significant extent, on government demand for their products and services. Thus, </span><span>the financial condition of, and investor interest in, aerospace and defense companies are heavily influenced by governmental </span><span>defense spending policies, which are typically under pressure from efforts to control government budgets. Transportation </span><span>stocks, a component of the industrials sector, are cyclical and can be significantly affected by economic changes, fuel prices, </span><span>labor relations and insurance costs. Transportation companies in certain countries may also be subject to significant </span><span>government regulation and oversight, which may adversely affect their businesses. For example, commodity price declines </span><span>and unit volume reductions resulting from an over-supply of materials used in the industrials sector can adversely affect the </span><span>sector. Furthermore, companies in the industrials sector may be subject to liability for environmental damage, product </span><span>liability claims, depletion of resources, and mandated expenditures for safety and pollution control.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Information Technology Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Information technology companies face intense competition, both </span><span>domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Like other technology companies, </span><span>information technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products </span><span>of information technology companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent </span><span>new product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. </span><span>Technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technology, especially those of smaller, less-seasoned companies, </span><span>tend to be more volatile than the overall market. Companies in the information technology sector are heavily dependent on </span><span>patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these </span><span>companies. Information technology companies are facing increased government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject </span><span>to adverse government or regulatory action. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>26</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>certain companies in the information technology sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of </span><span>proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses. </span><span>These risks are heightened for information technology companies in foreign markets.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Infrastructure Industry. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the infrastructure industry may be subject to a variety of </span><span>factors that could adversely affect their business or operations, including high interest costs in connection with capital </span><span>construction programs, high degrees of leverage, costs associated with governmental, environmental and other regulations, </span><span>the effects of economic slowdowns, increased competition from other providers of services, uncertainties concerning costs, </span><span>the level of government spending on infrastructure projects, and other factors. Infrastructure companies may be adversely </span><span>affected by commodity price volatility, changes in exchange rates, import controls, depletion of resources, technological </span><span>developments, and labor relations. There is also the risk that corruption may negatively affect publicly funded infrastructure </span><span>projects, especially in emerging markets, resulting in delays and cost overruns. Infrastructure issuers can be significantly </span><span>affected by government spending policies because companies involved in this industry rely to a significant extent on U.S. and </span><span>other government demand for their products.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Infrastructure companies in the oil and gas industry may be adversely affected by government regulation or world events in </span><span>the regions where the companies operate (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the </span><span>imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest, violence or labor </span><span>unrest). Infrastructure companies may have significant capital investments in, or engage in transactions involving, emerging </span><span>market countries, which may heighten these risks.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Operations Risk. </span><span>The failure of an infrastructure company to carry adequate insurance or to operate its assets appropriately </span><span>could lead to significant losses. Infrastructure may be adversely affected by environmental clean-up costs and catastrophic </span><span>events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Customer Risk. </span><span>Infrastructure companies can be dependent upon a narrow customer base. Additionally, if these customers </span><span>fail to pay their obligations, significant revenues could be lost and may not be replaceable.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Regulatory Risk. </span><span>Infrastructure companies may be subject to significant regulation by various governmental authorities and </span><span>also may be affected by regulation of rates charged to customers, service interruption due to environmental, operational or </span><span>other events, the imposition of special tariffs and changes in tax laws, regulatory policies and accounting standards.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Strategic Asset Risk. </span><span>Infrastructure companies may control significant strategic assets (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, major pipelines or highways), </span><span>which are assets that have a national or regional profile, and may have monopolistic characteristics. Given their national or </span><span>regional profile or irreplaceable nature, strategic assets could generate additional risk not common in other industry sectors </span><span>and they may be targeted for terrorist acts or adverse political actions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Interest Rate Risk. </span><span>Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for infrastructure companies, which could </span><span>negatively impact their ability to meet payment obligations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Leverage Risk. </span><span>Infrastructure companies can be highly leveraged, which increases investments risk and other risks normally </span><span>associated with debt financing and could adversely affect an infrastructure company's operations and market value in </span><span>periods of rising interest rates.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Inflation Risk. </span><span>Many infrastructure companies may have fixed income streams. Consequently, their market values may decline </span><span>in times of higher inflation. Additionally, the prices that an infrastructure company is able to charge users of its assets may be </span><span>linked to inflation, whether by government regulation, contractual arrangement or other factors. In this case, changes in the </span><span>rate of inflation may affect the company's profitability.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Transportation Risk. </span><span>The stock prices of companies in the transportation industry group are affected by both supply and </span><span>demand for their specific product. Government regulation, world events and economic conditions may affect the </span><span>performance of companies in the transportation industry group.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Oil and Gas Risk.</span><span> The profitability of oil and gas companies is related to worldwide energy prices, exploration, and production </span><span>spending.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>27</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Utilities Risk. </span><span>Utilities companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse </span><span>effect on their profit margins. The rates charged by regulated utility companies are subject to review and limitation by </span><span>governmental regulatory commissions.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Insurance Industry. </span><span> </span><span>The insurance industry is subject to extensive government regulation in some </span><span>countries and can be significantly affected by changes in interest rates, general economic conditions, price and marketing </span><span>competition, the imposition of premium rate caps or other changes in government regulation or tax law. Different segments </span><span>of the insurance industry can be significantly affected by changes in mortality and morbidity rates, environmental clean-up </span><span>costs and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Life Science and Tools Industry. </span><span> </span><span>The profitability of companies in the Life Science and Tools Industry </span><span>may be affected by limited product focus, rapidly changing technology, product development costs, product liability risks, </span><span>extensive government regulation, intellectual property rights, and intense competition, any of which may have a material </span><span>adverse effect on securities prices of a company in which the Fund has invested.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span> </span><span>Cost containment measures already implemented by the federal government, state governments and the private sector have </span><span>adversely affected certain sectors of companies related to healthcare. If not repealed, the continued implementation or </span><span>expansion of the ACA may create increased demand for healthcare products and services but also may have an adverse </span><span>effect on some companies in the life sciences and tools industry. Increased emphasis on managed care in the United States </span><span>may put pressure on the price and usage of products sold by life sciences and tools companies in which the Fund may invest </span><span>and may adversely affect the sales and revenues of these companies. In addition, the restructuring or repeal of the ACA may </span><span>result in lower utilization of life science and tools products and services. A reduction in the research budget of the National </span><span>Institutes of Health may also result in reduced annual research outlays and adversely impact the demand for life science and </span><span>tools products and services.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Materials Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the materials sector may be adversely affected by commodity price </span><span>volatility, exchange rate fluctuations, social and political unrest, war, import or export controls, increased competition, </span><span>depletion of resources, technical progress, labor relations and government regulations, and mandated expenditures for safety </span><span>and pollution control, among other factors. Such risks may adversely affect the issuers to which a Fund has exposure. </span><span>Companies in the materials sector are also at risk of liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. </span><span>Production of materials may exceed demand as a result of market imbalances or economic downturns, leading to poor </span><span>investment returns. These risks are heightened for companies in the materials sector located in foreign markets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Medical Equipment Industry. </span><span> </span><span>Many companies in the medical equipment industry are heavily </span><span>dependent on patent protection, and the expiration of patents may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. </span><span>Companies in the medical equipment industry may be subject to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar </span><span>claims as well as competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may result in price discounting. The </span><span>profitability of some medical equipment companies may be dependent on a relatively limited number of products. In </span><span>addition, their products can become obsolete due to industry innovation, changes in technologies or other market </span><span>developments. Many new products in the medical equipment industry are subject to regulatory approvals, and the process of </span><span>obtaining such approvals is long and costly.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Mortgage Real Estate Investment Trusts. </span><span> </span><span>Mortgage REITs lend money to developers and owners of </span><span>properties and invest primarily in mortgages and similar real estate interests. The mortgage REITs receive interest payments </span><span>from the owners of the mortgaged properties. Accordingly, mortgage REITs are subject to the credit risk of the borrowers to </span><span>whom they extend funds. Credit risk is the risk that the borrower will not be able to make timely interest and principal </span><span>payments on the loan to the REIT. Mortgage REITs also are subject to the risk that the value of mortgaged properties may be </span><span>less than the amounts owed on the properties. If a mortgage REIT is required to foreclose on a borrower, the amount </span><span>recovered in connection with the foreclosure may be less than the amount owed to the mortgage REIT.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span> </span><span>Mortgage REITs are subject to significant interest rate risk. During periods when interest rates are declining, mortgages are </span><span>often refinanced or prepaid. Refinancing or prepayment of mortgages may reduce the yield of mortgage REITs. When interest </span><span>rates decline, the value of a REIT’s investment in fixed rate obligations can be expected to rise. Conversely, when interest rates </span><span>rise, the value of a REIT’s investment in fixed rate obligations can be expected to decline. In addition, rising interest rates </span><span>generally increase the costs of obtaining financing, which could cause the value of a mortgage REIT’s investments to decline. </span><span>A REIT’s investment in adjustable rate obligations may react differently to interest rate changes than an investment in fixed </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>28</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>rate obligations. As interest rates on adjustable rate mortgage loans are reset periodically, yields on a REIT’s investment in </span><span>such loans will gradually align themselves to reflect changes in market interest rates, causing the value of such investments </span><span>to fluctuate less dramatically in response to interest rate fluctuations than would investments in fixed rate obligations.</span></div> <div> <div><span> </span><span>Mortgage REITs typically use leverage (and in many cases, may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk and </span><span>could adversely affect a REIT’s operations and market value in periods of rising interest rates, increased interest rate volatility, </span><span>downturns in the economy and reductions in the availability of financing or deterioration in the conditions of the REIT’s </span><span>mortgage-related assets.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Natural Resources Industry. </span><span> </span><span>The profitability of companies in the natural resources industry can be </span><span>affected by worldwide energy prices, limits on exploration, and production spending. Companies in the natural resources </span><span>industry are affected by government regulation, world events and economic conditions. Companies in the natural resources </span><span>industry are at risk for environmental damage claims. Companies in the natural resources industry could be adversely </span><span>affected by commodity price volatility, changes in exchange rates, imposition of import controls and increased competition. </span><span>Companies in the natural resources industry may be adversely affected by depletion of natural resources, technological </span><span>developments, and labor relations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Pharmaceuticals Industry. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the pharmaceuticals industry are subject to competitive </span><span>forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may result in price discounting. The profitability of some </span><span>companies in the pharmaceuticals industry may be dependent on a relatively limited number of products. In addition, their </span><span>products can become obsolete due to industry innovation, changes in technologies or other market developments. Many </span><span>new products in the pharmaceuticals industry are subject to government approvals, regulation and reimbursement rates </span><span>which may affect companies' profitability. The process of obtaining government approvals may be long and costly. Many </span><span>companies in the pharmaceuticals industry are heavily dependent on patents and intellectual property rights. The loss or </span><span>impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Companies in the pharmaceutical </span><span>industry may be subject to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Real Estate Industry. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the real estate industry include companies that invest in real </span><span>estate, such as REITs, real estate holding and operating companies or real estate development companies (collectively, </span><span>“</span><span>Real </span><span>Estate Companies</span><span>”</span><span>). Investing in Real Estate Companies exposes investors to the risks of owning real estate directly, as well </span><span>as to risks that relate specifically to the way in which Real Estate Companies are organized and operated. The real estate </span><span>industry is highly sensitive to general and local economic conditions and developments, and characterized by intense </span><span>competition and periodic overbuilding. Investing in Real Estate Companies involves various risks. Some risks that are specific </span><span>to Real Estate Companies are discussed in greater detail below.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Concentration Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may own a limited number of properties and concentrate their investments in a </span><span>particular geographic region or property type. Economic downturns affecting a particular region, industry or property type </span><span>may lead to a high volume of defaults within a short period.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Distressed Investment Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may invest in distressed, defaulted or out-of-favor bank loans. </span><span>Identification and implementation by a Real Estate Company of loan modification and restructure programs involves a high </span><span>degree of uncertainty. Even successful implementation may still require adverse compromises and may not prevent </span><span>bankruptcy. Real Estate Companies may also invest in other debt instruments that may become non-performing, including </span><span>the securities of companies with higher credit and market risk due to financial or operational difficulties. Higher risk securities </span><span>may be less liquid and more volatile than the securities of companies not in distress.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Illiquidity Risk.</span><span> Investing in Real Estate Companies may involve risks similar to those associated with investing in small-capitalization</span><span> companies. Real Estate Company securities, like the securities of small-capitalization companies, may be more </span><span>volatile than, and perform differently from, shares of large-capitalization companies. There may be less trading in Real Estate </span><span>Company shares, which means that buy and sell transactions in those shares could have a magnified impact on share price, </span><span>resulting in abrupt or erratic price fluctuations. In addition, real estate is relatively illiquid, and, therefore, a Real Estate </span><span>Company may have a limited ability to vary or liquidate properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Interest Rate Risk.</span><span> Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could </span><span>negatively impact a Real Estate Company’s ability to meet its payment obligations. Declining interest rates could result in </span><span>increased prepayment on loans and require redeployment of capital in less desirable investments.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>29</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Leverage Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may use leverage (and some may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk </span><span>and could adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s operations and market value in periods of rising interest rates. Real Estate </span><span>Companies are also exposed to the risks normally associated with debt financing. Financial covenants related to a Real Estate </span><span>Company’s leverage may affect the ability of the Real Estate Company to operate effectively. In addition, real property may be </span><span>subject to the quality of credit extended and defaults by borrowers and tenants. If the properties do not generate sufficient </span><span>income to meet operating expenses, including, where applicable, debt service, ground lease payments, tenant improvements, </span><span>third-party leasing commissions and other capital expenditures, the income and ability of a Real Estate Company to make </span><span>payments of any interest and principal on its debt securities will be adversely affected.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Loan Foreclosure Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may foreclose on loans that the Real Estate Company originated and/or </span><span>acquired. Foreclosure may generate negative publicity for the underlying property that affects its market value. In addition to </span><span>the length and expense of such proceedings, the validity of the terms of the applicable loan may not be recognized in </span><span>foreclosure proceedings. Claims and defenses asserted by borrowers or other lenders may interfere with the enforcement of </span><span>rights by a Real Estate Company. Parallel proceedings, such as bankruptcy, may also delay resolution and limit the amount of </span><span>recovery on a foreclosed loan by a Real Estate Company even where the property underlying the loan is liquidated.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Management Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies are dependent upon management skills and may have limited financial resources. </span><span>Real Estate Companies are generally not diversified and may be subject to heavy cash flow dependency, default by borrowers </span><span>and voluntary liquidation. In addition, transactions between Real Estate Companies and their affiliates may be subject to </span><span>conflicts of interest, which may adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s shareholders. A Real Estate Company may also have </span><span>joint venture investments in certain of its properties, and, consequently, its ability to control decisions relating to such </span><span>properties may be limited.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Property Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may be subject to risks relating to functional obsolescence or reduced desirability of </span><span>properties; extended vacancies due to economic conditions and tenant bankruptcies; catastrophic events such as </span><span>earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts; and casualty or condemnation losses. Real estate income and values also may be </span><span>greatly affected by demographic trends, such as population shifts or changes in consumer preferences and values, or </span><span>increasing vacancies or declining rents resulting from legal, cultural, technological, global or local economic developments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Regulatory Risk.</span><span> Real estate income and values may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable domestic and foreign </span><span>laws (including tax laws). Government actions, such as tax increases, zoning law changes, mandated closures or other </span><span>commercial restrictions or environmental regulations, also may have a major impact on real estate income and values. In </span><span>addition, quarterly compliance with regulations limiting the proportion of asset types held by a U.S. REIT may force certain </span><span>Real Estate Companies to liquidate or restructure otherwise attractive investments. Some countries may not recognize REITs </span><span>or comparable structures as a viable form of real estate funds.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Underlying Investment Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies make investments in a variety of debt and equity instruments with </span><span>varying risk profiles. For instance, Real Estate Companies may invest in debt instruments secured by commercial property </span><span>that have higher risks of delinquency and foreclosure than loans on single family homes due to a variety of factors associated </span><span>with commercial property, including the tie between income available to service debt and productive use of the property. Real </span><span>Estate Companies may also invest in debt instruments and preferred equity that are junior in an issuer’s capital structure and </span><span>that involve privately negotiated structures. Subordinated debt investments, such as B-Notes and mezzanine loans, involve a </span><span>greater credit risk of default due to the need to service more senior debt of the issuer. Similarly, preferred equity investments </span><span>involve a greater risk of loss than conventional debt financing due to their non-collateralized nature and subordinated </span><span>ranking. Investments in commercial mortgage-backed securities may also be junior in priority in the event of bankruptcy or </span><span>similar proceedings. Investments in senior loans may be effectively subordinated if the senior loan is pledged as collateral. </span><span>The ability of a holder of junior claims to proceed against a defaulting issuer is circumscribed by the terms of the particular </span><span>contractual arrangement, which vary considerably from transaction to transaction.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>U.S. Tax Risk.</span><span> Certain U.S. Real Estate Companies are subject to special U.S. federal tax requirements. A REIT that fails to </span><span>comply with such tax requirements may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation, which may affect the value of the REIT </span><span>and the characterization of the REIT’s distributions. The U.S. federal tax requirement that a REIT distribute substantially all of </span><span>its net income to its shareholders may result in a REIT having insufficient capital for future expenditures. A REIT that </span><span>successfully maintains its qualification may still become subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes, including excise, </span><span>penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage recording, and transfer taxes, both directly and indirectly through its subsidiaries. </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>30</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Because REITs often do not provide complete tax information until after the calendar year-end, a Fund may at times need to </span><span>request permission to extend the deadline for issuing your tax reporting statement or supplement the information otherwise </span><span>provided to you.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Residential and Residential-Related REIT Sub-Industry. </span><span> </span><span>The Residential and Residential-Related </span><span>REIT Sub-Industry consists of REITs with exposure to residential real estate and certain types of commercial real estate that </span><span>complements residential real estate, including properties operated by healthcare providers and self-storage companies. In </span><span>addition to the risks related to REITs generally, investments in these REITs are subject to additional subsector-specific risks. </span><span>Residential real estate may be affected by unique supply and demand factors that do not apply to other REIT sub-sectors. In </span><span>addition, certain investors may already have exposure to residential real estate through ownership of a primary residence or </span><span>direct ownership of rental property. The value of healthcare-focused REITs may be affected by changes in federal or state </span><span>regulation of healthcare providers and reimbursement rates to healthcare providers under Medicare, Medicaid and other </span><span>public or private health insurance plans. Unlike less specialized commercial real estate, when tenants vacate healthcare-related</span><span> properties, the ability of property management to find replacement tenants may be impaired by the properties’ </span><span>specialized healthcare uses. Investments in self-storage REITs are subject to changes in demand levels for self-storage. In </span><span>addition, self-storage operators may be liable for unplanned environmental and hazardous waste compliance costs </span><span>associated with operating self-storage locations.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Semiconductor Industry. </span><span> </span><span>Semiconductor companies face intense competition, both domestically </span><span>and internationally; such competition may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Semiconductor companies may have </span><span>limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of semiconductor companies may face </span><span>obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction, unpredictable changes in </span><span>growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Capital equipment expenditures could be substantial </span><span>and equipment generally suffers from rapid obsolescence. Companies in the semiconductor industry are heavily dependent </span><span>on patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights would adversely affect the profitability of </span><span>these companies.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Technology Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Technology companies are characterized by periodic new product introductions, </span><span>innovations and evolving industry standards, and, as a result, face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, </span><span>which may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Companies in the technology sector are often smaller and less </span><span>experienced companies and may be subject to greater risks than larger companies; these risks may be heightened for </span><span>technology companies in foreign markets. Technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial </span><span>resources or personnel. The products of technology companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological </span><span>developments and frequent new product introduction, changes in consumer and business purchasing patterns, </span><span>unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. In addition, a rising interest </span><span>rate environment tends to negatively affect companies in the technology sector because, in such an environment, those </span><span>companies with high market valuations may appear less attractive to investors, which may cause sharp decreases in the </span><span>companies’ market prices. Companies in the technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property </span><span>rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Companies in the </span><span>technology sector are facing increased government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or </span><span>regulatory action. The technology sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which </span><span>may be influenced or characterized by unpredictable factors. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network </span><span>security breaches, certain companies in the technology sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of </span><span>proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Telecommunications Sector. </span><span> </span><span>The telecommunications sector of a country’s economy is often </span><span>subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with governmental regulations, delays or failure to </span><span>receive required regulatory approvals, or the enactment of new regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of </span><span>telecommunications companies. Government actions around the world, specifically in the area of pre-marketing clearance of </span><span>products and prices, can be arbitrary and unpredictable. Companies in the telecommunications sector may experience </span><span>distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition, particularly in </span><span>developing new products and services using new technology. Technological innovations may make the products and services </span><span>of certain telecommunications companies obsolete. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network security </span><span>breaches, certain companies in the telecommunications sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of </span><span>proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>31</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Utilities Sector. </span><span> </span><span>The utilities sector may be adversely affected by changing commodity prices, </span><span>government regulation stipulating rates charged by utilities, increased tariffs, changes in tax laws, interest rate fluctuations </span><span>and changes in the cost of providing specific utility services. The utilities industry is also subject to potential terrorist attacks, </span><span>natural disasters and severe weather conditions, as well as regulatory and operational burdens associated with the operation </span><span>and maintenance of nuclear facilities. Government regulators monitor and control utility revenues and costs, and therefore </span><span>may limit utility profits. In certain countries, regulatory authorities may also restrict a company’s access to new markets, </span><span>thereby diminishing the company’s long-term prospects.</span></div> <div> <div><span>There are substantial differences among the regulatory practices and policies of various jurisdictions, and any regulatory </span><span>agency may make major shifts in policy from time to time. There is no assurance that regulatory authorities will, in the future, </span><span>grant rate increases. Additionally, existing and possible future regulatory legislation may make it even more difficult for </span><span>utilities to obtain adequate relief. Certain of the issuers of securities held in a Fund's portfolio may own or operate nuclear </span><span>generating facilities. Governmental authorities may from time to time review existing policies and impose additional </span><span>requirements governing the licensing, construction and operation of nuclear power plants. Prolonged changes in climate </span><span>conditions can also have a significant impact on both the revenues of an electric and gas utility as well as the expenses of a </span><span>utility, particularly a hydro-based electric utility.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The rates that traditional regulated utility companies may charge their customers generally are subject to review and </span><span>limitation by governmental regulatory commissions. Rate changes may occur only after a prolonged approval period or may </span><span>not occur at all, which could adversely affect utility companies when costs are rising. The value of regulated utility debt </span><span>securities (and, to a lesser extent, equity securities) tends to have an inverse relationship to the movement of interest rates. </span><span>Certain utility companies have experienced full or partial deregulation in recent years. These utility companies are frequently </span><span>more similar to industrial companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been permitted by regulators to </span><span>diversify outside of their original geographic regions and their traditional lines of business. As a result, some companies may </span><span>be forced to defend their core business and may be less profitable. Deregulation may also permit a utility company to expand </span><span>outside of its traditional lines of business and engage in riskier ventures.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Proxy Voting Policy</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For the Funds, the Board has delegated the voting of proxies for each Fund’s securities to BFA pursuant to the Funds' Proxy </span><span>Voting Policy, and BFA has adopted policies and procedures (collectively, the </span><span>“</span><span>iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policies</span><span>”</span><span>) governing </span><span>proxy voting by accounts managed by BFA, including the Funds.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Under the iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policies, BFA will vote proxies related to Fund securities in the best interests of a Fund </span><span>and its shareholders. From time to time, a vote may present a conflict between the interests of a Fund’s shareholders, on the </span><span>one hand, and those of BFA, or any affiliated person of a Fund or BFA, on the other. BFA maintains policies and procedures </span><span>that are designed to prevent undue influence on BFA’s proxy voting activity that might stem from any relationship between </span><span>the issuer of a proxy (or any dissident shareholder) and BFA, BFA’s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund’s affiliates. Most conflicts are </span><span>managed through a structural separation of BFA’s Corporate Governance Group from BFA’s employees with sales and client </span><span>responsibilities. In addition, BFA maintains procedures to ensure that all engagements with corporate issuers or dissident </span><span>shareholders are managed consistently and without regard to BFA’s relationship with the issuer of the proxy or the dissident </span><span>shareholder. In certain instances, BFA may determine to engage an independent fiduciary to vote proxies as a further </span><span>safeguard to avoid potential conflicts of interest or as otherwise required by applicable law.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Copies of the iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policies are attached as Appendix A.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Information with respect to how proxies relating to the Funds' portfolio securities were voted during the 12-month period </span><span>ended June 30 is available: (i) without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or through the Funds' </span><span>website at www.iShares.com; and (ii) on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Portfolio Holdings Information</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>On each Business Day (as defined in the </span><span>Creation and Redemption of Creation Units</span><span> section of this SAI), prior to the opening </span><span>of regular trading on the Fund’s primary listing exchange, a Fund discloses on its website (</span><span>www.iShares.com</span><span>) certain </span><span>information relating to the portfolio holdings that will form the basis of a Fund’s next net asset value per share calculation.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>32</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

For certain of these indices, the relevant fund may be the first or sole </span><span>user of the underlying index. In its sole discretion, the index provider determines the composition of the securities and other </span><span>instruments in such underlying index, the rebalance protocols of the underlying index, the weightings of the securities and </span><span>other instruments in the underlying index, and any updates to the methodology.

The impact of a </span><span>component’s price change is proportional to the issue’s total market value, which is the share price multiplied by the number </span><span>of shares outstanding. Each Underlying Index is adjusted to reflect changes in capitalization resulting from mergers, </span><span>acquisitions, stock rights, substitutions and other capital events. Each of the Underlying Indexes (subject to any applicable </span><span>capping as described below) is a free-float adjusted market capitalization-weighted index, so the impact of a component’s </span><span>price change is proportional to the component’s free-float adjusted market value, which is the share price multiplied by the </span><span>number of float-adjusted shares outstanding. S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC (</span><span>“</span><span>SPDJI</span><span>”</span><span>) defines the free-float of a security as the </span><span>proportion of shares outstanding that are deemed to be available for purchase in the public equity markets by investors. In </span><span>practice, limitations on free-float available to investors include: cross ownership (shares that are owned by other companies), </span><span>ownership by governments (central or municipal) or their agencies, certain substantial levels of private ownership (by </span><span>individuals, families or charitable trusts and foundations), and restricted shares. Under SPDJI's free-float adjustment </span><span>methodology, a company’s outstanding shares are adjusted if, and only if, an entity in any of the four qualified categories </span><span>listed above owns 5% or more of the company. The company’s shares will not be adjusted if the block ownership is less than </span><span>5%. A constituent’s inclusion factor is equal to its estimated percentage of free-float shares outstanding. For example, a </span><span>constituent security with a free-float of 67% will be included in the index at 67% of its market capitalization. However, a </span><span>company’s outstanding shares are not adjusted by institutional investors’ holdings, which include, but are not limited to, the </span><span>following categories: custodian nominees, trustee companies, mutual funds (open-end and closed-end funds), and other </span><span>investment companies.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Index Availability.</span><span> The Underlying Indexes are calculated continuously and are available from major data vendors.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Component Selection Criteria.</span><span> The following indexes are collectively referred to herein as the </span><span>“</span><span>Dow Jones U.S. Select Sectors </span><span>Specialty Indexes</span><span>”</span><span>: Dow Jones U.S. Select Aerospace &amp; Defense Index, Dow Jones U.S. Select Health Care Providers Index, </span><span>Dow Jones U.S. Select Home Construction Index, Dow Jones U.S. Select Insurance Index, Dow Jones U.S. Select Investment </span><span>Services Index, Dow Jones U.S. Select Medical Equipment Index, Dow Jones U.S. Select Oil Equipment &amp; Services Index, Dow </span><span>Jones U.S. Select Oil Exploration &amp; Production Index, Dow Jones U.S. Select Pharmaceuticals Index and Dow Jones U.S. Select </span><span>Regional Banks Index.

The JPX-Nikkei </span><span>400 Net Total Return Index is constructed based on market capitalization adjusted by free-float weight. Free-float weight is </span><span>the percentage of listed shares deemed to be available for trading in the market. As a general matter, shares held by the top </span><span>10 major shareholders, treasury and other similar shares, shares held by board members and other representatives, shares </span><span>held for policy purposes (so-called </span><span>“</span><span>strategic shareholdings</span><span>”</span><span>), and other shares deemed by the JPX Group and the Nikkei to </span><span>be unavailable for trading in the market are considered to be non-free float shares.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Eligibility.</span><span> Underlying Index eligibility is limited to (i) common stocks traded primarily on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Prime </span><span>Market, Standard Market or Growth Market and (ii) Tokyo Stock Exchange Prime Market, Standard Market or Growth </span><span>Market-listed securities other than common stocks that are regarded by the JPX Group and the Nikkei as equivalent to </span><span>common stocks in each case if their inclusion is deemed to be particularly necessary- as determined by the JPX Group and </span><span>the Nikkei.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Index Maintenance and Issue Changes. </span><span>The constituents are reviewed annually at the end of August.

The impact of a component </span><span>security’s price change is proportional to the issuer’s total market value, which is the share price times the number of shares </span><span>available. Each Russell Index is adjusted to reflect changes in capitalization resulting from mergers, acquisitions, stock rights, </span><span>substitutions and other capital events.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Frank Russell Company uses a probability measure to assign stocks to the growth and value style indexes. The probability </span><span>measure is used to indicate the degree of certainty that a stock is value or growth, based on three fundamental indicators: </span><span>relative price-to-book (</span><span>“</span><span>PB</span><span>”</span><span>) ratio, Institutional Brokers’ Estimate System forecast medium-term growth (2 years) and sales </span><span>per share historical growth (5 years). This method allows stocks to be represented as having both growth and value </span><span>characteristics, while preserving the additive nature of the indexes. As a result, a stock may be a component of a Russell </span><span>growth style index and also a component of the corresponding value style index, although the stock would likely have a </span><span>different weight in each index.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Issue Changes.</span><span> Securities that leave the Russell Indexes between reconstitution dates are not replaced. Thus, the number of </span><span>securities in the investments over the year will fluctuate according to corporate activity. When a stock is acquired, delisted or </span><span>moves to the pink sheets or OTC bulletin boards, the stock is deleted from the relevant indexes.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When acquisitions or mergers take place, the stock’s capitalization moves to the acquiring stock, hence, mergers have no </span><span>effect on index total capitalization if the acquiring stock is part of the index. The only additions between reconstitution dates </span><span>are as a result of spin-offs and IPOs.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Issue Changes for the Focused Value Select Index.</span><span> The Focused Value Select Index will be reviewed monthly, with changes </span><span>being implemented after the close of the 6</span><span>th</span><span> business day.

The Parent Index is a subset of the Russell 1000 Index, which measures the performance of the </span><span>large- and mid-capitalization segments of the U.S. equity market. The Underlying Index is reviewed monthly using an </span><span>optimization process designed to maximize, in aggregate, the Underlying Index’s exposure to the weighted combination of </span><span>five target investment style factors (momentum, value, quality, size, and low volatility) while maintaining total risk similar to </span><span>that of the Parent Index. The value score is calculated from the following value factor metrics: 12-month trailing book-to-price,</span><span> dividend yield, earnings yield and cash flow yield (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, cash flow divided by the full market capitalization).

The optimizer selects securities </span><span>from the Parent Index and assigns weights such that the optimization objective and constraints are best satisfied.

Issuers (</span><span>i.e</span><span>., the </span><span>“</span><span>components</span><span>”</span><span>) selected for the </span><span>S&amp;P U.S. indexes represent a broad range of industry segments within the U.S. economy. The starting universe of publicly </span><span>traded U.S. issuers classified by the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS</span><span>®</span><span>) is screened to eliminate ADRs, mutual </span><span>funds, limited partnerships, royalty trusts, certain holding issuers, OTC bulletin board issues, pink sheet-listed issues, closed-end</span><span> funds, ETFs and tracking stocks. REITs, except for mortgage REITs, are eligible for inclusion in the Indexes. The stock of </span><span>each constituent must trade on either the NYSE, the NYSE Amex Equities or on NASDAQ. Additionally, only one share class </span><span>per constituent will be included in an Index. The share class is selected by SPDJI and is generally defined as the largest, most </span><span>liquid share class. Issuers with multiple share classes will have the classes combined for purposes of calculation of market </span><span>capitalization. The following criteria are then analyzed to determine an issuer’s eligibility for inclusion in the S&amp;P Indexes: (i) </span><span>ownership of an issuer’s outstanding common stock, in order to screen out closely held issuers; (ii) trading volume of an </span><span>issuer’s shares, in order to ensure ample liquidity and efficient share pricing; and (iii) the financial and operating condition of </span><span>an issuer.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The S&amp;P DJI’s Indices are capitalization-weighted, based on the following formula: number of outstanding shares of a </span><span>constituent (as determined by the float-adjusted market capitalization using SPDJI’s methodology) multiplied by the </span><span>constituent’s share price. Issuers with float-adjusted market capitalizations below certain thresholds are not eligible for the </span><span>Indexes. In addition, the market capitalization of an issuer eligible for inclusion typically must be greater than the Index’s </span><span>minimum market capitalization at the time it is being considered for Index inclusion. The market capitalizations of an Index’s </span><span>components are adjusted to reflect changes in capitalization resulting from mergers, acquisitions, stock rights, substitutions </span><span>and other capital events. The market capitalizations of an Index’s constituent are adjusted for all strategic holdings, including </span><span>private, corporate, and government holdings.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Component Selection Criteria for International Indexes.</span><span> </span><span>Stocks are eligible for the S&amp;P Global Indices if they meet criteria for </span><span>size, liquidity, profitability, and sector and market representation. Each of the S&amp;P Global Indices is balanced across country </span><span>and sector weights in the region/market. The S&amp;P Global Indices begin with an eligible investable universe of stocks covering </span><span>approximately 95% of each country’s total market capitalization. In some cases, the S&amp;P Global Indexes may include ADRs </span><span>and GDRs. Stocks with relatively small market capitalization or insufficient liquidity are excluded by SPDJI. To identify a </span><span>candidate pool for index constituent selection, all stocks are carefully examined using a set of general criteria. The specific </span><span>securities are then screened for industry sector classification; thus, the eligible securities are ranked according to GICS. Then, </span><span>the Index components, now determined, are weighted on the basis of SPDJI’s float-adjusted, market capitalization </span><span>methodology. Generally, SPDJI observes a prospective constituent’s liquidity over a period of at least twelve months before </span><span>consideration for inclusion. However, there may be extraordinary situations when issuers should be added immediately (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, </span><span>certain privatizations). When a particular issuer dominates its home market, it may be excluded from an Index if analysis of </span><span>the sectors reveals that its securities are not as liquid as those of similar issuers in other countries. Once a year, the float </span><span>adjustments will be reviewed and potentially changed based on such review. The values of an Index’s components are </span><span>adjusted to reflect changes in capitalization resulting from mergers, acquisitions, stock rights, substitutions and other capital </span><span>events. The market capitalization of index constituent issuers is adjusted for all strategic holdings, including private, </span><span>corporate, and government holdings.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>48</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>With respect to the non-U.S. components of the S&amp;P Global Indexes, the eligible universe of index components that are </span><span>considered for inclusion are from the following S&amp;P DJI Indices: (i) the S&amp;P/TSX 60 (Toronto Stock Exchange), which </span><span>represents the liquid, large-cap stocks of the publicly listed issuers in the Canadian equities market; (ii) the S&amp;P/TOPIX 150 </span><span>(TSE) which represents the liquid, large-cap stocks of the publicly listed issuers in the Japanese equities market; (iii) S&amp;P/ASX </span><span>All-Australian 50 Index (Australian Stock Exchange), which represents the liquid, large-cap stocks in the Australian equities </span><span>market; (iv) the S&amp;P Asia 50, which represents the liquid, large-cap stocks of four major equities markets in Asia (Hong Kong, </span><span>South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore); (v) the S&amp;P Latin America 40, which represents the liquid, large-cap stocks from major </span><span>sectors of the Mexico, Brazil, Peru, Colombia and Chilé equity markets; and (vi) the S&amp;P Europe 350, which represents the </span><span>liquid, large-cap stocks of the publicly listed issuers in the region, covering approximately 70% of the region’s market </span><span>capitalization.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Issue Changes.</span><span> </span><span>General oversight responsibility for the S&amp;P DJI Indices, including overall policy guidelines and methodology, </span><span>is handled by the S&amp;P Global Index Committee. Maintenance of component investments, including additions and deletions to </span><span>these investments, is the responsibility of separate regional index committees composed of S&amp;P staff specialized in the </span><span>various regional equity markets and, in some cases, with the assistance of local stock exchanges. Public announcements of </span><span>index changes as the result of committee decisions will generally be made two business days in advance of the anticipated </span><span>effective date whenever possible, although for exceptional corporate events announcements may be made earlier.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Index Maintenance.</span><span> </span><span>Maintaining the S&amp;P DJI Indices includes monitoring and completing the adjustments for issuer </span><span>additions and deletions, share changes, stock splits, stock dividends, and stock price adjustments due to restructuring and </span><span>spin-offs. An issuer will be removed from the S&amp;P DJI Indices as a result of mergers/acquisitions, bankruptcy, or </span><span>restructuring. An issuer is removed from the relevant index as close as possible to the actual date on which the event </span><span>occurred. An issuer can be removed from an index because it no longer meets current criteria for inclusion and/or is no </span><span>longer representative of its industry group. All replacement issuers are selected based on the above component section </span><span>criteria.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When calculating index weights, individual components shares held by governments, corporations, strategic partners, or </span><span>other control groups are excluded from the issuer’s shares outstanding. Shares owned by other issuers are also excluded </span><span>regardless of whether they are index components. In countries with regulated environments, where a foreign investment </span><span>limit exists at the sector or issuer level, the constituent’s weight will reflect either the foreign investment limit or the </span><span>percentage float, whichever is the more restrictive.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Each issuer’s financial statements will be used to update the major shareholders’ ownership. However, during the course of </span><span>the year, SPDJI also monitors each issuer’s Investable Weight Factor (</span><span>“</span><span>IWF</span><span>”</span><span>) which is SPDJI’s term for the mathematical float </span><span>factor used to calculate the float adjustment. If a change in IWF is caused by a major corporate action (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, privatization, </span><span>merger, takeover, or share offering) and the change equal to or greater than 5%, a float adjustment will be implemented as </span><span>soon as reasonably possible.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Changes in the number of shares outstanding driven by corporate events such as stock dividends, splits, and rights issues </span><span>will be adjusted on the ex-date. Share changes of 5% or greater are implemented when they occur. Share changes of less </span><span>than 5% are only updated on a quarterly basis on the Friday near the end of the calendar quarter. Generally, index changes </span><span>due to rebalancing are announced two days before the effective date by way of a news release posted on </span><span>www.us.spindices.com.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Index Availability.</span><span> The S&amp;P Indexes are calculated continuously and are available from major data vendors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Exchange Rates. </span><span>SPDJI uses the World Markets/Reuters Closing Spot Rates taken at 4:00 p.m. London time</span><span> </span><span>for the following </span><span>funds:</span><span> </span><span>iShares ESG Screened S&amp;P 500 ETF, iShares ESG Screened S&amp;P Mid-Cap ETF, iShares ESG Screened S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF, </span><span>iShares Europe ETF, iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF, iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF, iShares North American </span><span>Natural Resources ETF and iShares U.S. Digital Infrastructure and Real Estate ETF.

The SEC staff has taken the position that investment of 25% or </span><span>more of a fund’s total assets in one or more issuers conducting their principal activities in the same industry or group of </span><span>industries constitutes concentration. It is possible that interpretations of concentration could change in the future. The policy </span><span>in (1) above will be interpreted to refer to concentration as that term may be interpreted from time to time. The policy also </span><span>will be interpreted to permit investment without limit in the following: securities of the U.S. government and its agencies or </span><span>instrumentalities; securities of state, territory, possession or municipal governments and their authorities, agencies, </span><span>instrumentalities or political subdivisions; and repurchase agreements collateralized by any such obligations. Accordingly, </span><span>issuers of the foregoing securities will not be considered to be members of any industry. There also will be no limit on </span><span>investment in issuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or country. Finance companies will be considered to be in the </span><span>industries of their parents if their activities are primarily related to financing the activities of the parents. Each foreign </span><span>government will be considered to be a member of a separate industry. With respect to a Fund's industry classifications, each </span><span>Fund currently utilizes any one or more of the industry sub-classifications used by one or more widely recognized market </span><span>indexes or rating group indexes, and/or as defined by Fund management. The policy also will be interpreted to give broad </span><span>authority to a Fund as to how to classify issuers within or among industries.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to borrowing money set forth in (2) above, the Investment Company Act </span><span>permits each Fund to borrow money in amounts of up to one-third of the Fund's total assets from banks for any purpose, </span><span>and to borrow up to 5% of the Fund's total assets from banks or other lenders for temporary purposes. (The Fund's total </span><span>assets include the amounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks attendant to borrowing, the Investment Company Act requires </span><span>each Fund to maintain at all times an </span><span>“</span><span>asset coverage</span><span>”</span><span> of at least 300% of the amount of its borrowings. Asset coverage </span><span>means the ratio that the value of each Fund’s total assets (including amounts borrowed), minus liabilities other than </span><span>borrowings, bears to the aggregate amount of all borrowings. Borrowing money to increase portfolio holdings is known as </span><span>“</span><span>leveraging.</span><span>”</span><span> Certain trading practices and investments, such as reverse repurchase agreements, may be considered to be </span><span>borrowings or involve leverage and thus are subject to the Investment Company Act restrictions. In accordance with Rule 18f-4</span><span> under the Investment Company Act, when each Fund engages in reverse repurchase agreements and similar financing </span><span>transactions, the Fund may either (i) maintain asset coverage of at least 300% with respect to such transactions and any </span><span>other borrowings in the aggregate, or (ii) treat such transactions as </span><span>“</span><span>derivatives transactions</span><span>”</span><span> and comply with Rule 18f-4 </span><span>with respect to such transactions. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and </span><span>arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered to be borrowings under the policy. Practices and </span><span>investments that may involve leverage but are not considered to be borrowings are not subject to the policy.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to underwriting set forth in (5) above, the Investment Company Act does not </span><span>prohibit a fund from engaging in the underwriting business or from underwriting the securities of other issuers; in fact, in the </span><span>case of diversified funds, the Investment Company Act permits a fund to have underwriting commitments of up to 25% of its </span><span>assets under certain circumstances. Those circumstances currently are that the amount of a fund’s underwriting </span><span>commitments, when added to the value of a fund’s investments in issuers where a fund owns more than 10% of the </span><span>outstanding voting securities of those issuers, cannot exceed the 25% cap. A fund engaging in transactions involving the </span><span>acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act. Although it is </span><span>not believed that the application of the 1933 Act provisions described above would cause a fund to be engaged in the </span><span>business of underwriting, the policy in (5) above will be interpreted not to prevent a fund from engaging in transactions </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>57</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

A determination of whether one is an underwriter for purposes of the 1933 Act must take into account all of the </span><span>facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the broker-dealer or its client in the particular case and the examples </span><span>mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that could lead to a categorization as </span><span>an underwriter.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Broker-dealer firms should also note that dealers who are not </span><span>“</span><span>underwriters</span><span>”</span><span> but are effecting transactions in shares, </span><span>whether or not participating in the distribution of shares, generally are required to deliver a prospectus. This is because the </span><span>prospectus delivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act is not available in respect of such transactions as a result of </span><span>Section 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that incur a prospectus delivery obligation with respect to shares of the Funds are </span><span>reminded that, pursuant to Rule 153 under the 1933 Act, a prospectus delivery obligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the 1933 </span><span>Act owed to an exchange member in connection with a sale on the Listing Exchange generally is satisfied by the fact that the </span><span>prospectus is available at the Listing Exchange upon request. The prospectus delivery mechanism provided in Rule 153 is </span><span>available only with respect to transactions on an exchange.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Management</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Trustees and Officers. </span><span> </span><span>The Board has responsibility for the overall management and operations of the Funds, including </span><span>general supervision of the duties performed by BFA and other service providers. Each Trustee serves until he or she resigns, is </span><span>removed, dies, retires or becomes incapacitated. Each officer shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and </span><span>qualifies or until his or her death, resignation or removal. Trustees who are not </span><span>“</span><span>interested persons</span><span>”</span><span> (as defined in the 1940 </span><span>Act) of the Trust are referred to as independent trustees (</span><span>“</span><span>Independent Trustees</span><span>”</span><span>).</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The registered investment companies advised by BFA or its affiliates (the </span><span>“</span><span>BlackRock-advised Funds</span><span>”</span><span>) are organized into one </span><span>complex of open-end equity, multi-asset, index and money market funds and ETFs (the </span><span>“</span><span>BlackRock Multi-Asset Complex</span><span>”</span><span>), </span><span>one complex of closed-end funds and open-end non-index fixed-income funds (including ETFs) (the </span><span>“</span><span>BlackRock Fixed-Income</span><span> Complex</span><span>”</span><span>) and one complex of ETFs (</span><span>“</span><span>Exchange-Traded Fund Complex</span><span>”</span><span>) (each, a </span><span>“</span><span>BlackRock Fund Complex</span><span>”</span><span>). Each </span><span>Fund is included in the Exchange-Traded Fund Complex. Each Trustee also serves as a Director of iShares, Inc. and a Trustee </span><span>of iShares U.S. ETF Trust and, as a result, oversees all of the funds within the Exchange-Traded Fund Complex, which consists </span><span>of 387 funds as of August 1, 2023. With the exception of Stephen Cohen, Robert S. Kapito and Aaron Wasserman, the </span><span>address of each Trustee and officer is c/o BlackRock, Inc., 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. The address of Mr. </span><span>Kapito and Mr. Wasserman is c/o BlackRock, Inc., 50 Hudson Yards, New York, NY 10001. The address of Mr. Cohen is c/o </span><span>BlackRock, Inc., Drapers Gardens, 12 Throgmorton Avenue, London EC2N 2DL United Kingdom. The Board has designated </span><span>John E.

The Board has engaged BFA to manage the Funds on a </span><span>day-to-day basis. The Board is responsible for overseeing BFA and other service providers in the operations of the Funds in </span><span>accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, applicable provisions of state and other laws and the Trust’s charter. The </span><span>Board is currently composed of eleven members, nine of whom are Independent Trustees. The Board currently conducts </span><span>regular in person meetings four times a year. In addition, the Board frequently holds special in person or telephonic meetings </span><span>or informal conference calls to discuss specific matters that may arise or require action between regular meetings. The </span><span>Independent Trustees meet regularly outside the presence of management, in executive session or with other service </span><span>providers to the Trust.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Board has appointed an Independent Trustee to serve in the role of Board Chair. The Board Chair’s role is to preside at all </span><span>meetings of the Board and to act as a liaison with service providers, officers, attorneys, and other Trustees generally between </span><span>meetings. The Board Chair may also perform such other functions as may be delegated by the Board from time to time. The </span><span>Board has established seven standing Committees: a Nominating and Governance Committee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c) </span><span>Committee, a Securities Lending Committee, a Risk Committee, an Equity Plus Committee and a Fixed Income Plus </span><span>Committee to assist the Board in the oversight and direction of the business and affairs of the Funds, and from time to time </span><span>the Board may establish ad hoc committees or informal working groups to review and address the policies and practices of </span><span>the Funds with respect to certain specified matters. The Chair of each standing Committee is an Independent Trustee. The </span><span>role of the Chair of each Committee is to preside at all meetings of the Committee and to act as a liaison with service </span><span>providers, officers, attorneys and other Trustees between meetings. Each standing Committee meets regularly to conduct the </span><span>oversight functions delegated to the Committee by the Board and reports its finding to the Board. The Board and each </span><span>standing Committee conduct annual assessments of their oversight function and structure. The Board has determined that </span><span>the Board’s leadership structure is appropriate because it allows the Board to exercise independent judgment over </span><span>management and it allocates areas of responsibility among committees of Independent Trustees and the full Board to </span><span>enhance effective oversight.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Day-to-day risk management with respect to the Funds is the responsibility of BFA or other service providers (depending on </span><span>the nature of the risk), subject to the supervision of BFA. Each Fund is subject to a number of risks, including investment, </span><span>compliance, operational, reputational, counterparty and valuation risks, among others. While there are a number of risk </span><span>management functions performed by BFA and other service providers, as applicable, it is not possible to identify and </span><span>eliminate all of the risks applicable to the Funds. The Trustees have an oversight role in this area, satisfying themselves that </span><span>risk management processes and controls are in place and operating effectively. Risk oversight forms part of the Board’s </span><span>general oversight of each Fund and is addressed as part of various Board and committee activities. In some cases, risk </span><span>management issues are specifically addressed in presentations and discussions. For example, BFA has an independent </span><span>dedicated Risk and Quantitative Analysis Group (</span><span>“</span><span>RQA</span><span>”</span><span>) that assists BFA in managing fiduciary and corporate risks, including </span><span>investment, operational, counterparty credit and enterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet with the Board to discuss their </span><span>analysis and methodologies, as well as specific risk topics such as operational and counterparty risks relating to the Funds. </span><span>The Board, directly or through a committee, also reviews reports from, among others, management and the independent </span><span>registered public accounting firm for the Trust, as appropriate, regarding risks faced by each Fund and management’s risk </span><span>functions. The Board has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer who oversees the implementation and testing of the Trust's </span><span>compliance program, including assessments by independent third parties, and reports to the Board regarding compliance </span><span>matters for the Trust and its principal service providers. In testing and maintaining the compliance program, the Chief </span><span>Compliance Officer (and his or her delegates) assesses key compliance risks affecting each Fund, and addresses them in </span><span>periodic reports to the Board.

(collectively </span><span>referred to in this section as </span><span>“</span><span>BlackRock</span><span>”</span><span>) and their respective directors, officers and employees, with respect to the Funds </span><span>and/or other accounts managed by BlackRock, may give rise to actual or perceived conflicts of interest such as those </span><span>described below.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock is one of the world's largest asset management firms. BlackRock, its subsidiaries and their respective directors, </span><span>officers and employees, including the business units or entities and personnel who may be involved in the investment </span><span>activities and business operations of a Fund, are engaged worldwide in businesses, including managing equities, fixed-income</span><span> securities, cash and alternative investments, and have interests other than that of managing the Funds. These are </span><span>considerations of which investors in a Fund should be aware, and which may cause conflicts of interest that could </span><span>disadvantage a Fund and its shareholders. These businesses and interests include potential multiple advisory, financial and </span><span>other relationships with, or interests in, companies and interests in securities or other instruments that may be purchased or </span><span>sold by a Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock has proprietary interests in, and may manage or advise with respect to, accounts or funds (including separate </span><span>accounts and other funds and collective investment vehicles) that have investment objectives similar to those of a Fund </span><span>and/or that engage in transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and instruments as the Funds. BlackRock is </span><span>also a major participant in the global currency, equities, swap and fixed income markets, in each case, for the accounts of </span><span>clients and, in some cases, on a proprietary basis. As such, BlackRock is or may be actively engaged in transactions in the </span><span>same securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests. Such activities could affect the prices and availability of </span><span>the securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests, which could have an adverse impact on a Fund's </span><span>performance. Such transactions, particularly in respect of most proprietary accounts or client accounts, will be executed </span><span>independently of a Fund's transactions and thus at prices or rates that may be more or less favorable than those obtained by </span><span>the Funds.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When BlackRock seeks to purchase or sell the same assets for managed accounts, including a Fund, the assets actually </span><span>purchased or sold may be allocated among the accounts on a basis determined in its good faith discretion to be equitable. In </span><span>some cases, this system may adversely affect the size or price of the assets purchased or sold for a Fund. In addition, </span><span>transactions in investments by one or more other accounts managed by BlackRock may have the effect of diluting or </span><span>otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of a Fund, particularly, but not limited to, with respect to </span><span>small-capitalization, emerging market or less liquid strategies. This may occur with respect to BlackRock-advised accounts </span><span>when investment decisions regarding a Fund are based on research or other information that is also used to support </span><span>decisions for other accounts. When BlackRock implements a portfolio decision or strategy on behalf of another account </span><span>ahead of, or contemporaneously with, similar decisions or strategies for a Fund, market impact, liquidity constraints, or other </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>100</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>factors could result in the Fund receiving less favorable trading results and the costs of implementing such decisions or </span><span>strategies could be increased or the Fund could otherwise be disadvantaged. BlackRock may, in certain cases, elect to </span><span>implement internal policies and procedures designed to limit such consequences, which may cause a Fund to be unable to </span><span>engage in certain activities, including purchasing or disposing of securities, when it might otherwise be desirable for it to do </span><span>so.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Conflicts may also arise because portfolio decisions regarding a Fund may benefit other accounts managed by BlackRock. For </span><span>example, the sale of a long position or establishment of a short position by a Fund may impair the price of the same security </span><span>sold short by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its other accounts or funds, and the purchase of a security or covering of a </span><span>short position in a security by a Fund may increase the price of the same security held by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or </span><span>its other accounts or funds. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, certain Funds may invest their assets in </span><span>other funds advised by BlackRock, including funds that are managed by one or more of the same portfolio managers, which </span><span>could result in conflicts of interest relating to asset allocation, timing of Fund purchases and sales, and increased </span><span>remuneration and profitability for BlackRock, and/or its personnel, including portfolio managers.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In certain circumstances, BlackRock, on behalf of the Funds, may seek to buy from or sell securities to another fund or </span><span>account advised by BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is not required to) effect purchases and sales between BlackRock clients </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>cross trades</span><span>”</span><span>), including the Funds, if BlackRock believes such transactions are appropriate based on each party's </span><span>investment objectives and guidelines, subject to applicable law and regulation. There may be potential conflicts of interest or </span><span>regulatory issues relating to these transactions which could limit BlackRock’s decision to engage in these transactions for the </span><span>Funds. BlackRock may have a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities to the parties in such </span><span>transactions. On any occasion when a Fund participates in a cross trade, BlackRock will comply with procedures adopted </span><span>under applicable rules and SEC guidance.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock and its clients may pursue or enforce rights with respect to an issuer in which a Fund has invested, and those </span><span>activities may have an adverse effect on the Fund. As a result, prices, availability, liquidity and terms of a Fund's investments </span><span>may be negatively impacted by the activities of BlackRock or its clients, and transactions for the Fund may be impaired or </span><span>effected at prices or terms that may be less favorable than would otherwise have been the case.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The results of a Fund’s investment activities may differ significantly from the results achieved by BlackRock for its proprietary </span><span>accounts or other accounts (including investment companies or collective investment vehicles) which it manages or advises. </span><span>It is possible that one or more accounts managed or advised by BlackRock and such other accounts will achieve investment </span><span>results that are substantially more or less favorable than the results achieved by a Fund. Moreover, it is possible that a Fund </span><span>will sustain losses during periods in which one or more proprietary or other accounts managed or advised by BlackRock </span><span>achieve significant profits. The opposite result is also possible.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>From time to time, a Fund may be restricted from purchasing or selling securities, or from engaging in other investment </span><span>activities because of regulatory, legal or contractual requirements applicable to BlackRock or other accounts managed or </span><span>advised by BlackRock, and/or the internal policies of BlackRock designed to comply with such requirements. As a result, </span><span>there may be periods, for example, when BlackRock will not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions in certain </span><span>securities or instruments with respect to which BlackRock is performing services or when position limits have been reached. </span><span>For example, the investment activities of BlackRock for its proprietary accounts and accounts under its management may </span><span>limit the investment opportunities for a Fund in certain emerging and other markets in which limitations are imposed upon </span><span>the amount of investment, in the aggregate or in individual issuers, by affiliated foreign investors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In connection with its management of a Fund, BlackRock may have access to certain fundamental analysis and proprietary </span><span>technical models developed by BlackRock. BlackRock will not be under any obligation, however, to effect transactions on </span><span>behalf of a Fund in accordance with such analysis and models. In addition, BlackRock will not have any obligation to make </span><span>available any information regarding its proprietary activities or strategies, or the activities or strategies used for other </span><span>accounts managed by them, for the benefit of the management of a Fund and it is not anticipated that BlackRock will have </span><span>access to such information for the purpose of managing the Fund. The proprietary activities or portfolio strategies of </span><span>BlackRock, or the activities or strategies used for accounts managed by BlackRock or other client accounts could conflict </span><span>with the transactions and strategies employed by BlackRock in managing a Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Funds may be included in investment models developed by BlackRock for use by clients and financial advisors. To the </span><span>extent clients invest in these investment models and increase the assets under management of the Funds, the investment </span><span>management fee amounts paid by the Funds to BlackRock may also increase. The price, availability and liquidity of a Fund </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>101</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>may be impacted by purchases and sales of the Fund by model-driven investment portfolios, as well as by BlackRock itself </span><span>and by its advisory clients.</span></div> <div> <div><span>In addition, certain principals and certain employees of a Fund’s investment adviser are also principals or employees of other </span><span>business units or entities within BlackRock. As a result, these principals and employees may have obligations to such other </span><span>business units or entities or their clients and such obligations to other business units or entities or their clients may be a </span><span>consideration of which investors in a Fund should be aware.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock may enter into transactions and invest in securities, instruments and currencies on behalf of a Fund in which </span><span>clients of BlackRock or, to the extent permitted by the SEC and applicable law, BlackRock serves as the counterparty, principal </span><span>or issuer. In such cases, such party's interests in the transaction will be adverse to the interests of the Fund, and such party </span><span>may have no incentive to assure that the Fund obtains the best possible prices or terms in connection with the transactions. </span><span>In addition, the purchase, holding and sale of such investments by a Fund may enhance the profitability of BlackRock.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock may also create, write or issue derivatives for clients based on the underlying securities, currencies or instruments </span><span>in which a Fund may invest or on the performance of the Fund. An entity in which BlackRock has a significant minority </span><span>interest will create, write or issue options which may be based on the performance of certain Funds. BlackRock has the right </span><span>to receive a portion of the gross revenue earned by such entity. Options writing by such entity on a Fund could potentially </span><span>lead to increased purchase activity with respect to the Fund and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock has entered into an arrangement with Markit Indices Limited, the index provider for underlying fixed-income </span><span>indexes used by certain iShares funds, related to derivative fixed-income products that are based on such iShares funds. </span><span>BlackRock may receive certain payments for licensing intellectual property belonging to BlackRock and for facilitating the </span><span>provision of data in connection with such derivative products, which may include payments based on the trading volumes of, </span><span>or revenues generated by, the derivative products. However, BlackRock will not receive any such payments on those derivative </span><span>products utilized by the Funds or other BlackRock funds or accounts. Other funds and accounts managed by BlackRock may </span><span>from time to time transact in such derivative products, which could contribute to the viability or success of such derivative </span><span>products by making them more appealing to funds and accounts managed by third parties, and in turn lead to increased </span><span>payments to BlackRock. Trading activity in such derivative products could also potentially lead to increased purchase activity </span><span>with respect to these iShares funds and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A Fund may, subject to applicable law, purchase investments that are the subject of an underwriting or other distribution by </span><span>BlackRock and may also enter into transactions with other clients of BlackRock where such other clients have interests </span><span>adverse to those of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>At times, these activities may cause business units or entities within BlackRock to give advice to clients that may cause these </span><span>clients to take actions adverse to the interests of a Fund. To the extent such transactions are permitted, a Fund will deal with </span><span>BlackRock on an arm’s-length basis.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>To the extent authorized by applicable law, BlackRock may act as broker, dealer, agent, lender or adviser or in other </span><span>commercial capacities for a Fund. It is anticipated that the commissions, mark-ups, mark-downs, financial advisory fees, </span><span>underwriting and placement fees, sales fees, financing and commitment fees, brokerage fees, other fees, compensation or </span><span>profits, rates, terms and conditions charged by BlackRock will be in its view commercially reasonable, although BlackRock, </span><span>including its sales personnel, will have an interest in obtaining fees and other amounts that are favorable to BlackRock and </span><span>such sales personnel, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. Index based funds may use an index provider that is </span><span>affiliated with another service provider of a Fund or BlackRock that acts as a broker, dealer, agent, lender or in other </span><span>commercial capacities for a Fund or BlackRock.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock (and its personnel and other distributors) will be entitled to retain fees and other </span><span>amounts that they receive in connection with their service to the Funds as broker, dealer, agent, lender, adviser or in other </span><span>commercial capacities. No accounting to the Funds or their shareholders will be required, and no fees or other compensation </span><span>payable by the Funds or their shareholders will be reduced by reason of receipt by BlackRock of any such fees or other </span><span>amounts.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When BlackRock acts as broker, dealer, agent, adviser or in other commercial capacities in relation to the Funds, BlackRock </span><span>may take commercial steps in its own interests, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. A Fund will be required to </span><span>establish business relationships with its counterparties based on the Fund's own credit standing. BlackRock will not have any </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>102</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>obligation to allow its credit to be used in connection with a Fund's establishment of its business relationships, nor is it </span><span>expected that the Fund's counterparties will rely on the credit of BlackRock in evaluating the Fund's creditworthiness.</span></div> <div> <div><span>BTC, an affiliate of BFA pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, acts as securities lending agent to, and receives a share of securities </span><span>lending revenues from, the Funds. BlackRock will also receive compensation for managing the reinvestment of the cash </span><span>collateral from securities lending. There are potential conflicts of interests in managing a securities lending program, </span><span>including but not limited to: (i) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to, among other things, increase </span><span>or decrease the amount of securities on loan or to lend particular securities in order to generate additional risk-adjusted </span><span>revenue for BlackRock and its affiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to allocate loans </span><span>to clients that would provide more revenue to BlackRock. As described further below, BlackRock seeks to mitigate this </span><span>conflict by providing its securities lending clients with equal lending opportunities over time in order to approximate </span><span>pro rata </span><span>allocation. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As part of its securities lending program, BlackRock indemnifies the Funds and certain other clients and/or funds against a </span><span>shortfall in collateral in the event of borrower default. On a regular basis, BlackRock calculates the potential dollar exposure of </span><span>collateral shortfall resulting from a borrower default (</span><span>“</span><span>shortfall risk</span><span>”</span><span>) in the securities lending program. BlackRock establishes </span><span>program-wide borrower limits (</span><span>“</span><span>credit limits</span><span>”</span><span>) to actively manage borrower-specific credit exposure. BlackRock oversees the </span><span>risk model that calculates projected collateral shortfall values using loan-level factors such as loan and collateral type and </span><span>market value as well as specific borrower credit characteristics. When necessary, BlackRock may adjust securities lending </span><span>program attributes by restricting eligible collateral or reducing borrower credit limits. As a result, the management of </span><span>program-wide exposure as well as BlackRock-specific indemnification exposure may affect the amount of securities lending </span><span>activity BlackRock may conduct at any given point in time by reducing the volume of lending opportunities for certain loans </span><span>(including by asset type, collateral type and/or revenue profile).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock uses a predetermined systematic process in order to approximate </span><span>pro rata</span><span> allocation over time. In order to allocate </span><span>a loan to a portfolio: (i) BlackRock as a whole must have sufficient lending capacity pursuant to the various program limits </span><span>(</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> indemnification exposure limit and borrower credit limits); (ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset at the time a </span><span>loan opportunity arrives; and (iii) the lending portfolio must also have enough inventory, either on its own or when </span><span>aggregated with other portfolios into one single market delivery, to satisfy the loan request. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to </span><span>provide equal lending opportunities for all portfolios, independent of whether BlackRock indemnifies the portfolio. Equal </span><span>opportunities for lending portfolios does not guarantee equal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-term outcomes for </span><span>individual clients may vary due to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on different securities, and the overall limits imposed by </span><span>the firm.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock may decline to make a securities loan on behalf of a Fund, discontinue lending on behalf of a Fund or terminate a </span><span>securities loan on behalf of a Fund for any reason, including but not limited to regulatory requirements and/or market rules, </span><span>liquidity considerations, or credit considerations, which may impact Funds by reducing or eliminating the volume of lending </span><span>opportunities for certain types of loans, loans in particular markets, loans of particular securities or types of securities, or for </span><span>loans overall.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Purchases and sales of securities and other assets for a Fund may be bunched or aggregated with orders for other BlackRock </span><span>client accounts, including with accounts that pay different transaction costs solely due to the fact that they have different </span><span>research payment arrangements. BlackRock, however, is not required to bunch or aggregate orders if portfolio management </span><span>decisions for different accounts are made separately, or if they determine that bunching or aggregating is not practicable or </span><span>required, or in cases involving client direction.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Prevailing trading activity frequently may make impossible the receipt of the same price or execution on the entire volume of </span><span>securities purchased or sold. When this occurs, the various prices may be averaged, and the Funds will be charged or </span><span>credited with the average price. Thus, the effect of the aggregation may operate on some occasions to the disadvantage of </span><span>the Funds. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Funds will not be charged the same commission or commission </span><span>equivalent rates in connection with a bunched or aggregated order.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock may select brokers that furnish BlackRock, the Funds, other BlackRock client accounts or </span><span>personnel, directly or through correspondent relationships, with research or other appropriate services which provide, in </span><span>BlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to BlackRock in the investment decision-making process (including with respect to </span><span>futures, fixed-price offerings and OTC transactions). Such research or other services may include, to the extent permitted by </span><span>law, research reports on companies, industries and securities; economic and financial data; financial publications; proxy </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>103</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>analysis; trade industry seminars; computer data bases; research-oriented software and other services and products. </span><span>Research or other services obtained in this manner may be used in servicing any or all of the Funds and other BlackRock </span><span>client accounts, including in connection with BlackRock client accounts other than those that pay commissions to the broker </span><span>relating to the research or other service arrangements. Such products and services may disproportionately benefit other </span><span>BlackRock client accounts relative to the Funds based on the amount of brokerage commissions paid by the Funds and such </span><span>other BlackRock client accounts. For example, research or other services that are paid for through one client's commissions </span><span>may not be used in managing that client's account. In addition, other BlackRock client accounts may receive the benefit, </span><span>including disproportionate benefits, of economies of scale or price discounts in connection with products and services that </span><span>may be provided to the Funds and to such other BlackRock client accounts. To the extent that BlackRock uses soft dollars, it </span><span>will not have to pay for those products and services itself.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock does not currently enter into arrangements to use the Funds' assets for, or participate in, soft dollars, although </span><span>BlackRock may receive research that is bundled with the trade execution, clearing, and/or settlement services provided by a </span><span>particular broker-dealer. To the extent that BlackRock receives research on this basis, many of the same conflicts related to </span><span>traditional soft dollars may exist. For example, the research effectively will be paid by client commissions that also will be </span><span>used to pay for the execution, clearing, and settlement services provided by the broker-dealer and will not be paid by </span><span>BlackRock. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may endeavor to execute trades through brokers who, pursuant to </span><span>such arrangements, provide research or other services in order to ensure the continued receipt of research or other services </span><span>BlackRock believes are useful in its investment decision-making process. BlackRock may from time to time choose not to </span><span>engage in the above described arrangements to varying degrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may also </span><span>enter into commission sharing arrangements under which BlackRock may execute transactions through a broker-dealer, and </span><span>request that the broker-dealer allocate a portion of the commissions or commission credits to another firm that provides </span><span>research to BlackRock. To the extent that BlackRock engages in commission sharing arrangements, many of the same </span><span>conflicts related to traditional soft dollars may exist.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock may utilize certain electronic crossing networks (</span><span>“</span><span>ECNs</span><span>”</span><span>) (including, without limitation, ECNs in which BlackRock </span><span>has an investment or other interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law) in executing client</span><span> </span><span>securities transactions for </span><span>certain types of securities. These ECNs may charge fees for their services, including access fees and transaction fees. The </span><span>transaction fees, which are similar to commissions or markups/markdowns, will generally be charged to clients and, like </span><span>commissions and markups/markdowns, would generally be included in the cost of the securities purchased. Access fees </span><span>may be paid by BlackRock even though incurred in connection with executing transactions on behalf of clients, including the </span><span>Funds. In certain circumstances, ECNs may offer volume discounts that will reduce the access fees typically paid by </span><span>BlackRock. BlackRock will only utilize ECNs consistent with its obligation to seek to obtain best execution in client </span><span>transactions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock owns a minority interest in, and is a member of, Members Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>MEMX</span><span>”</span><span>), a newly created U.S. stock </span><span>exchange. Transactions for a Fund may be executed on MEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue </span><span>for execution of orders placed by BlackRock traders on behalf of such Funds. In addition, transactions in Fund shares may be </span><span>executed on MEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue for the execution of such orders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock has adopted policies and procedures designed to prevent conflicts of interest from influencing proxy voting </span><span>decisions that it makes on behalf of advisory clients, including the Funds, and to help ensure that such decisions are made in </span><span>accordance with BlackRock's fiduciary obligations to its clients. Nevertheless, notwithstanding such proxy voting policies and </span><span>procedures, actual proxy voting decisions of BlackRock may have the effect of favoring the interests of other clients or </span><span>businesses of other divisions or units of BlackRock, provided that BlackRock believes such voting decisions to be in </span><span>accordance with its fiduciary obligations. For a more detailed discussion of these policies and procedures, see the </span><span>Proxy </span><span>Voting Policy</span><span> section of this SAI.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>It is also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients (including other funds and separately </span><span>managed accounts) may, subject to compliance with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of a Fund. Increasing a Fund’s </span><span>assets may enhance liquidity, investment flexibility and diversification and may contribute to economies of scale that tend to </span><span>reduce the Fund's expense ratio. BlackRock reserves the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to sell into the </span><span>market or redeem in Creation Units through an Authorized Participant at any time some or all of the shares of a Fund </span><span>acquired for its own accounts or the account of a BlackRock advisory client. A large sale or redemption of shares of a Fund by </span><span>BlackRock itself or a BlackRock advisory client could significantly reduce the asset size of the Fund, which might have an </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>104</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

A Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by </span><span>entities for which BlackRock provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the </span><span>sale of such issuances. In making investment decisions for a Fund, BlackRock is not permitted to obtain or use material non-public</span><span> information acquired by any unit of BlackRock in the course of these activities. In addition, from time to time, the </span><span>activities of BlackRock may limit a Fund's flexibility in purchases and sales of securities. As indicated below, BlackRock may </span><span>engage in transactions with companies in which BlackRock-advised funds or other clients of BlackRock have an investment.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock, its personnel and other financial service providers may have interests in promoting sales of the Funds. With </span><span>respect to BlackRock and its personnel, the remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of the Funds or </span><span>other products may be greater than remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of certain funds or other </span><span>products that might be provided or offered. BlackRock and its sales personnel may directly or indirectly receive a portion of </span><span>the fees and commissions charged to the Funds or their shareholders. BlackRock and its advisory or other personnel may </span><span>also benefit from increased amounts of assets under management. Fees and commissions may also be higher than for other </span><span>products or services, and the remuneration and profitability to BlackRock and such personnel resulting from transactions on </span><span>behalf of or management of the Funds may be greater than the remuneration and profitability resulting from other funds or </span><span>products.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Third parties, including service providers to BlackRock or a Fund, may sponsor events (including, but not limited to, </span><span>marketing and promotional activities and presentations, educational training programs and conferences) for registered </span><span>representatives, other professionals and individual investors. There is a potential conflict of interest as such sponsorships </span><span>may defray the costs of such activities to BlackRock, and may provide an incentive to BlackRock to retain such third parties to </span><span>provide services to a Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock may provide valuation assistance to certain clients with respect to certain securities or other investments and the </span><span>valuation recommendations made for such clients' accounts may differ from the valuations for the same securities or </span><span>investments assigned by a Fund's pricing vendors, especially if such valuations are based on broker-dealer quotes or other </span><span>data sources unavailable to the Fund's pricing vendors. While BlackRock will generally communicate its valuation information </span><span>or determinations to a Fund's pricing vendors and/or fund accountants, there may be instances where the Fund's pricing </span><span>vendors or fund accountants assign a different valuation to a security or other investment than the valuation for such </span><span>security or investment determined or recommended by BlackRock.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As disclosed in more detail in the </span><span>Determination of Net Asset Value</span><span> section in this SAI, when market quotations are not </span><span>readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, each Fund’s investments are valued at fair value by BFA. BFA has been </span><span>designated as each Fund’s valuation designee pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act and acts through </span><span>BFA’s Rule 2a-5 Committee (the </span><span>“</span><span>2a-5 Committee</span><span>”</span><span>), with assistance from other BFA pricing committees and in accordance </span><span>with BFA’s policies and procedures (the </span><span>“</span><span>Valuation Procedures</span><span>”</span><span>). When determining a </span><span>“</span><span>fair value price,</span><span>”</span><span> the 2a-5 Committee </span><span>seeks to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or liability in </span><span>an arm’s-length transaction. The price generally may not be determined based on what a Fund might reasonably expect to </span><span>receive for selling an asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. While fair value </span><span>determinations will be based upon all available factors that BFA deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be </span><span>based on analytical values determined by BFA using proprietary or third-party valuation models, fair value represents only a </span><span>good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in </span><span>retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair </span><span>values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a </span><span>holding or holdings are valued by the 2a-5 Committee at fair value, may have the effect of diluting or increasing the economic </span><span>interest of existing shareholders and may affect the amount of revenue received by BFA with respect to services for which it </span><span>receives an asset-based fee.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>To the extent permitted by applicable law, a Fund may invest all or some of its short-term cash investments in any money </span><span>market fund or similarly-managed private fund advised or managed by BlackRock. In connection with any such investments, </span><span>a Fund, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, may pay its share of expenses of a money market fund or other similarly-managed</span><span> private fund in which it invests, which may result in a Fund bearing some additional expenses.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>105</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock and its directors, officers and employees, may buy and sell securities or other investments for their own accounts </span><span>and may have conflicts of interest with respect to investments made on behalf of a Fund. As a result of differing trading and </span><span>investment strategies or constraints, positions may be taken by directors, officers and employees that are the same, different </span><span>from or made at different times than positions taken for the Fund. To lessen the possibility that a Fund will be adversely </span><span>affected by this personal trading, each Fund, BFA and BlackRock have each adopted a code of ethics in compliance with </span><span>Section 17(j) of the 1940 Act that restricts securities trading in the personal accounts of investment professionals and others </span><span>who normally come into possession of information regarding a Fund's portfolio transactions. Each code of ethics is available </span><span>by contacting BlackRock at the telephone number on the back cover of each Fund’s Prospectus or by accessing the EDGAR </span><span>Database on the SEC's Internet site at http://www.sec.gov, and copies may be obtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by </span><span>e-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov.</span></div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock will not purchase securities or other property from, or sell securities or other property to, a Fund, except that a </span><span>Fund may in accordance with rules or guidance adopted under the 1940 Act engage in transactions with another Fund or </span><span>accounts that are affiliated with a Fund as a result of common officers, directors, or investment advisers or pursuant to </span><span>exemptive orders granted to the Funds and/or BlackRock by the SEC. These transactions would be effected in circumstances </span><span>in which BlackRock determined that it would be appropriate for a Fund to purchase and another client of BlackRock to sell, or </span><span>a Fund to sell and another client of BlackRock to purchase, the same security or instrument on the same day. From time to </span><span>time, the activities of a Fund may be restricted because of regulatory requirements applicable to BlackRock and/or </span><span>BlackRock's internal policies designed to comply with, limit the applicability of, or otherwise relate to such requirements. A </span><span>client not advised by BlackRock would not be subject to some of those considerations. There may be periods when </span><span>BlackRock may not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions, or may otherwise restrict or limit its advice in certain </span><span>securities or instruments issued by or related to companies for which BlackRock is performing advisory or other services or </span><span>has proprietary positions. For example, when BlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or risk management services for a </span><span>company, BlackRock may be prohibited from or limited in purchasing or selling securities of that company on behalf of a </span><span>Fund, particularly where such services result in BlackRock obtaining material non-public information about the company </span><span>(</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, in connection with participation in a creditors’ committee). Similar situations could arise if personnel of BlackRock serve </span><span>as directors of companies the securities of which a Fund wishes to purchase or sell. However, if permitted by applicable law, </span><span>and where consistent with BlackRock’s policies and procedures (including the necessary implementation of appropriate </span><span>information barriers), the Funds may purchase securities or instruments that are issued by such companies, are the subject </span><span>of an advisory or risk management assignment by BlackRock, or where personnel of BlackRock are directors or officers of the </span><span>issuer.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The investment activities of BlackRock for its proprietary accounts and for client accounts may also limit the investment </span><span>strategies and rights of the Funds. For example, in certain circumstances where the Funds invest in securities issued by </span><span>companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or international markets, or are subject to </span><span>corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or invest in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits </span><span>on the aggregate amount invested by BlackRock for their proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Funds) </span><span>that may not be exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if exceeded, may cause </span><span>BlackRock, the Funds or other client accounts to suffer disadvantages or business restrictions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If certain aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either through the actions of BlackRock or a Fund or as a result of </span><span>third-party transactions, the ability of BlackRock, on behalf of clients (including the Funds), to purchase or dispose of </span><span>investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. As </span><span>a result, BlackRock, on behalf of its clients (including the Funds), may limit purchases, sell existing investments, or otherwise </span><span>restrict, forgo or limit the exercise of rights (including transferring, outsourcing or limiting voting rights or forgoing the right </span><span>to receive dividends) when BlackRock, in its sole discretion, deems it appropriate in light of potential regulatory or other </span><span>restrictions on ownership or other consequences resulting from reaching investment thresholds.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In those circumstances where ownership thresholds or limitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks to allocate limited </span><span>investment opportunities equitably among clients (including the Funds), taking into consideration benchmark weight and </span><span>investment strategy. BlackRock has adopted certain controls designed to prevent the occurrence of a breach of any </span><span>applicable ownership threshold or limits, including, for example, when ownership in certain securities nears an applicable </span><span>threshold, BlackRock may remove such securities from the list of Deposit Securities to be delivered to the Fund in connection </span><span>with purchases of Creation Units of such Fund and may limit purchases in such securities to the issuer's weighting in the </span><span>applicable benchmark used by BlackRock to manage such Fund. If client (including Fund) holdings of an issuer exceed an </span><span>applicable threshold and BlackRock is unable to obtain relief to enable the continued holding of such investments, it may be </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>106</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>necessary to sell down these positions to meet the applicable limitations. In these cases, benchmark overweight positions </span><span>will be sold prior to benchmark positions being reduced to meet applicable limitations.</span></div> <div> <div><span>In addition to the foregoing, other ownership thresholds may trigger reporting requirements to governmental and regulatory </span><span>authorities, and such reports may entail the disclosure of the identity of a client or BlackRock’s intended strategy with respect </span><span>to such security or asset.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock may not serve as an Authorized Participant in the creation and redemption of iShares ETFs.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Under an ETF Services Agreement, certain Funds have retained BRIL, an Affiliate of BFA, to perform certain order processing, </span><span>Authorized Participant communications, and related services in connection with the issuance and redemption of Creation </span><span>Units of the Funds (</span><span>“</span><span>ETF Services</span><span>”</span><span>). BRIL will retain a portion of the standard transaction fee received from Authorized </span><span>Participants on each creation or redemption order from the Authorized Participant for the ETF Services provided. BlackRock </span><span>collaborated with, and received payment from, Citibank, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>Citibank</span><span>”</span><span>) on the design and development of the ETF Services </span><span>platform. Citibank may have, or from time to time may develop, additional relationships with BlackRock or funds managed by </span><span>BFA and its affiliates.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock may maintain securities indices. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, the Funds may seek to license and use </span><span>such indices as part of their investment strategy. Index based funds that seek to track the performance of securities indices </span><span>also may use the name of the index or index provider in the fund name. Index providers, including BlackRock (to the extent </span><span>permitted by applicable law), may be paid licensing fees for use of their index or index name. BlackRock may benefit from the </span><span>Funds using BlackRock indices by creating increasing acceptance in the marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is not </span><span>obligated to license its indices to a Fund and the Funds are under no obligation to use BlackRock indices. Any Fund that </span><span>enters into a license for a BlackRock index cannot be assured that the terms of any index licensing agreement with BlackRock </span><span>will be as favorable as those terms offered to other licensees.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The custody arrangement described in </span><span>“</span><span>Investment Advisory, Administrative and Distribution Services</span><span>”</span><span> may lead to potential </span><span>conflicts of interest with BlackRock where BlackRock has agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse ordinary operating expenses </span><span>in order to cap expenses of the Funds (or where BlackRock charges a unitary management fee). This is because the custody </span><span>arrangements with certain Funds' custodian may have the effect of reducing custody fees when the Funds leave cash </span><span>balances uninvested. This could be viewed as having the potential to provide BlackRock an incentive to keep high positive </span><span>cash balances for Funds in order to offset fund custody fees that BlackRock might otherwise reimburse or pay. However, </span><span>BlackRock’s portfolio managers do not intentionally keep uninvested balances high, but rather make investment decisions </span><span>that they anticipate will be beneficial to fund performance. For funds without a unitary management fee, when a fund’s </span><span>actual operating expense ratio exceeds a stated cap, a reduction in custody fees reduces the amount of waivers and/or </span><span>reimbursements BlackRock would be required to make to the fund.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock may enter into contractual arrangements with third-party service providers to a Fund (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, custodians, </span><span>administrators and index providers) pursuant to which BlackRock receives fee discounts or concessions in recognition of </span><span>BlackRock’s overall relationship with such service providers. BlackRock may also enter into contractual arrangements with </span><span>such service providers pursuant to which BlackRock incurs additional costs if the service provider’s services are terminated </span><span>with respect to a Fund. To the extent that BlackRock is responsible for paying these service providers out of its management </span><span>fee, the benefits of any such fee discounts or concessions, or any additional costs, may accrue, in whole or in part, to </span><span>BlackRock, which could result in conflicts of interest relating to the use or termination of service providers to a Fund.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock owns or has an ownership interest in certain trading, portfolio management, operations and/or information </span><span>systems used by Fund service providers. These systems are, or will be, used by a Fund service provider in connection with the </span><span>provision of services to accounts managed by BlackRock and funds managed and sponsored by BlackRock, including the </span><span>Funds, that engage the service provider (typically the custodian). A Fund’s service provider remunerates BlackRock for the </span><span>use of the systems. A Fund service provider’s payments to BlackRock for the use of these systems may enhance the </span><span>profitability of BlackRock.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock’s receipt of fees from a service provider in connection with the use of systems provided by BlackRock may create </span><span>an incentive for BlackRock to recommend that a Fund enter into or renew an arrangement with the service provider.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>107</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

BFA Entities make these payments from their own assets and </span><span>not from the assets of the Funds. Although a portion of BFA Entities’ revenue comes directly or indirectly in part from fees </span><span>paid by the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products, these payments do not increase the price paid by </span><span>investors for the purchase of shares of, or the cost of owning, the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products. </span><span>BFA Entities make payments for Intermediaries’ participation in activities that are designed to make registered </span><span>representatives, other professionals and individual investors more knowledgeable about exchange-traded products, including </span><span>the Funds and other iShares funds, or for other activities, such as participation in marketing activities and presentations, </span><span>educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems (</span><span>“</span><span>Education </span><span>Costs</span><span>”</span><span>). BFA Entities also make payments to Intermediaries for certain printing, publishing and mailing costs or materials </span><span>relating to the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products (</span><span>“</span><span>Publishing Costs</span><span>”</span><span>). In addition, BFA Entities make </span><span>payments to Intermediaries that make shares of the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products available to </span><span>their clients, in some cases at a waived or reduced commission rate or ticket charge, develop new products that feature </span><span>iShares, create educational content about the Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products that is featured on an </span><span>Intermediary’s platform, or otherwise promote the Funds, other iShares funds and exchange-traded products. BFA Entities </span><span>may also reimburse expenses or make payments from their own assets to Intermediaries or other persons in consideration of </span><span>services or other activities that the BFA Entities believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in the Funds, </span><span>other iShares funds or exchange-traded products. Payments of the type described above are sometimes referred to as </span><span>revenue-sharing payments.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Payments to an Intermediary may be significant to the Intermediary, and amounts that Intermediaries pay to your </span><span>salesperson or other investment professional may also be significant for your salesperson or other investment professional. </span><span>Because an Intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it will recommend or make available to its </span><span>clients, what services to provide for various products, or what marketing content to make available to its clients based on </span><span>payments it receives or is eligible to receive, such payments may create conflicts of interest between the Intermediary and its </span><span>clients. These financial incentives may cause the Intermediary to recommend the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded</span><span> products, or otherwise promote the Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products over other investments. </span><span>The same conflicts of interest and financial incentives exist with respect to your salesperson or other investment professional </span><span>if he or she receives similar payments from his or her Intermediary firm.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition to the payments described above, BFA Entities have developed proprietary tools, calculators and related </span><span>interactive or digital content that is made available through the www.BlackRock.com website at no additional cost to </span><span>Intermediaries.

Effective June 4, 2016, this </span><span>relationship was expanded to include National Financial Services, LLC (</span><span>“</span><span>NFS</span><span>”</span><span>), an affiliate of FBS.

BFA Entities have agreed to facilitate the Marketing Program by, among other </span><span>things, making certain payments to FBS and NFS for marketing and implementing certain brokerage and investment </span><span>programs.

Such agreements may </span><span>include payments by BFA Entities to such Intermediaries and third parties for data collection and provision, technology </span><span>support, platform enhancement, or educational content, co-marketing and cross-promotional efforts. Payments made </span><span>pursuant to such arrangements may vary in any year and may be different for different Intermediaries and third parties.

As of the </span><span>date of this SAI, the Intermediaries and other third parties receiving one or more types of the contractual payments described </span><span>above include (in addition to FBS and NFS): Advisor Credit Exchange, Avantax Investment Services, Inc., BNY Mellon Capital </span><span>Markets, LLC, BNY Mellon Performance &amp; Risk Analytics, LLC, Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Inc., Clearstream Fund Centre AG, </span><span>Commonwealth Equity Services, LLC, Dorsey Wright and Associates, LLC, E*Trade Securities LLC, Envestnet Asset </span><span>Management, Inc., LPL Financial LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC, </span><span>Northwestern Mutual Investment Services, LLC, Orion Portfolio Solutions, LLC, Pershing LLC, Public Holdings, Inc., Raymond </span><span>James Financial Services, Inc., Riskalyze, Inc., Stash Investments, LLC, TD Ameritrade, Inc., UBS Financial Services Inc., Wells </span><span>Fargo Clearing Services, LLC and Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, LLC. Any additions, modifications, or deletions to </span><span>Intermediaries and other third parties listed above that have occurred since the date of this SAI are not included in the list.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Further, BFA Entities make Education Costs and Publishing Costs payments to other Intermediaries that are not listed in the </span><span>immediately preceding paragraph. BFA Entities may determine to make such payments based on any number of metrics. For </span><span>example, BFA Entities may make payments at year-end or other intervals in a fixed amount, an amount based upon an </span><span>Intermediary’s services at defined levels or an amount based on the Intermediary’s net sales of one or more iShares funds in a </span><span>year or other period, any of which arrangements may include an agreed-upon minimum or maximum payment, or any </span><span>combination of the foregoing. As of the date of this SAI, BFA anticipates that the payments paid by BFA Entities in connection </span><span>with the Funds, iShares funds and exchange-traded products in general will be immaterial to BFA Entities in the aggregate for </span><span>the next year. </span><span>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such </span><span>payments or financial incentives his or her Intermediary firm may receive. Any payments made, or financial incentives </span><span>offered, by the BFA Entities to an Intermediary may create the incentive for the Intermediary to encourage customers to </span><span>buy shares of the Funds, other iShares funds or other exchange-traded products.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Funds may participate in certain market maker incentive programs of a national securities exchange in which an affiliate </span><span>of the Funds would pay a fee to the exchange used for the purpose of incentivizing one or more market makers in the </span><span>securities of a Fund to enhance the liquidity and quality of the secondary market of securities of a Fund. The fee would then </span><span>be credited by the exchange to one or more market makers that meet or exceed liquidity and market quality standards with </span><span>respect to the securities of a Fund. Each market maker incentive program is subject to approval from the SEC. Any such fee </span><span>payments made to an exchange will be made by an affiliate of a Fund solely for the benefit of a Fund and will not be paid </span><span>from any Fund assets. Other funds managed by BFA may also participate in such programs.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Determination of Net Asset Value</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Valuation of Shares. </span><span>The NAV for each Fund is generally calculated as of the close of regular trading hours on the NYSE </span><span>(normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time) on each business day the NYSE is open. Valuation of assets held by a Fund is as follows:</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Equity Investments. </span><span>Equity securities traded on a recognized securities exchange (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, NYSE), on separate trading boards of a </span><span>securities exchange or through a market system that provides contemporaneous transaction pricing information (each an </span><span>“</span><span>Exchange</span><span>”</span><span>) are valued using information obtained via independent pricing services, generally at the closing price or, if an </span><span>Exchange closing price is not available, the last traded price on that Exchange prior to the time as of which the assets or </span><span>liabilities are valued. However, under certain circumstances, other means of determining current market value may be used. If </span><span>an equity security is traded on more than one Exchange, the current market value of the security where it is primarily traded </span><span>generally will be used. In the event that there are no sales involving an equity security held by a Fund on a day on which a </span><span>Fund values such security, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BFA determines that such prior day’s price no longer </span><span>reflects the fair value of the security, in which case such asset would be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below).</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Options, Futures, Swaps and Other Derivatives. </span><span>Exchange-traded equity options (except those that are customized) for </span><span>which market quotations are readily available are valued at the mean of the last bid and ask prices as quoted on the </span><span>Exchange or the board of trade on which such options are traded. In the event that there is no mean price available for an </span><span>exchange traded equity option held by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values such option, the last bid (long positions) or </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>142</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>ask (short positions) price, if available, will be used as the value of such option. If no bid or ask price is available on a day on </span><span>which a Fund values such option, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BFA determines that such prior day’s price no </span><span>longer reflects the fair value of the option, in which case such option will be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below). </span><span>Customized exchange-traded equity options, as well as OTC derivatives, may be valued using a mathematical model which </span><span>may incorporate a number of market data factors. Financial futures contracts and options thereon, which are traded on </span><span>exchanges, are valued at their last sale price or settle price as of the close of such exchanges. Swap agreements and other </span><span>derivatives are generally valued daily based upon quotations from market makers or by a pricing service in accordance with </span><span>the Valuation Procedures.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Underlying Funds. </span><span>Shares of underlying open-end funds (including money market funds) are valued at NAV. Shares of </span><span>underlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs will be valued at their most recent closing price.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>General Valuation Information. </span><span>Prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services, broker-dealers or market </span><span>makers to value a Fund’s securities and other assets and liabilities are based on information available at the time a Fund </span><span>values its assets and liabilities. In the event that a pricing service quotation is revised or updated subsequent to the day on </span><span>which a Fund valued such security, the revised pricing service quotation generally will be applied prospectively. Such </span><span>determination will be made considering pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding the revision.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The price a Fund could receive upon the sale of any particular portfolio investment may differ from a Fund’s valuation of the </span><span>investment, particularly for assets that trade in thin or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair valuation methodology </span><span>or a price provided by an independent pricing service. As a result, the price received upon the sale of an investment may be </span><span>less than the value ascribed by a Fund, and a Fund could realize a greater than expected loss or lesser than expected gain </span><span>upon the sale of the investment. A Fund’s ability to value its investment may also be impacted by technological issues and/or </span><span>errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>All cash, receivables and current payables are carried on a Fund’s books at their fair value.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the event that application of the methods of valuation discussed above result in a price for a security which is deemed not </span><span>to be representative of the fair market value of such security, the security will be valued by, under the direction of or in </span><span>accordance with a method approved by BFA, each Fund’s valuation designee, as reflecting fair value. All other assets and </span><span>liabilities (including securities for which market quotations are not readily available) held by a Fund (including restricted </span><span>securities) are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by BFA pursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any assets and </span><span>liabilities which are denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate </span><span>a Fund’s NAV and the prices used in the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between a Fund’s </span><span>performance and the performance of the Underlying Index.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fair Value.</span><span> When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, a Fund’s investments are </span><span>valued at fair value (</span><span>“</span><span>Fair Value Assets</span><span>”</span><span>). Fair Value Assets are valued by BFA in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. </span><span>Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act, the Board of Trustees has designated BFA as the valuation </span><span>designee for the respective Funds for which it serves as investment adviser. BFA may reasonably conclude that a market </span><span>quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if, among other things, a security or other asset or liability does not have a </span><span>price source due to its complete lack of trading, if BFA believes a market quotation from a broker-dealer or other source is </span><span>unreliable (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, where it varies significantly from a recent trade, or no longer reflects the fair value of the security or other </span><span>asset or liability subsequent to the most recent market quotation), or where the security or other asset or liability is only </span><span>thinly traded or due to the occurrence of a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation. For this </span><span>purpose, a </span><span>“</span><span>significant event</span><span>”</span><span> is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment, that an event has </span><span>occurred after the close of trading for an asset or liability but prior to or at the time of pricing a Fund’s assets or liabilities, is </span><span>likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or closing market price of one or more assets held by, or </span><span>liabilities of, a Fund. On any day the NYSE is open and a foreign market or the primary exchange on which a foreign asset or </span><span>liability is traded is closed, such asset or liability will be valued using the prior day’s price, provided that BFA is not aware of </span><span>any significant event or other information that would cause such price to no longer reflect the fair value of the asset or </span><span>liability, in which case such asset or liability would be treated as a Fair Value Asset.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>For certain foreign assets, a third-party vendor supplies evaluated, systematic fair value pricing based upon the movement of </span><span>a proprietary multi-factor model after the relevant foreign markets have closed. This systematic fair value pricing </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>143</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>methodology is designed to correlate the prices of foreign assets in one or more non-U.S. markets following the close of the </span><span>local markets to the prices that might have prevailed as of a Fund’s pricing time.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>BFA’s Rule 2a-5 Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving methodologies by investment type and significant </span><span>inputs used in the fair valuation of Fund assets or liabilities. In addition, a Fund’s accounting agent assists BFA by periodically </span><span>endeavoring to confirm the prices it receives from all third-party pricing services, index providers and broker-dealers and </span><span>regularly evaluating the values assigned to the securities and other assets and liabilities of a Fund. The pricing of all Fair Value </span><span>Assets is subsequently reported to the Board or a committee thereof.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When determining the price for a Fair Value Asset, BFA will seek to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect </span><span>to receive from the current sale of that asset or liability in an arm’s-length transaction on the date on which the asset or </span><span>liability is being valued, and does not seek to determine the price a Fund might reasonably expect to receive for selling an </span><span>asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. Fair value determinations will be based upon all </span><span>available factors that BFA deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be based on analytical values determined </span><span>by BFA using proprietary or third-party valuation models.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. When determining the fair value of an </span><span>investment, one or more fair value methodologies may be used (depending on certain factors, including the asset type). For </span><span>example, the investment may be initially priced based on the original cost of the investment or, alternatively, using proprietary </span><span>or third-party models that may rely upon one or more unobservable inputs. Prices of actual, executed or historical </span><span>transactions in the relevant investment (or comparable instruments) or, where appropriate, an appraisal by a third-party </span><span>experienced in the valuation of similar instruments, may also be used as a basis for establishing the fair value of an </span><span>investment.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could </span><span>have been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a </span><span>Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a holding or holdings are valued at fair value, may have the </span><span>effect of diluting or increasing the economic interest of existing shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Each Fund’s annual audited financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally </span><span>accepted in the United States of America (</span><span>“</span><span>US GAAP</span><span>”</span><span>), follow the requirements for valuation set forth in Financial </span><span>Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, </span><span>“</span><span>Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>ASC 820</span><span>”</span><span>), which defines and establishes a framework for measuring fair value under US GAAP and expands financial </span><span>statement disclosure requirements relating to fair value measurements.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Generally, ASC 820 and other accounting rules applicable to funds and various assets in which they invest are evolving. Such </span><span>changes may adversely affect a Fund. For example, the evolution of rules governing the determination of the fair market </span><span>value of assets or liabilities, to the extent such rules become more stringent, would tend to increase the cost and/or reduce </span><span>the availability of third-party determinations of fair market value. This may in turn increase the costs associated with selling </span><span>assets or affect their liquidity due to a Fund’s inability to obtain a third-party determination of fair market value.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Brokerage Transactions</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Subject to policies established by the Board, BFA is primarily responsible for the execution of a Fund’s portfolio transactions </span><span>and the allocation of brokerage. BFA does not execute transactions through any particular broker or dealer, but seeks to </span><span>obtain the best net results for the Funds, taking into account such factors as price (including the applicable brokerage </span><span>commission or dealer spread), size of order, difficulty of execution, operational facilities of the firm and the firm’s risk and skill </span><span>in positioning blocks of securities. While BFA generally seeks reasonable trade execution costs, a Fund does not necessarily </span><span>pay the lowest spread or commission available, and payment of the lowest commission or spread is not necessarily </span><span>consistent with obtaining the best price and execution in particular transactions. Subject to applicable legal requirements, </span><span>BFA may select a broker based partly upon brokerage or research services provided to BFA and its clients, including a Fund. In </span><span>return for such services, BFA may cause a Fund to pay a higher commission than other brokers would charge if BFA </span><span>determines in good faith that the commission is reasonable in relation to the services provided.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In selecting brokers or dealers to execute portfolio transactions, BFA seeks to obtain the best price and most favorable </span><span>execution for a Fund and may take into account a variety of factors including: (i) the size, nature and character of the security </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>144</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>or instrument being traded and the markets in which it is purchased or sold; (ii) the desired timing of the transaction; (iii) </span><span>BFA’s knowledge of the expected commission rates and spreads currently available; (iv) the activity existing and expected in </span><span>the market for the particular security or instrument, including any anticipated execution difficulties; (v) the full range of </span><span>brokerage services provided; (vi) the broker’s or dealer’s capital; (vii) the quality of research and research services provided; </span><span>(viii) the reasonableness of the commission, dealer spread or its equivalent for the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA’s </span><span>knowledge of any actual or apparent operational problems of a broker or dealer. Brokers may also be selected because of </span><span>their ability to handle special or difficult executions, such as may be involved in large block trades, thinly traded securities, or </span><span>other circumstances.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act (</span><span>“</span><span>Section 28(e)</span><span>”</span><span>) permits a U.S. investment adviser, under certain circumstances, to cause an </span><span>account to pay a broker or dealer a commission for effecting a transaction in securities that exceeds the amount another </span><span>broker or dealer would have charged for effecting the same transaction in recognition of the value of brokerage and research </span><span>services provided by that broker or dealer. This includes commissions paid on riskless principal transactions in securities </span><span>under certain conditions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>From time to time, a Fund may purchase new issues of securities in a fixed price offering. In these situations, the broker may </span><span>be a member of the selling group that will, in addition to selling securities, provide BFA with research services. FINRA has </span><span>adopted rules expressly permitting these types of arrangements under certain circumstances. Generally, the broker will </span><span>provide research </span><span>“</span><span>credits</span><span>”</span><span> in these situations at a rate that is higher than that available for typical secondary market </span><span>transactions. These arrangements may not fall within the safe harbor of Section 28(e).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Funds anticipate that brokerage transactions involving foreign equity securities generally will be conducted primarily on </span><span>the principal stock exchanges of the applicable country. Foreign equity securities may be held by the Funds in the form of </span><span>depositary receipts, or other securities convertible into foreign equity securities. Depositary receipts may be listed on stock </span><span>exchanges, or traded in OTC markets in the U.S. or Europe, as the case may be. ADRs, like other securities traded in the U.S., </span><span>will be subject to negotiated commission rates.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>OTC issues, including most fixed-income securities such as corporate debt and U.S. Government securities, are normally </span><span>traded on a </span><span>“</span><span>net</span><span>”</span><span> basis without a stated commission, through dealers acting for their own account and not as brokers. The </span><span>Funds will primarily engage in transactions with these dealers or deal directly with the issuer unless a better price or </span><span>execution could be obtained by using a broker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect to both foreign and domestic securities </span><span>will generally include a </span><span>“</span><span>spread,</span><span>”</span><span> which is the difference between the prices at which the dealer is willing to purchase and sell </span><span>the specific security at the time, and includes the dealer’s normal profit.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Under the 1940 Act, persons affiliated with a Fund and persons who are affiliated with such affiliated persons are prohibited </span><span>from dealing with the Fund as principal in the purchase and sale of securities unless a permissive order allowing such </span><span>transactions is obtained from the SEC. Since transactions in the OTC market usually involve transactions with the dealers </span><span>acting as principal for their own accounts, the Funds will not deal with affiliated persons and affiliated persons of such </span><span>affiliated persons in connection with such transactions. The Funds will not purchase securities during the existence of any </span><span>underwriting or selling group relating to such securities of which BFA, BRIL or any affiliated person (as defined in the 1940 </span><span>Act) thereof is a member except pursuant to procedures adopted by the Board in accordance with Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 </span><span>Act.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Purchases of money market instruments by the Funds are made from dealers, underwriters and issuers. The Funds do not </span><span>currently expect to incur any brokerage commission expense on such transactions because money market instruments are </span><span>generally traded on a </span><span>“</span><span>net</span><span>”</span><span> basis with dealers acting as principal for their own accounts without a stated commission. The </span><span>price of the security, however, usually includes a profit to the dealer.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BFA may, from time to time, effect trades on behalf of and for the account of the Funds with brokers or dealers that are </span><span>affiliated with BFA, in conformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under these provisions, </span><span>any commissions paid to affiliated brokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by </span><span>other brokers or dealers in comparable transactions.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Securities purchased in underwritten offerings include a fixed amount of compensation to the underwriter, generally referred </span><span>to as the underwriter’s concession or discount. When securities are purchased or sold directly from or to an issuer, no </span><span>commissions or discounts are paid.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>145</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investment decisions for the Funds and for other investment accounts managed by BFA and the other Affiliates are made </span><span>independently of each other in light of differing conditions. A variety of factors will be considered in making investment </span><span>allocations. These factors include: (i) investment objectives or strategies for particular accounts, including sector, industry, </span><span>country or region and capitalization weightings; (ii) tax considerations of an account; (iii) risk or investment concentration </span><span>parameters for an account; (iv) supply or demand for a security at a given price level; (v) size of available investment; (vi) </span><span>cash availability and liquidity requirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory restrictions; (viii) minimum investment size of an </span><span>account; (ix) relative size of account; and (x) such other factors as may be approved by BlackRock’s general counsel. </span><span>Moreover, investments may not be allocated to one client account over another based on any of the following considerations: </span><span>(i) to favor one client account at the expense of another; (ii) to generate higher fees paid by one client account over another </span><span>or to produce greater performance compensation to BlackRock; (iii) to develop or enhance a relationship with a client or </span><span>prospective client; (iv) to compensate a client for past services or benefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce future services </span><span>or benefits to be rendered to BlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize investment performance among different client </span><span>accounts. BFA and the other Affiliates may deal, trade and invest for their own respective accounts in the types of securities </span><span>in which the Funds may invest.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Initial public offerings (</span><span>“</span><span>IPOs</span><span>”</span><span>) of securities may be over-subscribed and subsequently trade at a premium in the secondary </span><span>market. When BFA is given an opportunity to invest in such an initial offering or </span><span>“</span><span>new</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>hot</span><span>”</span><span> issue, the supply of securities </span><span>available for client accounts is often less than the amount of securities the accounts would otherwise take. In order to </span><span>allocate these investments fairly and equitably among client accounts over time, each portfolio manager or a member of his </span><span>or her respective investment team will indicate to BFA’s trading desk their level of interest in a particular offering with respect </span><span>to eligible clients’ accounts for which that team is responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities will be identified as eligible for </span><span>particular client accounts that are managed by portfolio teams who have indicated interest in the offering based on market </span><span>capitalization of the issuer of the security and the investment mandate of the client account and in the case of international </span><span>equity securities, the country where the offering is taking place and the investment mandate of the client account. Generally, </span><span>shares received during the IPO will be allocated among participating client accounts within each investment mandate on a </span><span>pro rata</span><span> basis. This </span><span>pro rata</span><span> allocation may result in a Fund receiving less of a particular security than if pro-rating had not </span><span>occurred. All allocations of securities will be subject, where relevant, to share minimums established for accounts and </span><span>compliance constraints. In situations where supply is too limited to be allocated among all accounts for which the </span><span>investment is eligible, portfolio managers may rotate such investment opportunities among one or more accounts so long as </span><span>the rotation system provides for fair access for all client accounts over time. Other allocation methodologies that are </span><span>considered by BFA to be fair and equitable to clients may be used as well.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Because different accounts may have differing investment objectives and policies, BFA may buy and sell the same securities </span><span>at the same time for different clients based on the particular investment objective, guidelines and strategies of those </span><span>accounts. For example, BFA may decide that it may be entirely appropriate for a growth fund to sell a security at the same </span><span>time a value fund is buying that security. To the extent that transactions on behalf of more than one client of BFA or the other </span><span>Affiliates during the same period increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, </span><span>there may be an adverse effect on price. For example, sales of a security by BlackRock on behalf of one or more of its clients </span><span>may decrease the market price of such security, adversely impacting other BlackRock clients that still hold the security. If </span><span>purchases or sales of securities arise for consideration at or about the same time that would involve the Funds or other </span><span>clients or funds for which BFA or another Affiliate act as investment manager, transactions in such securities will be made, </span><span>insofar as feasible, for the respective funds and clients in a manner deemed equitable to all.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In certain instances, BFA may find it efficient for purposes of seeking to obtain best execution, to aggregate or </span><span>“</span><span>bunch</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>certain contemporaneous purchases or sale orders of its advisory accounts and advisory accounts of affiliates. In general, all </span><span>contemporaneous trades for client accounts under management by the same portfolio manager or investment team will be </span><span>bunched in a single order if the trader believes the bunched trade would provide each client with an opportunity to achieve a </span><span>more favorable execution at a potentially lower execution cost. The costs associated with a bunched order will be shared </span><span>pro </span><span>rata</span><span> among the clients in the bunched order. Generally, if an order for a particular portfolio manager or management team is </span><span>filled at several different prices through multiple trades, all accounts participating in the order will receive the average price </span><span>(except in the case of certain international markets where average pricing is not permitted). While in some cases this practice </span><span>could have a detrimental effect upon the price or value of the security as far as the Funds are concerned, in other cases it </span><span>could be beneficial to the Funds. Transactions effected by BFA or the other Affiliates on behalf of more than one of its clients </span><span>during the same period may increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, </span><span>causing an adverse effect on price. The trader will give the bunched order to the broker-dealer that the trader has identified </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>146</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>as being able to provide the best execution of the order. Orders for purchase or sale of securities will be placed within a </span><span>reasonable amount of time of the order receipt and bunched orders will be kept bunched only long enough to execute the </span><span>order.</span></div> <div> <div><span>The table below sets forth the brokerage commissions paid by each Fund for the fiscal years noted. Any differences in </span><span>brokerage commissions paid by a Fund from year to year are</span><span> </span><span>principally due to increases or decreases in that Fund’s assets </span><span>over those periods</span><span> </span><span>or the magnitude of changes to the components of a Fund's Underlying Index:</span></div> </div> <div><span> </span></div> <div> <div> </div> </div> <div>

In any matter submitted to </span><span>shareholders for a vote, each fund shall hold a separate vote, provided that shareholders of all affected funds will vote </span><span>together when: (i) required by the 1940 Act, or (ii) the Trustees determine that the matter affects the interests of more than </span><span>one fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Under Delaware law, the Trust is not required to hold an annual meeting of shareholders unless required to do so under the </span><span>1940 Act. The policy of the Trust is not to hold an annual meeting of shareholders unless required to do so under the 1940 </span><span>Act. All shares (regardless of the fund) have noncumulative voting rights in the election of members of the Board. Under </span><span>Delaware law, Trustees of the Trust may be removed by vote of the shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Following the creation of the initial Creation Unit(s) of shares of a fund and immediately prior to the commencement of </span><span>trading in such fund’s shares, a holder of shares may be a </span><span>“</span><span>control person</span><span>”</span><span> of the fund, as defined in Rule 0-1 under the 1940 </span><span>Act. A fund cannot predict the length of time for which one or more shareholders may remain a control person of the fund.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shareholders may make inquiries by writing to iShares Trust, c/o BlackRock Investments, LLC, 1 University Square Drive, </span><span>Princeton, NJ 08540.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Absent an applicable exemption or other relief from the SEC or its staff, beneficial owners of more than 5% of the shares of a </span><span>fund may be subject to the reporting provisions of Section 13 of the 1934 Act and the SEC’s rules promulgated thereunder. In </span><span>addition, absent an applicable exemption or other relief from the SEC or its staff, officers and trustees of a fund and beneficial </span><span>owners of 10% of the shares of a fund (</span><span>“</span><span>Insiders</span><span>”</span><span>) may be subject to the insider reporting, short-swing profit and short sale </span><span>provisions of Section 16 of the 1934 Act and the SEC’s rules promulgated thereunder. Beneficial owners and Insiders should </span><span>consult with their own legal counsel concerning their obligations under Sections 13 and 16 of the 1934 Act and existing </span><span>guidance provided by the SEC staff.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In accordance with the Trust's current Agreement and Declaration of Trust (the </span><span>“</span><span>Declaration of Trust</span><span>”</span><span>), the Board may, </span><span>without shareholder approval (unless such shareholder approval is required by the Declaration of Trust or applicable law, </span><span>including the 1940 Act), authorize certain funds to merge, reorganize, consolidate, sell all or substantially all of their assets, or </span></div> </div> <div><span>take other similar actions with, to or into another fund.</span><span>  </span><span>The Trust or a fund may be terminated by a majority vote of the </span><span>Board, subject to the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders of the Trust or such fund entitled to vote on </span><span>termination; however, in certain circumstances described in the Declaration of Trust, only a majority vote of the Board is </span><span>required. Although the shares are not automatically redeemable upon the occurrence of any specific event, the Declaration of </span><span>Trust provides that the Board will have the unrestricted power to alter the number of shares in a Creation Unit. Therefore, in </span><span>the event of a termination of the Trust or a fund, the Board, in its sole discretion, could determine to permit the shares to be </span><span>redeemable in aggregations smaller than Creation Units or to be individually redeemable. In such circumstance, the Trust or a </span><span>fund may make redemptions in-kind, for cash or for a combination of cash or securities. Further, in the event of a termination </span><span>of the Trust or a fund, the Trust or a fund might elect to pay cash redemptions to all shareholders, with an in-kind election for </span><span>shareholders owning in excess of a certain stated minimum amount.</span></div> <div> <div><span>DTC as Securities Depository for Shares of the Funds. </span><span> </span><span>Shares of each Fund are represented by securities registered in the </span><span>name of DTC or its nominee and deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>DTC was created in 1973 to enable electronic movement of securities between its participants (</span><span>“</span><span>DTC Participants</span><span>”</span><span>), and </span><span>NSCC was established in 1976 to provide a single settlement system for securities clearing and to serve as central </span><span>counterparty for securities trades among DTC Participants.

Ownership of beneficial interests in shares (owners of such beneficial interests are </span><span>referred to herein as </span><span>“</span><span>Beneficial Owners</span><span>”</span><span>) is shown on, and the transfer of ownership is effected only through, records </span><span>maintained by DTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on the records of DTC Participants (with respect to Indirect </span><span>Participants and Beneficial Owners that are not DTC Participants). Beneficial Owners will receive from or through the DTC </span><span>Participant a written confirmation relating to their purchase of shares. The laws of some jurisdictions may require that certain </span><span>purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. Such laws may impair the ability of certain </span><span>investors to acquire beneficial interests in shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Conveyance of all notices, statements and other communications to Beneficial Owners is effected as follows. Pursuant to the </span><span>Depositary Agreement between the Trust and DTC, DTC is required to make available to the Trust upon request and for a fee </span><span>to be charged to the Trust a listing of the shares of each Fund held by each DTC Participant. The Trust shall inquire of each </span><span>such DTC Participant as to the number of Beneficial Owners holding shares, directly or indirectly, through such DTC </span><span>Participant. The Trust shall provide each such DTC Participant with copies of such notice, statement or other communication, </span><span>in such form, number and at such place as such DTC Participant may reasonably request, in order that such notice, </span><span>statement or communication may be transmitted by such DTC Participant, directly or indirectly, to such Beneficial Owners. In </span><span>addition, the Trust shall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair and reasonable amount as reimbursement for the expenses </span><span>attendant to such transmittal, all subject to applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Share distributions shall be made to DTC or its nominee, Cede &amp; Co., as the registered holder of all shares of the Trust. DTC or </span><span>its nominee, upon receipt of any such distributions, shall credit immediately DTC Participants’ accounts with payments in </span><span>amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in shares of each Fund as shown on the records of DTC or its </span><span>nominee. Payments by DTC Participants to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners of shares held through such DTC </span><span>Participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for the </span><span>accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in a </span><span>“</span><span>street name,</span><span>”</span><span> and will be the responsibility of such DTC Participants.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Trust has no responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or notices to Beneficial Owners, or </span><span>payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in such shares, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any </span><span>records relating to such beneficial ownership interests, or for any other aspect of the relationship between DTC and the DTC </span><span>Participants or the relationship between such DTC Participants and the Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners owning </span><span>through such DTC Participants. DTC may decide to discontinue providing its service with respect to shares of the Trust at any </span><span>time by giving reasonable notice to the Trust and discharging its responsibilities with respect thereto under applicable law. </span><span>Under such circumstances, the Trust shall take action to find a replacement for DTC to perform its functions at a comparable </span><span>cost.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Distribution of Shares. </span><span> </span><span>In connection with each Fund's launch, each Fund was seeded through the sale of one or more </span><span>Creation Units by each Fund to one or more initial investors.

An Authorized Participant, acting on behalf of an investor, may require the investor to enter into an </span><span>agreement with such Authorized Participant with respect to certain matters, including payment of the Cash Component. </span><span>Investors who are not Authorized Participants must make appropriate arrangements with an Authorized Participant. Investors </span><span>should be aware that their particular broker may not be a DTC Participant or may not have executed an Authorized </span><span>Participant Agreement and that orders to purchase Creation Units may have to be placed by the investor's broker through an </span><span>Authorized Participant. As a result, purchase orders placed through an Authorized Participant may result in additional </span><span>charges to such investor. The Trust does not expect to enter into an Authorized Participant Agreement with more than a </span><span>small number of DTC Participants. A list of current Authorized Participants may be obtained from the Distributor.

Procedures and requirements governing the </span><span>delivery of the Fund Deposit are set forth in the procedures handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time </span><span>to time. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements for a creation request to be </span><span>made through an Authorized Participant.

Those placing </span><span>orders should ascertain the applicable deadline for cash transfers by contacting the operations department of the broker or </span><span>depositary institution effectuating the transfer of the Cash Component. This deadline is likely to be significantly earlier than </span><span>the Cutoff Time of the Funds.

Economic or market disruptions or changes, or telephone or </span><span>other communication failure, may impede the ability to reach the Distributor or its agent or an Authorized Participant. Orders </span><span>to create shares of a Fund that are submitted on the Business Day immediately preceding a holiday or a day (other than a </span><span>weekend) when the equity markets in the relevant non-U.S. market are closed may not be accepted.

The Distributor or its </span><span>agent shall notify a prospective purchaser of a Creation Unit and/or the Authorized Participant acting on behalf of such </span><span>purchaser of its rejection of such order. The Funds, State Street, JPMorgan, BNY Mellon or Citibank, as applicable, the sub-custodian</span><span> and the Distributor or its agent are under no duty, however, to give notification of any defects or irregularities in the </span><span>delivery of Fund Deposits nor shall any of them incur any liability for failure to give such notification.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Issuance of a Creation Unit.</span><span>  </span><span> Except as provided herein, a Creation Unit will not be issued until the transfer of good title to </span><span>the applicable Fund of the Deposit Securities and the payment of the Cash Component have been completed. When the sub-custodian</span><span> has confirmed to the custodian that the securities included in the Fund Deposit (or the cash value thereof) have </span><span>been delivered to the account of the relevant sub-custodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor or its agent and BFA shall be </span><span>notified of such delivery and the applicable Fund will issue and cause the delivery of the Creation Unit. Creation Units are </span><span>generally issued on a </span><span>“</span><span>T+2 basis</span><span>”</span><span> (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, two Business Days after trade date). However, each Fund reserves the right to settle </span><span>Creation Unit transactions on a basis other than T+2, including a shorter settlement period, if necessary or appropriate under </span><span>the circumstances and compliant with applicable law. For example, each Fund reserves the right to settle Creation Unit </span><span>transactions on a basis other than T+2, in order to accommodate non-U.S. market holiday schedules to account for different </span><span>treatment among non-U.S. and U.S. markets of dividend record dates and ex-dividend dates (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the last day the holder of a </span><span>security can sell the security and still receive dividends payable on the security) and in certain other circumstances.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>To the extent contemplated by an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Distributor, each Fund will issue Creation Units </span><span>to such Authorized Participant, notwithstanding the fact that the corresponding Fund Deposits have not been received in </span><span>part or in whole, in reliance on the undertaking of the Authorized Participant to deliver the missing Deposit Securities as soon </span><span>as possible, which undertaking shall be secured by such Authorized Participant's delivery and maintenance of collateral as set </span><span>forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants. The Trust may use such collateral at any time to buy Deposit Securities for </span><span>the Funds. Such collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the contractual </span><span>settlement date. Information concerning the Funds' current procedures for collateralization of missing Deposit Securities is </span><span>available from the Distributor or its agent. The Authorized Participant Agreement will permit the Funds to buy the missing </span><span>Deposit Securities at any time and will subject the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the cost to the </span><span>Funds of purchasing such securities and the collateral including, without limitation, liability for related brokerage, borrowings </span><span>and other charges.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In certain cases, Authorized Participants may create and redeem Creation Units on the same trade date and in these </span><span>instances, the Funds reserve the right to settle these transactions on a net basis or require a representation from the </span><span>Authorized Participants that the creation and redemption transactions are for separate beneficial owners. All questions as to </span><span>the number of shares of each security in the Deposit Securities and the validity, form, eligibility and acceptance for deposit of </span><span>any securities to be delivered shall be determined by each Fund and the Fund's determination shall be final and binding.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Costs Associated with Creation Transactions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>iShares Europe ETF, iShares International Developed Small Cap Value Factor ETF and iShares JPX-Nikkei 400 ETF</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A standard creation transaction fee is imposed to offset the transfer and other transaction costs associated with the issuance </span><span>of Creation Units.

If a purchase consists solely or partially of cash, the Authorized Participant may </span><span>also be required to cover (up to the maximum amount shown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, </span><span>price movement and other costs and expenses related to the execution of trades resulting from such transaction (which may, </span><span>in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs).

Procedures and requirements governing redemption </span><span>transactions are set forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time to time.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Unless cash redemptions are available or specified for a Fund, the redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit generally consist </span><span>of Fund Securities, plus the Cash Amount, which is an amount equal to the difference between the NAV of the shares being </span><span>redeemed, as next determined after the receipt of a redemption request in proper form, and the value of Fund Securities, less </span><span>a redemption transaction fee (as described below).</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Trust may, in its sole discretion, substitute a </span><span>“</span><span>cash in lieu</span><span>”</span><span> amount to replace any Fund Security in certain circumstances, </span><span>including: (i) when the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant (or to an investor on whose behalf the </span><span>Authorized Participant is acting) would be restricted under applicable securities or other local laws or due to a trading </span><span>restriction; (ii) when the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in the disposition of the Fund </span><span>Security by the Authorized Participant due to restrictions under applicable securities or other local laws; (iii) when the delivery </span><span>of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in unfavorable tax treatment; (iv) when a Fund Security cannot </span><span>be settled or otherwise delivered in time to facilitate an in-kind redemption; or (v) in certain other situations.

<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>cash paid out in such cases will be equivalent to the value of the substituted security listed as a Fund Security. In the event </span><span>that the Fund Securities have a value greater than the NAV of the shares, a compensating cash payment equal to the </span><span>difference is required to be made by or through an Authorized Participant by the redeeming shareholder. Each Fund generally </span><span>redeems Creation Units for Fund Securities, but each Fund reserves the right to utilize a cash option for redemption of </span><span>Creation Units. Each Fund may, in its sole discretion, provide such redeeming Authorized Participant a portfolio of securities </span><span>that differs from the exact composition of the Fund Securities, but does not differ in NAV. The Redemption Basket may also </span><span>be modified to minimize the Cash Component by redistributing the cash to the Fund Securities portion of the Redemption </span><span>Basket through systematically rounding. The rounding methodology allows position sizes of securities in the Fund Securities </span><span>to be </span><span>“</span><span>rounded up,</span><span>”</span><span> while limiting the maximum allowed percentage change in weight and share quantity of any given </span><span>security in the Redemption Basket. Redemption Baskets may also be modified to position a fund towards a forward index </span><span>rebalance to reflect revisions that account for index additions, deletions, and re-weights.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Cash Redemption Method.</span><span>  </span><span> Although the Trust does not generally permit partial or full cash redemptions of Creation Units </span><span>of its funds, when partial or full cash redemptions of Creation Units are available or specified for a Fund, they will be effected </span><span>in essentially the same manner as in-kind redemptions thereof. In the case of partial or full cash redemption, the Authorized </span><span>Participant receives the cash equivalent of the Fund Securities it would otherwise receive through an in-kind redemption, plus </span><span>the same Cash Amount to be paid to an in-kind redeemer.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Costs Associated with Redemption Transactions.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>iShares Europe ETF, iShares International Developed Small Cap Value Factor ETF and iShares JPX-Nikkei 400 ETF</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A standard redemption transaction fee is imposed to offset transfer and other transaction costs that may be incurred by the </span><span>relevant Fund. The standard redemption transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized </span><span>Participant redeems a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number of Creation Units redeemed by an Authorized </span><span>Participant on the applicable Business Day. If a redemption consists solely or partially of cash, the Authorized Participant may </span><span>also be required to cover (up to the maximum amount shown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, </span><span>price movement and other costs and expenses related to the execution of trades resulting from such transaction (which may, </span><span>in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Authorized Participants will also bear the costs </span><span>of transferring the Fund Securities from a Fund to their account on their order. Certain fees/costs associated with redemption </span><span>transactions may be waived in certain circumstances. Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial </span><span>intermediary to dispose of Fund shares may be charged a fee for such services.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The following table sets forth each Fund's standard redemption transaction fees and maximum additional charge (as </span><span>described above):</span></div> </div> <div><span> </span></div> <div> <div> </div> </div> <div>

However, each Fund reserves </span><span>the right to settle deliveries of redemption proceeds on a basis other than T+2, including a shorter settlement period, if </span><span>necessary or appropriate under the circumstances and compliance with applicable law. For example, certain Funds reserve </span><span>the right to settle redemption transactions on a basis other than T+2 to accommodate non-U.S. market holiday schedules to </span><span>account for different treatment among non-U.S. and U.S. markets of dividend record dates and dividend ex-dates (</span><span>i.e., </span><span>the </span><span>last date the holder of a security can sell the security and still receive dividends payable on the security sold) and in certain </span><span>other circumstances consistent with applicable law.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If neither the redeeming Beneficial Owner nor the Authorized Participant acting on behalf of such redeeming Beneficial </span><span>Owner has appropriate arrangements to take delivery of Fund Securities in the applicable non-U.S. jurisdiction and it is not </span><span>possible to make other such arrangements, or if it is not possible to effect deliveries of Fund Securities in such jurisdiction, a </span><span>Fund may in its discretion exercise its option to redeem such shares in cash, and the redeeming Beneficial Owner will be </span><span>required to receive its redemption proceeds in cash. In such case, the investor will receive a cash payment equal to the net </span><span>asset value of its shares based on the NAV of the relevant Fund next determined after the redemption request is received in </span><span>proper form (minus a redemption transaction fee and additional charges specified above to offset the Fund's brokerage and </span><span>other transaction costs associated with the disposition of Fund Securities).

The fees of State Street, JPMorgan, BNY Mellon or Citibank, as applicable, and any </span><span>sub-custodians in respect of the delivery, maintenance and redelivery of the collateral shall be payable by the Authorized </span><span>Participant.

Each Fund has adopted policies and </span><span>procedures that govern the construction and acceptance of baskets, including heightened requirements for certain types of </span><span>custom baskets. Such policies and procedures provide the parameters for the construction and acceptance of custom </span><span>baskets that are in the best interests of a Fund and its shareholders, establish processes for revisions to, or deviations from, </span><span>such parameters, and specify the titles and roles of the employees of BFA who are required to review each custom basket for </span><span>compliance with those parameters. In addition, when constructing custom baskets for redemptions, the tax efficiency of a </span><span>Fund may be taken into account. The policies and procedures distinguish among different types of custom baskets that may </span><span>be used for each Fund and impose different requirements for different types of custom baskets in order to seek to mitigate </span><span>against potential risks of conflicts and/or overreaching by an Authorized Participant. BlackRock has established a governance </span><span>process to oversee basket compliance for the Funds, as set forth in each Fund's policies and procedures.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxation on Creations and Redemptions of Creation Units.</span><span>  </span><span> An Authorized Participant generally will recognize either gain or </span><span>loss upon the exchange of Deposit Securities for Creation Units.

Authorized Participants should consult their own tax advisors.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Current U.S. federal income tax laws dictate that capital gain or loss realized from the redemption of Creation Units will </span><span>generally create long-term capital gain or loss if the Authorized Participant holds the Creation Units for more than one year, </span><span>or short-term capital gain or loss if the Creation Units were held for one year or less, if the Creation Units are held as capital </span><span>assets.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxes</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The following is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations regarding the purchase, ownership and </span><span>disposition of shares of a Fund.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Regulated Investment Company Qualifications. </span><span> </span><span>Each Fund intends to continue to qualify for treatment as a separate RIC </span><span>under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify for treatment as a RIC, each Fund must annually distribute at </span><span>least 90% of its investment company taxable income (which includes dividends, interest and net short-term capital gains) </span><span>and meet several other requirements. Among such other requirements are the following: (i) at least 90% of each Fund’s </span><span>annual gross income must be derived from dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans, gains from the sale </span><span>or other disposition of stock or securities or non-U.S. currencies, other income (including, but not limited to, gains from </span><span>options, futures or forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies, </span><span>and net income derived from interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships (</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> partnerships that are traded on an </span><span>established securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than partnerships that derive at least 90% of their </span><span>income from interest, dividends, capital gains and other traditionally permitted RIC income); and (ii) at the close of each </span><span>quarter of each Fund's taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the market value of each Fund’s total assets must be represented by </span><span>cash and cash items, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs and other securities, with such other securities </span><span>limited for purposes of this calculation in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of the </span><span>Fund’s assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (b) not more than 25% of the </span><span>value of each Fund's total assets may be invested in the securities (other than U.S. government securities or the securities of </span><span>other RICs) of any one issuer, of two or more issuers of which 20% or more of the voting stock is held by the Fund and that </span><span>are engaged in the same or similar trades or businesses or related trades or businesses, or the securities of one or more </span><span>qualified publicly-traded partnerships.</span></div> <div> <div><span>A Fund may be able to cure a failure to derive at least 90% of its income from the sources specified above or a failure to </span><span>diversify its holdings in the manner described above by paying a tax</span><span> </span><span>and/or by disposing of certain assets. If, in any taxable </span><span>year, a Fund fails one of these tests and does not timely cure the failure, that Fund will be taxed in the same manner as an </span><span>ordinary corporation and distributions to its shareholders will not be deductible by that Fund in computing its taxable </span><span>income.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Although, in general, the passive loss rules of the Internal Revenue Code do not apply to RICs, such rules do apply to a RIC </span><span>with respect to items attributable to interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships. A Fund's investments in partnerships, </span><span>including in qualified publicly-traded partnerships, may result in the Fund being subject to state, local, or non-U.S. income, </span><span>franchise or withholding tax liabilities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxation of RICs. </span><span> </span><span>As a RIC, a Fund will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of its taxable investment </span><span>income and capital gains that it distributes to its shareholders, provided that it satisfies a minimum distribution requirement. </span><span>To satisfy the minimum distribution requirement, a Fund must distribute to its shareholders at least the sum of (i) 90% of its </span><span>“</span><span>investment company taxable income</span><span>”</span><span> (</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> income other than its net realized long-term capital gain over its net realized </span><span>short-term capital loss), plus or minus certain adjustments, and (ii) 90% of its net tax-exempt income for the taxable year. A </span><span>Fund will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates on any taxable income or gains that it does not distribute to its </span><span>shareholders. If a Fund fails to qualify for any taxable year as a RIC or fails to meet the distribution requirement, all of its </span><span>taxable income will be subject to tax at regular corporate income tax rates without any deduction for distributions to </span><span>shareholders, and such distributions generally will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends to the extent of the </span><span>Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits. In such event, distributions to individuals should be eligible to be </span><span>treated as qualified dividend income and distributions to corporate shareholders generally should be eligible for the dividends </span><span>received deduction. Although each Fund intends to distribute substantially all of its net investment income and its capital </span><span>gains for each taxable year, a Fund may decide to retain a portion of its income or gains if the Fund determines that doing so </span><span>is in the interest of its shareholders. Each Fund will be subject to U.S. federal income taxation to the extent any such income </span><span>or gains are not distributed. If a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC in any year, it must pay out its earnings and profits accumulated </span><span>in that year in order to qualify again as a RIC. If a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, the </span><span>Fund may be required to recognize any net built-in gains with respect to certain of its assets (</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> the excess of the aggregate </span><span>gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if the Fund </span><span>had been liquidated) if it qualifies as a RIC in a subsequent year.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Excise Tax.</span><span>  </span><span>A Fund will be subject to a 4% excise tax on certain undistributed income if it does not distribute to its </span><span>shareholders in each calendar year at least 98% of its ordinary income for the calendar year plus at least 98.2% of its capital </span><span>gain net income for the 12 months ended October 31 of such year. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital </span><span>gain net income retained by a Fund that is subject to corporate income tax will be considered to have been distributed by </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>167</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

In addition, the minimum amounts that must be distributed in any year to avoid the excise tax will be increased or </span><span>decreased to reflect any underdistribution or overdistribution, as the case may be, from the previous year. Each Fund intends </span><span>to declare and distribute dividends and distributions in the amounts and at the times necessary to avoid the application of </span><span>this 4% excise tax.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Net Capital Loss Carryforwards. </span><span> </span><span>Net capital loss carryforwards may be applied against any net realized capital gains in each </span><span>succeeding year, until they have been reduced to zero.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the event that a Fund were to experience an ownership change as defined under the Internal Revenue Code, the loss </span><span>carryforwards and other favorable tax attributes of a Fund, if any, may be subject to limitation.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The following Funds had net capital loss carryforwards, as set forth in the table below, as of March 31, 2023, the tax year-end </span><span>for the Funds:</span></div> </div> <div><span> </span></div> <div> <div> </div> </div> <div>

In that event, the Fund will designate such retained amounts as undistributed capital </span><span>gains in a notice to its shareholders who (a) will be required to include in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as </span><span>long-term capital gains, their proportionate shares of the undistributed amount, (b) will be entitled to credit their </span><span>proportionate shares of the tax paid by the Fund on the undistributed amount against their U.S. federal income tax liabilities, </span><span>if any, and to claim refunds to the extent their credits exceed their liabilities, if any, and (c) will be entitled to increase their tax </span><span>basis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in their shares by an amount equal to the excess of the amount in clause (a) over </span><span>the amount in clause (b). Organizations or persons not subject to U.S. federal income tax on such capital gains will be </span><span>entitled to a refund of their </span><span>pro rata</span><span> share of such taxes paid by the Fund upon filing appropriate returns or claims for refund </span><span>with the IRS.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>169</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Long-term capital gains are eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate </span><span>shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts.</span></div> <div> <div><span>If an individual receives a regular dividend qualifying for the long-term capital gains rates and such dividend constitutes an </span><span>“</span><span>extraordinary dividend,</span><span>”</span><span> and the individual subsequently recognizes a loss on the sale or exchange of stock in respect of </span><span>which the extraordinary dividend was paid, then the loss will be long-term capital loss to the extent of such extraordinary </span><span>dividend. An </span><span>“</span><span>extraordinary dividend</span><span>”</span><span> on common stock for this purpose is generally a dividend (i) in an amount greater than </span><span>or equal to 10% of the taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-dividend </span><span>dates within an 85-day period, or (ii) in an amount greater than 20% of the taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share </span><span>of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates within a 365-day period.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Distributions in excess of a Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits will, as to each shareholder, be treated as a </span><span>tax-free return of capital to the extent of a shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund, and as a capital gain thereafter (if the </span><span>shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets). Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum distribution </span><span>requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute </span><span>nontaxable returns of capital. Shareholders receiving dividends or distributions in the form of additional shares should be </span><span>treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as receiving a distribution in an amount equal to the amount of money that the </span><span>shareholders receiving cash dividends or distributions will receive and should have a cost basis in the shares received equal to </span><span>such amount.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on net investment income, including, but not limited to, interest, </span><span>dividends, and net gain from investments, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and </span><span>filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investors considering buying shares just prior to a dividend or capital gain distribution should be aware that, although the </span><span>price of shares purchased at that time may reflect the amount of the forthcoming distribution, such dividend or distribution </span><span>may nevertheless be taxable to them. If a Fund is the holder of record of any security on the record date for any dividends </span><span>payable with respect to such security, such dividends will be included in the Fund’s gross income not as of the date received </span><span>but as of the later of (a) the date such security became ex-dividend with respect to such dividends (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the date on which a </span><span>buyer of the security would not be entitled to receive the declared, but unpaid, dividends); or (b) the date the Fund acquired </span><span>such security. Accordingly, in order to satisfy its income distribution requirements, a Fund may be required to pay dividends </span><span>based on anticipated earnings, and shareholders may receive dividends in an earlier year than would otherwise be the case.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In certain situations, a Fund may, for a taxable year, defer all or a portion of its net capital loss (or if there is no net capital </span><span>loss, then any net long-term or short-term capital loss) realized after October and its late-year ordinary loss (defined as the </span><span>sum of (i) the excess of post-October foreign currency and passive foreign investment company (</span><span>“</span><span>PFIC</span><span>”</span><span>) losses over post-October</span><span> foreign currency and PFIC gains and (ii) the excess of post-December ordinary losses over post-December ordinary </span><span>income) until the next taxable year in computing its investment company taxable income and net capital gain, which will </span><span>defer the recognition of such realized losses. Such deferrals and other rules regarding gains and losses realized after October </span><span>(or December) may affect the tax character of shareholder distributions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Sales of Shares. </span><span> </span><span>Upon the sale or exchange of shares of a Fund, a shareholder will realize a taxable gain or loss equal to the </span><span>difference between the amount realized and the shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund. A redemption of shares by a Fund </span><span>will be treated as a sale for this purpose. Such gain or loss will be treated as capital gain or loss if the shares are capital assets </span><span>in the shareholder’s hands and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the shares are held for more than one year and short-term</span><span> capital gain or loss if the shares are held for one year or less. Any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed </span><span>to the extent the shares disposed of are replaced, including replacement through the reinvesting of dividends or capital gains </span><span>distributions, or by an option or contract to acquire substantially identical shares, within a 61-day period beginning 30 days </span><span>before and ending 30 days after the disposition of the shares. In such a case, the basis of the shares acquired will be </span><span>increased to reflect the disallowed loss.

The </span><span>Medicare contribution tax described above will apply to the sale of Fund shares.</span></div> <div> <div><span>If a shareholder incurs a sales charge in acquiring shares of a Fund, disposes of those shares within 90 days and then, on or </span><span>before January 31 of the following calendar year, acquires shares in a mutual fund for which the otherwise applicable sales </span><span>charge is reduced by reason of a reinvestment right (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, an exchange privilege), the original sales charge will not be taken </span><span>into account in computing gain/loss on the original shares to the extent the subsequent sales charge is reduced. Instead, the </span><span>disregarded portion of the original sales charge will be added to the tax basis of the newly acquired shares. Furthermore, the </span><span>same rule also applies to a disposition of the newly acquired shares made within 90 days of the second acquisition. This </span><span>provision prevents shareholders from immediately deducting the sales charge by shifting their investments within a family of </span><span>mutual funds.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Backup Withholding. </span><span> </span><span>In certain cases, a Fund will be required to withhold at a 24% rate and remit to the U.S. Treasury such </span><span>amounts withheld from any distributions paid to a shareholder who: (i) has failed to provide a correct taxpayer identification </span><span>number; (ii) is subject to backup withholding by the IRS; (iii) has failed to certify to a Fund that such shareholder is not </span><span>subject to backup withholding; or (iv) has not certified that such shareholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien). </span><span>Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amount withheld may be credited against a shareholder's U.S. federal </span><span>income tax liability.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Sections 351 and 362. </span><span> </span><span>The Trust, on behalf of each Fund, has the right to reject an order for a purchase of shares of the </span><span>Fund if the purchaser (or group of purchasers) would, upon obtaining the shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the </span><span>outstanding shares of a given Fund and if, pursuant to Sections 351 and 362 of the Internal Revenue Code, that Fund would </span><span>have a basis in the securities different from the market value of such securities on the date of deposit. If a Fund’s basis in </span><span>such securities on the date of deposit was less than market value on such date, the Fund, upon disposition of the securities, </span><span>would recognize more taxable gain or less taxable loss than if its basis in the securities had been equal to market value. It is </span><span>not anticipated that the Trust will exercise the right of rejection except in a case where the Trust determines that accepting </span><span>the order could result in material adverse tax consequences to a Fund or its shareholders. The Trust also has the right to </span><span>require information necessary to determine beneficial share ownership for purposes of the 80% determination.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxation of Certain Derivatives.</span><span>  </span><span>A Fund’s transactions in zero coupon securities, non-U.S. currencies, forward contracts, </span><span>options and futures contracts (including options and futures contracts on non-U.S. currencies), to the extent permitted, will </span><span>be subject to special provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (including provisions relating to </span><span>“</span><span>hedging transactions</span><span>”</span><span> and </span><span>“</span><span>straddles</span><span>”</span><span>) that, among other consequences, may affect the character of gains and losses realized by the Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, may </span><span>affect whether gains or losses are ordinary or capital), accelerate recognition of income to the Fund and defer Fund losses. </span><span>These rules could therefore affect the character, amount and timing of distributions to shareholders. These provisions also </span><span>(a) will require a Fund to mark-to-market certain types of the positions in its portfolio (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, treat them as if they were closed </span><span>out at the end of each year) and (b) may cause a Fund to recognize income without receiving cash with which to pay </span><span>dividends or make distributions in amounts necessary to satisfy the distribution requirements for avoiding income and excise </span><span>taxes. Each Fund will monitor its transactions, will make the appropriate tax elections and will make the appropriate entries in </span><span>its books and records when it acquires any zero coupon security, non-U.S. currency, forward contract, option, futures </span><span>contract or hedged investment in order to mitigate the effect of these rules and prevent disqualification of a Fund as a RIC.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A Fund’s investments in so-called </span><span>“</span><span>Section 1256 contracts,</span><span>”</span><span> such as regulated futures contracts, most non-U.S. currency </span><span>forward contracts traded in the interbank market and options on most security indexes, are subject to special tax rules. All </span><span>Section 1256 contracts held by a Fund at the end of its taxable year are required to be marked to their market value, and any </span><span>unrealized gain or loss on those positions will be included in a Fund’s income as if each position had been sold for its fair </span><span>market value at the end of the taxable year. The resulting gain or loss will be combined with any gain or loss realized by a </span><span>Fund from positions in Section 1256 contracts closed during the taxable year.

With respect to certain types of swaps, a Fund may be required to currently recognize income or loss </span><span>with respect to future payments on such swaps or may elect under certain circumstances to mark such swaps to market </span><span>annually for tax purposes as ordinary income or loss.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Qualified Dividend Income. </span><span> </span><span>Distributions by a Fund of investment company taxable income (including any short-term </span><span>capital gains), whether received in cash or shares, will be taxable either as ordinary income or as qualified dividend income, </span><span>which is eligible to be taxed at long-term capital gain rates to the extent a Fund receives qualified dividend income on the </span><span>securities it holds and a Fund reports the distribution as qualified dividend income. Qualified dividend income is, in general, </span><span>dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations (but generally not from U.S. REITs) and certain non-U.S. corporations (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, </span><span>non-U.S. corporations that are not PFICs and which are incorporated in a possession of the U.S. or in certain countries with a </span><span>comprehensive tax treaty with the U.S., or the stock of which is readily tradable on an established securities market in the </span><span>U.S. (where the dividends are paid with respect to such stock)). Under current IRS guidance, the U.S. has appropriate </span><span>comprehensive income tax treaties with the following countries: Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, Bulgaria, </span><span>Canada, China (but not with Hong Kong, which is treated as a separate jurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes), Cyprus, the Czech </span><span>Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, </span><span>Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, </span><span>Pakistan, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, </span><span>Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, the U.K. and Venezuela.</span><span> </span><span>Substitute </span><span>payments received by a Fund for securities lent out by a Fund will not be qualified dividend income.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>A dividend from a Fund will not be treated as qualified dividend income to the extent that: (i) the shareholder has not held </span><span>the shares on which the dividend was paid for 61 days during the 121-day period that begins on the date that is 60 days </span><span>before the date on which the shares become ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or a Fund fails to satisfy those </span><span>holding period requirements with respect to the securities it holds that paid the dividends distributed to the shareholder (or, </span><span>in the case of certain preferred stocks, the holding requirement of 91 days during the 181-day period beginning on the date </span><span>that is 90 days before the date on which the stock becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend); (ii) a Fund or the </span><span>shareholder is under an obligation (whether pursuant to a short sale or otherwise) to make related payments with respect to </span><span>substantially similar or related property; or (iii) the shareholder elects to treat such dividend as investment income under </span><span>Section 163(d)(4)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code. Dividends received by a Fund from a REIT or another RIC may be treated </span><span>as qualified dividend income only to the extent the dividend distributions are attributable to qualified dividend income </span><span>received by such REIT or other RIC. It is expected that dividends received by a Fund from a REIT and distributed to a </span><span>shareholder generally will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income. However, for tax years beginning after December </span><span>31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, a non-corporate taxpayer who is a direct REIT shareholder may claim a 20% </span><span>“</span><span>qualified </span><span>business income</span><span>”</span><span> deduction for ordinary REIT dividends, and a RIC may report dividends as eligible for this deduction to the </span><span>extent the RIC’s income is derived from ordinary REIT dividends (reduced by allocable RIC expenses). A shareholder may treat </span><span>the dividends as such provided the RIC and the shareholder satisfy applicable holding period requirements. Distributions by a </span><span>Fund of its net short-term capital gains will be taxable as ordinary income.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Corporate Dividends Received Deduction.</span><span>  </span><span>Dividends paid by a Fund that are attributable to dividends received by the Fund </span><span>from U.S. corporations may qualify for the U.S. federal dividends received deduction for corporations.

Restrictions may apply if indebtedness, including a short sale, is attributable to </span><span>the investment.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Excess Inclusion Income. </span><span> </span><span>Under current law, the Funds serve to block unrelated business taxable income (</span><span>“</span><span>UBTI</span><span>”</span><span>) from </span><span>being realized by their respective tax-exempt shareholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a tax-exempt shareholder could </span><span>realize UBTI by virtue of its investment in a Fund if shares in the Fund constitute debt-financed property in the hands of the </span><span>tax-exempt shareholder within the meaning of Section 514(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. Certain types of income received </span><span>by a Fund from REITs, real estate mortgage investment conduits, taxable mortgage pools or other investments may cause the </span><span>Fund to report some or all of its distributions as </span><span>“</span><span>excess inclusion income.</span><span>”</span><span> To Fund shareholders, such excess inclusion </span><span>income may: (i) constitute taxable income, as UBTI for those shareholders who would otherwise be tax-exempt such as </span><span>individual retirement accounts, 401(k) accounts, Keogh plans, pension plans and certain charitable entities; (ii) not be offset </span><span>by otherwise allowable deductions for tax purposes; (iii) not be eligible for reduced U.S. withholding for non-U.S. </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>172</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

If a charitable remainder annuity trust or a </span><span>charitable remainder unitrust (each as defined in Section 664 of the Internal Revenue Code) has UBTI for a taxable year, a </span><span>100% excise tax on the UBTI is imposed on the trust.</span></div> <div> <div><span>A Fund tries to avoid investing in REITs that are expected to generate excess inclusion income, but a Fund may not always be </span><span>successful in doing so. Because information about a REIT’s investments may be inadequate or inaccurate, or because a REIT </span><span>may change its investment program, a Fund may not be successful in avoiding the consequences described above. </span><span>Avoidance of investments in REITs that generate excess inclusion income may require a Fund to forego otherwise attractive </span><span>investment opportunities.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Non-U.S. Investments. </span><span> </span><span>Under Section 988 of the Internal Revenue Code, gains or losses attributable to fluctuations in </span><span>exchange rates between the time a Fund accrues income or receivables or expenses or other liabilities denominated in a non-U.S.</span><span> currency and the time a Fund actually collects such income or pays such liabilities are generally treated as ordinary </span><span>income or ordinary loss. In general, gains (and losses) realized on debt instruments will be treated as Section 988 gain (or </span><span>loss) to the extent attributable to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which the </span><span>instruments are denominated. Similarly, gains or losses on non-U.S. currency, non-U.S. currency forward contracts and </span><span>certain non-U.S. currency options or futures contracts denominated in non-U.S. currency, to the extent attributable to </span><span>fluctuations in exchange rates between the acquisition and disposition dates, are also treated as ordinary income or loss </span><span>unless a Fund was to elect otherwise.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Each Fund may be subject to non-U.S. income taxes withheld at the source. Each Fund, if permitted to do so, may elect to </span><span>“</span><span>pass through</span><span>”</span><span> to its investors the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid by the Fund provided that the Fund held the </span><span>security on the dividend settlement date and for at least 15 additional days immediately before and/or thereafter, with the </span><span>result that each investor with respect to shares of the Fund held for a minimum 16-day holding period at the time of deemed </span><span>distribution will (i) include in gross income, even though not actually received, the investor’s </span><span>pro rata</span><span> share of the Fund’s </span><span>non-U.S. income taxes, and (ii) either deduct (in calculating U.S. taxable income, but only for investors who itemize their </span><span>deductions on their personal tax returns) or credit (in calculating U.S. federal income tax) the investor’s </span><span>pro rata</span><span> share of the </span><span>Fund’s non-U.S. income taxes. Withholding taxes on dividends on non-U.S. securities while such securities are lent out by the </span><span>Fund are not eligible for non-U.S. tax credit pass through. Taxes not </span><span>“</span><span>passed through</span><span>”</span><span> for tax purposes will not be available to </span><span>shareholders for foreign tax credit purposes. A non-U.S. person invested in a Fund in a year that the Fund elects to </span><span>“</span><span>pass </span><span>through</span><span>”</span><span> its non-U.S. taxes may be treated as receiving additional dividend income subject to U.S. withholding tax. A non-U.S.</span><span> tax credit may not exceed the investor’s U.S. federal income tax otherwise payable with respect to the investor’s non-U.S. </span><span>source income. For this purpose, shareholders must treat as non-U.S. source gross income (i) their proportionate shares of </span><span>non-U.S. taxes paid by a Fund and (ii) the portion of any dividend paid by the Fund that represents income derived from non-U.S.</span><span> sources; the Fund’s gain from the sale of securities will generally be treated as U.S.-source income. Certain limitations </span><span>will be imposed to the extent to which the non-U.S. tax credit may be claimed. If your Fund shares are loaned pursuant to </span><span>securities lending arrangements, you may lose the ability to use any non-U.S. tax credits passed through by a Fund or to treat </span><span>Fund dividends (paid while the shares are held by the borrower) as qualified dividends. Regarding a short sale with respect to </span><span>shares of a Fund, substitute payments made to the lender of such shares may not be deductible under certain circumstances. </span><span>Consult your financial intermediary or tax advisor.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Passive Foreign Investment Companies. </span><span> </span><span>If a Fund purchases shares in PFICs, it may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on </span><span>a portion of any </span><span>“</span><span>excess distribution</span><span>”</span><span> or gain from the disposition of such shares even if such income is distributed as a </span><span>taxable dividend by the Fund to its shareholders. Additional charges in the nature of interest may be imposed on a Fund in </span><span>respect of deferred taxes arising from such distributions or gains.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>If a Fund were to invest in a PFIC and elect to treat the PFIC as a </span><span>“</span><span>qualified electing fund</span><span>”</span><span> under the Internal Revenue Code, in </span><span>lieu of the foregoing requirements, a Fund might be required to include in income each year a portion of the ordinary </span><span>earnings and net capital gains of the qualified electing fund, even if not distributed to a Fund, and such amounts would be </span><span>subject to the 90% and excise tax distribution requirements described above. In order to make this election, a Fund would be </span><span>required to obtain certain annual information from the PFICs in which it invests, which may be difficult or impossible to </span><span>obtain. Currently proposed IRS regulations, if adopted, would treat such included amounts as nonqualifying RIC income to a </span><span>Fund unless such amounts were also distributed to the Fund.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>173</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Alternatively, a Fund may make a mark-to-market election that would result in a Fund being treated as if it had sold and </span><span>repurchased its PFIC stock at the end of each year. In such case, a Fund would report any such gains as ordinary income and </span><span>would deduct any such losses as ordinary losses to the extent of previously recognized gains. The election must be made </span><span>separately for each PFIC owned by a Fund and, once made, would be effective for all subsequent taxable years, unless </span><span>revoked with the consent of the IRS. By making the election, a Fund could potentially ameliorate the adverse tax </span><span>consequences with respect to its ownership of shares in a PFIC, but in any particular year may be required to recognize </span><span>income in excess of the distributions it receives from PFICs and its proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock. A Fund may </span><span>have to distribute this </span><span>“</span><span>phantom</span><span>”</span><span> income and gain to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement and to avoid imposition of the </span><span>4% excise tax.</span></div> <div> <div><span>A Fund will make the appropriate tax elections, if possible, and take any additional steps that are necessary to mitigate the </span><span>effects of these rules.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Reporting. </span><span> </span><span>If a shareholder recognizes a loss with respect to a Fund’s shares of $2 million or more for an individual </span><span>shareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate shareholder, the shareholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement </span><span>on IRS Form 8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases exempted from this reporting requirement, </span><span>but under current guidance, shareholders of a RIC are not exempted. The fact that a loss is reportable under these </span><span>regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer’s treatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders </span><span>should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual circumstances.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Other Taxes. </span><span> </span><span>Dividends, distributions and redemption proceeds may also be subject to additional state, local and non-U.S. </span><span>taxes depending on each shareholder’s particular situation.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders. </span><span> </span><span>Dividends paid by a Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are generally subject to withholding </span><span>tax at a 30% rate or a reduced rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty to the extent derived from investment income </span><span>and short-term capital gains. Dividends paid by a Fund from net tax-exempt income or long-term capital gains are generally </span><span>not subject to such withholding tax. In order to obtain a reduced rate of withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder will be required </span><span>to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying its entitlement to benefits under a treaty. The withholding </span><span>tax does not apply to regular dividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who provides an IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that the </span><span>dividends are effectively connected with the non-U.S. shareholder’s conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. Instead, </span><span>the effectively connected dividends will be subject to regular U.S. income tax as if the non-U.S. shareholder were a U.S. </span><span>shareholder. A non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively connected dividends may also be subject to additional </span><span>“</span><span>branch </span><span>profits tax</span><span>”</span><span> imposed at a rate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S. shareholder who fails to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN, </span><span>IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable form may be subject to backup withholding at the appropriate rate.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Properly-reported dividends are generally exempt from U.S. federal withholding tax where they (i) are paid in respect of a </span><span>Fund’s </span><span>“</span><span>qualified net interest income</span><span>”</span><span> (generally, the Fund’s U.S. source interest income, other than certain contingent </span><span>interest and interest from obligations of a corporation or partnership in which the Fund is at least a 10% shareholder or </span><span>partner, reduced by expenses that are allocable to such income) or (ii) are paid in respect of a Fund’s </span><span>“</span><span>qualified short-term </span><span>capital gains</span><span>”</span><span> (generally, the excess of the Fund’s net short-term capital gain over the Fund’s long-term capital loss for such </span><span>taxable year). However, depending on its circumstances, a Fund may report all, some or none of its potentially eligible </span><span>dividends as such qualified net interest income or as qualified short-term capital gains and/or treat such dividends, in whole </span><span>or in part, as ineligible for this exemption from withholding. In order to qualify for this exemption from withholding, a non-U.S.</span><span> shareholder will need to comply with applicable certification requirements relating to its non-U.S. status (including, in </span><span>general, furnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or substitute Form). In the case of shares held through an </span><span>intermediary, the intermediary may withhold even if a Fund reports the payment as qualified net interest income or qualified </span><span>short-term capital gain. Non-U.S. shareholders should contact their intermediaries with respect to the application of these </span><span>rules to their accounts.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Special rules may apply to a foreign shareholder receiving a Fund distribution if at least 50% of the Fund's assets consist of </span><span>interests in U.S. real property interests, including certain REITs and U.S. real property holding corporations (as defined in the </span><span>Internal Revenue Code and Treasury regulations). Fund distributions that are attributable to gain from the disposition of a </span><span>U.S. real property interest will be taxable as ordinary dividends and subject to withholding at a 30% or lower treaty rate if the </span><span>foreign shareholder held no more than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of </span><span>the distribution. If the foreign shareholder held at least 5% of the Fund's shares, the distribution would be treated as income </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>174</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

These do not currently apply to managers established outside of the EU, such as BFA. Rather, non-EU managers </span><span>are only required to comply with certain disclosure, reporting and transparency obligations of AIFMD (</span><span>“</span><span>AIFMD Disclosure </span><span>Provisions</span><span>”</span><span>) if such managers market a fund to EU investors. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Where the AIFMD Disclosure Provisions relate to EU Operative Provisions that do not apply to BFA, no meaningful disclosure </span><span>can be made. These EU Operative Provisions include prescriptive rules on: measuring and capping leverage in line with </span><span>known European standards; the treatment of investors; the use of </span><span>“</span><span>depositaries</span><span>”</span><span>; and coverage for professional liability risks. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>AIFMD imposes certain conditions on the marketing of funds, such as the Funds, to EU investors. AIFMD requires that an </span><span>‘alternative investment fund manager’ (</span><span>“</span><span>AIFM</span><span>”</span><span>) be identified to meet such conditions where such marketing is sought. For </span><span>these purposes BFA, as the legal entity responsible for performing the portfolio and risk management of the Funds, shall be </span><span>the AIFM. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>AIFMD requires disclosure on an ongoing basis of certain information relating to the use of special arrangements, leverage, </span><span>rights of reuse of collateral, guarantees granted under leverage arrangements and the use of gates, side pockets and similar </span><span>liquidity management tools. Given that the Funds do not use any special arrangements or allow for collateral reuse, it is not </span><span>intended that such disclosures will need to be made by the Funds. Each Fund will, however, to the extent relevant and </span><span>appropriate, disclose in its annual report information on the Fund's leverage, risk profile and risk management systems </span><span>employed by BFA. Each Fund will also disclose material changes, if any, to the liquidity management systems and procedures </span><span>employed in respect of the Fund. </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BFA has registered the following Funds for marketing to investors in Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the U.K.:</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>176</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Introduction to BlackRock</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock’s purpose is to help more and more people experience financial well-being. We manage assets on behalf of </span><span>institutional and individual clients, across a full spectrum of investment strategies, asset classes, and regions. Our client base </span><span>includes pension plans, endowments, foundations, charities, official institutions, insurers, and other financial institutions, as </span><span>well as individuals around the world.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Philosophy on investment stewardship</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As part of our fiduciary duty to our clients, we consider it one of our responsibilities to promote sound corporate governance </span><span>as an informed, engaged shareholder on their behalf. At BlackRock, this is the responsibility of the BlackRock Investment </span><span>Stewardship (BIS) team.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In our experience, sound governance is critical to the success of a company, the protection of investors’ interests, and long-term</span><span> financial value creation. We take a constructive, long-term approach with companies and seek to understand how they </span><span>are managing the drivers of risk and financial value creation in their business models. We have observed that well-managed </span><span>companies will effectively evaluate and address risks and opportunities relevant to their businesses, which supports durable, </span><span>long-term financial value creation. As one of many minority shareholders, BlackRock cannot – and does not try to – direct a </span><span>company’s strategy or its implementation.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shareholder rights</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We believe that there are certain fundamental rights attached to shareholding. Shareholders should have the right to:</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Elect, remove, and nominate directors, approve the appointment of the auditor, and amend the corporate charter or </span><span>by-laws.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Vote on key board decisions that are material to the protection of their investment, including but not limited to, </span><span>changes to the purpose of the business, dilution levels and pre-emptive rights, and the distribution of income and </span><span>capital structure.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Access sufficient and timely information on material governance, strategic, and business matters to make informed </span><span>decisions.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>In our view, shareholder voting rights should be proportionate to economic ownership—the principle of </span><span>“</span><span>one share, one </span><span>vote</span><span>”</span><span> helps to achieve this balance.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Consistent with these shareholder rights, BlackRock monitors and provides feedback to companies in our role as stewards of </span><span>our clients’ assets. Investment stewardship is how we use our voice as an investor to promote sound corporate governance </span><span>and business practices that support the ability of companies to deliver long-term financial performance for our clients. We do </span><span>this through engagement with companies, proxy voting on behalf of those clients who have given us authority, and </span><span>participating in market-level dialogue to improve corporate governance standards.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Engagement is an important mechanism for providing feedback on company practices and disclosures, particularly where </span><span>our observations indicate that they could be enhanced to support a company’s ability to deliver financial performance. </span><span>Similarly, it provides us with an opportunity to hear directly from company boards and management on how they believe </span><span>their actions are aligned with the long-term economic interests of shareholders. Engagement with companies may also </span><span>inform our proxy voting decisions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As a fiduciary, we vote in the long-term economic interests of our clients. Generally, we support the recommendations of the </span><span>board of directors and management. However, there may be instances where we vote against the election of directors or </span><span>other management proposals, or support shareholder proposals. For instance, we may vote against management </span><span>recommendations where we are concerned that the board may not be acting in the long-term economic interests of </span><span>shareholders, or disclosures do not provide sufficient information to assess how material, strategic risks and opportunities </span><span>are being managed. Our regional proxy voting guidelines are informed by our market-specific approach and standards of </span><span>corporate governance best practices.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Key Themes</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>While accepted standards and norms of corporate governance can differ between markets, in our experience, there are </span><span>certain globally-applicable fundamental elements of governance that contribute to a company’s ability to create long-term </span><span>financial value for shareholders. These global themes are set out in this overarching set of principles (the </span><span>“</span><span>Principles</span><span>”</span><span>), which </span><span>are anchored in transparency and accountability. At a minimum, it is our view that companies should observe the accepted </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Alongside the Principles and regional voting guidelines, BIS </span><span>publishes our </span><span>engagement priorities</span><span> which reflect the </span><span>five themes</span><span> on which we most frequently engage companies, where </span><span>they are relevant, as these can be a source of material business risk or opportunity. Collectively, these BIS policies set out the </span><span>core elements of corporate governance that guide our investment stewardship efforts globally and within each market, </span><span>including when engaging with companies and voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS policies are applied on a case-by-case </span><span>basis, taking into consideration the context within which a company is operating.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Boards and directors</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We believe that an effective and well-functioning board that has appropriate governance structures to facilitate oversight of a </span><span>company's management and strategic initiatives is critical to the long-term financial success of a company and the </span><span>protection of shareholders’ economic interests. In our view, a strong board can be a competitive advantage to a company, </span><span>providing valuable oversight of and perspectives to management on the most important decisions in support of long-term </span><span>financial performance. As part of their responsibilities, board members have a fiduciary duty to shareholders to oversee the </span><span>strategic direction, operations, and risk management of a company. For this reason, BIS sees engagement with and the </span><span>election of directors as one of our most important responsibilities. Disclosure of material risks that may affect a company’s </span><span>long-term strategy and financial value creation, including material sustainability-related factors when relevant, is essential for </span><span>shareholders to appropriately understand and assess how effectively management is identifying, managing, and mitigating </span><span>such risks.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The board should establish and maintain a framework of robust and effective governance mechanisms to support its </span><span>oversight of the company’s strategy and operations consistent with the long-term economic interests of investors. There </span><span>should be clear descriptions of the role of the board and the committees of the board and how directors engage with and </span><span>oversee management. We look to the board to articulate the effectiveness of these mechanisms in overseeing the </span><span>management of business risks and opportunities and the fulfillment of the company’s purpose and strategy.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Where a company has not adequately disclosed and demonstrated that its board has fulfilled these corporate governance </span><span>and risk oversight responsibilities, we will consider voting against the election of directors who, on our assessment, have </span><span>particular responsibility for the issues. We assess director performance on a case-by-case basis and in light of each </span><span>company’s circumstances, taking into consideration their governance, business practices that support durable, long-term </span><span>financial value creation, and performance. Set out below are ways in which boards and directors can demonstrate a </span><span>commitment to acting in the long-term economic interests of all shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Regular accountability through director elections</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>It is our view that directors should stand for election on a regular basis, ideally annually. In our experience, annual director </span><span>elections allow shareholders to reaffirm their support for board members and/or hold them accountable for their decisions in </span><span>a timely manner. When board members are not elected annually, in our experience, it is good practice for boards to have a </span><span>rotation policy to ensure that, through a board cycle, all directors have had their appointment re-confirmed, with a </span><span>proportion of directors being put forward for election at each annual general meeting.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Effective board composition</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Regular director elections also give boards the opportunity to adjust their composition in an orderly way to reflect </span><span>developments in the company’s strategy and the market environment. In our view, it is beneficial for new directors to be </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

We consider the average overall tenure of the board, and seek a balance between the knowledge and </span><span>experience of longer-serving directors and the fresh perspectives of directors who joined more recently. We encourage </span><span>companies to regularly review the effectiveness of their board (including its size), and assess directors nominated for election </span><span>in the context of the composition of the board as a whole. In our view, the company’s assessment should consider a number </span><span>of factors, including each director’s independence and time commitments, as well as the diversity and relevance of director </span><span>experiences and skillsets, and how these factors may contribute to the financial performance of the company.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Similarly, there should be a sufficient number of independent directors, free from conflicts of interest or undue influence from </span><span>connected parties, to ensure objectivity in the decision-making of the board and its ability to oversee management. Common </span><span>impediments to independence may include but are not limited to:</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Current or recent employment at the company or a subsidiary</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Being, or representing, a shareholder with a substantial shareholding in the company</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Interlocking directorships</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Having any other interest, business, or other relationship which could, or could reasonably be perceived to, materially </span><span>interfere with a director’s ability to act in the best interests of the company and shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>In our experience, boards are most effective at overseeing and advising management when there is a senior, independent </span><span>board leader. This director may chair the board, or, where the chair is also the CEO (or is otherwise not independent), be </span><span>designated as a lead independent director. The role of this director is to enhance the effectiveness of the independent </span><span>members of the board through shaping the agenda, ensuring adequate information is provided to the board, and </span><span>encouraging independent director participation in board deliberations. The lead independent director or another appropriate </span><span>director should be available to meet with shareholders in those situations where an independent director is best placed to </span><span>explain and contextualize a company’s approach.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>There are matters for which the board has responsibility that may involve a conflict of interest for executives or for affiliated </span><span>directors, or require additional focus. It is our view that objective oversight of such matters is best achieved when the board </span><span>forms committees comprised entirely of independent directors. In many markets, these committees of the board specialize in </span><span>audit, director nominations, and compensation matters. An ad hoc committee might also be formed to decide on a special </span><span>transaction, particularly one involving a related party, or to investigate a significant adverse event.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When nominating directors to the board, we look to companies to provide sufficient information on the individual candidates </span><span>so that shareholders can assess the capabilities and suitability of each individual nominee and their fit within overall board </span><span>composition. These disclosures should give an understanding of how the collective experience and expertise of the board, as </span><span>well as the particular skill-sets of individual directors, aligns with the company’s long-term strategy and business model. </span><span>Highly qualified, engaged directors with professional characteristics relevant to a company’s business and strategy enhance </span><span>the ability of the board to add value and be the voice of shareholders in board discussions.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>It is in this context that we are interested in diversity in the board room. We see it as a means to promoting diversity of </span><span>thought and avoiding </span><span>“</span><span>group think</span><span>”</span><span> when the board advises and oversees management. This position is based on our view </span><span>that diversity of perspective and thought – in the board room, in the management team, and throughout the company – </span><span>leads to better long-term economic outcomes for companies. Academic research has revealed correlations between specific </span><span>dimensions of diversity and effects on decision-making processes and outcomes.</span><span>1</span><span> In our experience, greater diversity in the </span><span>board room can contribute to more robust discussions and more innovative and resilient decisions. Over time, greater </span><span>diversity in the board room can also promote greater diversity and resilience in the leadership team, and the workforce more </span><span>broadly. That diversity can enable companies to develop businesses that better address the needs of the customers and </span><span>communities they serve.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We ask boards to disclose how diversity is considered in board composition, including professional characteristics, such as a </span><span>director’s industry experience, specialist areas of expertise and geographic location; as well as demographic characteristics </span><span>such as gender, race/ethnicity, and age.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We look to understand a board’s diversity in the context of a company’s domicile, market capitalization, business model, and </span><span>strategy. Increasingly, we see the most effective boards nominating directors from diverse backgrounds which helps ensure </span><span>boards can more effectively understand the company's customers, employees, and communities. We note that in many </span><span>markets, policymakers have set board gender diversity goals which we may discuss with companies, particularly if there is a </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>For a discussion on the different impacts of diversity see: </span><span>McKinsey</span><span>, </span><span>“</span><span>Diversity Wins: How Inclusion Matters,</span><span>”</span><span> May 2022; </span><span>Harvard Business Review</span><span>, </span><span>“</span><span>Diverse Teams Feel Less Comfortable – and That’s Why They Perform Better,</span><span>”</span><span> September 2016; </span><span>“</span><span>Do Diverse Directors Influence DEI Outcomes</span><span>,</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>September 2022.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-6</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Self-identified board demographic diversity can usefully be disclosed in </span><span>aggregate, consistent with local law. We encourage boards to aspire to meaningful diversity of membership, while </span><span>recognizing that building a strong, diverse board can take time.</span></div> <div> <div><span>Sufficient capacity</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As the role and expectations of a director are increasingly demanding, directors must be able to commit an appropriate </span><span>amount of time to board and committee matters. It is important that directors have the capacity to meet all of their </span><span>responsibilities - including when there are unforeseen events – and therefore, they should not take on an excessive number of </span><span>roles that would impair their ability to fulfill their duties.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Auditors and audit-related issues</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock recognizes the critical importance of financial statements, which should provide a true and fair picture of a </span><span>company’s financial condition. Accordingly, the assumptions made by management and reviewed by the auditor in preparing </span><span>the financial statements should be reasonable and justified.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The accuracy of financial statements, inclusive of financial and non-financial information as required or permitted under </span><span>market-specific accounting rules, is of paramount importance to BlackRock. Investors increasingly recognize that a broader </span><span>range of risks and opportunities have the potential to materially impact financial performance. Over time, we anticipate </span><span>investors and other users of company reporting will increasingly seek to understand and scrutinize the assumptions </span><span>underlying financial statements, particularly those that pertain to the impact of the transition to a low-carbon economy on a </span><span>company’s business model and asset mix. We recognize that this is an area of evolving practice and note that international </span><span>standards setters, such as the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Board and the International Auditing and </span><span>Assurance Standards Board (IAASB), continue to develop their guidance to companies.</span><span>2</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In this context, audit committees, or equivalent, play a vital role in a company’s financial reporting system by providing </span><span>independent oversight of the accounts, material financial and, where appropriate to the jurisdiction, non-financial </span><span>information and internal control frameworks. Moreover, in the absence of a dedicated risk committee, these committees can </span><span>provide oversight of Enterprise Risk Management systems.</span><span>3</span><span> In our view, effective audit committee oversight strengthens the </span><span>quality and reliability of a company’s financial statements and provides an important level of reassurance to shareholders.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We hold members of the audit committee or equivalent responsible for overseeing the management of the audit function. </span><span>Audit committees or equivalent should have clearly articulated charters that set out their responsibilities and have a rotation </span><span>plan in place that allows for a periodic refreshment of the committee membership to introduce fresh perspectives to audit </span><span>oversight. We recognize that audit committees will rely on management, internal audit, and the independent auditor in </span><span>fulfilling their responsibilities but look to committee members to demonstrate they have relevant expertise to monitor and </span><span>oversee the audit process and related activities.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We take particular note of unexplained changes in reporting methodology, cases involving significant financial restatements, </span><span>or ad hoc notifications of material financial weakness. In this respect, audit committees should provide timely disclosure on </span><span>the remediation of Key and Critical Audit Matters identified either by the external auditor or internal audit function.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The integrity of financial statements depends on the auditor being free of any impediments to being an effective check on </span><span>management. To that end, it is important that auditors are, and are seen to be, independent. Where an audit firm provides </span><span>services to the company in addition to the audit, the fees earned should be disclosed and explained. Audit committees </span><span>should have in place a procedure for assessing annually the independence of the auditor and the quality of the external audit </span><span>process.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Comprehensive disclosure provides investors with a sense of the company’s long-term operational risk management </span><span>practices and, more broadly, the quality of the board’s oversight. The audit or risk committee, should periodically review the </span><span>company’s risk assessment and risk management policies and the significant risks and exposures identified by management, </span><span>the internal auditors or the independent auditors and management’s steps to address them. In the absence of detailed </span><span>disclosures, we may reasonably conclude that companies are not adequately managing risk.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>2</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>IFRS, </span><span>“</span><span>IFRS S1 General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information</span><span>”</span><span>, June 2023, and IAASB, </span><span>“</span><span>IAASB Launches Public </span><span>Consultation on Landmark Proposed Global Sustainability Assurance Standard</span><span>”</span><span>, August 2023.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>3</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Enterprise risk management is a process, effected by the entity’s board of directors, management, and other personnel, applied in strategy setting and </span><span>across the enterprise, designed to identify potential events that may affect the entity, and manage risk to be within the risk appetite, to provide </span><span>reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Capital structure, mergers, asset sales, and other special transactions</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>The capital structure of a company is critical to shareholders as it impacts the value of their investment and the priority of </span><span>their interest in the company relative to that of other equity or debt investors. Pre-emptive rights are a key protection for </span><span>shareholders against the dilution of their interests.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Effective voting rights are basic rights of share ownership and a core principle of effective governance. Shareholders, as the </span><span>residual claimants, have the strongest interest in protecting the financial value of the company, and voting rights should </span><span>match economic exposure, i.e. one share, one vote.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In principle, we disagree with the creation of a share class with equivalent economic exposure and preferential, differentiated </span><span>voting rights. In our view, this structure violates the fundamental corporate governance principle of proportionality and </span><span>results in a concentration of power in the hands of a few shareholders, thus disenfranchising other shareholders and </span><span>amplifying any potential conflicts of interest. However, we recognize that in certain markets, at least for a period of time, </span><span>companies may have a valid argument for listing dual classes of shares with differentiated voting rights. In our view, such </span><span>companies should review these share class structures on a regular basis or as company circumstances change. Additionally, </span><span>they should seek shareholder approval of their capital structure on a periodic basis via a management proposal at the </span><span>company’s shareholder meeting. The proposal should give unaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to affirm the current </span><span>structure or establish mechanisms to end or phase out controlling structures at the appropriate time, while minimizing costs </span><span>to shareholders.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In assessing mergers, asset sales, or other special transactions, BlackRock’s primary consideration is the long-term economic </span><span>interests of our clients as shareholders. Boards proposing a transaction should clearly explain the economic and strategic </span><span>rationale behind it. We will review a proposed transaction to determine the degree to which it can enhance long-term </span><span>shareholder value. We find long-term investors like our clients typically benefit when proposed transactions have the </span><span>unanimous support of the board and have been negotiated at arm’s length. We may seek reassurance from the board that </span><span>the financial interests of executives and/or board members in a given transaction have not adversely affected their ability to </span><span>place shareholders’ interests before their own. Where the transaction involves related parties, the recommendation to </span><span>support should come from the independent directors, a best practice in most markets, and ideally, the terms should have </span><span>been assessed through an independent appraisal process. In addition, it is good practice that it be approved by a separate </span><span>vote of the non-conflicted parties.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As a matter of sound governance practice, shareholders should have a right to dispose of company shares in the open </span><span>market without unnecessary restriction. In our view, corporate mechanisms designed to limit shareholders’ ability to sell their </span><span>shares are contrary to basic property rights. Such mechanisms can serve to protect and entrench interests other than those </span><span>of the shareholders. In our view, shareholders are broadly capable of making decisions in their own best interests. We </span><span>encourage any so-called </span><span>“</span><span>shareholder rights plans</span><span>”</span><span> proposed by a board to be subject to shareholder approval upon </span><span>introduction and periodically thereafter.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Executive compensation</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In most markets, one of the most important roles for a company’s board of directors is to put in place a compensation </span><span>structure that incentivizes and rewards executives appropriately. There should be a clear link between variable pay and </span><span>operational and financial performance. Performance metrics should be stretching and aligned with a company’s strategy and </span><span>business model. BIS does not have a position on the use of sustainability-related criteria in compensation structures, but in </span><span>our view, where companies choose to include these components, they should be adequately disclosed, material to the </span><span>company’s strategy, and as rigorous as other financial or operational targets. Long-term incentive plans should encompass </span><span>timeframes that 1) are distinct from annual executive compensation structures and metrics, and 2) encourage the delivery of </span><span>strong financial results over a period of years. Compensation committees should guard against contractual arrangements </span><span>that would entitle executives to material compensation for early termination of their employment. Finally, pension </span><span>contributions and other deferred compensation arrangements should be reasonable, in light of market practices.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We are not supportive of one-off or special bonuses unrelated to company or individual performance. Where discretion has </span><span>been used by the compensation committee or its equivalent, we expect disclosure relating to how and why the discretion </span><span>was used, and how the adjusted outcome is aligned with the interests of shareholders. We acknowledge that the use of peer </span><span>group evaluation by compensation committees can help ensure competitive pay; however, we are concerned when the </span><span>rationale for increases in total compensation at a company is solely based on peer benchmarking, rather than a rigorous </span><span>measure of outperformance. We encourage companies to clearly explain how compensation outcomes have rewarded </span><span>performance.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>We encourage boards to consider building clawback provisions into incentive plans such that companies could clawback </span><span>compensation or require executives to forgo awards when compensation was based on faulty financial statements or </span><span>deceptive business practices. We also favor recoupment from or the foregoing of the grant of any awards by any senior </span><span>executive whose behavior caused material financial harm to shareholders, material reputational risk to the company, or </span><span>resulted in a criminal investigation, even if such actions did not ultimately result in a material restatement of past results.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Non-executive directors should be compensated in a manner that is commensurate with the time and effort expended in </span><span>fulfilling their professional responsibilities. Additionally, these compensation arrangements should not risk compromising </span><span>directors’ independence or aligning their interests too closely with those of the management, whom they are charged with </span><span>overseeing.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We use third party research, in addition to our own analysis, to evaluate existing and proposed compensation structures. BIS </span><span>may signal concerns through not supporting management’s proposals to approve compensation, where they are on the </span><span>agenda. We may also vote against members of the compensation committee or equivalent board members for poor </span><span>compensation practices or structures.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Material sustainability-related risks and opportunities</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>It is our view that well-managed companies will effectively evaluate and manage material sustainability-related risks and </span><span>opportunities relevant to their businesses. As with all risks and opportunities in a company's business model, appropriate </span><span>oversight of material sustainability considerations is a core component of having an effective governance framework, which </span><span>supports durable, long-term financial value creation.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Robust disclosure is essential for investors to effectively evaluate companies’ strategy and business practices related to </span><span>material sustainability-related risks and opportunities. Long-term investors like our clients can benefit when companies </span><span>demonstrate that they have a resilient business model through disclosures that cover governance, strategy, risk </span><span>management, and metrics and targets, including industry-specific metrics. The International Sustainability Standards Board </span><span>(ISSB) standards, IFRS S1 and S2,</span><span>4</span><span> provide companies with a useful guide to preparing this disclosure. The standards build on </span><span>the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework and the standards and metrics developed by the </span><span>Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), which have converged under the ISSB. We recognize that companies may </span><span>phase in reporting aligned with the ISSB standards over several years. We also recognize that some companies may report </span><span>using different standards, which may be required by regulation, or one of a number of voluntary standards. In such cases, we </span><span>ask that companies highlight the metrics that are industry- or company-specific.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We note that climate and other sustainability-related disclosures often require companies to collect and aggregate data from </span><span>various internal and external sources. We recognize that the practical realities of data collection and reporting may not line up </span><span>with financial reporting cycles and companies may require additional time after their fiscal year-end to accurately collect, </span><span>analyze, and report this data to investors.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>That said, to give investors time to assess the data, we encourage companies to produce climate and other sustainability-related</span><span> disclosures sufficiently in advance of their annual meeting, to the best of their abilities.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Companies may also choose to adopt or refer to guidance on sustainable and responsible business conduct issued by </span><span>supranational organizations such as the United Nations or the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. </span><span>Further, industry initiatives on managing specific operational risks may provide useful guidance to companies on best </span><span>practices and disclosures. We find it helpful to our understanding of investment risk when companies disclose any relevant </span><span>global climate and other sustainability-related standards adopted, the industry initiatives in which they participate, any peer </span><span>group benchmarking undertaken, and any assurance processes to help investors understand their approach to sustainable </span><span>and responsible business practices. We will express any concerns through our voting where a company’s actions or </span><span>disclosures do not seem adequate in light of the materiality of the business risks.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Climate and nature-related risk</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>While companies in various sectors and geographies may be affected differently by climate-related risks and opportunities, </span><span>the low-carbon transition is an investment factor that can be material for many companies and economies around the globe.</span><span> </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div><span>4</span><span> </span><span>The objective of </span><span>IFRS S1</span><span> General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information is to require an entity to disclose </span><span>information about its sustainability-related risks and opportunities that is useful to primary users of general-purpose financial reports in making </span><span>decisions relating to providing resources to the entity.

As one of many shareholders, and typically a minority one, BlackRock does not tell companies what to do. It is the role </span><span>of the board and management to set and implement a company's long-term strategy to deliver long-term financial returns.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Our research shows that the low-carbon transition is a structural shift in the global economy that will be shaped by changes </span><span>in government policies, technology, and consumer preferences, which may be material for many companies. </span><span>5 </span><span>Yet the path to </span><span>a low-carbon economy is deeply uncertain and uneven, with different parts of the economy moving at different speeds. BIS </span><span>recognizes that it can be challenging for companies to predict the impact of climate-related risk and opportunity on their </span><span>businesses and operating environments. Many companies are assessing how to navigate the low-carbon transition while </span><span>delivering long-term value to investors. In this context, we encourage companies to publicly disclose, consistent with their </span><span>business model and sector, how they intend to deliver long-term financial performance through the transition to a low-carbon</span><span> economy. Where available, we appreciate companies publishing their transition plan.</span><span>6</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Consistent with the ISSB standards, we are better able to assess preparedness for the low-carbon transition when companies </span><span>disclose short-, medium- and long-term targets, ideally science-based where these are available for their sector, for scope 1 </span><span>and 2 greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reductions and to demonstrate how their targets are consistent with the long-term </span><span>financial interests of their investors.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>While we recognize that regulators in some markets are moving to mandate certain disclosures, at this stage, we view scope </span><span>3 emissions differently from scopes 1 and 2, given methodological complexity, regulatory uncertainty, concerns about </span><span>double-counting, and lack of direct control by companies. We welcome disclosures and commitments companies choose to </span><span>make regarding scope 3 emissions and recognize these are provided on a good-faith basis as methodology develops. Our </span><span>publicly available </span><span>commentary</span><span> provides more information on our approach to climate-related risks and opportunities.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition to climate-related risks and opportunities, the management of nature-related factors is increasingly a component </span><span>of some companies’ ability to generate durable, long-term financial returns for shareholders, particularly where a company’s </span><span>strategy is heavily reliant on the availability of natural capital, or whose supply chains are exposed to locations with nature-related</span><span> risks. We look for such companies to disclose how they manage any reliance and impact on, as well as use of, natural </span><span>capital, including appropriate risk oversight and relevant metrics and targets, to understand how these factors are integrated </span><span>into strategy. We will evaluate these disclosures to inform our view of how a company is managing material nature-related </span><span>risks and opportunities, as well as in our assessment of relevant shareholder proposals. Our publicly available </span><span>commentary</span><span> </span><span>provides more information on our approach to natural capital. </span><span>7</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Key stakeholder interests</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In order to advance long-term shareholders’ interests, companies should consider the interests of the various parties on </span><span>whom they depend for their success over time. It is for each company to determine their key stakeholders based on what is </span><span>material to their business and long-term financial performance. For many companies, key stakeholders include employees, </span><span>business partners (such as suppliers and distributors), clients and consumers, regulators, and the communities in which they </span><span>operate.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As a long-term shareholder on behalf of our clients, we find it helpful when companies disclose how they have identified </span><span>their key stakeholders and considered their interests in business decision-making. In addition to understanding broader </span><span>stakeholder relationships, BIS finds it helpful when companies consider the needs of their workforce today, and the skills </span><span>required for their future business strategy. We are also interested to understand the role of the board, which is well positioned </span><span>to ensure that the approach taken is informed by and aligns with the company’s strategy and purpose.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Companies should articulate how they address material adverse impacts that could arise from their business practices and </span><span>affect critical relationships with their stakeholders. We encourage companies to implement, to the extent appropriate, </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div><span>5</span><span> </span><span>BlackRock Investment Institute, </span><span>“</span><span>Tracking the low-carbon transition</span><span>”</span><span>, July 2023.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>6</span><span> </span><span>We have observed that more companies are developing such plans, and public policy makers in a number of markets are signaling their intentions to </span><span>require them. We view transition plans (TPs) as a method for a company to both internally assess and externally communicate long-term strategy, </span><span>ambition, objectives, and actions to create financial value through the global transition towards a low-carbon economy. While many initiatives across </span><span>jurisdictions outline a framework for TPs, there is no consensus on the key elements these plans should contain. We view useful disclosure as that </span><span>which communicates a company’s approach to managing financially material, business relevant risks and opportunities – including climate-related </span><span>risks – to deliver long-term financial performance, thus enabling investors to make more informed decisions.</span></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>7</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Given the growing awareness of the materiality of these issues for certain businesses, enhanced reporting on a company's natural capital </span><span>dependencies and impacts would aid investors’ understanding. In our view, the final recommendations of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial </span><span>Disclosures may prove useful to some companies. We recognize that some companies may report using different standards, which may be required </span><span>by regulation, or one of a number of other private sector standards.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-10</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

In our view, maintaining trust within these relationships can </span><span>contribute to a company’s long-term success.</span><span> </span></div> <div> <div><span>Other corporate governance matters and shareholder protections</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In our view, shareholders have a right to material and timely information on the financial performance and viability of the </span><span>companies in which they invest. In addition, companies should publish information on the governance structures in place </span><span>and the rights of shareholders to influence these structures. The reporting and disclosure provided by companies help </span><span>shareholders assess the effectiveness of the board’s oversight of management and whether investors’ economic interests </span><span>have been protected. We believe shareholders should have the right to vote on key corporate governance matters, including </span><span>changes to governance mechanisms, to submit proposals to the shareholders’ meeting, and to call special meetings of </span><span>shareholders.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Corporate form</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In our view, it is the responsibility of the board to determine the corporate form that is most appropriate given the company's </span><span>purpose and business model. </span><span>8</span><span> Companies proposing to change their corporate form to a public benefit corporation or </span><span>similar entity should put it to a shareholder vote if not already required to do so under applicable law. Supporting </span><span>documentation from companies or shareholder proponents proposing to alter the corporate form should clearly articulate </span><span>how the interests of shareholders and different stakeholders would be impacted as well as the accountability and voting </span><span>mechanisms that would be available to shareholders. As a fiduciary on behalf of clients, we generally support management </span><span>proposals if our analysis indicates that shareholders’ economic interests are adequately protected. Relevant shareholder </span><span>proposals are evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shareholder proposals</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In most markets in which BlackRock invests on behalf of clients, shareholders have the right to submit proposals to be voted </span><span>on by shareholders at a company’s annual or extraordinary meeting, as long as eligibility and procedural requirements are </span><span>met. The matters that we see put forward by shareholders address a wide range of topics, including governance reforms, </span><span>capital management, and improvements in the management or disclosure of sustainability-related risks.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock is subject to legal and regulatory requirements in the U.S. that place restrictions and limitations on how BlackRock </span><span>can interact with the companies in which we invest on behalf of our clients, including our ability to submit shareholder </span><span>proposals. We can vote, on behalf of clients who authorize us to do so, on proposals put forth by others.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When assessing shareholder proposals, we evaluate each proposal on its merit, with a singular focus on its implications for </span><span>long-term financial value creation by that company. We believe it is helpful for companies to disclose the names of the </span><span>proponent or organization that has submitted or advised on the proposal. We consider the business and economic relevance </span><span>of the issue raised, as well as its materiality and the urgency with which our experience indicates it should be addressed. We </span><span>would not support proposals that we believe would result in over-reaching into the basic business decisions of the company. </span><span>We take into consideration the legal effect of the proposal, as shareholder proposals may be advisory or legally binding </span><span>depending on the jurisdiction, while others may make requests that would be deemed illegal in a given jurisdiction.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Where a proposal is focused on a material business risk that we agree needs to be addressed and the intended outcome is </span><span>consistent with long-term financial value creation, we will look to the board and management to demonstrate that the </span><span>company has met the intent of the request made in the shareholder proposal. Where our analysis and/or engagement </span><span>indicate an opportunity for improvement in the company’s approach to the issue, we may support shareholder proposals that </span><span>are reasonable and not unduly prescriptive or constraining on management.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We recognize that some shareholder proposals bundle topics and/or specific requests and include supporting statements </span><span>that explain the reasoning or objectives of the proponent. In voting on behalf of clients, we do not submit or edit proposals or </span><span>the supporting statements – we must vote yes or no on the proposal as phrased by the proponent. Therefore, when we vote </span><span>in support of a proposal, we are not necessarily endorsing every element of the proposal or the reasoning, objectives, or </span><span>supporting statement of the proponent. We may support a proposal for different reasons from those put forth by the </span><span>proponent, when we believe that, overall, it can advance our clients' long-term financial interests. We would normally explain </span><span>to the company our rationale for supporting such proposals.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div><span>8</span><span> Corporate form refers to the legal structure by which a business is organized.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The regional Stewardship Advisory Committees review and advise on </span><span>amendments to BIS regional proxy voting guidelines (the Guidelines) covering markets within each respective region. The </span><span>advisory committees do not determine voting decisions, which are the responsibility of BIS.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition to the regional Stewardship Advisory Committees, the Investment Stewardship Global Oversight Committee </span><span>(Global Oversight Committee) is a risk-focused committee, comprised of senior representatives from various BlackRock </span><span>investment teams, a senior legal representative, the Global Head of Investment Stewardship (Global Head), and other senior </span><span>executives with relevant experience and team oversight. The Global Committee does not determine voting decisions, which </span><span>are the responsibility of BIS.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Global Head has primary oversight of the activities of BIS, including voting in accordance with the Guidelines, which </span><span>require the application of professional judgment and consideration of each company’s unique circumstances. The Global </span><span>Committee reviews and approves amendments to these Principles. The Global Committee also reviews and approves </span><span>amendments to the regional Guidelines, as proposed by the regional Stewardship Advisory Committees.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, the Global Committee receives and reviews periodic reports regarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as updates on </span><span>material process issues, procedural changes, and other risk oversight considerations. The Global Committee reviews these </span><span>reports in an oversight capacity as informed by the Guidelines.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BIS carries out engagement with companies, executes proxy votes, and conducts vote operations (including maintaining </span><span>records of votes cast) in a manner consistent with the relevant Guidelines. BIS also conducts research on corporate </span><span>governance issues and participates in industry discussions to contribute to and keep abreast of important developments in </span><span>the corporate governance field. BIS may utilize third parties for certain of the foregoing activities and performs oversight of </span><span>those third parties. BIS may raise complicated or particularly controversial matters for internal discussion with the relevant </span><span>investment teams and governance specialists for discussion and guidance prior to making a voting decision.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Vote execution</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock votes on proxy issues when our clients authorize us to do so. When BlackRock has been authorized to vote on </span><span>behalf of our clients, we carefully consider proxies submitted to funds and other fiduciary account(s) (Fund or Funds) for </span><span>which we have voting authority. BlackRock votes (or refrains from voting) proxies for each Fund for which we have voting </span><span>authority based on our evaluation of the alignment of the voting items with the long-term economic interests of our clients, </span><span>in the exercise of our independent business judgment, and without regard to the relationship of the issuer of the proxy (or </span><span>any shareholder proponent or dissident shareholder) to the Fund, the Fund’s affiliates (if any), BlackRock or BlackRock’s </span><span>affiliates, or BlackRock employees (see </span><span>“</span><span>Conflicts management policies and procedures,</span><span>”</span><span> below).</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>When exercising voting rights, BIS will normally vote on specific proxy issues in accordance with the Guidelines for the </span><span>relevant market, as well as the Global Principles. The Guidelines are reviewed annually and are amended consistent with </span><span>changes in the local market practice, as developments in corporate governance occur, or as otherwise deemed advisable by </span><span>the applicable Stewardship Advisory Committees. BIS analysts may, in the exercise of their professional judgment, conclude </span><span>that the Guidelines do not cover the specific matter upon which a proxy vote is required or that an exception to the </span><span>Guidelines would be in the long-term economic interests of BlackRock’s clients.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In the uncommon circumstance of there being a vote with respect to fixed income securities or the securities of privately </span><span>held issuers, the decision generally will be made by a Fund's portfolio managers and/or BIS based on an assessment of the </span><span>particular transactions or other matters at issue.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In certain markets, proxy voting involves logistical issues which can affect BIS’ ability to vote such proxies, as well as the </span><span>desirability of voting such proxies. These issues include, but are not limited to: i) untimely notice of shareholder meetings; ii) </span><span>restrictions on a foreigner’s ability to exercise votes; iii) requirements to vote proxies in person; iv) </span><span>“</span><span>share-blocking</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>(requirements that investors who exercise their voting rights surrender the right to dispose of their holdings for some </span><span>specified period in proximity to the shareholder meeting); v) potential difficulties in translating the proxy; vi) regulatory </span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-12</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>constraints; and vii) requirements to provide local agents with unrestricted powers of attorney to facilitate voting </span><span>instructions. We are not supportive of impediments to the exercise of voting rights such as share-blocking or overly </span><span>burdensome administrative requirements.</span></div> <div> <div><span>As a consequence, BlackRock votes proxies in these situations on a </span><span>“</span><span>best-efforts</span><span>”</span><span> basis. In addition, BIS may determine that it </span><span>is generally in the interests of BlackRock’s clients not to vote proxies (or not to vote our full allocation) if the costs (including </span><span>but not limited to opportunity costs associated with share-blocking constraints) associated with exercising a vote are </span><span>expected to outweigh the benefit the client would derive by voting on the proposal.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Active portfolio managers have full discretion to vote the shares in the Funds they manage based on their analysis of the </span><span>economic impact of a particular ballot item on their investors. Portfolio managers may, from time to time, reach differing </span><span>views on how to maximize economic value with respect to a particular investment. Therefore, portfolio managers may, and </span><span>sometimes do, vote shares in the Funds under their management differently from BIS or from one another. However, because </span><span>BlackRock’s clients are mostly long-term investors with long-term economic goals, ballots are generally cast in a uniform </span><span>manner.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Voting Choice</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock offers a </span><span>Voting Choice</span><span> program, which provides eligible clients with more opportunities to participate in the proxy </span><span>voting process where legally and operationally viable. BlackRock Voting Choice aims to make proxy voting easier and more </span><span>accessible for eligible clients.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Voting Choice is currently available for eligible clients invested in certain institutional pooled funds in the U.S., UK, Ireland, and </span><span>Canada that utilize equity index investment strategies, as well as eligible clients in certain institutional pooled funds in the </span><span>U.S., UK, and Canada that use systematic active equity (SAE) strategies. Currently, this includes over 650 pooled investment </span><span>funds, including equity index funds and SAE investment funds. In addition, institutional clients in separately managed </span><span>accounts (SMAs) continue to be eligible for BlackRock Voting Choice regardless of their investment strategies. </span><span>9</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>As a result, the shares attributed to BlackRock in company share registers may be voted differently depending on whether our </span><span>clients have authorized BIS to vote on their behalf, have authorized BIS to vote in accordance with a third-party policy, or have </span><span>elected to vote shares in accordance with their own policy. Agreements with our clients to allow them greater control over </span><span>their voting, including which policies they have selected, will be treated confidentially consistent with our treatment of similar </span><span>client agreements.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Conflicts management policies and procedures</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>BIS maintains policies and procedures that seek to prevent undue influence on BlackRock’s proxy voting activity. Such </span><span>influence might stem from any relationship between the investee company (or any shareholder proponent or dissident </span><span>shareholder) and BlackRock, BlackRock’s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund’s affiliates, or BlackRock employees.

Securities lending is a well-regulated </span><span>practice that contributes to capital market efficiency. It also enables funds to generate additional returns while allowing fund </span><span>providers to keep fund expenses lower.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>With regard to the relationship between securities lending and proxy voting, BlackRock cannot vote shares on loan and may </span><span>determine to recall them for voting, as guided by our fiduciary responsibility to act in our clients’ financial interests. While this </span><span>has occurred in a limited number of cases, the decision to recall securities on loan as part of BlackRock’s securities lending </span><span>program in order to vote is based on an evaluation of various factors that include, but are not limited to, assessing potential </span><span>securities lending revenue alongside the potential long-term financial value to clients of voting those securities (based on the </span><span>information available at the time of recall consideration). </span><span>10</span><span> BIS works with colleagues in the Securities Lending and Risk and </span><span>Quantitative Analysis teams to evaluate the costs and benefits to clients of recalling shares on loan.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In almost all instances, BlackRock anticipates that the potential long-term financial value to the Fund of voting shares would </span><span>be less than the potential revenue the loan may provide the Fund. However, in certain instances, BlackRock may determine, in </span><span>our independent business judgment as a fiduciary, that the value of voting outweighs the securities lending revenue loss to </span><span>clients and would therefore recall shares to be voted in those instances.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Periodically, BlackRock reviews our process for determining whether to recall securities on loan in order to vote and may </span><span>modify it as necessary.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>10</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Recalling securities on loan can be impacted by the timing of record dates. In the U.S., for example, the record date of a shareholder meeting typically </span><span>falls before the proxy statements are released. Accordingly, it is not practicable to evaluate a proxy statement, determine that a vote has a material </span><span>impact on a fund and recall any shares on loan in advance of the record date for the annual meeting. As a result, managers must weigh independent </span><span>business judgement as a fiduciary, the benefit to a fund’s shareholders of recalling loaned shares in advance of an estimated record date without </span><span>knowing whether there will be a vote on matters which have a material impact on the fund (thereby forgoing potential securities lending revenue for </span><span>the fund’s shareholders) or leaving shares on loan to potentially earn revenue for the fund (thereby forgoing the opportunity to vote).</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The </span><span>Guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. BIS applies the Guidelines on a case-by-case basis, in the context of the </span><span>individual circumstances of each company and the specific issue under review. As such, the Guidelines do not indicate how </span><span>BIS will vote in every instance. Rather, they reflect our view about corporate governance issues generally, and provide insight </span><span>into how we typically approach issues that commonly arise on corporate ballots. As previously discussed, the Guidelines </span><span>should be read in conjunction with the Principles and engagement priorities. Collectively, these </span><span>“</span><span>BIS policies</span><span>”</span><span> set out the core </span><span>elements of corporate governance that guide our investment stewardship efforts globally and within each market, including </span><span>when engaging with companies and voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS policies are applied on a case-by-case basis, </span><span>taking into consideration the context within which a company is operating.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>Reporting and vote transparency</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>We are committed to transparency in the stewardship work we do on behalf of clients. We inform clients about our </span><span>engagement and voting policies and activities through direct communication and through disclosure on our website. Each </span><span>year we publish an annual report that provides a global overview of our investment stewardship engagement and voting </span><span>activities and a voting spotlight that summarizes our voting over a proxy year.</span><span>11</span><span> Additionally, we make public our regional </span><span>proxy voting guidelines for the benefit of clients and the companies in which we invest on their behalf. We also publish </span><span>commentaries to share our perspective on market developments and emerging key themes.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>At a more granular level, on a quarterly basis, we publish our vote record for each company that held a shareholder meeting </span><span>during the period, showing how BIS voted on each proposal and providing our rationale for any votes against management </span><span>proposals or on shareholder proposals. For shareholder meetings where a vote might be high profile or of significant interest </span><span>to clients, we may publish a vote bulletin after the meeting, disclosing and explaining our vote on key proposals. We also </span><span>publish a quarterly list of all companies with which we engaged and the key topics addressed in the engagement meeting.</span></div> </div> <div> <div><span>In this way, we help inform our clients about the work we do on their behalf in promoting the governance and business </span><span>practices that support durable, long-term financial value creation.</span></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>11</span></div> <div><span>The proxy year runs from July 1 to June 30.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-15</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
