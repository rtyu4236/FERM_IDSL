The following is added to the section entitled “Construction and Maintenance of the Underlying Indexes”: </div> <div>The MSCI Indexes </div> <div>The MSCI indexes were founded in 1969 by Capital International S.A. as international performance benchmarks constructed to facilitate comparison of world markets. The MSCI single country standard equity indexes have covered the world’s developed markets since 1969 and in 1987 MSCI Inc. commenced coverage of emerging markets. </div> <div>Local stock exchanges traditionally calculated their own indexes, which were generally not comparable with one another due to differences in the representation </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> of the local market, mathematical formulas, base dates and methods of adjusting for capital changes. MSCI, however, applies the same calculation methodology to all markets for all single country standard equity indexes, both developed and emerging. </div> <div>MSCI Global Investable Market Indexes </div> <div>MSCI’s Global Investable Market Indexes (the “MSCI GIMI”) provide coverage and non‑overlapping market segmentation by market capitalization size and by style. The MSCI GIMI intend to target approximately 99% coverage of the free float-adjusted market capitalization in each market of large-, mid‑ and small‑cap securities. </div> <div><span>Defining the Equity Universe</span>. MSCI begins with securities listed in countries in the MSCI GIMI. All listed equity securities and listed securities that exhibit characteristics of equity securities, except mutual funds, ETFs, equity derivatives, limited partnerships and most investment trusts, are eligible for inclusion in the equity universe. REITs in some countries and certain income trusts in Canada are also eligible for inclusion. Each company and its securities (<span>i.e</span>., share classes) are classified in only one country. </div> <div><span>Determining Market Capitalization Size Segments for Each Market.</span> In order to create size components that can be meaningfully aggregated into composites, individual market size segments balance the following two objectives: </div> <div> </div>

In practice, limitations on free float available to international investors include: (i) strategic and other shareholdings not considered part of available free float; and (ii) limits on share ownership for foreigners. </div> <div>MSCI calculates the free float-adjusted market capitalization of each security in the equity index universe by (i) defining and estimating the free float available to foreign investors; (ii) assigning a free float-adjustment factor to each security; and (iii) calculating the free float-adjusted market capitalization of each security. </div> <div>Under MSCI’s free float-adjustment methodology, a constituent’s inclusion factor is equal to its estimated free float, rounded up to the closest 5% for constituents with </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> free float equal to or exceeding 15%. For example, a constituent security with a free float of 23.2% will be included in the index at 25% of its market capitalization. For securities with a free float of less than 15%, the estimated free float is adjusted to the nearest 1%. </div> <div>Price and Exchange Rates </div> <div><span>Prices.</span> The prices used to calculate all MSCI indexes are the official exchange closing prices or those figures accepted as such. MSCI reserves the right to use an alternative pricing source on any given day. </div> <div><span>Exchange Rates. </span>MSCI uses the World Markets/Reuters Closing Spot Rates taken at 4:00 p.m. London time. In case World Markets/Reuters does not provide rates for specific markets on given days (for example, Christmas Day and New Year’s Day), the previous business day’s rates are normally used. MSCI independently monitors the exchange rates on all its indexes. MSCI may under exceptional circumstances elect to use alternative sources of exchange rates if the World Markets/Reuters rates are not available, or if MSCI determines that the World Markets/Reuters rates are not reflective of market circumstances for a given currency on a particular day. In such circumstances, an announcement would be sent to clients with the related information. If appropriate, MSCI may conduct a consultation with the investment community to gather feedback on the most relevant exchange rate. </div> <div><span>Changes to the Indexes. </span>The MSCI GIMI are maintained with the objective of reflecting, on a timely basis, the evolution of the underlying equity markets. In maintaining the MSCI indexes, emphasis is also placed on continuity, replicability and minimizing turnover in the indexes. Maintaining the MSCI indexes involves many aspects, including: (i) additions to, and deletions from, the indexes; (ii) changes in number of shares; and (iii) changes in inclusion factors as a result of updated free float estimates. </div> <div>Index maintenance can be described by three broad categories of changes: </div> <div> </div>

During the QIRs, MSCI reflects changes in the index that were not captured at the time of their actual occurrence, but are significant enough to be included before the next SAIR. The results of the SAIR and QIR are generally announced at least ten business days in advance of implementation. </div> <div>Creation of Sector and Industry Indexes using the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS<sup>®</sup>) </div> <div>All securities in the Global Investable Equity Universe are assigned to the industry that best describes their business activities using the GICS. The GICS classification consists of sectors, industry groups, industries and sub‑industries. Each company is assigned to one unique sub‑industry according to its principal business activity (generally defined as the business activity that generates 60% or more of the company’s revenues). Narrower indexes may be derived based on industry classification and may contain securities belonging to specific sectors, industry groups, industries, sub‑industries or a combination thereof. </div> <div>MSCI USA Quality GARP Select Index </div> <div><span>Number of Components: approximately 170 </span></div> <div><span>Index Description: </span>The MSCI USA Quality GARP Select Index is a subset of the MSCI USA Index (the “Parent Index”), which is designed to measure the performance of the large- and mid‑capitalization segments of the U.S. equity market, as defined by the Index Provider. The Underlying Index’s “growth at a reasonable price” or “GARP” strategy seeks to measure the performance of securities in the Parent Index that exhibit stronger growth characteristics, with weighting based on relatively favorable value and quality characteristics. </div> <div><span>Index Methodology.</span> The Index Provider begins by calculating a “growth score” for each security in the Parent Index using five metrics: long-term forward earnings per share (“EPS”) growth rate; short-term forward EPS growth rate; current internal growth rate (based on return on equity and dividend payout metrics); long-term historical EPS growth trend; and long-term historical sales per share growth trend. The values of the metrics are standardized to reduce the effect of outliers on the calculation of the growth scores. The Index Provider then selects securities with higher growth scores until approximately 50% of the aggregate market capitalization of the Parent Index is reached, subject to certain constraints. </div> <div>The process for weighting the selected securities in the Underlying Index involves calculating a “tilt score” for each security. Two components of the tilt score are value and quality scores, which are calculated for each security relative to its peers within the corresponding GICS sector. The value score is based on three metrics: price‑to‑book value, forward price‑to‑earnings ratio, and the ratio of enterprise value to cash flow from operations. The quality score is based on three metrics: return on equity, debt‑to‑equity ratio, and earnings variability. The values of the metrics are standardized to reduce the effect of outliers on the calculation of the value and quality scores. </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div>A security’s tilt score is based on the following: </div> <div> </div>
<table>
<tr>
<td> </td>
<td><span>∎</span></td>

<tr>

<td> </td>
<td> <div>the particular quartile in which the security’s quality score falls. </div> </td> </tr> </table> <div>Tilt scores are generally lower for securities with larger market capitalizations and higher for securities with more favorable value and quality scores. To determine a security’s weight in the Underlying Index, its tilt score is multiplied by the security’s market capitalization weight in the Parent Index. The maximum weight of any individual issuer is 5%. The sector weights after the tilt score is applied will not deviate more than +/- 5% from the sector weights of the Underlying Index before the tilt score is applied (i.e., with sector weights based on the free float-adjusted market capitalization of the selected securities) at the time of rebalancing. The Index Provider also applies constraints to reduce turnover. The Underlying Index is rebalanced on a quarterly basis. </div> <div><span></span><span><span><span>Changes in the Fund’s “Investment Advisory, Administrative and Distribution Services” </span></span></span></div> <div>In the management fee table on pages 109‑110 of the SAI, the following footnote is added to the Fund: </div> <div>Effective April 1, 2024, the management fee for the iShares MSCI USA Quality GARP ETF is 0.15%.
