<p><font size="2">The Fund is expected to implement these changes no sooner than September 7, 2020, but no later than
December 31, 2020. </font></p> <p><font size="2">When the above changes are effective, the below changes to the Summary Prospectus, Prospectus and the SAI for the Fund will go
into effect. </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b><i>Changes to the Prospectus and Summary Prospectus </i></b></font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>The first paragraph on page <font>S-2</font> of the section of the Summary Prospectus and Prospectus entitled “Principal Investment Strategies” is deleted in its entirety and
replaced with the following: </b></font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>Principal Investment Strategies </b></font></p> <p><font size="2">The Fund seeks to track the investments results of the Bloomberg Barclays MSCI US High Yield Choice ESG Screened Index (the “Underlying Index”), developed by Bloomberg Barclays Capital, Inc. (the
“Index Provider” or “Bloomberg Barclays”) with environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) rating inputs from MSCI ESG Research LLC (“MSCI ESG Research”) pursuant to an agreement between MSCI ESG Research and
Bloomberg Index Services Limited (a subsidiary of Bloomberg Barclays) or an affiliate. The Underlying Index is a modified market value weighted index with a cap on each issuer of 2%. The Underlying Index is designed to reflect the performance of
U.S. dollar-denominated high yield corporate bonds of issuers with favorable ESG ratings, as identified by the Index Provider, while applying additional screens. To construct the Underlying Index, Bloomberg Barclays begins with the Bloomberg
Barclays US Corporate High Yield Index (the “Parent Index”). The Parent Index includes U.S. dollar-denominated, high yield, fixed-rate corporate bonds that: (i) are issued by companies with countries of risk classified as developed
markets by the Index Provider based primarily on quantitative economic criteria established by the Index Provider, and (ii) have a middle rating of below-investment grade (as determined by the Index Provider). From the Parent Index, Bloomberg
Barclays selects bonds that have $400 million or more of outstanding face value at the time of inclusion. </font></p> <p><font size="2">In determining
whether a bond has a middle rating of below investment grade, ratings from Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. (“Moody’s”), Standard &amp; Poor’s<font size="1"><sup>®</sup></font> Global Ratings, a subsidiary of S&amp;P Global (“S&amp;P Global Ratings”) and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (“Fitch”) are considered. Securities in the
Underlying Index must be rated high yield (Ba1 by Moody’s, BB+, by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch) using the middle rating from Moody’s, S&amp;P Global Ratings, and Fitch. When a rating from only

<p><font size="2">
two agencies is available, the lower of the two agencies’ ratings is used. When a rating from only one agency is available, that rating is used to determine eligibility in the Underlying
Index. Securities that are rated below investment grade are commonly referred to as “junk bonds.” MSCI excludes companies with an ESG controversy score of less than three (3) or an ESG rating below BB. MSCI ESG Research also excludes
securities of companies involved in adult entertainment, alcohol, gambling, tobacco, genetically modified organisms, controversial weapons, nuclear weapons, civilian firearms, conventional weapons, palm oil,
<font>for-profit</font> prisons, predatory lending, and nuclear power based on revenue or percentage of revenue thresholds for certain categories (<i>e.g</i>. $500 million or 50%) and categorical exclusions for others
(e.g. nuclear weapons). MSCI ESG Research screens companies with involvement to fossil fuels by excluding the securities of any company in the Bloomberg Class 3 energy sector and all companies with an industry tie to fossil fuels such as
thermal coal, oil and gas—in particular, reserve ownership, related revenues and power generation. </font></p> <p><font size="2">The Underlying Index is rebalanced on a monthly
basis, on the last business day of each month. As of June 1, 2020, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the consumer cyclical, communications and consumer
<font>non-cyclical</font> industries or sectors. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time. </font></p>

<p><font size="2"><b>Index Methodology</b>. The Underlying Index is a modified market value weighted index with a cap on each issuer of 2%. From the Parent Index, the Underlying
Index (i) selects bonds that have $400 million or more of outstanding face value at the time of inclusion, and (ii) excludes securities of companies with an ESG controversy score less than three (3) or an ESG rating below BB and

on each issuer by redistributing the excess market value over the cap on a <i>pro rata</i> basis to other bonds in the Underlying Index that are under the 2% cap. For example, an issuer that represents 4% of the Underlying Index will have 2% of the
Underlying Index’s market value redistributed to each bond from all companies under the 2% cap on a <i>pro rata </i>basis. The process is repeated until no issuer exceeds the 2% limit. Securities in the Underlying

Index must be rated high yield (Ba1 by Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. (“Moody’s”), BB+, by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (“Fitch”)) using the
middle rating from Moody’s, S&amp;P Global Ratings, and Fitch. When a rating from only two agencies is available, the lower of the two agencies’ ratings is used. When a rating from only one agency is available, that rating is used to
determine eligibility in the Underlying Index. In cases where explicit bond level ratings may not be available, the following sources may be used to classify securities by credit quality: (i) expected ratings at issuance may be used to ensure
timely index inclusion or to classify split-rated companies properly and (ii) unrated securities may use an issuer rating for index classification purposes if available. </font></p> <p><font size="2">The Underlying Index consists of U.S. dollar-denominated, high-yield corporate bonds having and issued by companies that have positive ESG characteristics (as determined by MSCI ESG Research ratings). In addition,
the securities included in the Underlying Index must be fixed-rate, taxable corporate securities. Excluded from the Underlying Index include, but are not limited to, structured notes, private placements and floating rate securities. The Underlying
Index is market value weighted and the securities in the Underlying Index are updated on the last business day of each month. </font></p> <p><font size="2">MSCI ESG Research
determines ESG ratings by evaluating a company’s risks and opportunities in relation to 37 ESG Key Issues (<i>e.g</i>., carbon emissions). Each company is scored on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 being the highest, for each Key Issue before being
provided an ESG rating based on average Key Issue score. Additionally, MSCI ESG Research excludes companies involved in very serious business controversies. MSCI ESG Research defines a controversy as an instance or ongoing situation in which company
operations and/or products allegedly have a negative environmental, social and/or governance impact. Each controversy case is assessed for the severity of its impact on society. MSCI ESG Research excludes companies involved in very severe business
controversies by assessing the possible negative environmental, social, and/or governance impact of a company’s operations or products on a scale from zero to ten, with zero being the most severe controversy rating (the “MSCI Controversies
Score”). Only securities of companies with a MSCI Controversies Score of three or higher are eligible for inclusion in the Underlying Index. </font></p> <p><font size="1"> </font></p>
