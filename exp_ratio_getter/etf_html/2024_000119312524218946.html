<p>September 12, 2024 </p> <p>Dear Shareholder: </p>
<p>The Board of Trustees (the “Board”) of iShares Trust, a Delaware statutory trust (the “Trust”), is pleased to announce, as provided in an
Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the “Reorganization Agreement”), the iShares LifePath Target Date 2025 ETF (the “Target Fund”), a series of the Trust, will be reorganized into iShares LifePath Retirement ETF (the
“Acquiring Fund”), a series of the Trust (the “Reorganization”). <b>The Reorganization does not require your approval, and you are not being asked to vote.</b> We do, however, ask that you review the enclosed Combined
Prospectus/Information Statement, which contains information about the Acquiring Fund, outlines certain aspects of the Target Fund and the Acquiring Fund and provides details about the terms and conditions of the Reorganization. You should review
the Combined Prospectus/Information Statement carefully and retain it for future reference. </p> <p>If the Reorganization is completed, the Target Fund shares
you own will be exchanged for shares of the Acquiring Fund (plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any) with the same aggregate net asset value as your Target Fund shares. It is currently anticipated that the Reorganization of the Target Fund
will be effected on a <font>tax-free</font> basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except for any taxes that may be imposed as a result of the receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares. </p>
<p>As described in the Combined Prospectus/Information Statement, BlackRock Fund Advisors, the Target Fund and Acquiring Fund’s investment adviser, has
proposed the Reorganization because during the year prior to the Target Fund’s maturity date, its allocation of assets is expected to be similar to that of the Acquiring Fund. As disclosed in the Target Fund’s prospectus, as the Target
Fund’s target date approaches, the Target Fund and the Acquiring Fund are expected to, subject to approval by the Board, merge into a single fund. The Combined Fund may give rise to operating efficiencies from a larger net asset size managed in
a single vehicle. </p> <p>The Board of Trustees of the Trust believes the Reorganization is in the best interest of the Target Fund and has approved the
Reorganization. </p> <p>As always, we appreciate your support. </p> <p> </p><div>

Retirement ETF (the “Acquiring Fund”), a series of the Trust (the “Reorganization”). BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) serves as investment adviser for each of the Target Fund and the Acquiring Fund. When the
Reorganization is completed, you will become a shareholder of the Acquiring Fund, and the Target Fund will be terminated. The Acquiring Fund, following completion of the Reorganization, may be referred to as the “Combined Fund” in this

<table>
<tr>
<td><font>A-2:</font></td>
<td> <p>The Target Fund and the Acquiring Fund are part of a group of funds referred to as the “LifePath
ETFs,” each of which seeks to provide for retirement outcomes based on quantitatively measured risk that investors on average may be willing to accept given a particular time horizon, pursuant to which the Target Fund will have a similar
investment objective and substantially similar investment policies, strategies, restrictions and risks as the Acquiring Fund as the target date of the Target Fund approaches in 2025. As disclosed in the Target Fund’s prospectus, as the Target
Fund’s target date approaches, the Target Fund and the Acquiring Fund are expected to, subject to approval by the Board, merge into a single fund. </p></td></tr></table>
<p>BFA has proposed the Reorganization because during the year prior to the Target Fund’s maturity date, its allocation of assets is expected

approved the Reorganization. After careful consideration, the Board, including a majority of the Trustees who are not “interested persons” of the Trust (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended) determined that the
Reorganization is in the best interest of the Target Fund and that the Target Fund’s existing shareholders will not be diluted as a result of the Reorganization and approved the Reorganization. </p></td></tr></table>

<p>The Reorganization Agreement provides for: </p>
<p>Step 1: The transfer and delivery of substantially all of the assets of the Target Fund to the Acquiring Fund in exchange for the assumption by
the Acquiring Fund of certain stated liabilities of the Target Fund and newly-issued shares of the Acquiring Fund (the “Acquiring Fund Shares”) and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any. </p>

Prospectus/Information Statement. </p> <p><b><a name="tx873542_2"></a>1.1  Background and Reasons for the Reorganization </b></p>
<p>BFA has proposed the Reorganization because the Funds are part of a group of funds referred to as the “LifePath ETFs,” each of which
seeks to provide for retirement outcomes based on quantitatively measured risk that investors on average may be willing to accept given a particular time horizon, pursuant to which the Target Fund will have a similar investment objective and
substantially similar investment policies, strategies, restrictions and risks as the Acquiring Fund as the target date of the Target Fund approaches in 2025. As disclosed in the Target Fund’s prospectus, as the Target Fund’s target date
approaches, the Target Fund and the </p>

Acquiring Fund are expected to, subject to approval by the Board, merge into a single fund. The Combined Fund may give rise to operating efficiencies from a larger net asset size managed in a
single vehicle. BFA will continue as the investment adviser of the Combined Fund after the Reorganization and no change in portfolio managers will result from the Reorganization. In addition, no increase in advisory or other fee rates will result
from the Reorganization. The Target Fund and the Acquiring Fund have the same expense structure and the same types of fees. The fees of the Acquiring Fund and the Target Fund may differ only to the extent the acquired fund fees and expense incurred
by each Fund differ. Assuming the Reorganization had occurred on July 31, 2024, the Combined Fund would have (A) total annual fund operating expenses that are estimated to be the same as the Target Fund prior to the Reorganization and
(B) net annual fund operating expenses that are estimated to be the same as the Target Fund prior to the Reorganization. </p> <p>The
portfolio managers of the Acquiring Fund have reviewed the portfolio holdings of the Target Fund and, as of July 31, 2024, all the securities held by the Target Fund comply with the compliance guidelines and/or investment restrictions of the
Acquiring Fund. The Acquiring Fund may sell securities of the Target Fund acquired in the Reorganization in preparation for, or as a result of, the Reorganization, to the extent Target Fund shareholders receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of
the Acquiring Fund. Minimal transaction costs are anticipated to be incurred with the Reorganization. </p> <p>At a meeting held on June <font>4-5,</font> 2024 (the “Approval Meeting”), the Board, including all of the Independent Board Members, approved the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the “Reorganization Agreement”). The Board
determined that, based on an assumption that all of the facts and circumstances existing at the time of closing of the Reorganization are not materially different from those presented to the Board at the Approval Meeting, the Reorganization is in
the best interest of each Fund and that the interests of each Fund’s shareholders will not be diluted as a result of the Reorganization. The Board’s determinations were based on a comprehensive evaluation of the information provided to it.
During the review, the Board did not identify any particular information or consideration that was <font>all-important</font> or controlling. </p>
<p>(a)  Results of Process </p>
<p>In reaching its determinations with respect to the Reorganization, the Board considered a number of factors presented at the time of the
Approval Meeting, including, but not limited to, the following: </p> <p> </p>

<p>The Reorganization is expected to qualify as a <font>tax-free</font> “reorganization” under
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). In general, if the Reorganization so qualifies, the Target Fund and the Acquiring Fund will not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes
from the transactions contemplated by the Reorganization (except for any gain or loss that may be required to be recognized solely as a result of the close of the Target Fund’s taxable year due to the Reorganization or as a result of the
transfer of certain assets). As a condition to the closing of the Reorganization, the Trust, on behalf of the Target Fund and the Acquiring Fund, will receive an opinion from Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher LLP to the effect that the
Reorganization will qualify as a <font>tax-free</font> reorganization under Section 368 of the Code. An opinion of counsel is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or any court and thus
does not preclude the IRS from asserting, or a court from rendering, a contrary position. </p> <p>If any of the portfolio assets of the Target
Fund are sold, or deemed sold as a result of the termination of the Target Fund’s taxable year due to the Reorganization or as a result of the transfer of an interest in a passive foreign investment company, the tax impact of such sales, deemed
sales or transfers will depend on the difference between the price at which such portfolio assets are sold, deemed sold or transferred, and the Target Fund’s basis in such assets. Any gains will be distributed to the Target Fund’s
shareholders as either capital gain dividends (to the extent of long-term capital gains) or ordinary dividends (to the extent of ordinary income or short-term capital gains) during or with respect to the year of sale, deemed sale or transfer, and
such distributions will be taxable to shareholders in <font>non-tax</font> qualified accounts. In addition, prior to the Reorganization, the Target Fund will distribute to its shareholders all investment company taxable
income, net <font>tax-exempt</font> income and net </p>

time before the Reorganization takes place, a shareholder may sell shares of the Target Fund. Generally, these are taxable transactions. For more information about the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Reorganization, see “Information

<p>This section provides a comparison of the Target Fund and the Acquiring Fund. It describes the differences, if any, in the principal
investment risks of investing in the Target Fund and the Acquiring Fund, followed by a description of the differences, if any, in the fundamental investment restrictions of the Target Fund and the Acquiring Fund. In addition, this section
provides performance information and information regarding management of the Target Fund and the Acquiring Fund and each of their investment advisory and administration agreements, as well as information about each Fund’s other service
providers. This section also provides information about dividends and distributions, procedures for the purchase, sale and valuation of shares and market timing policies to the extent there are differences. </p>
<p><b><a name="tx873542_9"></a>2.1  Principal Investment Strategies </b></p>
<p><i>Description of the Target Fund’s Principal Strategies </i></p>
<p>The Target Fund is actively managed and allocates and reallocates its assets among a combination of Underlying Funds in proportions based on
its own investment strategy. </p> <p>The Target Fund is one of a group of funds referred to as the “LifePath ETFs,” each of which seeks
to provide for retirement outcomes based on quantitatively measured risk that investors on average may be willing to accept given a particular time horizon. </p>
<p>BFA employs a multi-dimensional approach to assess risk for the Target Fund and to determine its allocation across asset classes. As part of
this multi-dimensional approach, BFA aims to quantify risk using proprietary risk measurement tools that, among other things, analyze historical and forward-looking securities market data, including risk, asset class correlations, and expected
returns. Under normal circumstances, the Target Fund intends to invest primarily in affiliated exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”). </p>
<p>The Target Fund will invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its assets in securities or other financial instruments that are
components of or have economic characteristics similar to the securities included in its custom model benchmark, the 2025 Target Date Custom Benchmark. BFA will not publish its custom benchmark but will apply a proprietary model to monitor
performance of the Target Fund. The Target Fund is designed for investors expecting to retire or to begin withdrawing assets around the year 2025. At inception, BFA expected the Target Fund to hold approximately 43.50% of its assets in Underlying
Funds that seek to track particular underlying indexes of equity securities, approximately 56.50% of its assets in Underlying Funds that seek to track particular fixed-income indexes and the remainder of its assets in Underlying Funds that invest
primarily in money market instruments. </p> <p>At inception, the Target Fund invested in the iShares <font>0-5</font>
Year TIPS Bond ETF, iShares <font>1-5</font> Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares <font>5-10</font> Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares 10+ Year Investment Grade
Corporate Bond ETF, iShares <font>10-20</font> Year Treasury Bond ETF, iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, iShares Core MSCI International Developed Markets ETF, iShares Core U.S. REIT ETF, iShares Global
Infrastructure ETF, iShares MBS ETF, iShares Russell 1000 ETF, iShares Russell 2000 ETF, iShares U.S. Treasury Bond ETF and money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates. Factors such as fund classifications, historical risk and performance,
and the relationship to other Underlying Funds in the Target Fund are considered when selecting Underlying Funds. The specific Underlying Funds selected for the Target Fund are determined at BFA’s discretion and may change as deemed appropriate
to allow the Target Fund to meet its investment objective. </p> <p>Under normal circumstances, the Target Fund’s asset allocation will
change over time according to a predetermined “glide path” as the Target Fund approaches its target date. The glide path below represents the shifting of asset classes over time. As the glide path shows, as time elapses prior to
retirement, the Target Fund’s </p>

<p>
asset allocations become more conservative. This reflects the need for reduced investment risk as retirement approaches and the need for lower volatility of the Target Fund, which for certain
investors may be a primary source of income after retirement. During the year prior to the Target Fund’s maturity date, its allocation of assets is expected to be similar to that of the Acquiring Fund. Further, as retirement approaches, the
Target Fund and the Acquiring Fund are expected to, subject to approval by the Board, merge into a single fund. </p> <p>The following chart

</table> <p>The asset allocation targets are established by the Target Fund’s portfolio managers. The investment
team, including the portfolio managers, meets regularly to assess market conditions, review the asset allocation targets of the Target Fund, and determine whether any changes are required to enable the Fund to achieve its investment objective. </p>
<p>Although the asset allocation targets listed for the glide path are general, long-term targets, BFA may periodically adjust the proportion of
equity and fixed-income Underlying Funds in the Target Fund, based on an assessment of the current market conditions, the potential contribution of each asset class to the expected risk and return characteristics of

the Target Fund, reallocations of the Target Fund’s composition to reflect intra-year movement along the glide path and other factors. In general, such adjustments will be limited; however,
BFA may determine that a greater degree of variation is warranted to protect the Target Fund or achieve its investment objective. </p>
<p>BFA’s second step in the structuring of the Target Fund is the selection of the Underlying Funds. Factors such as fund classifications,
historical risk and performance, and the relationship to other Underlying Funds in the Target Fund are considered when selecting Underlying Funds. The specific Underlying Funds selected for the Target Fund are determined at BFA’s discretion and
may change as deemed appropriate to allow the Target Fund to meet its investment objective. </p> <p>Within the prescribed percentage allocations
to equity and fixed-income index funds, BFA seeks to diversify the Target Fund. The allocation to Underlying Funds that track equity indexes may be further diversified by style (including both value and growth), market capitalization (including
emerging growth, large-, <font>mid-,</font> and small-capitalization), region (i.e., U.S, and international, including emerging markets) or other attributes. The allocation to Underlying Funds that track fixed-income
indexes may be further diversified by sector (including government, corporate, U.S. agency MBS or debentures, CMBS, and other sectors), duration (a measurement of interest rate risk), credit quality (including investment grade bonds and high yield
bonds), geographic location (including U.S. and <font>non-U.S.</font> securities, including bonds of emerging market issuers), currency (U.S. dollar-denominated or local currency bonds) or other attributes. Though BFA
seeks to diversify the Target Fund, certain Underlying Funds may concentrate their investments in specific sectors or geographic regions or countries. The percentage allocation to the various styles of equity and fixed-income Underlying Funds is
determined at the discretion of the investment team and can be changed to reflect the current market environment. </p> <p>Certain Underlying
Funds may invest in real estate investment trusts (“REITs”), foreign securities, emerging market securities, high yield bonds and derivative securities or instruments, such as options and futures, the value of which is derived from another
security, a currency or commodity, an interest rate or an index, when seeking to match the performance of a particular market index. The Target Fund and certain Underlying Funds may also lend securities with a value up to <font>one-third</font> of their respective total assets to financial institutions that provide cash or securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government as collateral. </p>
<p><i>Description of the Combined Fund’s Principal Investment Strategies </i></p>
<p>The Combined Fund’s principal investment strategies are expected to be the same as the Acquiring Fund’s investment strategies. </p>
<p>The Acquiring Fund is actively managed and allocates and reallocate its assets among a combination of Underlying Funds in proportions based on
its own investment strategy. </p> <p>The Acquiring Fund is one of a group of funds referred to as the “LifePath ETFs,” each of which
seeks to provide for retirement outcomes based on quantitatively measured risk that investors on average may be willing to accept given a particular time horizon. </p>
<p>BFA employs a multi-dimensional approach to assess risk for the Acquiring Fund and to determine the Acquiring Fund’s allocation across
asset classes. As part of this multi-dimensional approach, BFA aims to quantify risk using proprietary risk measurement tools that, among other things, analyze historical and forward-looking securities market data, including risk, asset class
correlations, and expected returns. Under normal circumstances, the Acquiring Fund intends to invest primarily in affiliated ETFs. </p> <p>The
Acquiring Fund will invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its assets in securities or other financial instruments that are components of or have economic characteristics similar to the securities included in its custom model benchmark,
the Retirement Custom Benchmark. BFA will not publish the Retirement Custom </p>

<p>
Benchmark but will apply a proprietary model to monitor performance of the Fund. The Acquiring Fund is designed for investors expecting to retire or to begin withdrawing assets in the future. At
inception, BFA expected the Acquiring Fund to hold approximately 40% of its assets in Underlying Funds that seek to track particular equity indexes, approximately 60% of its assets in Underlying Funds that seek to track particular fixed-income
indexes and the remainder of its assets in Underlying Funds that invest primarily in money market instruments. </p> <p>At inception, the
Acquiring Fund invested in the iShares <font>0-5</font> Year TIPS Bond ETF, iShares <font>1-5</font> Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares <font>5-10</font>
Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares 10+ Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares <font>10-20</font> Year Treasury Bond ETF, iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, iShares Core MSCI International
Developed Markets ETF, iShares Core U.S. REIT ETF, iShares Global Infrastructure ETF, iShares MBS ETF, iShares Russell 1000 ETF, iShares Russell 2000 ETF, iShares U.S. Treasury Bond ETF and money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates.
Factors such as fund classifications, historical risk and performance, and the relationship to other Underlying Funds in the Fund are considered when selecting Underlying Funds. The specific Underlying Funds selected for the Acquiring Fund are
determined at BFA’s discretion and may change as deemed appropriate to allow the Acquiring Fund to meet its investment objective. </p>
<p>Certain Underlying Funds may invest in REITs, foreign securities, emerging market securities, high yield bonds and derivative securities or
instruments, such as options and futures, the value of which is derived from another security, a currency or commodity, an interest rate or an index, when seeking to match the performance of a particular market index. The Acquiring Fund and certain
Underlying Funds may also lend securities with a value up to <font>one-third</font> of their respective total assets to financial institutions that provide cash or securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government as
collateral. </p> <p>The Acquiring Fund’s selection of Underlying Funds that track equity indexes may be further diversified by style
(including both value and growth), market capitalization (including large cap, mid cap, small cap and emerging growth), region (including domestic and international (including emerging markets)) or other factors. The Acquiring Fund’s selection
of Underlying Funds that track fixed-income indexes may be further diversified by sector (including government, corporate, agency, and other sectors), duration (a calculation of the average life of a bond which measures its price risk), credit
quality (including <font>non-investment</font> grade debt or junk bonds), geographic location (including U.S. and foreign-issued securities), or other factors. Though BFA seeks to diversify the Acquiring Fund, certain
Underlying Funds may concentrate their investments in specific sectors or geographic regions or countries. The percentage allocation to the various styles of equity and fixed-income Underlying Funds is determined at the discretion of the investment
team and can be changed to reflect the current market environment. Because the Fund is in its most conservative phase, its allocation generally does not <font>de-risk</font> over time, although its allocation may change to
maintain the Fund’s risk profile. </p> <p><b><a name="tx873542_10"></a>2.2  Principal Investment Risks </b></p>
<p>Because of their similar investment objectives and investment strategies (as described above under “Summary — Investment Objectives
and Principal Investment Strategies”), the Target Fund and the Acquiring Fund are subject to identical principal investment risks associated with an investment in the relevant Fund. The principal investment risks of the Combined Fund will be
the same as those of the Target Fund and the Acquiring Fund. A description of the principal risks of the Combined Fund are set out below. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. </p>
<p><i>Descriptions of the Combined Fund’s Principal Investment Risks </i></p>
<p>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your investment in the Combined Fund, and the Combined Fund’s performance could
trail that of other investments. The Combined Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below (either directly or through its investments in the Underlying </p>
<p> </p> <p>- 10 - </p>
</div></center>
<p> </p>
<hr size="3"/>
<h5><a href="#toc">Table of Contents</a></h5>
<center><div>
<p>
Funds), any of which may adversely affect the Combined Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. Certain key risks are prioritized below
(with others following in alphabetical order), but the relative significance of any risk is difficult to predict and may change over time. You should review each risk factor carefully. </p>
<p><b><i>Equity Securities Risk</i></b>. Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of
other asset classes. Certain Underlying Funds invest in common stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders
of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer. </p> <p><b><i>Credit Risk</i></b>. Debt issuers and other
counterparties may be unable or unwilling to make timely interest and/or principal payments when due or otherwise honor their obligations. Changes in an issuer’s credit rating or the market’s perception of an issuer’s creditworthiness
may also adversely affect the value of the Fund’s or an Underlying Fund’s investment in that issuer. The degree of credit risk depends on an issuer’s or counterparty’s financial condition and on the terms of an obligation. </p>
<p><b><i>Interest Rate Risk</i></b>. During periods of very low or negative interest rates, the Fund may be unable to maintain positive returns
or pay dividends to Fund shareholders. Very low or negative interest rates may magnify interest rate risk. Changing interest rates, including rates that fall below zero, may have unpredictable effects on markets, result in heightened market
volatility and detract from the Fund’s performance to the extent the Fund is exposed to such interest rates. Additionally, under certain market conditions in which interest rates are low and the market prices for portfolio securities have
increased, the Fund may have a very low or even negative yield. A low or negative yield would cause the Fund to lose money in certain conditions and over certain time periods. An increase in interest rates will generally cause the value of
securities held by the Fund or an Underlying Fund to decline, may lead to heightened volatility in the fixed-income markets and may adversely affect the liquidity of certain fixed-income investments, including those held by the Fund or an Underlying
Fund. Because rates on certain floating rate debt securities typically reset only periodically, changes in prevailing interest rates (and particularly sudden and significant changes) can be expected to cause some fluctuations in the net asset value
of the Fund to the extent that it invests in floating rate debt securities. The historically low interest rate environment in recent years heightens the risks associated with rising interest rates. </p>
<p><b><i>U.S. Treasury Obligations Risk</i></b>. U.S. Treasury obligations may differ from other securities in their interest rates, maturities,
times of issuance and other characteristics and may provide relatively lower returns than those of other securities. Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial condition or credit rating of a government may cause the value of the Fund’s
or an Underlying Fund’s U.S. Treasury obligations to decline. </p> <p><b><i>Allocation Risk</i></b>. The Fund’s ability to achieve its
investment objective depends upon BFA’s ability to develop a model that accurately assesses the Fund’s asset class allocation and selects an appropriate mix of Underlying Funds and other ETFs. There is a risk that BFA’s evaluations
and assumptions regarding asset classes or Underlying Funds, which are utilized as inputs in the model, may be incorrect in view of actual market conditions. </p>
<p><b><i>Investment in Underlying Funds Risk</i></b>. The Fund invests substantially all of its assets in the Underlying Funds, so the
Fund’s investment performance is directly related to the performance of the Underlying Funds. The Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Funds and other securities in which the Fund invests based on their market
valuations. An investment in the Fund will entail more costs and expenses than a direct investment in the Underlying Funds. </p> <p>As the
Underlying Funds, or the Fund’s allocations among the Underlying Funds, change from time to time, or to the extent that the total annual fund operating expenses of any Underlying Fund change, the weighted average operating expenses borne by the
Fund may increase or decrease. </p> <p><b><i>Affiliated Fund Risk</i></b>. In managing the Fund, BFA has the ability to select Underlying Funds
and substitute Underlying Funds with other ETFs that it believes will achieve the Fund’s objective. BFA may be subject to </p>
<p> </p> <p>- 11 - </p>
</div></center>
<p> </p>
<hr size="3"/>
<h5><a href="#toc">Table of Contents</a></h5>
<center><div>
<p>
potential conflicts of interest in selecting Underlying Funds and substituting Underlying Funds with other ETFs because the fees paid to BFA by some Underlying Funds and other ETFs managed by BFA
may be higher than the fees paid by other Underlying Funds. If an Underlying Fund or other ETF holds interests in an affiliated fund in excess of a certain amount, the Fund may be prohibited from purchasing shares of that Underlying Fund or other
ETF. </p> <p><b><i>Retirement Income Risk</i></b>. The Retirement Fund does not provide a guarantee that sufficient capital appreciation will be
achieved to provide adequate income at and through retirement. The Retirement Fund also does not ensure that you will have assets in your account sufficient to cover your retirement expenses; this will depend on the amount of money you have invested
in the Retirement Fund, the length of time you have held your investment, the returns of the markets over time, the amount you spend in retirement, and your other assets and income sources. </p>
<p><b><i>Selection Risk</i></b>. Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by the Retirement Fund management will underperform the
markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies. This means you may lose money. </p>
<p><b><i>Market Risk</i></b>. The Fund and the Underlying Funds could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and
over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, public health issues, recessions, the prospect or occurrence of a sovereign default or other financial crisis, or other
events could have a significant impact on the Fund, the Underlying Funds and their investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s or Underlying Fund’s NAV. </p>
<p><b><i>Asset Class</i></b><b><i></i></b><b><i> Risk</i></b>. Securities and other assets in the Fund’s or an Underlying Fund’s
portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or other asset classes. </p>
<p><b><i>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk</i></b>. Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the Creations and Redemptions of each
Fund’s Prospectuses may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption transactions. The Fund has a limited number of
institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (i.e., on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with
respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. </p>
<p><b><i>Call Risk</i></b>. During periods of falling interest rates, an issuer of a callable bond held by the Fund or an Underlying Fund may
“call” or repay the security before its stated maturity, and the Fund or an Underlying Fund may have to reinvest the proceeds in securities with lower yields, which would result in a decline in the Fund’s income, or in securities with
greater risks or with other less favorable features. </p> <p><b><i>Concentration Risk</i></b>. The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk
of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund’s or an Underlying Fund’s investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other
assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector, market segment or asset class. </p>
<p><b><i>Currency Risk</i></b>. Because the Fund’s and the Underlying Funds’ NAVs are determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund’s NAV
could decline if a currency of a <font>non-U.S.</font> market in which a Fund or an Underlying Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are delays or limits on repatriation of such currency. Currency
exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may change quickly and without warning. </p>
<p><b><i>Cybersecurity Risk</i></b>. Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund or the Underlying Funds, the Funds’ or the
Underlying Funds’ adviser, distributor, the benchmark provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact
the Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the </p>
<p> </p> <p>- 12 - </p>
</div></center>
<p> </p>
<hr size="3"/>

<center><div>
<p>
Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in
such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems of the Fund’s benchmark provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund
invests. </p> <p><b><i>Derivatives Risk</i></b>. The Fund or an Underlying Fund may invest in certain types of derivatives contracts, including
futures, options and swaps, which can be more sensitive to changes in interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in market prices than conventional securities, which can result in greater losses to the Fund. </p>
<p><b><i>Energy Sector Risk</i></b>. The market value of securities in the energy sector may decline for many reasons, including, among others,
changes in energy prices, energy supply and demand, government regulations, costs related to exploration and production and energy conservation efforts. Companies in the energy sector may also be significantly impacted by natural disasters, social
and political unrest, war and environmental damage and may also be at risk for increased litigation and negative publicity or public perception. The energy sector may experience significant market volatility (e.g., as a result of Russia’s
invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the resulting sanctions on Russia and other responses by the U.S. and other actors). </p>
<p><b><i>Extension Risk</i></b>. During periods of rising interest rates, certain debt obligations may be paid off substantially more slowly than
originally anticipated and the value of those securities may fall sharply, resulting in a decline in the Fund’s income and potentially in the value of the Fund’s or an Underlying Fund’s investments. </p>
<p><b><i>Financials Sector Risk</i></b>. The performance of companies in the financials sector may be adversely impacted by many factors,
including, among others, changes in government regulations, economic conditions, and interest rates, credit rating downgrades, adverse public perception, exposure concentration and decreased liquidity in credit markets. The impact of changes in
regulation of any individual financial company, or of the financials sector as a whole, cannot be predicted. Cybersecurity incidents and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent and have caused significant losses to
companies in this sector, which may negatively impact an Underlying Fund. </p> <p><b><i>Geographic Risk</i></b>. A natural disaster could
occur in a geographic region in which the Fund or an Underlying Fund invests, which could adversely affect the economy or the business operations of companies in the specific geographic region, causing an adverse impact on the Fund’s or an
Underlying Fund’s investments in, or which are exposed to, the affected region. </p> <p><b><i>Healthcare Sector Risk</i></b>. The
profitability of companies in the healthcare sector may be affected by government regulations and government healthcare programs, increases or decreases in the cost of medical products and services, an increased emphasis on outpatient services,
demand for medical products and services and product liability claims, among other factors. Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent on patent protection, and the expiration of a company’s patent may adversely affect that company’s
profitability. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive forces that may result in price discounting, and may be thinly capitalized and susceptible to product obsolescence. </p>
<p><b><i>Income Risk</i></b>. The Fund’s income may decline if interest rates fall. This decline in income can occur because an Underlying
Fund may subsequently invest in lower-yielding securities as securities in an Underlying Fund’s portfolio mature, are near maturity or are called, securities are substituted, or an Underlying Fund otherwise needs to purchase additional bonds.
</p> <p><b><i>Indexing Investment Risk</i></b>. The Underlying Funds are not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take
defensive positions in the Underlying Funds under any market conditions, including declining markets. </p> <p><b><i>Industrials Sector
Risk</i></b>. Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by changes in the supply of and demand for products and services, product obsolescence, claims for environmental damage or product liability and changes in general economic
conditions, among other factors. </p>
<p> </p> <p>- 13 - </p>
</div></center>
<p> </p>
<hr size="3"/>
<h5><a href="#toc">Table of Contents</a></h5>
<center><div>
<p><b><i>Infectious Illness Risk</i></b>. A widespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such
as the <font>COVID-19</font> pandemic, may result in travel restrictions, disruption of healthcare services, prolonged quarantines, cancellations, supply chain disruptions, business closures, lower consumer demand,
layoffs, ratings downgrades, defaults and other significant economic, social and political impacts. Markets may experience temporary closures, extreme volatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity and increased trading costs. Such events may
adversely affect the Fund and its investments and may impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities or cause elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. Despite the development of vaccines, the
duration of the <font>COVID-19</font> pandemic and its effects cannot be predicted with certainty. </p>
<p><b><i>Information Technology Sector Risk</i></b>. Information technology companies face intense competition and potentially rapid product
obsolescence. They are also heavily dependent on intellectual property rights and may be adversely affected by the loss or impairment of those rights. Companies in the information technology sector are facing increased government and regulatory
scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or regulatory action. Companies in the software industry may be adversely affected by, among other things, the decline or fluctuation of subscription renewal rates for their products and services and
actual or perceived vulnerabilities in their products or services. </p> <p><b><i>Infrastructure Industry Risk</i></b>. Companies in the
infrastructure industry may be subject to a variety of factors that could adversely affect their business or operations, including high interest costs in connection with capital construction programs, high degrees of leverage, costs associated with
governmental, environmental and other regulations, the level of government spending on infrastructure projects, and other factors. </p>
<p><b><i>Issuer Risk</i></b>. The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund or an Underlying
Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may cause the value of the securities to decline. </p>
<p><b><i>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk</i></b>. Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to
adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more limited growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of
large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets. </p> <p><b><i>Management Risk</i></b>. The
Fund and the Underlying Funds are subject to management risk, which is the risk that the investment process, techniques and risk analyses applied by BFA will not produce the desired results, and that securities selected by BFA may underperform the
market or any relevant benchmark. In addition, legislative, regulatory, or tax developments may affect the investment techniques available to BFA in connection with managing the Fund and the Underlying Funds and may also adversely affect the ability
of the Fund and the Underlying Funds to achieve their investment objective. </p> <p><b><i>Market Trading Risk</i></b>. The Fund and the
Underlying Funds face numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for their shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. <b>ANY
OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND’S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</b> </p> <p><b><i><font>Mid-Capitalization</font> Companies Risk</i></b>. Compared to large-capitalization companies, <font>mid-capitalization</font> companies may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse
developments. In addition, the securities of <font>mid-capitalization</font> companies may be more volatile and less liquid than those of large-capitalization companies. </p>
<p><b><i>National Closed Market Trading Risk</i></b>. To the extent that the underlying securities or other instruments held by the Fund or the
Underlying Funds trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the Fund’s or an Underlying Fund’s shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price
of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (i.e., the Fund’s or an Underlying Fund’s quote from the closed foreign market). The impact of a closed </p>
<p> </p> <p>- 14 - </p>
</div></center>
<p> </p>
<hr size="3"/>

<center><div>
<p>
foreign market on the Fund or an Underlying Fund is likely to be greater where a large portion of the Fund’s or an Underlying Fund’s underlying securities or other instruments trade on
that closed foreign market or when the foreign market is closed for unscheduled reasons. These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the Fund’s or an Underlying Fund’s NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other
ETFs. </p> <p><b><i><font>Non-U.S.</font> Issuers Risk</i></b>. Securities issued by
<font>non-U.S.</font> issuers carry different risks from securities issued by U.S. issuers. These risks include differences in accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards, the possibility of expropriation or
confiscatory taxation, adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations, political instability, regulatory and economic differences, and potential restrictions on the flow of international capital. The Fund is specifically exposed to
Asian Economic Risk, European Economic Risk and North American Economic Risk. </p> <p><b><i><font>Non-U.S.</font>
Securities Risk</i></b>. Investments in the securities of <font>non-U.S.</font> issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those <font>non-U.S.</font> markets, such as
heightened risks of inflation or nationalization. The Fund or an Underlying Fund may lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting issuers of <font>non-U.S.</font> securities or <font>non-U.S.</font> markets. In addition, <font>non-U.S.</font> securities markets may trade a small number of securities and may be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume,
potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. The Fund is specifically exposed to Asian Economic Risk, European Economic Risk and North American Economic Risk. </p>
<p><b><i>Operational Risk</i></b>. The Fund and the Underlying Funds are exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors,
including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund’s service providers, counterparties or other third parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund, the
Underlying Funds and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks. </p>
<p><b><i>Prepayment Risk</i></b>. During periods of falling interest rates, issuers of certain debt obligations may repay principal prior to the
security’s maturity, which may cause the Fund to have to reinvest in securities with lower yields or higher risk of default, resulting in a decline in the Fund’s income or return potential. </p>
<p><b><i>Real Estate Investment Risk</i></b>. Companies that invest in real estate (“Real Estate Companies”), such as REITs, real
estate holding and operating companies and real estate management or development companies, expose investors in the Fund to the risks of owning real estate directly, as well as to risks that relate specifically to the way in which Real Estate
Companies are organized and operated. Real estate is highly sensitive to general and local economic conditions and developments, and characterized by intense competition and periodic overbuilding. If the Fund’s investments in Real Estate
Companies are concentrated in one geographic region, industry or property type, the Fund will be particularly subject to the risks associated with that region, industry or property type. Many Real Estate Companies, including REITs, utilize
leverage (and some may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk and the risk normally associated with debt financing, and could potentially magnify the Fund’s losses. Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital
for Real Estate Companies, which could negatively affect a Real Estate Company’s ability to meet its payment obligations or its financing activity and could decrease the market prices for REITs and for properties held by such REITs. </p>
<p><b><i>Reinvestment Risk</i></b>. The Fund or an Underlying Fund may invest a portion of its assets in short-term fixed-income instruments and,
as a result, may be adversely affected if interest rates fall because they may have to invest in lower-yielding bonds as bonds mature. </p>
<p><b><i>Risk of Investing in China</i></b>. Investments in Chinese securities, including certain Hong Kong-listed and U.S.-listed securities,
subject the Fund or the Underlying Funds to risks specific to China. China may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability. China is an emerging market and demonstrates significantly higher volatility from time
to time in comparison to developed markets. Over the last few decades, </p>

<p>
the Chinese government has undertaken reform of economic and market practices and has expanded the sphere of private ownership of property in China. However, Chinese markets generally continue to
experience inefficiency, volatility and pricing anomalies resulting from governmental influence, a lack of publicly available information and/or political and social instability. </p>
<p>Chinese companies are also subject to the risk that Chinese authorities can intervene in their operations and structure. Internal social
unrest or confrontations with neighboring countries, including military conflicts in response to such events, may also disrupt economic development in China and result in a greater risk of currency fluctuations, currency <font>non-convertibility,</font> interest rate fluctuations and higher rates of inflation. </p> <p>China has experienced
security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations. Additionally, China is alleged to have participated in state-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign companies and foreign governments. Actual and threatened responses to such
activity and strained international relations, including purchasing restrictions, sanctions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Chinese government or Chinese companies, may impact China’s economy and Chinese issuers of securities in which the Fund
invests. Incidents involving China’s or the region’s security may cause uncertainty in Chinese markets and may adversely affect the Chinese economy and the Fund’s investments. Export growth continues to be a major driver of
China’s rapid economic growth. Reduction in spending on Chinese products and services, institution of additional tariffs or other trade barriers (including as a result of heightened trade tensions or a trade war between China and the U.S. or in
response to actual or alleged Chinese cyber activity) or a downturn in any of the economies of China’s key trading partners may have an adverse impact on the Chinese economy. </p>
<p>Chinese companies, including Chinese companies that are listed on U.S. exchanges, are not subject to the same degree of regulatory
requirements, accounting standards or auditor oversight as companies in more developed countries. As a result, information about the Chinese securities in which the Fund invests may be less reliable or complete. Chinese companies with securities
listed on U.S. exchanges may be delisted if they do not meet U.S. accounting standards and auditor oversight requirements, which would significantly decrease the liquidity and value of the securities. There may be significant obstacles to obtaining
information necessary for investigations into or litigation against Chinese companies, and shareholders may have limited legal remedies. The Fund is not actively managed and does not select investments based on investor protection considerations.
</p> <p><b><i>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries</i></b>. The Fund’s and the Underlying Fund’s investment in developed country
issuers may subject the Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and other risks associated with developed countries. Developed countries tend to represent a significant portion of the global economy and have generally
experienced slower economic growth than some less developed countries. Certain developed countries have experienced security concerns, such as war, terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents involving a country’s or region’s
security may cause uncertainty in its markets and may adversely affect its economy and the Fund’s or an Underlying Fund’s investments. In addition, developed countries may be adversely impacted by changes to the economic conditions of
certain key trading partners, regulatory burdens, debt burdens and the price or availability of certain commodities. </p> <p><b><i>Risk of
Investing in India</i></b>. Investments in Indian issuers involve risks that are specific to India, including legal, regulatory, political, currency and economic risks. Political and legal uncertainty, greater government control over the economy,
currency fluctuations or blockage, and the risk of nationalization or expropriation of assets may result in higher potential for losses. The securities markets in India are relatively underdeveloped and may subject the Fund or an Underlying Fund to
higher transaction costs or greater uncertainty than investments in more developed securities markets. </p> <p><b><i>Risk of Investing in
Japan</i></b>. The Japanese economy may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability, which could have a negative impact on Japanese securities. Since 2000, Japan’s economic growth rate has generally remained
low relative to other advanced economies, and it may remain low in the future. In addition, Japan is subject to the risk of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, </p>
<p> </p> <p>- 16 - </p>

<p> </p>

<center><div>
<p>
typhoons and tsunamis, which could negatively affect the Fund or an Underlying Fund. Japan’s relations with its neighbors have at times been strained, and strained relations may cause
uncertainty in the Japanese markets and adversely affect the overall Japanese economy. </p> <p><b><i>Risk of Investing in Russia</i></b>.
Investing in Russian securities involves significant risks, including legal, regulatory, currency and economic risks that are specific to Russia. In addition, investing in Russian securities involves risks associated with the settlement of portfolio
transactions and loss of the Fund’s or an Underlying Fund’s ownership rights in its portfolio securities as a result of the system of share registration and custody in Russia. Governments in the U.S. and many other countries have imposed
economic sanctions on certain Russian individuals and Russian corporate and banking entities. A number of jurisdictions may also institute broader sanctions on Russia. Russia has issued a number of countersanctions, some of which restrict the
distribution of profits by limited liability companies (<i>e.g.</i>, dividends), and prohibit Russian persons from entering into transactions with designated persons from “unfriendly states” as well as the export of raw materials or other
products from Russia to certain sanctioned persons. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The extent and duration of the military action, resulting sanctions and resulting future market disruptions, including
declines in its stock markets and the value of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but could be significant. Disruptions caused by Russian military action or other actions (including cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting
actual and threatened responses to such activity, including purchasing and financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer or purchaser preferences, sanctions, import and export restrictions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Russian
government, Russian companies, or Russian individuals, including politicians, may impact Russia’s economy and Russian companies in which the Fund or an Underlying Fund invests. Actual and threatened responses to Russian military action may also
impact the markets for certain Russian commodities, such as oil and natural gas, as well as other sectors of the Russian economy, and are likely to have collateral impacts on such sectors globally. Russian companies may be unable to pay dividends
and, if they pay dividends, the Fund or an Underlying Fund may be unable to receive them. As a result of sanctions, the Fund is currently restricted from trading in Russian securities, including those in its portfolio, while the Underlying Indexes
of the Underlying Funds have removed Russian securities. It is unknown when, or if, sanctions may be lifted or the Fund’s ability to trade in Russian securities will resume. </p>
<p><b><i>Risk of Investing in Saudi Arabia</i></b>. The ability of foreign investors (such as the Fund or an Underlying Fund) to invest in the
securities of Saudi Arabian issuers is relatively new. Such ability could be restricted by the Saudi Arabian government at any time, and unforeseen risks could materialize with respect to foreign ownership in such securities. The economy of Saudi
Arabia is dominated by petroleum exports. A sustained decrease in petroleum prices could have a negative impact on all aspects of the economy. Investments in the securities of Saudi Arabian issuers involve risks not typically associated with
investments in securities of issuers in more developed countries that may negatively affect the value of the Fund’s or Underlying Fund’s investments. Such heightened risks may include, among others, expropriation and/or
nationalization of assets, restrictions on and government intervention in international trade, confiscatory taxation, political instability, including authoritarian and/or military involvement in governmental decision making, armed conflict, crime
and instability as a result of religious, ethnic and/or socioeconomic unrest. There remains the possibility that instability in the larger Middle East region could adversely impact the economy of Saudi Arabia, and there is no assurance of political
stability in Saudi Arabia. </p> <p><b><i>Saudi Arabia Broker Risk</i></b>. There are a number of different ways of conducting transactions in
equity securities in the Saudi Arabian market. The Fund (or an Underlying Fund) generally expects to conduct its transactions in a manner in which the Fund would not be limited by Saudi Arabian regulations to a single broker. However, there may be a
limited number of brokers who can provide services to the Fund (or an Underlying Fund), which may have an adverse impact on the prices, quantity or timing of Fund (or an Underlying Fund) transactions. </p>
<p><b><i>Risk of Investing in Taiwan</i></b>. Investments in Taiwanese issuers involve risks that are specific to Taiwan, including legal,
regulatory, political, currency and economic risks. Political and economic developments of Taiwan’s neighbors may have an adverse effect on Taiwan’s economy. Specifically, Taiwan’s geographic proximity and history of political
contention with China have resulted in ongoing tensions, which may materially affect the Taiwanese economy and its securities market. </p>

<p><b><i>Risk of Investing in the U.S</i></b>. Certain changes in the U.S. economy, such as
when the U.S. economy weakens or when its financial markets decline, may have an adverse effect on the securities to which the Fund or the Underlying Funds has exposure. </p>
<p><b><i>Securities Lending Risk</i></b>. The Fund or an Underlying Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk
that the Fund or the Underlying Funds may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund or the Underlying Funds could also lose money in the event of a decline in the
value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund or an Underlying Fund. </p>
<p><b><i>Small-Capitalization Companies Risk</i></b>. Compared to <font>mid-</font> and large-capitalization
companies, small-capitalization companies may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse developments. In addition, the securities of small-capitalization companies may be more volatile and less liquid than those of <font>mid-</font> and large-capitalization companies. </p> <p><b><i>Tax Risk</i></b>. Because the Fund is expected to invest
in the Underlying Funds, the Fund’s realized losses on sales of shares of an Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently deferred as “wash sales.” Distributions of short-term capital gains by an Underlying Fund will be
recognized as ordinary income by the Fund and would not be offset by the Fund’s capital loss carryforwards, if any. Capital loss carryforwards of an Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund. </p>
<p><b><i>Technology Sector Risk</i></b>. Technology companies, including information technology companies, may have limited product lines,
markets, financial resources or personnel. Technology companies typically face intense competition and potentially rapid product obsolescence. They are also heavily dependent on intellectual property rights and may be adversely affected by the loss
or impairment of those rights. Companies in the technology sector may face increased government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or regulatory action. </p>
<p><b><i>Utilities Sector Risk</i></b>. The utilities sector is subject to significant government regulation and oversight. Deregulation,
however, may subject utility companies to greater competition and may reduce their profitability. Companies in the utilities sector may be adversely affected due to increases in fuel and operating costs, rising costs of financing capital
construction and the cost of complying with U.S. federal and state regulations, among other factors. </p> <p><b><i>Valuation Risk</i></b>. The
price the Fund or an Underlying Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or other asset may differ from the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund’s valuation of the security or other asset, particularly for securities or other assets that
trade in low volume or volatile markets, or assets that are impacted by market disruption events or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. In addition, the value of the securities or
other assets in the Fund’s or an Underlying Fund’s portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s or an Underlying Fund’s shares. Authorized Participants who
purchase or redeem shares of the Fund or an Underlying Fund on days when the Fund or an Underlying Fund is holding fair-valued securities or other instruments may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would
have received had the securities or other instruments not been fair valued or been valued using a different methodology. The ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party
service providers. </p> <p><b><a name="tx873542_11"></a>2.3  Fundamental and <font>Non-Fundamental</font> Investment

<p>The Target Fund and the Acquiring Fund each commenced operations on October 17, 2023 and have limited operating histories. The Acquiring
Fund is deemed to be the “accounting survivor” in connection with the Reorganization. As a result, the Combined Fund will continue the performance history of the Acquiring Fund after the closing of the Reorganization. Performance
information for each Fund since inception through the period ended January 31, 2024 is available in each Fund’s Semi-Annual Report for the period ending January 31, 2024. Updated performance information, including the Funds’
current NAVs, may be obtained by visiting www.iShares.com or by calling <font><font>1-800-iShares</font></font> <font><font><font>(1-800-474-2737)</font></font></font> (toll free). </p> <p><b><a name="tx873542_13"></a>2.5  Management of the Funds </b></p>
<p><i>Investment Adviser</i>. As investment adviser, BFA has overall responsibility for the general management and administration of the Funds.
BFA provides an investment program for each Fund and manages the investment of each Fund’s assets. In managing the Funds, BFA may draw upon the research and expertise of its asset management affiliates with respect to certain portfolio
securities. In seeking to achieve a Fund’s investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists and other investment specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines and leverages BFA’s
extensive resources. </p> <p>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and the Trust (entered into on behalf of the Funds), BFA
is responsible for substantially all expenses of the Funds, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions,
including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, and litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of the Trustees who are not “interested persons” of the Trust). Operating expenses paid by
BFA under the Investment Advisory Agreement exclude Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any. </p> <p>For its investment advisory services to each
Fund, BFA is paid a management fee from each Fund based on a percentage of each Fund’s average daily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.00%. </p>
<p>BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses in order to limit total annual fund operating expenses
(excluding Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any time. </p> <p>BFA
is located at 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. It is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”). As of June 30, 2024, BFA and its affiliates provided investment advisory services for assets of
approximately $10.65 trillion. BFA and its affiliates trade and invest for their own accounts in the actual securities and types of securities in which the Funds may also invest, which may affect the price of such securities. </p>
<p>A discussion regarding the basis for the approval by the Board of the Investment Advisory Agreement with BFA is available in each Fund’s
Semi-Annual Report for the period ending January 31, 2024. </p> <p><i>Portfolio Managers</i>. Christopher Chung and Suzanne Ly are primarily
responsible for the <font><font>day-to-day</font></font> management of the Funds. The Portfolio Managers are responsible for various functions related to portfolio management, including, but not
limited to, investing cash inflows, coordinating with members of their respective portfolio management team to focus on certain asset classes, implementing investment strategy, researching and reviewing investment strategy and overseeing members of
their respective portfolio management teams who have more limited responsibilities. </p> <p>Christopher Chung has been with BlackRock since 2008,
including his years with Barclays Global Investors. Mr. Chung has been employed by BFA or its affiliates as a portfolio manager since 2008 and has been a Portfolio Manager of the Funds since inception (2023). </p>

<p><b><a name="tx873542_14"></a>2.6  Administrator, Custodian and Transfer Agent </b></p>
<p>Citibank serves as administrator, custodian and transfer agent for the Funds under the Master Services Agreement (the “Master Services
Agreement”). Citibank’s principal address is 388 Greenwich Street, New York, NY 10013. Pursuant to the Master Services Agreement with the Trust, Citibank provides necessary administrative, tax and accounting and financial
reporting services for the maintenance and operations of the Trust and each Fund. In addition, Citibank makes available the office space, equipment, personnel and facilities required to provide such services. Pursuant to the Master Services
Agreement with the Trust, Citibank maintains, in separate accounts, cash, securities and other assets of the Trust and each Fund, keeps all necessary accounts and records and provides other services. Citibank is required, upon the order of the
Trust, to deliver securities held by Citibank and to make payments for securities purchased by the Trust for each Fund. Citibank is authorized to appoint certain foreign custodians or foreign custody managers for Fund investments outside the U.S.
Pursuant to the Master Services Agreement with the Trust, Citibank acts as a transfer agent for each Fund’s authorized and issued shares of beneficial interest, and as dividend disbursing agent of the Trust. As compensation for these services,
Citibank receives certain <font><font>out-of-pocket</font></font> costs, transaction fees and asset-based fees which are accrued daily and paid monthly by BFA from its management fee. </p>
<p>JPMorgan serves as custodian for the Funds in connection with certain securities lending activities under a Custody Services Agreement.
JPMorgan’s principal address is 383 Madison Avenue, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10179. Pursuant to the Custody Services Agreement with BTC and the Trust, JPMorgan provides custody and related services required to facilitate securities lending
by the Fund. JPMorgan maintains custody as may be necessary to facilitate Fund securities lending activity in coordination with other funds, maintains custodial records and provides other services. As compensation for these services, JPMorgan
receives certain fees and expenses paid by BTC from its compensation for its services as securities lending agent. </p> <p>The Master Services
Agreement and Custody Service Agreement will remain in place with respect to the Combined Fund following the Reorganization. </p>

<p><b><a name="tx873542_17"></a>2.9  Dividends and Distributions </b></p>
<p><i>General Policies</i>. Dividends from net investment income, if any, generally are declared and paid at least once a year by each Fund. Each
Fund generally distributes its net capital gains, if any, to shareholders annually. Distributions of net realized securities gains, if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make distributions on a more frequent basis
for each Fund. The Trust reserves the right to declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to preserve its status as a RIC or to avoid imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed
income or realized gains. </p> <p>Dividends and other distributions on shares of each Fund are distributed on a pro rata basis to beneficial
owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC (defined below) participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds received from a Fund. </p>
<p><i>Dividend Reinvestment Service</i>. No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC
book-entry Dividend Reinvestment Service for use by beneficial owners of a Fund for reinvestment of their dividend distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of
participation therein. Brokers may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in
additional whole shares of a Fund purchased in the secondary market. </p> <p>Effective upon the closing of the Reorganization, the Acquiring
Fund’s dividends and distributions policy will be continued by the Combined Fund. Acquiring Fund Shares received by the Target Fund in the Reorganization will be valued as of the Valuation Time (as defined below), after the declaration and
payment of dividends and distributions. </p> <p><b><a name="tx873542_18"></a>2.10  Buying, Selling and Valuation of Shares </b></p>
<p>Shareholders should refer to the Acquiring Fund’s Prospectus (a copy of which accompanies this Combined Prospectus/Information Statement)
for the specific procedures applicable to buying, selling and valuation of shares. The following discussion describes the policies and procedures related to the purchase, sale and valuation of shares of the Funds, which are identical, and which
policies and procedures will be the same for the Combined Fund following the closing of the Reorganization. </p> <p><i>Buying and Selling
Shares</i>. Shares of the Funds may be acquired or redeemed directly from a Fund only in Creation Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the Creations and Redemptions section of each Fund’s Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant may
engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with a Fund. Once created, shares of the Funds generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a Creation Unit. </p>
<p>Shares of each Fund are listed on a national securities exchange for trading during the trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout
the trading day like shares of other publicly traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment for shares of a Fund purchased on an exchange or otherwise in the secondary market. The Funds’ shares trade under the ticker
symbols listed on the front cover page of this Prospectus. </p> <p>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary market
involves two types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Funds through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may be a
significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread,” that is, any difference between the bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over time
for shares of each Fund based on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading volume
</p>
<p> </p> <p>- 21 - </p>

<p> </p>
<hr size="3"/>
<h5><a href="#toc">Table of Contents</a></h5>
<center><div>
<p>
and market liquidity (which is often the case for funds that are newly launched or small in size). The Fund’s spread may also be impacted by the liquidity or illiquidity of the underlying
securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller funds or in instances of significant volatility of the underlying securities. </p>
<p>The national securities exchange on which each Fund’s shares are listed is open for trading Monday through Friday and is closed on
weekends and the following holidays (or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas
Day. Each Fund’s primary listing exchange is NYSE Arca. </p> <p>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act generally restricts investments by
investment companies, including foreign and unregistered investment companies, in the securities of other investment companies. For example, a registered investment company (the “Purchased Fund”), such as the Funds, may not knowingly sell
or otherwise dispose of any security issued by the Purchased Fund to any investment company (the “Purchasing Fund”) or any company or companies controlled by the Purchasing Fund if, immediately after such sale or disposition: (i) more
than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of the Purchased Fund is owned by the Purchasing Fund and any company or companies controlled by the Purchasing Fund, or (ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding voting stock of the Purchased
Fund is owned by the Purchasing Fund and other investment companies and companies controlled by them. Although SEC rules may permit registered investment companies and unit investment trusts (“Investing Funds”) that enter into an
investment agreement with the Trust to invest in iShares funds beyond the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act subject to certain terms and conditions, the Fund does not permit such investments. Accordingly, Investing Funds must
adhere to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act when investing in the Funds. In addition, foreign investment companies are permitted to invest in the Funds only up to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to
any applicable SEC <font>no-action</font> relief. </p> <p><i>Book Entry</i>. Shares of the Funds are held in
book-entry form, which means that no stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee is the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of each Fund. </p>
<p>Investors owning shares of the Funds are beneficial owners as shown on the records of DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities
depository for shares of the Funds. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and other institutions that directly or indirectly maintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial
owner of shares, you are not entitled to receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your name, and you are not considered a registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an owner of shares, you
must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other securities that you hold in book-entry or “street name” form. </p>
<p><i>Share Prices</i>. The trading prices of a Fund’s shares in the secondary market generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and
are affected by market forces such as the supply of and demand for ETF shares and shares of underlying securities held by the Funds, economic conditions and other factors. </p>
<p><i>Determination of Net Asset Value</i>. The NAV of each Fund normally is determined once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the
close of regular trading hours of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that any Fund assets or liabilities
denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. The NAV of each Fund is calculated by dividing the value
of the net assets of a Fund (<i>i.e.</i>, the value of its total assets, which includes the values of the Underlying Fund shares in which the Fund invests, less total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally
rounded to the nearest cent. </p>

<h5><a href="#toc">Table of Contents</a></h5>
<center><div>
<p>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities held by each Fund is determined
pursuant to BFA’s valuation policies and procedures. BFA has been designated by the Board as the valuation designee for the Fund pursuant to Rule <font>2a-5</font> under the 1940 Act. </p>
<p>Equity securities and other equity instruments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at market value, which is
generally determined using the last reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the last traded price on the exchange or market on which the security or instrument is primarily traded at the time of valuation.
Shares of underlying <font>open-end</font> funds (including money market funds) are valued at net asset value. Shares of underlying exchange-traded <font>closed-end</font> funds or other ETFs are
valued at their most recent closing price. </p> <p>Generally, trading in <font>non-U.S.</font> securities and money
market instruments is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of regular trading hours of the NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Funds are determined as of such times. </p>
<p>When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, BFA will fair value a Fund’s investments in
accordance with its policies and procedures. BFA may conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its lack of trading or other reasons, if a
market quotation differs significantly from recent price quotations or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent to the most
recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is available. A “significant event” is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its
reasonable business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing a Fund’s assets or liabilities, that the event is likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or closing market price of one or more assets held by, or
liabilities of, a Fund. </p> <p>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of an
asset or liability held by a Fund is the amount the Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to extinguish that liability in an <font>arm’s-length</font> transaction.
Valuing a Fund’s investments using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been sold during the period in which the particular
fair values were used. </p> <p><b><a name="tx873542_19"></a>2.11  Distribution </b></p>
<p>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for each Fund on an agency basis. The Distributor does not maintain a secondary market
in shares of the Funds. The Distributor has no role in determining the policies of any Fund or the securities that are purchased or sold by any Fund. The Distributor’s principal address is 50 Hudson Yards, New York, NY 10001. </p>
<p>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers, registered investment advisers, banks or other intermediaries (together,
“intermediaries”) related to marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems, data provision services, or their making shares of the Funds
and certain other iShares funds available to their customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may be significant to the intermediary, are not made by the Funds. Rather, such payments are made by BFA or its
affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may make decisions
about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other financial incentives it is eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial
incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the Funds or other iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding
these payments is contained in the Funds’ SAI. Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates. </p>

</p> <p><b><a name="tx873542_21"></a>2.13  Market Timing Trading Policies and Procedures </b></p>
<p>Each Fund does not impose restrictions on the frequency of purchases and redemptions of Fund shares directly with the Fund. The Board
determined not to adopt policies and procedures designed to prevent or monitor for frequent purchases and redemptions of Fund shares because each Fund generally sells and redeems its shares directly through transactions that are <font>in-kind</font> and/or for cash, with a deadline for placing cash-related transactions no later than the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities. However, each Fund has taken certain measures
(<i>e.g.</i>, imposing transaction fees on purchases and redemptions of Creation Units and reserving the right to reject purchases of Creation Units under certain circumstances) to minimize the potential consequences of frequent cash purchases and
redemptions by Authorized Participants, such as increased tracking error, disruption of portfolio management, dilution to the Fund, and/or increased transaction costs. Further, the vast majority of trading in Fund shares occurs on the secondary
market, which does not involve each Fund directly, and such trading is unlikely to cause many of the harmful effects of frequent cash purchases or redemptions of Fund shares. </p>

<p><b><a name="tx873542_23"></a>ARTICLE IV INFORMATION ABOUT THE REORGANIZATION </b></p>
<p>The following summary of the Reorganization Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
form of Reorganization Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Appendix II — “Form of Agreement and Plan of Reorganization” and is incorporated herein by reference. </p>
<p><b><a name="tx873542_24"></a>4.1  General </b></p>
<p>Under the Reorganization Agreement, the Reorganization will consist of (i) the transfer of all of the assets of the Target Fund to the
Acquiring Fund, in exchange for the assumption by the Acquiring Fund of All Liabilities (as defined in Appendix II) of the Target Fund and shares of the Acquiring Fund (such amount of Acquiring Fund shares, the “Acquiring Fund Shares”)
having an aggregate NAV equal to the value of the assets of the Target Fund acquired by the Acquiring Fund reduced by All Liabilities; (ii) the distribution, on or as soon as practicable after the Closing Date (as defined in Appendix II), of
the Acquiring Fund Shares and cash in lieu of fractional shares to the shareholders of the Target Fund in liquidation and redemption of all outstanding shares of the Target Fund; and (iii) the dissolution of the Target Fund, all upon the terms
and conditions set forth in the Reorganization Agreement. The Acquiring Fund Shares issued to the Target Fund will have an aggregate NAV equal to the aggregate NAV of the Target Fund’s shares outstanding as of the close of trading on the NYSE
on the business day immediately prior to the Closing Date of the Reorganization (the “Valuation Time”), minus cash paid in lieu of fractional shares of the Acquiring Fund. Such NAV will be determined in accordance with the Acquiring
Fund’s valuation procedures or such other valuation procedures as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Target Fund and the Acquiring Fund. In order to minimize any potential for undesirable federal income and excise tax consequences in
connection with the Reorganization, the Target Fund will distribute on or before the Closing Date all of its undistributed net investment income and net capital gains as of such date. </p>
<p>The Target Fund expects to distribute its Acquiring Fund Shares and cash in lieu of fractional Acquiring Fund Shares, if any, to the
shareholders of the Target Fund promptly after the Closing Date. </p> <p>Upon distribution of such shares, all outstanding shares of the Target
Fund will be redeemed as soon as practicable after the Closing Date in accordance with applicable state law and organizational documents of the Target Fund. Thereafter, the Target Fund will be abolished as a series of the Trust under Delaware state
law. </p> <p>The Target Fund and the Acquiring Fund have made certain standard representations and warranties to each other regarding
capitalization, status and conduct of business. </p> <p>Unless waived in accordance with the Reorganization Agreement, the obligations of the
Acquiring Fund and the Target Fund, respectively, are conditioned upon, among other things: </p> <p> </p>

Fund will not be diluted with respect to NAV as a result of the Reorganization. The Board also concluded that completion of the Reorganization is advisable and in the best interest of the Acquiring Fund. The determinations were made on the basis of
the business judgment of each Trustee after consideration of all of the factors taken as a whole, though individual members may have placed different weight on various factors and assigned different degrees of materiality to various conclusions.

<p>The following is a general summary of the material anticipated U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Reorganization. The discussion is
based upon the Code, Treasury regulations, court decisions, published positions of the IRS and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date hereof and all of which are subject to change or different interpretations (possibly with
retroactive effect). The discussion is limited to U.S. persons that hold shares of the Target Fund as capital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This summary does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be
relevant to shareholders that are subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax aspects described
below. Shareholders should consult their own tax advisers as to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Reorganization, as well as the effects of state, local and <font>non-U.S.</font> tax laws. </p>
<p>It is a condition to the closing of the Reorganization that the Trust, on behalf of each Fund, receive an opinion from Willkie Farr &amp;
Gallagher LLP, tax counsel to the Funds, dated as of the Closing Date, that the Reorganization will be a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that the Target Fund and the Acquiring Fund each will be a
“party to a reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code. As a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Reorganization can be

categories of assets as of the closing of the taxable year of the Target Fund at the time of the Reorganization or as a result of the transfer of certain types of assets. An opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS or any court. </p>
<p>The Combined Fund intends to continue to be taxed under the rules applicable to regulated investment companies as defined in Section 851
of the Code, which are the same rules currently applicable to the Target Fund and its shareholders. </p> <p>Prior to the Closing Date, the Target
Fund will declare a distribution to its shareholders that, together with all previous distributions, will have the effect of distributing to its shareholders all of its investment company taxable income (computed without regard to the deduction for
dividends paid), net <font>tax-exempt</font> income and net realized capital gains, if any, through the Closing Date (after reduction for any capital loss carryforward). </p>
<p>A portion of the assets held by the Target Fund may be sold in connection with the Reorganization if needed for purposes of the Target
Fund’s distribution mentioned in the previous paragraph, and a portion of such assets may be required to be marked to market as a result of the termination of the Target Fund’s taxable year or as a result of the transfer of some of the
assets in the Reorganization. The tax impact of any such sales (or deemed sales) will depend on the difference between the price at which such assets are sold (or deemed sold) and the Target Fund’s basis in such assets. Any capital gains
recognized in these sales (or deemed sales) on a net basis will be distributed to the Target Fund’s shareholders as capital gain dividends (to the extent of net realized long-term capital gains) and/or ordinary dividends (to the extent of net
realized short-term capital gains) during or with respect to the year of sale (or deemed sale) and prior to or on the date of the Reorganization, and such distributions will be taxable to shareholders of the Target Fund. </p>
<p>It is not expected that significant capital loss carryforwards will be forfeited as a result of the Reorganization with respect to the
Acquiring Fund. As of January 31, 2024, the Target Fund did not have any capital loss carryforwards. </p> <p>Shareholders of the Target Fund may
sell their shares at any time prior to the closing of the Reorganization. Generally, these are taxable transactions. Shareholders must consult with their own tax advisers regarding potential transactions. </p>

</table> <p>For purposes of the 1940 Act, any person who owns directly or through one or more controlled companies more

<p><i>Notations Regarding each Fund’s Fundamental Investment Policies </i></p>
<p>The following notations are not considered to be part of each Fund’s fundamental investment policies and are subject to change without
shareholder approval. </p> <p>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to concentration set forth in (1) above, the Investment
Company Act does not define what constitutes “concentration” in an industry. The SEC staff has taken the position that investment of 25% or more of a fund’s total assets in one or more issuers conducting their principal activities in
the same industry or group of industries constitutes concentration. It is possible that interpretations of concentration could change in the future. The policy in (1) above will be interpreted to refer to concentration as that term may be
interpreted from time to time. The policy also will be interpreted to permit investment without limit in the following: securities of the U.S. government and its agencies or instrumentalities; securities of state, territory, possession or municipal
governments and their authorities, agencies, instrumentalities or political subdivisions; and repurchase agreements collateralized by any such obligations. Accordingly, issuers of the foregoing securities will not be considered to be members of any
industry. There also will be no limit on investment in issuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or country. Finance companies will be considered to be in the industries of their parents if their activities are primarily related to financing the
activities of the parents. Each foreign government will be considered to be a member of a separate industry. With respect to each Fund’s industry classifications, each Fund currently utilizes any one or more of the industry <font>sub-classifications</font> used by one or more widely recognized market indexes or rating group indexes, and/or as defined by Fund management. The policy also will be interpreted to give broad authority to each Fund as to
how to classify issuers within or among industries<i>.</i> </p>

<p> </p>
<hr size="3"/>
<h5><a href="#toc">Table of Contents</a></h5>
<center><div>
<p>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to borrowing money set forth in
(2) above, the Investment Company Act permits each Fund to borrow money in amounts of up to <font>one-third</font> of the Fund’s total assets from banks for any purpose, and to borrow up to 5% of the Fund’s
total assets from banks or other lenders for temporary purposes. (Each Fund’s total assets include the amounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks attendant to borrowing, the Investment Company Act requires each Fund to maintain at all times an
“asset coverage” of at least 300% of the amount of its borrowings. Asset coverage means the ratio that the value of each Fund’s total assets (including amounts borrowed), minus liabilities other than borrowings, bears to the aggregate
amount of all borrowings. Borrowing money to increase portfolio holdings is known as “leveraging.” Certain trading practices and investments, such as reverse repurchase agreements, may be considered to be borrowings or involve leverage and
thus are subject to the Investment Company Act restrictions. In accordance with Rule <font>18f-</font> 4 under the Investment Company Act, when each Fund engages in reverse repurchase agreements and similar financing
transactions, the Fund may either (i) maintain asset coverage of at least 300% with respect to such transactions and any other borrowings in the aggregate, or (ii) treat such transactions as “derivatives transactions” and comply
with Rule <font>18f-4</font> with respect to such transactions. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered to be
borrowings under the policy. Practices and investments that may involve leverage but are not considered to be borrowings are not subject to the policy. </p>
<p>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to underwriting set forth in (5) above, the Investment Company Act does not prohibit a
fund from engaging in the underwriting business or from underwriting the securities of other issuers; in fact, in the case of diversified funds, the Investment Company Act permits a fund to have underwriting commitments of up to 25% of its assets
under certain circumstances. Those circumstances currently are that the amount of a fund’s underwriting commitments, when added to the value of a fund’s investments in issuers where a fund owns more than 10% of the outstanding voting
securities of those issuers, cannot exceed the 25% cap. A fund engaging in transactions involving the acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act. Although it is not believed that the
application of the 1933 Act provisions described above would cause a fund to be engaged in the business of underwriting, the policy in (5) above will be interpreted not to prevent a fund from engaging in transactions involving the acquisition
or disposition of portfolio securities, regardless of whether a fund may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act or is otherwise engaged in the underwriting business to the extent permitted by applicable law. </p>
<p>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to lending set forth in (7) above, the Investment Company Act does not prohibit each Fund
from making loans (including lending its securities); however, SEC staff interpretations currently prohibit funds from lending more than <font>one-third</font> of their total assets (including lending its securities),
except through the purchase of debt obligations or the use of repurchase agreements. In addition, collateral arrangements with respect to options, forward currency and futures transactions and other derivative instruments (as applicable), as well as
delays in the settlement of securities transactions, will not be considered loans. </p> <p><u><font>Non-Fundamental</font> Investment
Policies of the Funds. </u></p> <p>Each Fund has adopted a <font>non-fundamental</font> investment policy not to
purchase securities of other investment companies, except to the extent permitted by the Investment Company Act. As a matter of policy, however, each Fund will not purchase shares of any registered <font>open-end</font>
investment company or registered unit investment trust, in reliance on Section 12(d)(1)(F) or (G) (the “fund of funds” provisions) of the Investment Company Act, at any time each LifePath ETF has knowledge that its shares are
purchased by another investment company investor in reliance on the provisions of subparagraph (G) of Section 12(d)(1). </p> <p>Each
Fund has adopted a <font>non-fundamental</font> investment policy not to make short sales of securities or maintain a short position, except to the extent permitted by each Fund’s Prospectus and Statement of
Additional Information, as amended from time to time, and applicable law. </p>

<p>Unless otherwise indicated, all limitations under each Fund’s fundamental or <font>non-fundamental</font> investment policies apply only at the time that a transaction is undertaken. Any change in the percentage of each Fund’s assets invested in certain securities or other instruments resulting from
market fluctuations or other changes in each Fund’s total assets will not require each Fund to dispose of an investment until BFA determines that it is practicable to sell or close out the investment without undue market or tax consequences.
</p> <p>Notwithstanding any other investment policy or restriction (whether or not fundamental), the Underlying Funds in which each Fund may
invest have adopted certain investment restrictions that may be different from those listed above, thereby permitting each Fund to engage indirectly in investment strategies that are prohibited under the restrictions listed above. The investment
restrictions of each Underlying Fund are set forth in its respective statement of additional information. </p>

<p><b><u>FORM OF AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION </u></b></p>
<p>THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (the “Agreement”) is made as of this [<b>•</b>] day of [<b>•</b>], 2024, by and
between iShares Trust, a registered investment company and a Delaware statutory trust (the “Trust”), on behalf of iShares LifePath Target Date 2025 ETF, a separate series of the Trust (the “Target Fund”), and the Trust, on behalf
of iShares LifePath Retirement ETF, a separate series of the Trust (the “Acquiring Fund”). </p> <p>This Agreement is intended to be,
and is adopted as, a plan of reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. The reorganization will
consist of: (i) the transfer of all of the assets of the Target Fund to the Acquiring Fund, in exchange for the assumption by the Acquiring Fund of All Liabilities (as defined in paragraph 1.3) of the Target Fund and shares of the Acquiring
Fund (such amount of Acquiring Fund shares, the “Acquiring Fund Shares”) having an aggregate net asset value (“NAV”) equal to the value of the assets of the Target Fund acquired by the Acquiring Fund reduced by All Liabilities;
(ii) the distribution, on or as soon as practicable after the Closing Date (as defined in paragraph 3.1), of the Acquiring Fund Shares to the shareholders of the Target Fund in liquidation and redemption of all outstanding shares of the Target
Fund; and (iii) the dissolution of the Target Fund, all upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement (the “Reorganization”); </p>
<p>WHEREAS, the Target Fund and Acquiring Fund are each a separate series of the Trust, which is
<font>an open-end, registered</font> management investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”); </p>
<p>WHEREAS, each of the Acquiring Fund and the Target Fund qualifies as a “regulated investment company” under Subchapter M of the
Code; </p> <p>WHEREAS, the Acquiring Fund is authorized to issue the Acquiring Fund Shares; </p>
<p>WHEREAS, the Board of Trustees of the Trust (the “Board”) has determined that the Reorganization is appropriate and in the best
interests of the Target Fund and that the Reorganization is advisable; </p> <p>WHEREAS, the Board has determined that the Reorganization is
appropriate and in the best interests of the Acquiring Fund and that the Reorganization is advisable. </p> <p>NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of
the premises and of the covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto covenant and agree as follows: </p> <p><b>ARTICLE I
</b></p> <p><b>THE REORGANIZATION </b></p>
<p>1.1 THE EXCHANGE. Subject to the terms and conditions contained herein and on the basis of the representations and warranties contained
herein, the Target Fund agrees to convey, transfer and deliver substantially all of the assets of the Target Fund described in paragraph 1.2 free and clear of all liens, encumbrances and claims whatsoever to the Acquiring Fund. In exchange, the
Acquiring Fund, agrees: (a) to deliver to the Target Fund the number of Acquiring Fund Shares (and cash in lieu of fractional shares), determined by dividing: (A) the aggregate value of the Target Fund’s assets, net of All
Liabilities (as defined in paragraph 1.3) of the Target Fund, computed in the manner and as of the time and date set forth in paragraph 2.1, by (B) the NAV of one share of the Acquiring Fund computed in the manner and as of the time and date
set forth in paragraph 2.2; and (b) to assume All Liabilities of the Target Fund as described in paragraph 1.3. Such transactions shall take place at the closing (the “Closing”) provided for in paragraph 3.1. </p>
<p> </p> <p>II-1 </p>
</div></center>
<p> </p>
<hr size="3"/>
<h5><a href="#toc">Table of Contents</a></h5>
<center><div>
<p>1.2 ASSETS TO BE ACQUIRED. The assets of the Target Fund to be acquired by the Acquiring
Fund shall consist of all property owned by the Trust, on behalf of the Target Fund, including, without limitation, all cash, securities, commodities, interests in futures and other financial instruments, claims (whether absolute or contingent,
known or unknown), receivables (including dividends, interest, principal, subscriptions and other receivables), goodwill and other intangible property, all books and records belonging to the Target Fund, any deferred or prepaid expenses shown as an
asset on the books of the Target Fund on the Closing Date, and all interests, rights, privileges and powers, other than the rights of the Trust, on behalf of the Target Fund under this Agreement (the “Assets”). </p>
<p>1.3 LIABILITIES TO BE ASSUMED. The Trust, on behalf of the Target Fund, will endeavor to identify and discharge, to the extent practicable,
all of the Target Fund’s liabilities and obligations, including all liabilities relating to operations, before the Closing Date. The Acquiring Fund shall assume all accrued and unpaid liabilities of the Target Fund set forth in the Target
Fund’s statement of assets and liabilities as of the Closing Date delivered by the Target Fund to the Acquiring Fund pursuant to paragraph 5.2 (“All Liabilities”). The Acquiring Fund shall assume All Liabilities of the Target Fund.
</p> <p>1.4 STATE FILINGS. Prior to the Closing Date, the Trust shall make any filings with the state of Delaware that are required under the
laws of the state of Delaware to be made prior to the Closing Date. </p> <p>1.5 LIQUIDATION AND DISTRIBUTION. On or as soon as practicable after
the Closing Date, (i) the Target Fund will distribute in complete liquidation of the Target Fund, pro rata to its shareholders of record, determined as of the close of business at the Valuation Time (as defined below) (the “Target Fund
Shareholders”), all of the Acquiring Fund Shares (and cash in lieu of fractional shares) received by the Target Fund. Such distribution will be accomplished by the transfer on the books of the Acquiring Fund of Acquiring Fund Shares credited to
the account of the Target Fund to open accounts on the share records of the Acquiring Fund in the name of the Target Fund Shareholders, and representing the respective pro rata number of Acquiring Fund Shares due Target Fund Shareholders and
(ii) the Target Fund will be terminated as a separate series of the Trust. The Acquiring Fund shall not issue certificates representing Acquiring Fund Shares in connection with such transfer. </p>
<p>1.6 TRANSFER TAXES. Any transfer taxes payable upon the issuance of Acquiring Fund Shares in a name other than the registered holder of the
Target Fund shares on the books of the Target Fund as of that time shall, as a condition of such transfer, be paid by the person to whom such Acquiring Fund Shares are to be issued and transferred. </p>
<p>1.7 REPORTING RESPONSIBILITY. Any reporting responsibility of the Trust, on behalf of the Target Fund, including, without limitation, the
responsibility for filing of regulatory reports, tax returns or other documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), any state securities commission, and any federal, state or local tax authorities or any other
relevant regulatory authority, is and shall remain the responsibility of the Trust, on behalf of the Target Fund. </p> <p>1.8 BOOKS AND RECORDS.
Immediately after the Closing Date, the share transfer books relating to the Target Fund shall be closed and no transfer of shares shall thereafter be made on such books. All books and records of the Target Fund transferred to the Acquiring Fund,
including all books and records required to be maintained under the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, shall be made available to the Target Fund from and after the Closing Date at the Acquiring Fund’s cost of producing such

Target Fund required by law to be filed have or shall have been timely and duly filed by such dates (including any extensions) and are or will be correct in all material respects, and all federal and other taxes required to be paid pursuant to such
returns and reports have been paid. To the best of the Trust’s knowledge, on behalf of the Target Fund, after reasonable investigation, no such return is currently under audit or examination, and no assessment or deficiency has been asserted
with respect to any such returns. </p> <p>(l) The Trust is authorized to issue an unlimited number of shares of beneficial
interest, no par value, of the Target Fund. All issued and outstanding shares of the Target Fund have been offered and sold in compliance in all material respects with applicable registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (“1933

marketable title to the Assets, subject to no restrictions on their full transfer, other than such restrictions as might arise under the 1933 Act, and other than as disclosed to and accepted in writing by the Acquiring Fund. </p>

Gallagher LLP, counsel to the Acquiring Fund and the Target Fund, substantially to the effect that, based on certain facts, assumptions and representations of the parties, for U.S. federal income tax purposes: </p>
<p>(a) the transfer of the Assets of the Target Fund solely in exchange for Acquiring Fund Shares and the assumption by the
Acquiring Fund of All Liabilities of the Target Fund followed by the distribution of Acquiring Fund Shares to the Target Fund Shareholders and then the complete dissolution of the Target Fund, all pursuant to the Agreement, will constitute a
“reorganization” within the meaning of section 368(a) of the Code, and the Acquiring Fund and the Target Fund will each be a “party to a reorganization” within the meaning of section 368(b) of the Code; </p>
<p>(b) under section 1032 of the Code, no gain or loss will be recognized by the Acquiring Fund upon the receipt of the Assets of
the Target Fund solely in exchange for Acquiring Fund Shares and the assumption by the Acquiring Fund of All Liabilities of the Target Fund; </p>
<p>(c) under section 361 and 357(a) of the Code, no gain or loss will be recognized by the Target Fund upon the transfer of the
Assets of the Target Fund to the Acquiring Fund solely in exchange for Acquiring Fund Shares and the assumption by the Acquiring Fund of All Liabilities of the Target Fund or upon the distribution of Acquiring Fund Shares to Target Fund Shareholders
in exchange for such shareholders’ shares of the Target Fund in liquidation of the Target Fund; </p> <p>(d) under section 354
of the Code, no gain or loss will be recognized by the Target Fund Shareholders upon the exchange of their Target Fund shares solely for Acquiring Fund Shares pursuant to the Reorganization, except to the extent of cash received in lieu of
fractional shares; </p> <p>(e) under section 358 of the Code, the aggregate tax basis of Acquiring Fund Shares received by each
Target Fund Shareholder pursuant to the Reorganization will be the same as the aggregate tax basis of the Target Fund shares exchanged therefor by such shareholder; </p>
<p>(f) under section 1223(1) of the Code, the holding period of Acquiring Fund Shares to be received by each Target Fund
Shareholder pursuant to the Reorganization will include the period during which the Target Fund shares exchanged therefor were held by such shareholder, provided such Target Fund shares are held as capital assets at the time of the Reorganization;
</p> <p>(g) under section 362(b) of the Code, the tax basis of the Assets acquired by the Acquiring Fund will be the same as the
tax basis of such Assets to the Target Fund immediately before the Reorganization; and </p> <p> </p>

<p>(h) under section 1223(2) of the Code, the holding period of the Assets in
the hands of the Acquiring Fund will include the period during which those Assets were held by the Target Fund (except to the extent that the investment activities of the Acquiring Fund reduce or eliminate such holding period). </p>
<p>Such opinion shall be based on customary assumptions and such representations as Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher LLP may reasonably request,
and the Trust, on behalf of each of the Target Fund and the Acquiring Fund, will cooperate to make and certify the accuracy of such representations. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Trust, on behalf of either the Acquiring Fund

option terminate this Agreement at or before the Closing Date due to: </p> <p>(a) a material breach by one of the other parties of
any representation, warranty or agreement contained herein to be performed at or before the Closing Date, if not cured within 30 days; or </p>
<p>(b) a condition herein expressed to be precedent to the obligations of the terminating party and/or one or more other parties
that has not been met if it reasonably appears that it will not or cannot be met. </p> <p>11.2 In the event of any such termination, in the
absence of willful default, there shall be no liability for damages on the part of a party, or its Board, or officers, as applicable, to the other party or its Board. In the event of willful default, all remedies at law or in equity of the party or
parties adversely affected shall survive. </p> <p><b>ARTICLE XII </b></p>
