<div> <div><font>Before you invest, you may want to review the Fund’s prospectus,
which contains more information about </font><font>the Fund and its risks. You can find the Fund’s prospectus (including amendments and supplements) and </font><font>other information about the Fund, including the Fund’s statement of additional information and </font><font>shareholder reports, online at https://www.blackrock.com/prospectus. You can also get this information at </font><font>no cost by calling 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or by sending an e-mail request to
</font><font>iSharesETFs@blackrock.com, or from your financial professional. The Fund’s prospectus and statement of </font><font>additional information, both dated June 17, 2024, as amended and supplemented from time to time, are </font><font>incorporated by reference into (legally made a part of) this Summary Prospectus. Information on the Fund’s </font><font>net asset value, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads can be found at
</font><font>https://www.iShares.com</font><font>.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>As described herein, the Fund seeks to provide exposure to the share price return of the
Underlying ETF up to the Approximate </font><font>Cap, while seeking to maximize the downside protection against Underlying ETF losses through an Approximate Buffer (terms are </font><font>defined below). The Fund has characteristics unlike many investment products and may not be appropriate for all investors.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div>
<div><font>■</font></div>
<div><font>Approximate Cap:</font><font> The approximate upside limit on the share price return of the Underlying ETF during the Fund's Hedge
</font><font>Period</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>■</font></div>
<div><font>Approximate Buffer</font><font>: The downside protection, as sought by the Fund, for approximately 100% of Underlying ETF losses if </font><font>the Fund is held
for its entire Hedge Period</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>■</font></div>
<div><font>Underlying ETF</font><font>: iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>

<div><font>Underlying ETF’s Index</font><font>: S&amp;P 500 Index</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>■</font></div>
<div><font>Hedge Period</font><font>: July 1 through June 30</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>■</font></div>
<div><font>The Approximate Cap and the Approximate Buffer may not operate as anticipated and
investors may lose some or all their </font><font>money.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>■</font></div> <div><font>The Approximate Cap and the Approximate Buffer disclosed in the prospectus only apply to shares held over the entire
</font><font>Hedge Period.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>■</font></div>
<div><font>An investor that buys shares on a date other than the first day of the Hedge Period or
sells shares on a date other than the </font><font>last day of the Hedge Period may not fully realize the Approximate Cap or the Approximate Buffer and may be exposed to </font><font>greater risk of loss.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>■</font></div>
<div><font>The Approximate Buffer is provided prior to taking into account any fees or expenses
charged to the Fund. These fees and </font><font>any expenses will reduce the Approximate Buffer amount for Fund shareholders for the Hedge Period.</font></div> </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>■</font></div> <div><font>An investor can obtain information regarding the start date and end date of the current Hedge Period, information relating to </font><font>the potential outcomes of an investment in the Fund (including, the remaining Approximate Cap, the remaining Approximate
</font><font>Buffer and the potential downside before the Approximate Buffer for the remainder of the Hedge Period) on the Fund’s </font><font>website,
</font><font>www.iShares.com</font><font>.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>
</div> <div> <div> <div><font>■</font></div> <div><font>The Approximate Cap will likely change for each Hedge Period. The Approximate Buffer may change for each Hedge Period.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

return of the iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (the </font><font>“</font><font>Underlying ETF</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>Underlying Fund</font><font>”</font><font>) up to an approximate
upside limit, while seeking to maximize the downside protection against price </font><font>declines of the Underlying ETF over an approximate 12-month period beginning at the end of each
June.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Fees and Expenses</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you will incur if you buy, hold
and sell shares of the Fund. The investment </font><font>advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the
</font><font>“</font><font>Trust</font><font>”</font><font>) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (</font><font>“</font><font>BFA</font><font>”</font><font>) (the </font><font>“</font><font>Investment Advisory Agreement</font><font>”</font><font>) </font><font>provides that BFA will pay all operating expenses of the Fund, except: (i) the management fees, (ii) interest expenses, (iii) taxes, (iv) </font><font>expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, </font><font>including brokerage commissions, (v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi) litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses. The Fund </font><font>may incur </font><font>“</font><font>Acquired Fund Fees and
Expenses.</font><font>”</font><font> Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses reflect the Fund’s </font><font>pro rata</font><font> share of the fees and
</font><font>expenses incurred indirectly by the Fund as a result of investing in other investment companies. The impact of Acquired Fund Fees and </font><font>Expenses is included in the total returns of the Fund. Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses are not included in the calculation of the ratio of </font><font>expenses to average net assets shown in the </font><font>Financial Highlights</font><font> section of the Fund’s prospectus (the
</font><font>“</font><font>Prospectus</font><font>”</font><font>). BFA, the investment </font><font>adviser to the Fund, has contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees in an
amount equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and </font><font>Expenses, if any, attributable to investments by the Fund in other series of the Trust and iShares, Inc. through November 30, 2029. The
</font><font>contractual waiver may be terminated prior to November 30, 2029 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA.</font></div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Portfolio Turnover.</font><font> The Fund or the Underlying Fund may pay </font><font>transaction costs, such as commissions, when they buy and sell </font><font>securities (or </font><font>“</font><font>turn over</font><font>”</font><font> their portfolios). A higher portfolio
</font><font>turnover rate for the Fund or the Underlying Fund may indicate </font><font>higher transaction costs and may cause the
Fund or the </font><font>Underlying Fund to incur increased expenses. These costs, which </font><font>are not reflected in the Annual
Fund Operating Expenses or in the </font><font>Example</font><font> </font><font>(except costs to the Underlying Fund included as part of </font><font>acquired fund fees and expenses), affect the Fund’s
performance. </font><font>Because the Fund is new, there is no reportable turnover.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>Principal Investment Strategies</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The Fund seeks to provide exposure to the share price return of </font><font>the Underlying ETF up
to an approximate upside limit (the </font><font>“</font><font>Approximate Cap</font><font>”</font><font>), while seeking to maximize the downside
</font><font>protection against Underlying ETF losses (the </font><font>“</font><font>Approximate </font><font>Buffer</font><font>”</font><font>) over each annual Hedge Period (as defined below). Under </font><font>normal market conditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of its
net </font><font>assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in securities </font><font>or other instruments that provide
exposure to securities of large </font><font>capitalization companies or that provide for the upside limit on </font><font>gains or
the downside protection against the losses of securities </font><font>of large capitalization companies. For purposes of the Fund’s 80% </font><font>policy, </font><font>“</font><font>large capitalization
companies</font><font>”</font><font> are those within the range </font><font>of capitalization of the Underlying ETF’s underlying index.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Fund principally buys shares of the Underlying ETF and </font><font>customized put options thereon and sells call options that
</font><font>reference the Underlying ETF. The options in which the Fund </font><font>transacts (typically, equity or index
exchange-traded options </font><font>contracts) are referred to generally as Flexible Exchange Options </font><font>(</font><font>“</font><font>FLEX Options</font><font>”</font><font>). The Fund may transact in other listed options </font><font>that reference the price performance of the Underlying ETF, the </font><font>Underlying ETF’s underlying index, or other exchange-traded </font><font>funds (</font><font>“</font><font>ETFs</font><font>”</font><font>) that track the Underlying ETF’s underlying index </font><font>(collectively, </font><font>“</font><font>exchange-traded options</font><font>”</font><font>).</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Fund
intends to maximize protection against loss through the </font><font>Approximate Buffer while establishing a 2% minimum Approximate </font><font>Cap as further described below. While the Fund typically seeks to </font><font>provide against approximately 100% of Underlying ETF
losses for </font><font>each applicable Hedge Period, the Fund will reduce the </font><font>Approximate Buffer below 100% to provide
an Approximate Cap of </font><font>at least 2% during each Hedge Period.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Underlying ETF is an ETF that seeks to track the investment </font><font>results of the S&amp;P 500 Index (the </font><font>“</font><font>Underlying ETF’s Index</font><font>”</font><font>), which </font><font>measures the performance of the large-capitalization sector of </font><font>the U.S. equity market, as determined by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, </font><font>LLC (</font><font>“</font><font>SPDJI</font><font>”</font><font>). The securities in the Underlying ETF’s Index are </font><font>weighted based on the float-adjusted market value of their
</font><font>outstanding shares. The Underlying ETF’s Index consists of </font><font>securities from a broad range of
industries. The components of </font><font>the Underlying ETF’s Index are likely to change over time. BFA is </font><font>the
investment adviser to the Underlying ETF and receives a </font><font>management fee from the Underlying ETF.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The Underlying ETF is managed using a representative sampling </font><font>indexing strategy. </font><font>“</font><font>Representative
sampling</font><font>”</font><font> is an indexing
</font><font>strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of </font><font>securities that collectively has an
investment profile similar to </font><font>that of an applicable underlying index. The securities selected are </font></div> </div> </div>
<div> <div><font>expected to have, in aggregate, investment
characteristics (based </font><font>on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), </font><font>fundamental
characteristics (such as return variability and yield) </font><font>and liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying </font><font>index. The Underlying ETF may or may not hold all of the </font><font>securities in the Underlying ETF’s Index, which may cause
the </font><font>performance of the Underlying ETF to diverge from that of the </font><font>Underlying ETF's Index. Representative
sampling may subject the </font><font>Underlying ETF to </font><font>“</font><font>tracking error</font><font>”</font><font>, which is the divergence of
the </font><font>Underlying ETF’s performance from that of the Underlying ETF’s </font><font>Index. This risk may be
heightened during times of increased </font><font>market volatility or other unusual market conditions. The </font><font>prospectus
and other reports of the Underlying ETF (Ticker: IVV) </font><font>are available on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s </font><font>website at </font><font>www.sec.gov</font><font>. Shares of the Underlying
ETF are listed </font><font>on NYSE Arca, Inc.</font></div> <div> <div><font>An options contract is an agreement between a buyer and seller </font><font>that gives the purchaser of the option the right but not
the </font><font>obligation to buy (in the case of a call option) or sell (in the case </font><font>of a put option) a particular
financial instrument at a specified </font><font>future date for an agreed upon price (commonly known as the
</font><font>“</font><font>strike price</font><font>”</font><font>). If the Fund purchases a call option, the Fund pays </font><font>a premium and receives the right, but not the obligation, to
</font><font>purchase shares of the Underlying ETF or other reference asset at </font><font>a strike price by or on the expiration
date. When the Fund </font><font>purchases a put option, the Fund pays a premium and receives </font><font>the right, but not the
obligation, to sell shares of the Underlying </font><font>ETF or other reference asset at a strike price by or on the
</font><font>expiration date. When the Fund writes (sells) a call option, the </font><font>Fund receives a premium and gives the
purchaser of the option </font><font>the right to purchase from the Fund shares of the Underlying ETF </font><font>or other reference
asset at a strike price by or on the expiration </font><font>date. If the Fund writes (sells) a put option, the Fund receives a </font><font>premium and gives the purchaser of the option the right to sell to </font><font>the Fund shares of the Underlying ETF or other
reference asset at </font><font>a strike price by or on expiration date.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>FLEX Options provide investors with the ability to customize key </font><font>option contract terms such as strike price, style and
expiration </font><font>date, while avoiding the counterparty risk exposure of over-the-counter</font><font> derivatives. Like
traditional exchange-traded options, </font><font>FLEX Options are guaranteed for settlement by the Options </font><font>Clearing
Corporation (the
</font><font>“</font><font>OCC</font><font>”</font><font>), a market clearinghouse that </font><font>guarantees performance by counterparties to certain derivatives </font><font>contracts by becoming the </font><font>“</font><font>buyer for every
seller and the seller </font><font>for every buyer</font><font>”</font><font>. The OCC may make adjustments to FLEX </font><font>Options for certain significant events. The FLEX Options in which </font><font>the Fund invests are European style, which are exercisable at the </font><font>strike price only on the expiration date. The FLEX
Options traded </font><font>by the Fund are listed on an exchange, including the Chicago </font><font>Board Options Exchange (</font><font>“</font><font>CBOE</font><font>”</font><font>).</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Options
positions are marked to market daily by the Fund. The </font><font>value of the FLEX Options in which the Fund invests is affected by </font><font>changes in the value and dividend rates of the securities held by </font><font>the Underlying ETF, changes in interest rates, changes
in the </font><font>actual or perceived volatility of the Underlying ETF’s Index and the </font><font>remaining time to such
options’ expiration, as well as trading </font><font>conditions in the options market. The Fund will typically trade
</font><font>options that expire at or around the end of each annual period or </font><font>“</font><font>Hedge Period</font><font>”</font><font> (July 1 through June 30),
subject to the annual </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div>

<div> <div><font>rebalancing process described below. The Fund
will be indefinitely </font><font>offered and is not intended to terminate after one or more Hedge </font><font>Periods.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>For each Hedge Period, the Fund obtains exposure to the share </font><font>price return of the Underlying ETF by purchasing shares of the </font><font>Underlying ETF and futures that reference the price
performance </font><font>of the Underlying ETF’s Index, and creates the Approximate Buffer </font><font>and Approximate Cap by
trading a combination of put and call </font><font>exchange-traded options. Specifically, the Fund typically creates </font><font>the
Approximate Buffer by buying a put option with the strike </font><font>price approximately at-the-money relative to the Underlying ETF’s </font><font>share price. The Fund simultaneously writes a call option with a </font><font>higher strike price relative to the Underlying
ETF’s share price to </font><font>collect a premium that it uses to offset the premium paid to buy </font><font>the put option.
The call subjects the Fund to the Approximate Cap </font><font>as it limits the Fund’s ability to realize any increase in the value of </font><font>the Underlying ETF above the strike price. The Approximate Cap </font><font>for each Hedge Period is based on the strike price of the
capped </font><font>call for that Hedge Period. The Fund's market value and Net Asset </font><font>Value (</font><font>“</font><font>NAV</font><font>”</font><font>) may not correlate with the Underlying ETF and </font><font>Underlying ETF's Index, especially during each Hedge Period. The </font><font>strike prices for the capped calls will change for each Hedge </font><font>Period depending on the prevailing market conditions and
the cost </font><font>of the put option for that Hedge Period, resulting in a different </font><font>Approximate Cap for each Hedge
Period.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Fund will typically buy Underlying ETF shares and futures
on </font><font>the Underlying ETF’s Index and seek to enter into the combination </font><font>of options transactions
described above if there are any inflows, </font><font>or creation transactions, during a Hedge Period. This will occur
</font><font>even in circumstances where the Fund would receive a negligible </font><font>premium for writing an out-of-the-money
call which may </font><font>potentially give up more sizable returns to the extent that the </font><font>option later becomes in the
money. Because the Fund will </font><font>effectively use distributions from the Underlying ETF to purchase </font><font>the downside
protection, the Fund’s performance is likely to be </font><font>less than the Underlying ETF’s performance when (1) distributions </font><font>are considered and (2) the Underlying ETF’s performance is </font><font>positive.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>In order to obtain economic exposure to the Underlying ETF, in </font><font>lieu of purchasing Underlying ETF shares and futures on the </font><font>Underlying ETF’s Index for a Hedge Period, the Fund
may instead, </font><font>among other things: purchase call options with a strike price that </font><font>is very low (approximately
1% or less) relative to the Underlying </font><font>ETF’s share price on the day of purchase (a </font><font>“</font><font>zero strike call</font><font>”</font><font>); </font><font>purchase one or more other ETFs that seek to track the </font><font>Underlying ETF’s Index; purchase equity securities (e.g.,

Underlying ETF; or invest in </font><font>U.S. treasuries, money market funds and/or other cash </font><font>equivalents and purchase
or sell a combination of call and put </font><font>options that seek to synthesize the economic characteristics of </font><font>the
Underlying ETF. If the Fund invests in equity securities (other </font><font>than the Underlying ETF), the Fund’s equity security investments </font><font>will be primarily in common stocks of companies held by the </font><font>Underlying ETF that BFA believes will provide a risk/ return
profile </font><font>similar to that of the Underlying ETF.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>For the current Hedge Period of July 1 through June 30, the </font><font>Approximate Cap is 111.14% prior to taking into account any
fees </font></div> </div> </div> <div> <div><font>or
expenses charged to or transaction costs incurred by the Fund or </font><font>Underlying ETF. When the Fund’s annualized management fee of </font><font>0.50% of the Fund’s average daily net assets is taken into </font><font>account, the Approximate Cap for the current Hedge
Period is </font><font>reduced to 110.64%. The returns that the Fund seeks to provide </font><font>also do not include the costs
associated with purchasing shares </font><font>of the Fund.</font></div> <div> <div><font>The Approximate Buffer that the Fund typically seeks to provide is </font><font>against approximately 100% of Underlying ETF losses
for the </font><font>applicable Hedge Period; however, there is no guarantee that the </font><font>Approximate Buffer will succeed in
providing the intended </font><font>protection. The Approximate Buffer is provided prior to taking into </font><font>account any fees
or expenses charged to the Fund. These fees </font><font>and any expenses will reduce the Approximate Buffer amount for
</font><font>Fund shareholders for a Hedge Period. When the Fund’s annual </font><font>management fee equal to 0.50% of the
Fund’s daily net assets is </font><font>taken into account for a Hedge Period, the net Approximate Buffer </font><font>for the
Hedge Period is 99.5%. While the Fund typically seeks to </font><font>provide against approximately 100% of Underlying ETF losses for </font><font>the applicable Hedge Period and will maximize the Approximate </font><font>Buffer, the Fund will reduce the Approximate Buffer,
including </font><font>below 100%, to provide an Approximate Cap of at least 2%. For </font><font>example, if interest rates are low
enough that providing against </font><font>approximately 100% of Underlying ETF losses would result in an </font><font>Approximate
Cap of less than 2%, the Fund would decrease the </font><font>protection such that the Approximate Cap is at least 2%.
</font><font>Information on the Approximate Cap and Approximate Buffer will </font><font>be provided shortly before each Hedge
Period.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Approximate Buffer and Approximate Cap
for a Hedge </font><font>Period only apply to Fund shares held over the entire Hedge
</font><font>Period.</font><font> An investor that purchases Fund shares after the </font><font>beginning of the Hedge Period, or sells Fund shares before the </font><font>end of a Hedge Period, may not fully realize the
Approximate </font><font>Buffer or Approximate Cap for the Hedge Period and may be </font><font>exposed to greater risk of loss and
less potential gain. This is </font><font>because while the Approximate Cap and Approximate Buffer for </font><font>the Hedge Period
are fixed levels that are calculated in relation to </font><font>the Underlying ETF price and the Fund's NAV at the start of each </font><font>Hedge Period and generally remain constant throughout the </font><font>Hedge Period, an investor purchasing Fund shares at market
price </font><font>during the Hedge Period likely purchased Fund shares at a price </font><font>that is different from the Fund's NAV
at the start of the Hedge </font><font>Period (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the NAV that the Approximate Cap and Approximate </font><font>Buffer reference). For example, if an investor purchases Fund </font><font>shares during a Hedge Period at a time when the Underlying ETF’s </font><font>share price has increased from its price at the
beginning of the </font><font>Hedge Period, the investor’s upside limit may be lower than the </font><font>Approximate Cap and
the investor may experience losses prior to </font><font>reaching the downside protection offered by the Approximate
</font><font>Buffer. Conversely, if an investor purchases Fund shares during a </font><font>Hedge Period at a time when the
Underlying ETF’s share price has </font><font>decreased from its price at the beginning of the Hedge Period, the
</font><font>Fund may require a larger increase in the Underlying ETF’s share </font><font>price before it reaches the
Approximate Cap. The Approximate </font><font>Cap and Approximate Buffer, and the Fund’s position relative to
</font><font>each, which are typically available on iShares.com daily, should be </font><font>considered before investing in the
Fund.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In periods of extreme market volatility, the Fund’s return
may be </font><font>subject to an upside limit significantly below the Approximate Cap </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>and downside protection significantly lower
than the Approximate </font><font>Buffer. An investor may lose their entire investment and an </font><font>investment in the Fund is
only appropriate for investors willing to </font><font>bear those losses.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Following the close of business on the last day of each Hedge </font><font>Period, the Fund will file a prospectus supplement that
discloses </font><font>the Fund’s Approximate Cap (gross and net of the unitary </font><font>management fee) for the next Hedge
Period. The Fund’s </font><font>Approximate Cap (net of the unitary management fee) for the </font><font>current Hedge Period,
along with Fund’s position relative to the </font><font>Approximate Buffer and Approximate Cap, will be available on the </font><font>Fund’s website,

<div><font>The Fund is classified as non-diversified under the Investment </font><font>Company Act of 1940,
as amended (the </font><font>“</font><font>1940
Act</font><font>”</font><font>).</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Summary of Principal Risks</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your </font><font>investment in the Fund,
and the Fund's performance could trail </font><font>that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain
</font><font>risks</font><font> </font><font>(either
 directly or through its investments in the Underlying </font><font>Fund), including the principal risks noted below, any of which may </font><font>adversely affect the Fund's NAV , trading price, yield, total return </font><font>and ability to meet its investment objective.
Certain key risks are </font><font>prioritized below (with others following in alphabetical order), but </font><font>the relative
significance of any risk is difficult to predict and may </font><font>change over time. You should review each risk factor carefully.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Buffered Loss Risk.</font><font> There can be no guarantee that the Fund will </font><font>be successful in its strategy to provide downside protection </font><font>against Underlying ETF losses. The Fund does not provide </font><font>principal protection or non-principal protection, and, despite
the </font><font>Approximate Buffer, an investor may experience significant losses </font><font>on their investment, including the
loss of their entire investment. </font><font>In the event an investor purchases Fund shares after a Hedge </font><font>Period begins
or sells Fund shares prior to the end of the Hedge </font><font>Period, the Approximate Buffer that the Fund seeks to provide </font><font>may not be available. In periods of extreme market volatility, the </font><font>Fund’s return may be subject to downside
protection significantly </font><font>lower than the Approximate Buffer.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Capped Upside Return Risk.</font><font> The Fund’s strategy seeks to </font><font>provide returns that are subject to an Approximate Cap. The </font><font>Approximate Cap represents an approximate maximum </font><font>percentage return that an investor can achieve from an </font><font>investment in the Fund held over an entire Hedge Period. In the
</font><font>event that the Underlying ETF experiences gains in excess of the </font><font>upside limit to which the Fund is subject
as a result of the capped </font><font>call for a Hedge Period, the Fund will not participate in those gains </font><font>beyond the
upside limit. In the event an investor purchases Fund </font><font>shares after a Hedge Period begins or sells Fund shares prior to </font><font>the end of the Hedge Period, there may be little or no ability for </font><font>that investor to experience an investment gain on
their Fund </font><font>shares. In periods of extreme market volatility, the Fund’s return </font><font>may be subject to an
upside limit significantly below the </font><font>Approximate Cap.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>FLEX Options Risk.</font><font> In addition to counterparty risk, FLEX Options </font><font>are subject to the risk that they may be less liquid than certain </font><font>other securities, such as standardized options. In
less liquid </font><font>markets for the FLEX Options, terminating the FLEX Options may </font></div> </div> </div>
<div> <div><font>require the payment of a premium or
acceptance of a discounted </font><font>price and may take longer to complete. In a less liquid market for </font><font>the FLEX
Options, the liquidation of a large number of options </font><font>may significantly impact the price of the options and may </font><font>adversely impact the value of your investment. Additionally, to the </font><font>extent market participants are not willing or able
to enter into </font><font>FLEX Option transactions with the Fund at prices that reflect the </font><font>market price of the Fund
shares, the Fund’s NAV and, in turn the </font><font>share price of the Fund, could be negatively impacted.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>The FLEX Options held by the Fund will be exercisable at the </font><font>strike price only on their expiration date. As an in-the-money FLEX </font><font>Option approaches its expiration date, its value
typically will </font><font>increasingly move with the value of the Underlying ETF. However, </font><font>the value of the FLEX
Options prior to the expiration date may </font><font>vary because of related factors other than the value of the
</font><font>Underlying ETF. The value of the FLEX Options will be determined </font><font>based upon market quotations or using
other recognized pricing </font><font>methods. Factors that may influence the value of the FLEX </font><font>Options generally
include interest rate changes, dividends, the </font><font>actual and implied volatility levels of the Underlying ETF’s share </font><font>price, and the remaining time until the FLEX Options expire, </font><font>among others. The value of the FLEX Options held by the
Fund </font><font>typically do not increase or decrease at the same rate as the </font><font>Underlying ETF’s share price on a
day-to-day basis due to these </font><font>factors (although they generally move in the same direction), and, </font><font>as a
result, the Fund’s NAV may not increase or decrease at the </font><font>same rate as the Underlying ETF’s share price.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the U.S</font><font>.</font><font> Investing in U.S. issuers subjects </font><font>the Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, and </font><font>economic risks that are specific to the U.S. Certain
changes in the </font><font>U.S., such as a weakening of the U.S. economy or a decline in its </font><font>financial markets, may
have an adverse effect on U.S. issuers.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Market Risk</font><font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due </font><font>to short-term market movements and over longer periods during </font><font>more prolonged market downturns. Local, regional or global </font><font>events such as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or other
public </font><font>health issues, recessions, the prospect or occurrence of a </font><font>sovereign default or other financial
crisis, or other events could </font><font>have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments and </font><font>could
result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s </font><font>NAV.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Affiliated Fund Risk.</font><font> In managing the Fund, BFA
has the ability to </font><font>select Underlying Funds and substitute Underlying Funds with </font><font>other ETFs that it believes
will achieve the Fund’s objective. BFA </font><font>may be subject to potential conflicts of interest in selecting
</font><font>Underlying Funds and substituting Underlying Funds with other </font><font>ETFs because the fees paid to BFA by some
Underlying Funds and </font><font>other ETFs managed by BFA may be higher than the fees paid by </font><font>other Underlying
Funds.</font><font> </font><font>This risk may be reduced to the extent </font><font>BFA has agreed to waive Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses with </font><font>respect to the Underlying Fund. If an Underlying Fund or
other ETF </font><font>holds interests in an affiliated fund in excess of a certain amount, </font><font>the Fund may be prohibited
from purchasing shares of that </font><font>Underlying Fund or other ETF.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Approximate Buffer and Approximate Cap Change Risk.</font><font> The </font><font>Approximate Buffer and Approximate Cap are dependent on </font><font>prevailing market conditions (</font><font>e.g.</font><font> volatility, interest rates,
</font><font>dividends, and other factors). As such, the Approximate Buffer </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>and Approximate Cap may rise or fall from one
Hedge Period to </font><font>the next, sometimes to a significant extent, and are unlikely to </font><font>remain the same for
consecutive Hedge Periods.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Asset Class
Risk.</font><font> The securities and other assets in the Fund’s </font><font>portfolio may underperform in comparison to
financial markets </font><font>generally, a particular financial market, an index, or other asset </font><font>classes.</font></div>
</div> <div> <div><font>Assets Under Management (AUM) Risk</font><font>.</font><font> From time to time, an
</font><font>Authorized Participant (as defined below in </font><font>Authorized Participant </font><font>Concentration Risk</font><font>), a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser, an </font><font>affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or another fund may invest in the </font><font>Fund and hold its investment for a specific
period of time to allow </font><font>the Fund to achieve size or scale. There can be no assurance that </font><font>any such entity
would not redeem its investment or that the size </font><font>of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could
</font><font>negatively impact the Fund.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.</font><font>  An </font><font>“</font><font>Authorized </font><font>Participant</font><font>”</font><font> is a member or participant of a clearing agency </font><font>registered with the SEC, which has a written agreement with the </font><font>Fund or one of its service providers that allows the
Authorized </font><font>Participant to place orders for the purchase and redemption of </font><font>creation units (</font><font>“</font><font>Creation Units</font><font>”</font><font>). Only an Authorized Participant </font><font>may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with </font><font>the Fund. There are a limited number of institutions that may act </font><font>as Authorized Participants for the Fund, including on
an agency </font><font>basis on behalf of other market participants. No Authorized </font><font>Participant is obligated to engage in
creation or redemption </font><font>transactions. To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the </font><font>business or do not
place creation or redemption orders for the </font><font>Fund and no other Authorized Participant places orders, Fund
</font><font>shares are more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV </font><font>and possibly face trading halts or
delisting.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Clearing Member Default
Risk.</font><font> Transactions in some types of </font><font>derivatives, including FLEX Options and futures, are required to be
</font><font>centrally cleared (</font><font>“</font><font>cleared
derivatives</font><font>”</font><font>). In a transaction involving </font><font>cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house, </font><font>such as the OCC, rather than a bank or broker.
Since the Fund is </font><font>not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing </font><font>house (</font><font>“</font><font>clearing members</font><font>”</font><font>) can participate directly in the clearing </font><font>house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at </font><font>clearing members. In cleared derivatives positions, the Fund will </font><font>make payments (including margin payments) to and
receive </font><font>payments from a clearing house through their accounts at </font><font>clearing members. Customer funds held at a
clearing organization </font><font>in connection with any options contracts are held in a </font><font>commingled omnibus account and
are not identified to the name </font><font>of the clearing member’s individual customers. As a result, assets
</font><font>deposited by the Fund with any clearing member as margin for </font><font>FLEX Options or futures may, in certain
circumstances, be used to </font><font>satisfy losses of other clients of the Fund’s clearing member. In </font><font>addition,
although clearing members guarantee performance of </font><font>their clients’ obligations to the Underlying ETF, the Fund's or the </font><font>Underlying ETF's clearing house, there is a risk that the assets of </font><font>the Fund might not be fully protected in the event
of the clearing </font><font>member’s bankruptcy, as the Fund would be limited to recovering </font><font>only a pro rata share
of all available funds segregated on behalf of </font><font>the clearing member’s customers for the relevant account class. </font><font>The Fund is also subject to the risk that a limited number of </font></div> </div> </div> <div>
<div><font>clearing members are willing to transact on the Fund’s behalf, </font><font>which heightens the risks associated with a clearing member’s </font><font>default. If a clearing member defaults, the Fund
could lose some </font><font>or all of the benefits of a transaction entered into by the Fund with </font><font>the clearing member.
If the Fund cannot find a clearing member to </font><font>transact with on the Fund’s behalf, the Fund may be unable to </font><font>effectively implement its investment strategy.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Concentration Risk.</font><font> The Fund may be susceptible to an </font><font>increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that </font><font>affect the Fund’s investments more than the
market as a whole, </font><font>to the extent that the Fund’s investments are concentrated in the </font><font>securities or
other assets of one or more issuers, countries or </font><font>other geographic units, markets, industries, project types, or </font><font>asset classes.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Counterparty Risk.</font><font> Derivatives are subject to counterparty risk, </font><font>which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will be </font><font>unable or unwilling to fulfill its contractual
obligation, and the </font><font>related risks of having concentrated exposure to such a </font><font>counterparty. The OCC acts as
guarantor and central counterparty </font><font>with respect to the FLEX Options. As a result, the ability of the </font><font>Fund
to meet its objective depends on the OCC being able to </font><font>meet its obligations. In the unlikely event that the OCC becomes </font><font>insolvent or is otherwise unable to meet its settlement </font><font>obligations, the Fund could suffer significant
losses.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Cybersecurity Risk</font><font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic </font><font>systems of the Fund, its adviser, distributor, other service </font><font>providers, counterparties, or issuers of assets in which
the Fund </font><font>invests may cause disruptions that negatively impact the Fund </font><font>and its shareholders. While the Fund
has established business </font><font>continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to </font><font>address system breaches or
failures, there are inherent </font><font>limitations in such plans and systems. The Fund cannot control </font><font>the
cybersecurity plans and systems of its service providers, </font><font>counterparties, and other third parties whose activities affect the </font><font>Fund.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Derivatives Risk. </font><font>The Fund’s use of derivatives may reduce the </font><font>Fund’s returns or increase volatility. Volatility is defined as the </font><font>characteristic of a security, an index or a
market to fluctuate </font><font>significantly in price within a short time period. Derivatives may </font><font>also be subject to
counterparty risk, which is the risk that the </font><font>other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual
</font><font>obligation. A risk of the Fund’s use of derivatives is that the </font><font>fluctuations in their values may not
correlate perfectly with the </font><font>value of the underlying asset, the performance of the asset class </font><font>to which the
Fund seeks exposure or to the performance of the </font><font>overall</font><font> </font><font>securities markets. The possible lack of a liquid secondary </font><font>market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the
Fund to sell </font><font>or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund to </font><font>losses and could make
derivatives more difficult for the Fund to </font><font>value accurately. The Fund could also suffer losses related to its
</font><font>derivatives positions as a result of unanticipated market </font><font>movements, which losses are potentially
unlimited. Certain </font><font>derivatives may give rise to a form of leverage and may expose </font><font>the Fund to greater risk
and increase its costs. To the extent that </font><font>the Fund invests in rolling futures contracts, it may be subject to </font><font>additional risk. The impact of U.S. and global regulation of </font><font>derivatives may make derivatives more costly, may limit the
</font><font>availability of derivatives, may delay or restrict the exercise by the </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Fund of termination rights or remedies upon a
counterparty </font><font>default under derivatives held by the Fund (which could result in </font><font>losses), or may otherwise
adversely affect the value or </font><font>performance of derivatives. In addition, the Fund's use of </font><font>derivatives may
expose the Fund to risks related to potential </font><font>operational issues, such as documentation and settlement issues, </font><font>systems failures, inadequate controls and human error. </font><font>Derivatives may also involve legal risks, including insufficient
</font><font>documentation, insufficient capacity or authority of a </font><font>counterparty, and legality and enforceability of a
contract.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Equity Securities Risk</font><font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes </font><font>in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other </font><font>asset classes. The value of a security may decline
for a number of </font><font>reasons that may directly relate to the issuer as well as due to </font><font>general industry or market
conditions. Common stock is </font><font>subordinated to preferred securities and debt in a company’s </font><font>capital
structure. Common stock has the lowest priority, and the </font><font>greatest risk, with respect to dividends and any liquidation </font><font>payments in the event of an issuer’s bankruptcy.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Futures Contract Risk.</font><font> Futures are standardized, exchange-traded</font><font> contracts that obligate a purchaser to take delivery, and a </font><font>seller to make delivery, of a specific amount of an asset
at a </font><font>specified future date at a specified price. Unlike equities, which </font><font>typically entitle the holder to a
continuing ownership stake in an </font><font>issuer, futures contracts normally specify a certain date for </font><font>settlement
in cash based on the level of the reference rate. The </font><font>primary risks associated with the use of futures contracts are: (i) </font><font>the imperfect correlation between the change in market value of </font><font>the instruments held by the Fund and the price of the
futures </font><font>contract; (ii) possible lack of a liquid secondary market for a </font><font>futures contract and the resulting
inability to close a futures </font><font>contract when desired; (iii) losses caused by unanticipated market </font><font>movements,
which are potentially unlimited; (iv) BFA’s inability to </font><font>predict correctly the direction of prices and other economic </font><font>factors; and (v) the possibility that the counterparty will default in </font><font>the performance of its obligations.</font></div>
</div> <div> <div><font>Hedge Period Risk.</font><font>The Approximate Buffer and Approximate Cap </font><font>for a Hedge Period apply to Fund shares held over the entire </font><font>Hedge Period. In the event an investor purchases Fund shares </font><font>after a Hedge Period begins or sells Fund shares prior to
the end </font><font>of the Hedge Period, the returns realized by the investor will not </font><font>match those that the Fund seeks
to provide.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Investment in the
Underlying Fund Risk.</font><font> The Fund invests </font><font>substantially all of its assets in</font><font> </font><font>the Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s </font><font>investment performance is related to the performance of the </font><font>Underlying Fund. The Fund’s NAV will change with
changes in the </font><font>value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which the </font><font>Fund invests based on their
market valuations. An investment in </font><font>the Fund will entail more costs and expenses than a direct </font><font>investment
in the Underlying Fund.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Investment
Objective Risk.</font><font> Certain circumstances under which </font><font>the Fund might not achieve its objective include, but are
not </font><font>limited, to (i) if the Fund disposes of exchange-traded options, (ii) </font><font>if the Fund is unable to maintain
the proportional relationship </font><font>based on the number of exchange-traded options in the Fund’s </font><font>portfolio,
(iii) significant accrual of Fund expenses in connection </font><font>with effecting the Fund’s principal investment strategy or (iv) </font><font>adverse tax law changes affecting the treatment of FLEX Options.</font></div> </div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Issuer
Risk</font><font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the </font><font>performance of individual securities or other assets to which the </font><font>Fund has exposure. The value of securities or other
assets may </font><font>decline, or perform differently from the market as a whole, due to </font><font>changes in the financial
condition or credit rating of the issuer or </font><font>counterparty.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.</font><font> Large-capitalization </font><font>companies may be less able than smaller-capitalization </font><font>companies to adapt to changing market conditions and </font><font>competitive challenges. Large-capitalization companies may be </font><font>more mature and subject to more limited growth potential
</font><font>compared with smaller-capitalization companies. The </font><font>performance of large-capitalization companies could
trail the </font><font>overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Large Shareholder and Large-Scale Redemption Risk.</font><font>
Certain </font><font>shareholders of the Fund, including an Authorized Participant, a </font><font>third-party investor, the
Fund’s adviser, an affiliate of the Fund’s </font><font>adviser, a market maker, or another entity, may from time to time </font><font>own or manage a substantial amount of Fund shares, or may hold </font><font>their investment in the Fund for a limited period of
time. There can </font><font>be no assurance that any large shareholder or large group of </font><font>shareholders would not redeem
their investment. Redemptions of </font><font>a large number of Fund shares could require the Fund to dispose </font><font>of assets
to meet the redemption requests, which can accelerate </font><font>the realization of taxable income and/or capital gains and cause </font><font>the Fund to make taxable distributions to its shareholders earlier </font><font>than the Fund otherwise would have. In addition,
under certain </font><font>circumstances, non-redeeming shareholders may be treated as </font><font>receiving a disproportionately
large taxable distribution during or </font><font>with respect to such year. In some circumstances, the Fund may </font><font>hold a
relatively large proportion of its assets in cash in </font><font>anticipation of large redemptions, diluting its investment returns. </font><font>These large redemptions may also force the Fund to sell portfolio </font><font>securities or other assets when it might not otherwise
do so, </font><font>which may negatively impact the Fund’s NAV, increase the Fund’s </font><font>brokerage costs and/or
have a material effect on the market </font><font>price of Fund shares.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Management Risk.</font><font> The Fund is subject to management risk, </font><font>which is the risk that the investment process, techniques and risk </font><font>analyses applied by BFA will not produce the desired
results, and </font><font>that securities selected by BFA may underperform the market or </font><font>any relevant benchmark. In
addition, legislative, regulatory, or tax </font><font>developments may affect the investment techniques available to
</font><font>BFA in connection with managing the Fund and may also </font><font>adversely affect the ability of the Fund to achieve
its investment </font><font>objective.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Market Trading Risk</font><font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading </font><font>risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund </font><font>shares (including through a trading halt), losses from trading in </font><font>secondary markets, periods of high volatility, and
disruptions in </font><font>the process of creating and redeeming Fund shares. Any of these </font><font>factors, among others, may
lead to the Fund’s shares trading in </font><font>the secondary market at a premium or discount to NAV or to the
</font><font>intraday value of the Fund’s portfolio holdings. If you buy Fund </font><font>shares at a time when the market
price is at a premium to NAV or </font><font>sell Fund shares at a time when the market price is at a discount </font><font>to NAV,
you may pay significantly more or receive significantly </font><font>less than the underlying value of the Fund shares.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>
<div><font>Non-Diversification Risk</font><font>.</font><font> The Fund is classified as
</font><font>“</font><font>non-diversified.</font><font>”</font>
<font> This means that, compared with funds that are </font><font>classified as </font><font>“</font><font>diversified,</font><font>”</font><font> the Fund may invest a greater </font><font>percentage of its assets in securities or other instruments </font><font>representing a small number of issuers or counterparties and thus </font><font>may be more susceptible to the risks associated with
these </font><font>particular issuers or counterparties. As a result, the Fund's </font><font>performance may depend to a greater
extent on the performance </font><font>of a small number of issuers or counterparties, which may lead to </font><font>more volatility
in the Fund’s NAV.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Operational
Risk</font><font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising </font><font>from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human </font><font>error, processing and communication errors, errors of the
Fund’s </font><font>service providers, counterparties or other third parties, failed or </font><font>inadequate processes and
technology or systems failures. The </font><font>Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through </font><font>controls
and procedures. However, these measures do not </font><font>address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address
</font><font>significant operational risks.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Options Risk.</font><font>Investments in options are considered speculative. </font><font>When the Fund purchases an option, it may lose the total </font><font>premium paid for it if the price of the underlying security or
other </font><font>assets decreased, remained the same or failed to increase to a </font><font>level at or beyond the exercise price
(in the case of a call option) </font><font>or increased, remained the same or failed to decrease to a level at </font><font>or below
the exercise price (in the case of a put option). If a put or </font><font>call option purchased by the Fund were permitted to expire </font><font>without being sold or exercised, its premium would represent a </font><font>loss to the Fund. To the extent that the Fund writes or
sells an </font><font>option, if the decline or increase in the underlying asset is </font><font>significantly below or above the
exercise price of the written </font><font>option, the Fund could experience a substantial loss.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries</font><font>. </font><font>The Fund’s and the
</font><font>Underlying Fund's investment in developed country issuers will </font><font>subject the Fund to legal, regulatory,
political, currency, security, </font><font>economic and other risks associated with developed countries. </font><font>Developed
countries tend to represent a significant portion of the </font><font>global economy and have generally experienced slower economic </font><font>growth than some less developed countries. Certain developed </font><font>countries have experienced security concerns, such as war,
</font><font>terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents involving </font><font>a country’s or region’s
security may cause uncertainty in its </font><font>markets and may adversely affect its economy and the Fund’s or
</font><font>the Underlying Fund's investments. In addition, developed </font><font>countries may be adversely impacted by changes to
the economic </font><font>conditions of certain key trading partners, regulatory burdens, </font><font>debt burdens and the price or
availability of certain commodities.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Securities Lending Risk. </font><font>The Fund may engage in
securities </font><font>lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may </font><font>lose money because the borrower
of the loaned securities fails to </font><font>return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund could </font><font>also
lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral </font><font>provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any </font><font>investments made with cash collateral. These events could also </font><font>trigger adverse tax consequences for the
Fund.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Small Fund Risk. </font><font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may </font><font>experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In </font><font>addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if it does not </font></div> </div> </div> <div>
<div><font>meet certain requirements set by the listing exchange. Any
</font><font>resulting liquidation of the Fund could lead to elevated transaction </font><font>costs for the Fund and negative tax
consequences for its </font><font>shareholders.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Tax Risk.</font><font>The Fund intends to elect and to qualify each year to be </font><font>treated as a regulated investment company
(</font><font>“</font><font>RIC</font><font>”</font><font>) under </font><font>Subchapter M of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as </font><font>amended (the </font><font>“</font><font>Internal Revenue Code</font><font>”</font><font>). As a RIC, the Fund will </font><font>not be subject
to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of its net </font><font>investment income and net capital gain that it distributes to </font><font>shareholders, provided that it satisfies certain requirements of the </font><font>Internal Revenue Code. However, the federal income
tax </font><font>treatment of certain aspects of the proposed operations of the </font><font>Fund are not entirely clear. This
includes the tax aspects of the </font><font>Fund’s options strategy, its hedging strategy, the possible
</font><font>application of the
</font><font>“</font><font>straddle</font><font>”</font><font> rules, and various loss limitation </font><font>provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify and maintain </font><font>its status as a RIC, the Fund must meet certain income, </font><font>diversification and distributions tests. For purposes of the
</font><font>diversification test, the identification of the issuer (or, in some </font><font>cases, issuers) of a particular Fund
investment can depend on the </font><font>terms and conditions of that investment. In particular, there is no </font><font>published
Internal Revenue Service guidance or case law on how </font><font>to determine the </font><font>“</font><font>issuer</font><font>”</font><font> of certain derivatives that the
Fund will </font><font>enter into. Based upon the language in the legislative history, the </font><font>Fund intends to treat the
issuer of the FLEX Options as the </font><font>referenced asset, which, assuming the referenced asset qualifies </font><font>as a
RIC, would allow the Fund to count the FLEX Options as </font><font>automatically diversified investments under the RIC diversification </font><font>requirements. The Fund intends to treat any income it may derive </font><font>from the FLEX Options as </font><font>“</font><font>qualifying income</font><font>”</font><font> under the </font><font>provisions of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to RICs. If the </font><font>income is not qualifying income or the issuer of the FLEX Options </font><font>is not appropriately the referenced asset, the Fund
may not </font><font>qualify, or may be disqualified, as a RIC. If the Fund does not </font><font>qualify as a RIC for any taxable
year and certain relief provisions </font><font>are not available, the Fund’s taxable income will be subject to tax
</font><font>at the Fund level and to a further tax at the shareholder level </font><font>when such income is
distributed.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Technology Companies
Risk</font><font>.</font><font> Technology companies and </font><font>companies that rely heavily on technological advances may have </font><font>limited product lines, markets, financial resources,
supply chains </font><font>and personnel. These companies typically face intense </font><font>competition, potentially rapid product
obsolescence and changes </font><font>in product cycles and customer preferences. They may face </font><font>unexpected risks and
costs associated with technological </font><font>developments, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning.
</font><font>Technology companies also depend heavily on intellectual </font><font>property rights and may be adversely affected by
the loss or </font><font>impairment of those rights. Technology companies may face </font><font>increased government scrutiny and may
be subject to adverse </font><font>government or legal action.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Upside Participation Risk</font><font>. </font><font>There can be no guarantee that the </font><font>Fund will be successful in its strategy to match the increase, if </font><font>any, of the share price return of the Underlying ETF over a Hedge </font><font>Period, subject to an Approximate Cap. In the event an
investor </font><font>purchases Fund shares after the beginning of a Hedge Period or </font><font>does not stay invested in the Fund
for the entirety of the Hedge </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div>

<div> <div><font>Period, the returns realized by the investor
may not match those </font><font>that the Fund seeks to achieve.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Valuation Risk</font><font>.</font><font> The price that the Fund could receive upon the </font><font>sale (or other disposition) of a security or other asset may differ
</font><font>from the Fund’s valuation of the security or other asset, </font><font>particularly for securities or other assets
that trade in low volume </font><font>or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value </font><font>methodology. In
addition, the value of the securities or other </font><font>assets in the Fund’s portfolio may change on days or during time </font><font>periods when investors are not able to purchase or sell Fund </font><font>shares. Authorized Participants that create or redeem Fund
</font><font>shares on days when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities or </font><font>other assets may receive fewer or more
shares, or lower or higher </font></div> </div> </div> <div> <div><font>redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the </font><font>securities or other assets not been fair valued or been
valued </font><font>using a different methodology. The ability to value investments </font><font>may be impacted by technological
issues or errors by pricing </font><font>services or other third-party service providers.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>Performance Information</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>As of the date of the Prospectus, the Fund has not commenced </font><font>operations and therefore

<div> <div><font>Management</font></div>
<div> <div><font>Investment Adviser.</font><font> BlackRock Fund Advisors.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Portfolio Managers.</font><font> Jennifer Hsui, Greg Savage and Paul </font><font>Whitehead (the </font><font>“</font><font>Portfolio Managers</font><font>”</font><font>) are primarily responsible for </font><font>the
day-to-day management of the Fund. Each Portfolio Manager </font><font>supervises a portfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr. Savage </font><font>and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio Managers of the Fund </font><font>since inception (2024).</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only be </font><font>bought and sold in the secondary market through a broker-dealer. </font><font>Because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than
at NAV, </font><font>shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less </font><font>than NAV (a discount). An investor
may incur costs attributable to </font><font>the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay </font><font>to
purchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller </font><font>is willing to accept for shares of the Fund (ask) when buying or </font><font>selling shares in the secondary market (the
</font><font>“</font><font>bid-ask spread</font><font>”</font><font>).</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Tax Information</font></div> <div>
<div><font>The Fund intends to make distributions that may be taxable to you </font><font>as ordinary income
or capital gains, unless you are investing </font><font>through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an
</font><font>individual retirement account
(</font><font>“</font><font>IRA</font><font>”</font><font>), in which case, your </font><font>distributions generally will be taxed when withdrawn.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial </font><font>Intermediaries</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>If you purchase shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer or </font><font>other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or
other related </font><font>companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and </font><font>presentations, educational
training programs, conferences, the </font><font>development of technology platforms and reporting systems or </font><font>other
services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These </font><font>payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the </font><font>broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to </font><font>recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your </font><font>salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more </font><font>information.</font></div> </div> </div>
