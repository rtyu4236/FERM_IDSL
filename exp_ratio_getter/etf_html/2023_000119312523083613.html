<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund
may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are
held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance.</font></div>
<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the
Morningstar Global Emerging Green Technologies Select Index (the “Underlying Index”), which measures the performance of equity securities issued by U.S. and non-U.S. companies involved in breakthrough innovations and new technologies
that seek to address or combat climate change, as determined by Morningstar or its affiliates (“Morningstar” or the “Index Provider”). </div>
<div>To construct the Underlying Index, the Index Provider begins
with securities from the Morningstar Global Markets ex India Index (the “Parent Index”) and applies a number of exclusions. The Index Provider excludes constituents with an average three-month trailing daily trading volume of less than
$2 million or a free float market capitalization of less than $300 million. The Index Provider also excludes the securities of companies that it identifies as being involved in the business of tobacco, companies involved with controversial weapons,
producers and retailers of civilian firearms, and companies involved in thermal coal mining, thermal coal-based power generation or the extraction of oil</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>sands. Certain exclusions (<font>e.g.,
</font>controversial and nuclear weapons or the production of tobacco products) are categorical, and other exclusions are based on percentage of revenue or ownership thresholds. Additionally, the Index Provider excludes companies that it determines
are involved in controversies related to the ten United Nations Global Compact (“UNGC”) principles, which are classified into four categories: human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption, as well as companies for which a third
party data provider, Sustainalytics, has assigned a controversy score of 5 (indicating the company experienced an event with a severe impact on the environment and society), or for which the Index Provider has not assigned a controversy score. The
Index Provider will apply a series of revenue screens on the resulting eligible constituents. </div>
<div>First, Morningstar equity analysts evaluate each
company’s revenue that is derived from “sustainable products,” as calculated by the Index Provider. Sustainable products could include the distribution and management of energy efficient materials or products, or pollution
remediation services. The Index Provider determines whether a company has sustainable product revenue by breaking down the companywide revenue into the following eight sustainable themes: Energy Efficiency, Green Buildings, Green Transportation,
Pollution Prevention &amp; Reduction, Renewable Energy, Resource Efficiency Technologies &amp; Services, Sustainable Agriculture, Food &amp; Forestry, and Water. The Index Provider applies the first revenue screen, excluding companies with a total
sustainable product revenue of less than 25% from the Underlying Index.</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-2</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div>
<p>
<hr size="3"/> <div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Following the first revenue screen, Morningstar equity analysts research the
products or services identified within the eight sustainable themes to determine whether the products or services fall within the following categories, as defined by Morningstar: “green technologies”, “green services” or
“sustainability certified.” Green technologies are products and services that are highly innovative toward sustainability. Green services are services which rely on innovative technologies developed by other companies. Sustainability
certified means that an industry regulator or other third party has certified the product or service as sustainable or has certified the elements within the supply chain of the product or service as sustainable. Morningstar equity analysts consider
various metrics to make this determination (<font>e.g</font>., research and development as a percentage of revenue and company-level patent application data). Morningstar excludes all revenue tied to products and services
classified as “green services” or “sustainability certified.” Morningstar reviews the green technologies and assess whether each qualifies as an “emerging green technology.”</div>
<div>The products and services classified as “green
technologies” are assessed by Morningstar equity analysts and distributed within the Rogers Innovation Adoption Curve (“Adoption Curve”). The Adoption Curve is a theory created by Professor Everett Rogers that explains the rate at
which the population adopts a new product, service, or technology over time, and which labels each product or service as one of five adoption stages: Innovators, Early Adopters, Early Majority, Late Majority, and Laggards. Morningstar assesses
a</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>product or service’s total addressable market and current market share
to determine the adoption stage. Morningstar Equity Research classifies the products and services that are labeled Innovators, Early Adopters, and Early Majority as “emerging green technologies”. Once Morningstar identifies the emerging
green technologies, Morningstar applies a second revenue screen: companies with 25% or more of their revenue represented by emerging green technologies are eligible for inclusion in the Underlying Index. </div>
<div>Following the second revenue screen, the resulting constituents
receive an innovation score based on their products’ and/or services’ adoption stage, as follows:</div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td> Innovation Score of 1: Early
Majority </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td> Innovation Score of 2: Early
Adopters </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td> Innovation Score of 3:
Innovators </td></tr></table> </div> <div>The Index Provider
calculates a company-level aggregate score by multiplying the company’s revenue percentage of each product and/or service identified as an emerging green technology within each of the eight sustainable themes, and the product and/or
service’s innovation score, creating a “product score”. Each product score is summed across the company’s products and/or services, resulting in the company’s aggregate score. For example, suppose Morningstar analyzed
Company A’s products and services across the eight sustainable themes, and found that 71.7% of Company A’s revenue is allocated to the Energy Efficiency theme from Product X, and 28.3% of its revenue is allocated to the Green
Transportation theme from Product Y. Morningstar has determined both products are emerging green</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-3</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div>
<p>
<hr size="3"/> <div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>technologies and that Product X is an “innovator” on the Adoption
Curve, earning an innovation score of 3, and Product Y is an “early adopter,” earning an innovation score of 2. Each products’ revenues are multiplied by their respective innovation scores to determine their product scores. Product
X’s resulting product score is 2.15 (71.7% times 3), and Product Y’s resulting product score is 0.57 (28.3% times 2). Company A’s resulting aggregate score is 2.72, resulting in a Tier 1 designation. </div>
<div>Once Morningstar calculates each constituent’s aggregate
score, Morningstar designates each constituent as either Tier 1 or Tier 2 based on their aggregate score. Tier 1 issuers are those with an aggregate score of 1.5 or higher. Tier 2 issuers are those with an aggregate score of less than 1.5. All Tier
1 constituents are selected for the Underlying Index. Morningstar ranks Tier 2 issuers with preference given to issuers with a higher aggregate score over a lower aggregate score, then a smaller market capitalization over a larger market
capitalization. If there are fewer than 50 Tier 1 constituents, the shortfall is filled with Tier 2 constituents, and the Underlying Index is capped at 50 constituents. </div>
<div>Constituents are float market capitalization-weighted with a 6%
cap for individual stocks and each industry is capped at 15%. Additionally, individual constituents with weights of 4.5% or greater in aggregate cannot compose more than 45% of the Underlying Index. The Underlying Index is reconstituted annually
each December and rebalanced quarterly. The Index Provider does not require that each of the eight sustainable themes be</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>included in the Underlying Index, nor does it require the inclusion of a
minimum number of Tier 1 constituents. In addition, constituents may operate business lines that generate revenues in industries in addition to those related to breakthrough innovations and new technologies and may be associated with multiple
industries or sectors. </div> <div>The Underlying Index includes
small-, mid- and large-capitalization companies and may change over time. As of February 10, 2023, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the consumer cyclical, industrials and technology
industries or sectors. As of February 10, 2023, the Underlying Index consisted of securities from the following countries: Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, the
United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) and the U.S.</div> <div>BFA
uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive
positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover
low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund.</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<p>
<hr size="3"/> <div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>“Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves
investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to that of an applicable underlying index. The securities selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on
factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the
securities in the Underlying Index.</div> <div>The Fund generally
will invest at least 90% of its assets in the component securities of the Underlying Index and in investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities of the Underlying Index (<font>i.e</font>., depositary receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index) and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money
market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash equivalent investments associated with a derivative
position will be treated as part of that position for the purposes of calculating the percentage of investments included in the Underlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the
Fund.</div> <div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to
one-third of the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by Morningstar, which is
independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government
securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</font></div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share
(“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or other asset
classes.</font></div> <div>Assets Under Management (AUM) Risk<font>.</font><font> From time to time, an Authorized</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Participant (as defined in the <font>Creations and
Redemptions</font> section of this prospectus (the “Prospectus”)), a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a specific
period of time to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There can be no assurance that any such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the
Fund.</div> <div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption
transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other
market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem,
Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened for exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), such as the Fund, that
invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that have lower trading volumes.</font></div>
<div>Breakthrough Innovations and New Technologies Risk. <font>Breakthrough innovations and new technologies are products or services that fundamentally change the dynamics of an industry or market. The Fund's holdings may</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>include equity securities of operating companies that focus on or have
exposure to a wide variety of industries, and the economic success of certain of these companies may not be significantly tied to breakthrough innovations and new technologies. Companies involved in breakthrough innovations and new technologies may
have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel that face intense competition and potentially rapid product obsolescence. These companies may not be exclusively or substantially exposed to breakthrough innovations and new
technologies, but may be exposed, directly or indirectly, to the market and business risks of other companies, industries or sectors. In addition, these companies may depend on intellectual property or patent rights to protect their innovations or
new technologies, which may be difficult to prevent the misappropriation of, and are susceptible to competitors that may develop substantially similar or superior products or services.</div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector, market segment or asset class.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Cyclical Industry Risk. <font>Consumer cyclical companies rely heavily on business cycles and economic conditions. Consumer cyclical companies may be adversely affected by domestic and international economic</font></div> </div>

<div>S-6</div> </div> </div> </div>

<p>
<hr size="3"/> <div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>downturns, changes in exchange and interest rates, competition,
consumers’ disposable income and preferences, social trends and marketing campaigns.</div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the currency of a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are
delays or limits on repatriation of such currency. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may change quickly and without warning.</font></div>
<div>Custody Risk<font>.</font><font> Less developed securities markets are more likely to experience problems with the clearing and settling of trades, as well as the holding of securities by local banks, agents and
depositories.</font></div> <div>Cybersecurity Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, the Index Provider and other service providers, market makers,
Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the Fund and its
shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the
cybersecurity plans and systems of the Fund’s Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>ESG Risk. <font>To
the extent that the Underlying Index uses criteria related to</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>the ESG characteristics of issuers, this may limit the types and number of
investment opportunities available to the Fund and, as a result, the Fund may underperform other funds whose underlying index does not use ESG criteria. The Underlying Index’s use of ESG criteria may result in the Fund investing in, or
allocating greater weight to, securities or market sectors that underperform the market as a whole or underperform other funds that use ESG criteria. In addition, the use of representative sampling may result in divergence of the Fund’s
overall ESG characteristics or ESG risk from those of the Underlying Index. The Index Provider may evaluate security-level ESG data and, if applicable, ESG objectives or constraints that are relevant to the Underlying Index only at index reviews or
rebalances. Securities included in the Underlying Index may cease to meet the relevant ESG criteria but may nevertheless remain in the Underlying Index and the Fund until the next review or rebalance by the Index Provider. As a result, certain
securities in the Underlying Index, or the Underlying Index as a whole, may not meet the relevant ESG objectives or constraints at all times.</div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is composed of common stocks, which generally
subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>

<div>Geographic Risk<font>.</font><font> A natural disaster could occur in a geographic region in which the Fund invests, which could adversely affect the economy or the business operations of companies in the specific geographic region,
causing an adverse impact on the Fund's investments in, or which are exposed to, the affected region.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of
the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders.
Unusual market conditions or other unforeseen circumstances (such as natural disasters, political unrest or war) may impact the Index Provider or a third-party data provider, and could cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance. This
could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition.</font></div>
<div>Industrials Sector Risk.<font> Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by changes in the supply of and demand for products and services, product obsolescence, claims for environmental damage or product
liability and changes in general economic conditions, among other factors.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Infectious Illness Risk. <font>A widespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in travel restrictions, disruption of healthcare services, prolonged quarantines, cancellations, supply chain
disruptions, business closures, lower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings downgrades, defaults and other significant economic, social and political impacts. Markets may experience temporary closures, extreme volatility, severe losses, reduced
liquidity and increased trading costs. Such events may adversely affect the Fund and its investments and may impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities or cause elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the
Fund's NAV. Despite the development of vaccines, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects cannot be predicted with certainty.</font></div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may
cause the value of the securities to decline.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more
limited growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>

<div>shareholders, including an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the
Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, a market maker, or another entity, may from time to time own or manage a substantial amount of Fund shares, or may invest in the Fund and hold their investment for a limited period of
time. There can be no assurance that any large shareholder or large group of shareholders would not redeem their investment. Redemptions of a large number of Fund shares could require the Fund to dispose of assets to meet the redemption requests,
which can accelerate the realization of taxable income and/or capital gains and cause the Fund to make taxable distributions to its shareholders earlier than the Fund otherwise would have. In addition, under certain circumstances, non-redeeming
shareholders may be treated as receiving a disproportionately large taxable distribution during or with respect to such year. In some circumstances, the Fund may hold a relatively large proportion of its assets in cash in anticipation of large
redemptions, diluting its investment returns. These large redemptions may also force the Fund to sell portfolio securities when it might not otherwise do so, which may negatively impact the Fund’s NAV, increase the Fund’s brokerage costs
and/or have a material effect on the market price of the Fund shares.</div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>

NAV.</div> <div>Market Trading
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary
markets, periods of high volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. </font><font>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Mid-Capitalization Companies
Risk<font>.</font><font> Compared to large-capitalization companies, mid-capitalization companies may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse developments. In addition,
the securities of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile and less liquid than those of large-capitalization companies.</font></div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities and/or other assets held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the Fund’s quote from the closed foreign market). The impact of a closed foreign market on the Fund is likely to be greater where a large portion of the Fund’s underlying securities

<div>other assets trade on that closed foreign market or when the foreign market is
closed for unscheduled reasons. These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</div>
<div>Non-Diversification Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is classified as “non-diversified.” This means that, compared with other funds that are classified as “diversified,” the Fund may invest a greater percentage of its
assets in securities issued by or representing a small number of issuers. As a result, the Fund's performance may depend on the performance of a small number of issuers.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of inflation or nationalization. The Fund may
lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting issuers of non-U.S. securities or non-U.S. markets. In addition, non-U.S. securities markets may trade a small number of securities and may be unable to respond effectively
to changes in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. The Fund is specifically exposed to </font><font>Asian Economic Risk </font><font>and </font><font>European Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund’s service providers,
counterparties or other third parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every
possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Privatization Risk<font>.</font><font> Some countries in which the Fund invests have privatized, or have begun the process of privatizing, certain entities and industries. Privatized entities may lose money or be
re-nationalized.</font></div> <div>Reliance on Trading Partners Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund invests in countries or regions whose economies are heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in this trading may have an adverse
impact on the Fund's investments. Through its holdings of securities of certain issuers, the Fund is specifically exposed to </font><font>Asian Economic Risk, European Economic Risk</font><font> and </font><font>U.S. Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in China<font>.
</font><font>China subjects the Fund to risks specific to China. China may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability. China is an emerging market and demonstrates
significantly higher volatility from time to time in comparison to developed markets. Over the last few decades, the Chinese government has undertaken reform of economic and market practices and has expanded the sphere of private ownership of
property in China. However, Chinese markets generally continue to experience inefficiency, volatility and pricing anomalies resulting from governmental</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>influence, a lack of publicly available information and/or political and
social instability.</div> <div>Chinese companies are also subject to
the risk that Chinese authorities can intervene in their operations and structure. Internal social unrest or confrontations with neighboring countries, including military conflicts in response to such events, may also disrupt economic development in
China and result in a greater risk of currency fluctuations, currency non-convertibility, interest rate fluctuations and higher rates of inflation.</div>
<div>China has experienced security concerns, such as terrorism and
strained international relations. Additionally, China is alleged to have participated in state-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign companies and foreign governments. Actual and threatened responses to such activity and strained international
relations, including purchasing restrictions, sanctions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Chinese government or Chinese companies, may impact China’s economy and Chinese issuers of securities in which the Fund invests. Incidents involving
China's or the region's security may cause uncertainty in Chinese markets and may adversely affect the Chinese economy and the Fund's investments. Export growth continues to be a major driver of China's rapid economic growth. Reduction in spending
on Chinese products and services, institution of additional tariffs or other trade barriers or a downturn in any of the economies of China's key trading partners may have an adverse impact on the Chinese economy.</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries<font>. </font><font>The Fund’s investment in developed country issuers may subject the Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and other risks
associated with developed countries. Developed countries tend to represent a significant portion of the global economy and have generally experienced slower economic growth than some less developed countries. Certain developed countries have
experienced security concerns, such as war, terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents involving a country’s or region’s security may cause uncertainty in its markets and may adversely affect its economy and the
Fund’s investments. In addition, developed countries may be adversely impacted by changes to the economic conditions of certain key trading partners, regulatory burdens, debt burdens and the price or availability of certain
commodities.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets<font>.</font><font> Investments in emerging market issuers may be subject to a greater risk of loss than investments in issuers located or operating in more developed markets.
Emerging markets may be more likely to experience inflation, social instability, political turmoil or rapid changes in economic conditions than more developed markets. Companies in many emerging markets are not subject to the same degree of
regulatory requirements, accounting standards or auditor oversight as companies in more developed countries, and as a result, information about the securities in which the Fund invests may be less reliable or complete. Emerging markets often have
less reliable securities valuations and greater risk associated</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>with custody of securities than developed markets. There may be significant
obstacles to obtaining information necessary for investigations into or litigation against companies and shareholders may have limited legal remedies. The Fund is not actively managed and does not select investments based on investor protection
considerations.</div> <div>Risk of Investing in the U.S<font>.</font><font> Certain changes in the U.S. economy, such as when the U.S. economy weakens or when its financial markets decline, may have an adverse effect on the securities
to which the Fund has exposure.</font></div> <div>Securities Lending
Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a
timely manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger
adverse tax consequences for the Fund.</font></div> <div>Small Fund
Risk. <font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet
certain conditions of the listing exchange. Any resulting liquidation of the Fund could cause the Fund to incur elevated transaction costs for the Fund and negative tax consequences for its shareholders.</font></div>
<div>Sustainability Risk.<font> Sustainability risk is an inclusive term to designate investment risk that relates to environmental, social or governance issues. Sustainability risk around</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>environmental issues includes, but is not limited to, climate risk, both
physical and transition risk. Risks related to social issues can include, but are not limited to, labor rights and community relations. Governance-related risks can include, but are not limited to, risks around board independence, ownership and
control, and audit and tax management. Sustainability risk can also manifest itself through different existing risk types including, but not limited to, market, liquidity, concentration, credit and asset-liability mismatch risk. These risks can
impact an issuer's operational effectiveness and resilience as well as its public perception and reputation, affecting its profitability and, in turn, its capital growth and ultimately impacting the value of holdings in the Fund. As a result,
sustainability risk factors may have a material impact on an investment, may increase volatility, may affect liquidity and may have an adverse impact on the value of shares of the Fund.</div>
<div>Sustainability risk factors do not solely determine the risk
profile of the investment. The relevance, severity, materiality and time horizon of sustainability risk factors and other risks can differ significantly across funds. All or a combination of these factors may have an unpredictable impact on the
Fund's investments. Under normal market conditions, such events could have a material impact on the value of shares of the Fund. The impacts of sustainability risk are likely to develop over time, and new sustainability risks may be identified as
further data and information regarding sustainability factors and impacts become available.</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Technology Sector Risk<font>.</font><font> Technology companies, including information technology companies, may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. Technology companies typically face intense competition
and potentially rapid product obsolescence. They are also heavily dependent on intellectual property rights and may be adversely affected by the loss or impairment of those rights. Companies in the technology sector are facing increased government
and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or regulatory action.</font></div>
<div>Thematic Investing Risk.<font> The Fund relies on the Index Provider for the identification of securities for inclusion in the Underlying Index that reflect themes and sub-themes, and its performance may suffer if such securities
are not correctly identified or if a theme or sub-theme develops in an unexpected manner. Performance may also suffer if the stocks included in the Underlying Index do not benefit from the development of such themes or sub-themes. Performance may
also be impacted by the inclusion of non-theme-relevant exposures in the Underlying Index. There is no guarantee that the Underlying Index will reflect the theme and sub-theme exposures intended.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to “tracking error,” which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences
between the securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close
and the Fund's</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund's NAV),
transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual or the valuation of dividends or interest received by the Fund or distributions paid to the Fund’s shareholders, the
requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of
complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements, among other reasons. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs
fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not. Tracking error may occur due to differences between the methodologies used in calculating the value of the Underlying Index and determining the Fund’s NAV.
<font>INDEX ETFs THAT TRACK INDICES WITH SIGNIFICANT WEIGHT IN EMERGING MARKETS ISSUERS MAY EXPERIENCE HIGHER TRACKING ERROR THAN OTHER ETFs THAT DO NOT TRACK SUCH INDICES.</font></div>
<div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or other asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index,
particularly for securities or other assets that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. In addition, the value of the securities or other

received had the securities not been fair valued or been valued using a different methodology. The ability to value investments may be</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only be
bought and sold in the secondary market through a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An investor may incur costs
attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for shares of the Fund (ask) when buying or selling shares in the secondary
market (the “bid-ask spread”).<br/> </div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make distributions that may be taxable to
you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an individual retirement account (“IRA”), in which case, your distributions generally will be taxed when
withdrawn.</div> <div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial
Intermediaries</div> <div>If you purchase shares of the Fund through
a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms
and reporting systems or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another
investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.<br/> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
