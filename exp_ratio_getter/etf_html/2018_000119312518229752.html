<div>The iShares Currency Hedged MSCI United Kingdom ETF (the
“Fund”) seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of large- and mid-capitalization United Kingdom equities while mitigating exposure to fluctuations between the value of the British pound and the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you
will incur if you own shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides that BFA will pay
all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage
commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses. The Fund may incur “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses.” Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses reflect the Fund's <font>pro
rata</font> share of the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies. The impact of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses is included in the total returns of the Fund. Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses are not included in the
calculation of the ratio of expenses to average net assets shown in the <font>Financial Highlights</font> section of the Fund's prospectus (the “Prospectus”). BFA, the investment adviser to the Fund, has
contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees so that the Fund’s total annual fund operating expenses after this fee waiver is equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses attributable to the Fund’s investment in the
iShares MSCI United Kingdom ETF (“EWU” or the “Underlying Fund”), after taking into account any fee waivers by EWU, plus 0.03% through December 31, 2020. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to December 31, 2020
only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA. BFA has contractually agreed to waive its management fees by an additional amount equal to 0.03% through December 31, 2020. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to December 31, 2020 only
upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA.</div> <div>You may also
incur usual and customary brokerage commissions and other charges when buying or selling shares of the Fund, which are not reflected in the Example that follows:</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund and the
Underlying Fund in which the Fund principally invests, the iShares MSCI United Kingdom ETF, may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when they buy and sell securities (or “turn over” their portfolios). A higher portfolio turnover
rate for the Fund or the Underlying Fund may indicate higher transaction costs and may cause the Fund or the Underlying Fund to incur increased expenses. These expenses, which are not reflected in Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the
Example (except costs to the Underlying Fund included as part of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses), affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 20% of the average value of its
portfolio. To the extent the Underlying Fund incurs costs from high portfolio turnover, such costs may have a negative effect on the performance of the Fund.</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the MSCI
United Kingdom 100% Hedged to USD Index (the “Underlying Index”), which consists of stocks traded primarily on the London Stock Exchange with the currency risk inherent in the securities included in the Underlying Index hedged to the
U.S. dollar on a monthly basis. The Underlying Index may include large- and mid-capitalization companies. As of August 31, 2017, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of consumer staples and financials companies.
The components of the Underlying Index, and the degree to which these components represent certain industries, are likely to change over time.</div>
<div>Currently, the Fund achieves its investment objective by
investing a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund.</div> </div> </div> <div>  </div> <div type="Block"> 
<div>S-2</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by keeping portfolio turnover low in
comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div> <div>BFA
uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage the Fund and the Underlying Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities or other instruments
comprising an applicable underlying index. The securities selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as
return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund and the Underlying Fund may or may not hold all of the securities and other components of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its assets in
the component securities (including indirect investments through the Underlying Fund) and other instruments of the Underlying Index and in investments that have economic characteristics that</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>are substantially identical to the component securities of the Underlying
Index (<font>i.e</font>., depositary receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index) and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including
shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. Components of the Underlying Index include equity
securities and foreign currency forward contracts (both deliverable and non-deliverable) designed to hedge non-U.S. currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. The notional exposure to foreign currency forward contracts (both deliverable and
non-deliverable) generally will be a short position that hedges the currency risk of the equity portfolio. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index sells forward the total value of the
non-U.S. dollar denominated securities included in the Underlying Index at a one-month forward rate to effectively create a “hedge” against fluctuations in the relative value of the British pound in relation to the U.S. dollar. The hedge
is reset on a monthly basis. The Underlying Index is designed to have higher returns than an equivalent unhedged investment when the British pound is weakening relative to the U.S. dollar. Conversely, the Underlying Index is designed to have lower
returns than an equivalent unhedged investment when the British pound is rising relative to the U.S. dollar.</div>

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>component of the Underlying Index, the Fund intends to enter into foreign
currency forward contracts designed to offset the Fund’s exposure to the British pound. A foreign currency forward contract is a contract between two parties to buy or sell a specified amount of a specific currency in the future at an
agreed-upon exchange rate. The Fund's exposure to foreign currency forward contracts is based on the aggregate exposure of the Fund to the British pound. While this approach is designed to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations on Fund
returns, it does not necessarily eliminate the Fund’s exposure to the British pound. The return of the foreign currency forward contracts may not perfectly offset the actual fluctuations in value between the British pound and the U.S.
dollar.</div> <div>The Fund may also use non-deliverable forward
(“NDF”) contracts to execute its hedging transactions. An NDF is a contract where there is no physical settlement of two currencies at maturity. Rather, based on the movement of the currencies and the contractually agreed-upon exchange
rate, a net cash settlement will be made by one party to the other in U.S. dollars.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of
the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by MSCI Inc. (the
“Index Provider” or “MSCI”), which is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities and currency forwards in the Underlying Index and
publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government
securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</font></div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below (either directly or through its investments in the Underlying Fund), any
of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share (“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or
other asset classes.</font></div> <div>Assets Under Management (AUM)
Risk<font>.</font><font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this Prospectus), a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a specific period
of time in order to facilitate commencement of the Fund’s operations or to allow the Fund to</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-4</div> </div> </div> </div>

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>achieve size or scale. There<font> </font>can be no
assurance that any such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an
agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed
with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units (as defined in the </font><font>Purchase and Sale of Fund
Shares</font><font> section of the Prospectus), Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration
risk may be heightened for exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), such as the Fund, that invest in non-U.S. securities or other securities or instruments that have lower trading volumes.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
or the Underlying Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Staples Sector Risk.<font> The consumer staples sector may be</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>affected by, among other things, marketing campaigns, changes in consumer
demands, government regulations and changes in commodity prices.</div>
<div>Currency Hedging Risk.<font> When a derivative is used as a hedge against a position that the Fund or the Underlying Fund holds, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the
hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and its reference asset, and there can be no assurance
that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's hedging transactions will be effective.</font></div>
<div>In seeking to track the performance of the Underlying Index,
the Fund will attempt to hedge the currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in its portfolio (held directly or indirectly through its investment in the Underlying Fund) by investing in foreign currency forward contracts,
which may include both physically-settled forward contracts and NDFs. NDFs may be less liquid than deliverable currency forward contracts. A lack of liquidity in NDFs of the hedged currency could result in the Fund or the Underlying Fund being
unable to structure its hedging transactions as intended. In addition, BFA may seek to limit the size of the Fund in order to attempt to reduce the likelihood of a situation where the Fund is unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in an underlying
currency hedge to implement its investment objective.</div>
<div>Currency forward contracts, including NDFs, do not eliminate
movements in the value of non-U.S. currencies and</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>securities but rather allow the Fund to establish a fixed rate of exchange for
a future point in time. Exchange rates may be volatile and may change quickly and unpredictably in response to both global economic developments and economic conditions in a geographic region in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests. In
addition, in order to minimize transaction costs, or for other reasons, the Fund’s exposure to the British pound may not be fully hedged at all times. In addition, because the Fund’s currency hedge is reset on a monthly basis,
currency risk can develop or increase intra-month. Furthermore, while the Fund is designed to hedge against currency fluctuations, it is possible that a degree of currency exposure may remain even at the time a hedging transaction is implemented. As
a result, the Fund may not be able to structure its hedging transactions as anticipated or its hedging transactions may not successfully reduce the currency risk included in the Fund’s portfolio. The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency
hedging strategy will in general be affected by the volatility of both the Underlying Index and the volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound, measured on an aggregate basis. Increased volatility in either or both the Underlying
Index and the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound will generally reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy. The effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy may also in general be affected by
interest rates. Significant differences between U.S. dollar interest rates and foreign currency interest rates applicable to the British pound may impact the effectiveness of the Fund’s currency hedging strategy. Currency hedging activity
exposes the</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Fund to credit risk due to counterparty exposure. This risk will be higher to
the extent that the Fund trades with a single counterparty or small number of counterparties.</div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's NAVs are determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the British pound depreciates against the U.S. dollar and/or the Fund's attempt to
hedge currency exposure to the British pound is unsuccessful. Generally, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against the British pound will reduce the value of a security denominated in the British pound. In addition, fluctuations in the
exchange rates of currencies could affect the economy or particular business operations of companies in a geographic region, including securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests, causing an adverse impact on the Fund’s or the
Underlying Fund’s investments in the affected region and the United States. As a result, investors have the potential for losses regardless of the length of time they intend to hold Fund shares. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and
can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may change quickly and without warning.</font></div>
<div>Cyber Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund or the Underlying Fund, the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's adviser, distributor, or other service providers, market makers, Authorized
Participants, hedging counterparties to the Fund or the issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions and negatively impact the Fund’s business operations, potentially resulting
in</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>financial losses to the Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has
established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cyber security plans and systems of
the Fund’s service providers, the Index Provider, market makers, Authorized Participants, hedging counterparties to the Fund or issuers of securities in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests.</div>
<div>Derivatives Risk. <font>The Fund will use currency forwards and NDFs to hedge the currency exposure resulting from investments in the foreign currency-denominated securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. The
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of these instruments, like investments in other derivatives, may reduce the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's returns, increase volatility and/or result in losses due to credit risk or
ineffective hedging strategies. Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, a currency, an index or a market, to fluctuate significantly in price within a defined time period. Currency forwards, like other derivatives, are also
subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values
may not correlate perfectly with the value of the British pound as compared to that of the U.S. dollar. The possible lack of a liquid secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund or the Underlying Fund to sell or
otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund or the
Underlying Fund to value accurately. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also suffer losses related to its derivatives positions as a result of unanticipated market movements, which losses are potentially unlimited. BFA’s use of derivatives
is not intended to predict the direction of securities prices, currency exchange rates, interest rates and other economic factors, which could cause the Fund’s derivatives positions to lose value. Derivatives may give rise to a form of
leverage and may expose the Fund or the Underlying Fund to greater risk and increase its costs. Regulatory requirements may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, may delay or restrict the exercise of default
remedies or termination rights by the Fund, and may otherwise adversely affect the value and performance of derivatives.</div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common stocks, which generally
subject their holders to more risks than holders of preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stock and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the
issuer.</font></div> <div>Financials Sector Risk<font>.</font><font> Performance of companies in the financials sector may be adversely impacted by many factors, including, among others, changes in government regulations,
economic conditions, and interest rates, credit rating downgrades, and decreased liquidity in credit markets. The impact of</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-7</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>more stringent capital requirements and recent or future regulation of any
individual financial company, or of the financials sector as a whole, cannot be predicted. In recent years, cyber attacks and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector and have caused significant losses to
companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund.</div>
<div>Geographic Risk<font>.</font><font> A natural or other disaster could occur in the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”), which could adversely affect the economy or the business operations of companies in the U.K., causing an adverse
impact on the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments in the U.K.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index and that the Fund will therefore achieve its investment objective.
Market disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the
construction of the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its
shareholders.</font></div> <div>Investment in Underlying Fund Risk.<font> The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund.
The Fund’s NAV will change with</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other instruments in which the
Fund invests based on their market valuations. An investment in the Fund will entail more costs and expenses than a direct investment in the Underlying Fund, including as a result of the currency hedging activity conducted by the Fund.</div>
<div>As the Fund’s allocation to the Underlying Fund changes
from time to time, or to the extent that the expense ratio of the Underlying Fund changes, the weighted average operating expenses borne by the Fund may increase or decrease.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities and other instruments to which the Fund and the Underlying Fund have exposure. Changes in the financial condition or
credit rating of an issuer of those securities or counterparty on other instruments may cause the value of the securities or instruments to decline.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more
limited growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund may not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div> </div> <div>

<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund  and the Underlying Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns.</font></div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund face numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for their shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, losses due to
ineffective currency hedges, periods of high volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S AND THE UNDERLYING FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO
NAV.</font></div> <div>Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk<font>.</font><font> Compared to large-capitalization companies, mid-capitalization companies may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse developments, and their securities

Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund trade on foreign exchanges that may be closed when the securities exchange on which
the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's quote from the closed foreign market). These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the Fund’s
or the Underlying Fund's NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of inflation or nationalization. The
Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting issuers of British securities or British markets. In addition, non-U.S. securities markets may trade a small number of securities and may
be unable to respond effectively to increases in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. The Fund and the Underlying Fund are specifically exposed to
</font><font>European Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>. The Fund and the Underlying Fund are exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the
Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund, the Underlying Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through
controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Underlying Fund are not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>

Risk</font> and <font>U.S. Economic Risk</font>.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the United Kingdom<font>.</font><font> Investments in U.K. issuers may subject the Fund and the Underlying Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security, and economic risks specific to the U.K.
The U.K. has one of the largest economies in Europe, and the U.S. and other European countries are substantial trading partners of the U.K. As a result, the U.K.’s economy may be impacted by changes to the economic condition of the U.S. and
other European countries. Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain, may have an adverse effect on the U.K. economy. In a referendum held on June 23, 2016, the U.K. resolved to leave the European Union (the “EU”). The
referendum may introduce significant uncertainties and instability in the financial markets as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the EU.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund and the Underlying Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund or the Underlying Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities
fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund or the Underlying Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made
with cash collateral. These events could also</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund.</div>
<div>Tax Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund invests in the Underlying Fund, the Fund’s realized losses on sales of shares of the Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently deferred as “wash sales.”
Distributions of short-term capital gains by the Underlying Fund will be recognized as ordinary income by the Fund and would not be offset by the Fund’s capital loss carryforwards, if any. Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying Fund, if
any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund. Each of these effects is caused by the Fund’s investment in the Underlying Fund and may result in distributions to Fund shareholders being of higher magnitude and less likely to qualify for
lower capital gain tax rates than if the Fund were to invest directly in the securities and other instruments comprising the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in derivatives. The federal income tax treatment of a derivative may not be as favorable
as a direct investment in an underlying asset. Derivatives may produce taxable income and taxable realized gain. Derivatives may adversely affect the timing, character and amount of income the Fund realizes from its investments. As a result, a
larger portion of the Fund’s distributions may be treated as ordinary income rather than as capital gains. In addition, certain derivatives are subject to mark-to-market or straddle provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the “Internal Revenue Code”). If such provisions are applicable, there could be an increase (or decrease) in the amount of taxable dividends paid by the Fund. Income from swaps is generally taxable. In addition, the tax treatment of
certain derivatives, such as</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>swaps, is unsettled and may be subject to future legislation, regulation or
administrative pronouncements issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”).</div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> Tracking error is the divergence of a fund’s performance from that of the applicable underlying index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities (including
shares of an underlying fund) and other instruments held in a fund’s portfolio and those included in the applicable underlying index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local
market close and the fund’s valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the fund’s NAV), differences in transaction and hedging costs and forward rates achieved, the fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in
timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or other distributions, interest, tax gains or losses, changes to the applicable underlying index and the cost to the fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements.
These risks may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions in the affected securities and/or foreign exchange markets. In addition, tracking error may result because a fund incurs fees and expenses,
while the applicable underlying index does not, and because the fund accepts creations and redemptions during time periods between which it is able to adjust its currency hedges, whereas the applicable underlying index does not adjust its hedging
during these periods. To the extent that the Fund seeks its investment objective through</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>investments in an underlying fund, the Fund may experience increased tracking
error. The potential for increased tracking error may result from investments in the Underlying Fund due to, among other things, differences in the composition of the investment portfolio of the Underlying Fund as compared to the index tracked by
the Underlying Fund and differences in the timing of the Fund’s valuation of: (i) the Underlying Fund and the foreign currency forward contracts (each valued as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), typically 4:00
p.m., Eastern Time), (ii) the valuation of the securities in the Underlying Index (generally valued as of each security’s local market close) and (iii) the foreign currency forward contracts included in the Underlying Index (generally valued
at 4:00 p.m., London time).</div> <div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund and the Underlying Fund could receive upon sale of a security or unwind of a financial instrument or other asset may differ from the
Fund's or the Underlying Fund's valuation of the security, instrument or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other instruments that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are
valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. In addition, the value of the securities or other instruments in the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods
when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's shares. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem  Fund shares on days when the Fund or the Underlying Fund is holding fair-valued securities may
receive fewer or</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund are listed on
a national securities exchange. Most investors will buy and sell shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer. The price of Fund shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a
price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund will only issue or redeem shares that have been aggregated into blocks of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof (“Creation Units”) to Authorized Participants who
have entered into agreements with the Fund's distributor. The Fund generally will issue or redeem Creation Units in return for a designated portfolio of securities (and an amount of cash) that the Fund specifies each day.<br/> </div> </div>
