The ability to </span><span>value investments may be impacted by </span><span>technological issues or errors by pricing </span><span>services or other third-party service </span><span>providers.</span></div> </ix:nonnumeric> <div></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>S-12</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <ix:nonnumeric contextref="S000076781Member" name="rr:BarChartAndPerformanceTableHeading"> <div><span>Performance Information</span></div> </ix:nonnumeric> <ix:nonnumeric contextref="S000076781Member" escape="true" name="rr:PerformanceNarrativeTextBlock"> <ix:nonnumeric contextref="S000076781Member" name="rr:PerformanceOneYearOrLess"> <div><span>As of the date of this Prospectus, the </span><span>Fund does not have a full calendar year </span><span>of performance information to report.</span></div> </ix:nonnumeric> </ix:nonnumeric> <div><span>Management</span></div> <div><span>Investment Adviser.</span><span> BlackRock Fund </span><span>Advisors.</span></div> <div><span>Portfolio Managers.</span><span> Jennifer Hsui, </span><span>Orlando Montalvo, Greg Savage and </span><span>Paul Whitehead (the </span><span>“</span><span>Portfolio </span><span>Managers</span><span>”</span><span>) are primarily responsible for </span><span>the day-to-day management of the </span><span>Fund.

Individual shares of </span><span>the Fund may only be bought and sold in </span><span>the secondary market through a broker-dealer.</span><span> Because ETF shares trade at </span><span>market prices rather than at NAV, </span><span>shares may trade at a price greater than </span><span>NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a </span><span>discount). An investor may incur costs </span><span>attributable to the difference between </span><span>the highest price a buyer is willing to </span><span>pay to purchase shares of the Fund (bid) </span><span>and the lowest price a seller is willing to </span><span>accept for shares of the Fund (ask) </span><span>when buying or selling shares in the </span><span>secondary market (the </span><span>“</span><span>bid-ask </span><span>spread</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Tax Information</span></div> <div><span>The Fund intends to make distributions </span><span>that may be taxable to you as ordinary </span><span>income or capital gains, unless you are </span><span>investing through a tax-deferred </span><span>arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or </span><span>an individual retirement account (</span><span>“</span><span>IRA</span><span>”</span><span>), </span><span>in which case, your distributions </span><span>generally will be taxed when withdrawn.</span></div> <div><span>Payments to Broker-Dealers </span><span>and Other Financial </span><span>Intermediaries</span></div> <div><span>If you purchase shares of the Fund </span><span>through a broker-dealer or other </span><span>financial intermediary (such as a bank), </span><span>BFA or other related companies may </span><span>pay the intermediary for marketing </span><span>activities and presentations, educational </span><span>training programs, conferences, the </span><span>development of technology platforms </span><span>and reporting systems or other services </span><span>related to the sale or promotion of the </span><span>Fund.

Please </span><span>read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional </span><span>information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</span></div> <div><span>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund are listed for trading on </span><span>Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (</span><span>“</span><span>Cboe BZX</span><span>”</span><span>). The market price for a share of the Fund may </span><span>be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</span></div> <div><span>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly-traded securities. The Fund is designed to </span><span>track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund </span><span>represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other </span><span>instruments intended to track a market index. Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which </span><span>can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based </span><span>on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at </span><span>NAV solely by Authorized Participants and only in aggregations of a specified number of </span><span>shares (</span><span>“</span><span>Creation Units</span><span>”</span><span>). Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are </span><span>listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market </span><span>prices that change throughout the day.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund invests in a particular segment of the securities markets and seeks to track </span><span>the performance of an index consisting of securities and derivatives that is not </span><span>representative of the market as a whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of </span><span>broader asset allocation strategies. Accordingly, an investment in the Fund should not </span><span>constitute a complete investment program.</span></div> <div><span>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of financial instruments, and is </span><span>not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The </span><span>performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, </span><span>including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency valuations, asset valuations, corporate </span><span>actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of </span><span>representative sampling or from legal restrictions (such as diversification </span><span>requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to </span><span>time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments </span><span>to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise determined by BFA, any such change or </span><span>adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on </span><span>a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, </span><span>the Underlying Index performance shown for periods prior to the effective date of any </span><span>such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect </span><span>such change or adjustment. </span></div> <div><span>Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected </span><span>to have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. </span><span>“</span><span>Replication</span><span>”</span><span> is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all of the </span><span>securities in its underlying index in approximately the same proportions as in the </span><span>underlying index.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not insured or guaranteed by </span><span>the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or </span><span>any of its affiliates.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be changed without </span><span>shareholder approval.</span></div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Principal Risks</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The Fund is subject to various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of </span><span>which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability </span><span>to meet its investment objective. The Fund may be exposed to these risks directly or </span><span>indirectly through the Fund's investments in the Underlying Fund. You could lose all or </span><span>part of your investment in the Fund, and the Fund could underperform other </span><span>investments. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of </span><span>any particular risk factor. The Fund discloses its portfolio holdings daily at </span><span>www.iShares.com</span><span>.</span></div> <div><span>Asset Class Risk.</span><span> The securities</span><span> </span><span>and other assets in the Fund’s or the Underlying </span><span>Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that </span><span>track other issuers, countries, groups of countries, regions, industries, groups of </span><span>industries, markets, market segments, asset classes or sectors. Various types of </span><span>securities may experience cycles of outperformance and underperformance in </span><span>comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a number of factors </span><span>including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, global demand for </span><span>local products or resources, and regulation and governmental controls. This may cause </span><span>the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that invest in different asset </span><span>classes.</span></div> <div><span>Assets Under Management (AUM) Risk.</span><span> From time to time, an Authorized </span><span>Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s </span><span>adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a specific period </span><span>of time to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</span><span> </span><span>can be no assurance that any </span><span>such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund would be </span><span>maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. </span><span>Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of </span><span>those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption </span><span>transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized </span><span>Participants on an agency basis (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, on behalf of other market participants). To the </span><span>extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with </span><span>creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized </span><span>Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares </span><span>may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading </span><span>halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened </span><span>because ETFs, such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or </span><span>other securities or instruments that are less widely traded often involve greater </span><span>settlement and operational issues and capital costs for Authorized Participants, which </span><span>may limit the availability of Authorized Participants.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Calculation Methodology Risk.</span><span> The Index Provider</span><span> </span><span>relies on various sources of </span><span>information to assess the criteria of components of the Underlying Index, including </span><span>information that may be based on assumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund nor </span><span>BFA can offer assurances that the Index Provider's calculation methodology or sources </span><span>of information will provide an accurate assessment of included components.</span></div> <div><span>Call Risk.</span><span> During periods of falling interest rates, an issuer of a callable bond held by </span><span>the Underlying Fund may </span><span>“</span><span>call</span><span>”</span><span> or repay the security before its stated maturity, and the </span><span>Underlying Fund may have to reinvest the proceeds in securities with lower yields, </span><span>which would result in a decline in the Fund’s income, or in securities with greater risks </span><span>or with other less favorable features.</span></div> <div><span>Concentration Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, </span><span>including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than </span><span>the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's </span><span>investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular </span><span>issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of </span><span>industries, project types, group of project types, sector, market segment or asset </span><span>class. The Fund may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of those </span><span>securities and/or other assets, may experience increased price volatility and may be </span><span>more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences </span><span>affecting those securities and/or other assets than a fund that does not concentrate </span><span>its investments.</span></div> <div><span>Consumer Staples Sector Risk.</span><span> Companies in the consumer staples sector may be </span><span>affected by the regulation of various product components and production methods, </span><span>marketing campaigns and changes in the global economy, consumer spending and </span><span>consumer demand. Tobacco and tobacco-related companies, in particular, may be </span><span>adversely affected by new laws, regulations and litigation. Companies in the consumer </span><span>staples sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity </span><span>prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. These companies may be </span><span>subject to severe competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</span></div> <div><span>Covered Call Option Risk.</span><span> By writing covered call options in return for the receipt of </span><span>premiums, the Fund will give up the opportunity to benefit from potential increases in </span><span>the value of the Underlying Fund above the exercise prices of the written options, but </span><span>will continue to bear the risk of declines in the value of the Underlying Fund. The </span><span>premiums received from the options may not be sufficient to offset any losses </span><span>sustained from the volatility of the Underlying Fund over time. In addition, the Fund’s </span><span>ability to sell shares of the Underlying Fund will be limited while the option is in effect </span><span>unless the Fund extinguishes the option position through the purchase of an offsetting </span><span>identical option prior to the expiration of the written option.</span></div> <div><span>The covered call strategy may be subject to imperfect matching or price correlation </span><span>between the written options and the Underlying Fund, which could reduce the Fund’s </span><span>returns. Exchanges may suspend the trading of options (for example due to volatile </span><span>markets or if trading in the Underlying Fund is halted). If trading is suspended, the Fund </span><span>may be unable to write or purchase options at times that may be desirable or </span><span>advantageous to the Fund to do so. If the Fund is unable to extinguish the option </span><span>position before exercise, the Fund may be required to deliver the corresponding shares </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>of the Underlying Fund, resulting in increased transaction costs, tracking error, </span><span>underinvestment, and potentially the realization of capital gains. Further, this could </span><span>lead to re-purchasing shares of the Underlying Fund or selling the corresponding </span><span>options at a less favorable price than the Fund might have received had the options </span><span>been extinguished. The Fund uses options which are struck once per month, and the </span><span>timing of changes in the price of the Underlying Fund may affect the Fund’s </span><span>performance. For example, if the Underlying Fund experiences a drop in price followed </span><span>by a quick rebound, the Fund may be unable to fully participate in the rebound if the </span><span>rebound occurs immediately after the Fund’s roll date. In addition, if trading is </span><span>suspended, the Fund may be unable to purchase an offsetting option for purposes of </span><span>closing out an existing written option at the originally scheduled time and date.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund will be affected by movements in interest rates and bond yields and the </span><span>resulting share price of the Underlying Fund. In a falling interest rate environment and </span><span>other environments in which credit spreads narrow, the Underlying Fund is generally </span><span>expected to appreciate in price, and the Fund may underperform the Underlying Fund </span><span>as price appreciation for the Fund is limited to the exercise prices of the options </span><span>written by the Fund. Credit spread is generally the difference in yield between two </span><span>bonds with the same maturity but different credit ratings and can be impacted by </span><span>interest rates or underlying economic conditions.</span></div> <div><span>Credit Risk.</span><span> Credit risk is the risk that the issuer or guarantor of a debt instrument or </span><span>the counterparty to a derivatives contract, repurchase agreement or loan of portfolio </span><span>securities will be unable or unwilling to make its timely interest and/or principal </span><span>payments when due or otherwise honor its obligations. There are varying degrees of </span><span>credit risk, depending on an issuer’s or counterparty’s financial condition and on the </span><span>terms of an obligation, which may be reflected in the issuer’s or counterparty’s credit </span><span>rating. There is the chance that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's portfolio holdings </span><span>will have their credit ratings downgraded or will default (</span><span>i.e., </span><span>fail to make scheduled </span><span>interest or principal payments), or that the market’s perception of an issuer’s </span><span>creditworthiness may worsen, potentially reducing the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's </span><span>income level or share price.</span></div> <div><span>Cybersecurity Risk.</span><span> The Fund,</span><span> </span><span>the Underlying Fund,</span><span> </span><span>Authorized Participants, service </span><span>providers and the relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information </span><span>security and related </span><span>“</span><span>cyber</span><span>”</span><span> risks both directly and through their service providers. </span><span>Similar types of cybersecurity risks are also present for issuers of securities in which </span><span>the Fund or the Underlying Fund invest, which could result in material adverse </span><span>consequences for such issuers and may cause the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's </span><span>investment in such issuers to lose value. In general, cyber incidents can result from </span><span>deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are not limited </span><span>to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, through </span><span>“</span><span>hacking</span><span>”</span><span> or malicious </span><span>software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, </span><span>corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyberattacks may also be carried </span><span>out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing </span><span>denial-of-service attacks on websites (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, efforts to make network services unavailable </span><span>to intended users). Recently, geopolitical tensions may have increased the scale and </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>sophistication of deliberate attacks, particularly those from nation-states or from </span><span>entities with nation-state backing. </span></div> <div><span>Cybersecurity failures by, or breaches of, the systems of the Fund's or the Underlying </span><span>Fund's adviser, distributor and other service providers (including, but not limited to, </span><span>index and benchmark providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and </span><span>administrators), market makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in </span><span>which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invest have the ability to cause disruptions and </span><span>impact business operations, potentially resulting in: financial losses, interference with </span><span>the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's ability to calculate its NAV, disclosure of </span><span>confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of erroneous </span><span>trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund, the </span><span>Underlying Fund or their service providers to transact business, violations of applicable </span><span>privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, </span><span>reimbursement or other compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In </span><span>addition, cyberattacks may render records of Fund assets and transactions, </span><span>shareholder ownership of Fund shares, and other data integral to the functioning of the </span><span>Fund or the Underlying Fund inaccessible, inaccurate or incomplete. Substantial costs </span><span>may be incurred by the Fund or the Underlying Fund in order to resolve or prevent </span><span>cyber incidents in the future. While the Fund and the Underlying Fund have established </span><span>business continuity plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, </span><span>such cyber incidents, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems, </span><span>including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified, that prevention and </span><span>remediation efforts will not be successful or that cyberattacks will go undetected. </span><span>Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place </span><span>by service providers to the Fund or Underlying Fund, issuers in which the Fund or </span><span>Underlying Fund invests, the Index Provider, market makers or Authorized Participants. </span><span>The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result.</span></div> <div><span>Derivatives Risk.</span><span>The Fund will use covered calls, which are options, in seeking to </span><span>achieve the Fund’s investment objective. The Fund’s use of options, like investment in </span><span>other derivatives, may reduce the Fund’s returns or increase volatility. A risk of the </span><span>Fund’s use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate with </span><span>the value of the underlying asset, the performance of the asset class to which the Fund </span><span>seeks exposure or to the performance of the overall securities markets. Since the </span><span>Fund’s covered call options are written on shares of the Underlying Fund, if the </span><span>increase in the price of the Underlying Fund is significantly above the exercise price of </span><span>a written option, the Fund would likely substantially underperform the Underlying Fund. </span><span>In addition, implied volatility is one of the primary inputs in options pricing. As volatility </span><span>increases, the value of an option also increases (and vice-versa). Changes in the level </span><span>of volatility can affect the amount of premium the Fund will receive from writing </span><span>options and increased volatility may increase the cost the Fund pays to close out an </span><span>open option position.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund’s use of derivatives may reduce the Fund’s returns or increase volatility. </span><span>Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, a currency, an index or a market </span><span>to fluctuate significantly in price within a short time period. Derivatives may also be </span><span>subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund’s use of derivatives is that the </span><span>fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the value of the underlying </span><span>asset, the performance of the asset class to which the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund seeks </span><span>exposure or the performance of the overall markets. The possible lack of a liquid </span><span>secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying </span><span>Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or </span><span>Underlying Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or </span><span>Underlying Fund to value accurately. The Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund could also suffer </span><span>losses related to its derivatives positions as a result of unanticipated market </span><span>movements, or movements between the time of periodic reallocations of Fund</span><span> </span><span>or </span><span>Underlying Fund assets, which losses are potentially unlimited. Certain derivatives may </span><span>give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund to greater </span><span>risk and increase its costs.</span><span> </span><span>To the extent that the Fund invests in rolling futures </span><span>contracts, it may be subject to additional risk. The impact of U.S. and global regulation </span><span>of derivatives may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of </span><span>derivatives, may delay or restrict the exercise by the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund of </span><span>termination rights or remedies upon a counterparty default under derivatives held by </span><span>the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund (which could result in losses), or may otherwise adversely </span><span>affect the value or performance of derivatives. In addition, the Fund's use of derivatives </span><span>may expose the Fund to risks related to potential operational issues, such as </span><span>documentation and settlement issues, systems failures, inadequate controls and </span><span>human error. Derivatives may also involve legal risks, including insufficient </span><span>documentation, insufficient capacity or authority of a counterparty, and legality and </span><span>enforceability of a contract.</span></div> <div><span>Distribution Tax Risk.</span><span> The Fund currently expects to make distributions on a regular </span><span>basis. While the Fund will normally pay its income as distributions, the Fund's </span><span>distributions may exceed the Fund's income and gains for the Fund's taxable year. The </span><span>Fund may be required to reduce its distributions if it has insufficient income. </span><span>Distributions in excess of the Fund's current and accumulated earnings and profits will </span><span>be treated as a return of capital. Distributions in excess of the Fund's minimum </span><span>distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund's earnings and profits, will be </span><span>taxable to Fund shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A </span><span>return of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the </span><span>shareholder's cost basis and will result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss </span><span>when those Fund shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a Fund </span><span>shareholder's cost basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as </span><span>capital gain, if the Fund shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets. </span><span>Because the Fund's distributions may consist of return of capital, the Fund may not be </span><span>an appropriate investment for investors who do not want their principal investment in </span><span>the Fund to decrease over time or who do not wish to receive return of capital in a </span><span>given period.</span></div> <div><span>Financials Sector Risk.</span><span> Companies in the financials sector</span><span> </span><span>of an economy are subject </span><span>to extensive governmental regulation and intervention, which may adversely affect the </span><span>scope of their activities, the prices they can charge, the amount of capital they must </span><span>maintain and, potentially, their size. The extent to which the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or the Underlying </span><span>Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>6</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>limited by applicable law. Governmental regulation may change frequently and may </span><span>have significant adverse consequences for companies in the financials sector, </span><span>including effects not intended by such regulation. Increased risk taking by banks may </span><span>also result in greater overall risk in the U.S. and global financials sector. The impact of </span><span>changes in capital requirements, or recent or future regulation in various countries, on </span><span>any individual financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be </span><span>predicted. </span></div> <div><span>Certain risks may impact the value of investments in the financials sector more </span><span>severely than those of investments outside this sector, including the risks associated </span><span>with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage. Companies in the </span><span>financials sector are exposed directly to the credit risk of their borrowers and </span><span>counterparties, who may be leveraged to an unknown degree, including through swaps </span><span>and other derivatives products. Financial services companies may have significant </span><span>exposure to the same borrowers and counterparties, with the result that a borrower’s </span><span>or counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations to one company may affect other </span><span>companies with exposure to the same borrower or counterparty. This </span><span>interconnectedness of risk may result in significant negative impacts to companies </span><span>with direct exposure to the defaulting counterparty as well as adverse cascading </span><span>effects in the markets and the financials sector generally. Companies in the financials </span><span>sector may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and loan losses, </span><span>decreases in the availability of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades </span><span>and adverse conditions in other related markets. Insurance companies, in particular, </span><span>may be subject to severe price competition and/or rate regulation, which may have an </span><span>adverse impact on their profitability. The financials sector is particularly sensitive to </span><span>fluctuations in interest rates. The financials sector is also a target for cyberattacks, and </span><span>may experience technology malfunctions and disruptions. Cybersecurity incidents and </span><span>technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector </span><span>and have reportedly caused losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively </span><span>impact the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Geographic Risk.</span><span> Some of the companies in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund </span><span>invests are located in parts of the world that have historically been prone to natural </span><span>disasters, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, droughts, floods, </span><span>hurricanes or tsunamis, and are economically sensitive to environmental events. Any </span><span>such event may adversely impact the economies of these geographic areas or business </span><span>operations of companies in these geographic areas, causing an adverse impact on the </span><span>value of the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Income Risk.</span><span> The Fund’s income may decline if yields fall because the Fund or the </span><span>Underlying Fund may hold a significant portion of short duration securities and/or </span><span>securities that have floating or variable interest rates. The Fund’s income may decline </span><span>because the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests in lower yielding bonds as bonds in its </span><span>portfolio mature, are near maturity or are called, or when the Fund or the Underlying </span><span>Fund needs to purchase additional bonds. The Fund’s income from option premiums </span><span>may fall due to changes in market conditions.</span></div> <div><span>Index-Related Risk.</span><span> The Fund seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to </span><span>the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>7</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any </span><span>agents that may act on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that </span><span>the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the </span><span>Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to </span><span>achieve, neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any </span><span>liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or </span><span>its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in line with </span><span>the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to </span><span>manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider </span><span>to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee against the Index Provider’s or </span><span>any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the </span><span>data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not </span><span>be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, </span><span>particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or </span><span>managers. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its </span><span>shareholders. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains </span><span>incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and </span><span>would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Shareholders </span><span>should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund </span><span>and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will </span><span>be borne by the Fund and its shareholders. Because the Index Provider is relatively new </span><span>to the creation of securities indexes, there may be a greater risk that index errors will </span><span>not be detected as quickly as they might be in the case of an index maintained by a </span><span>long-standing index provider.</span></div> <div><span>Unusual market conditions or other unforeseen circumstances (such as natural </span><span>disasters, political unrest or war) may impact the Index Provider or a third-party data </span><span>provider, and could cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance to the </span><span>Underlying Index. This could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or </span><span>expected composition. The postponement of a scheduled rebalance could mean that </span><span>constituents of the Underlying Index that would otherwise be removed at rebalance </span><span>due to changes in market value, issuer credit ratings, or other reasons may remain, </span><span>causing the performance and constituents of the Underlying Index to vary from those </span><span>expected under normal conditions. Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index </span><span>Provider or its agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying </span><span>Index due to reaching certain weighting constraints, unusual market conditions or </span><span>corporate events or, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index </span><span>constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances </span><span>its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the </span><span>Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such </span><span>portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Therefore, </span><span>errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the Index Provider or its agents </span><span>to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Infectious Illness Risk. </span><span>A widespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as the </span><span>COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect the economies of many nations and the </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>global economy and may impact individual issuers and capital markets in ways that </span><span>cannot be foreseen.</span></div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in travel restrictions, closed international </span><span>borders, disruption of healthcare services, prolonged quarantines, cancellations, </span><span>supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, temporary and permanent closures </span><span>of businesses, layoffs, defaults and other significant economic, social and political </span><span>impacts, as well as general concern and uncertainty.</span></div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in extreme volatility, severe losses, credit </span><span>deterioration of issuers, and disruptions in markets, which could adversely impact the </span><span>Fund and its investments, including impairing any hedging activity.</span></div> <div><span>Certain local markets may be subject to closures. Any suspension of trading in markets </span><span>in which the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or the Underlying Fund invests will have an impact on the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or </span><span>Underlying Fund and its investments and will impact the Fund’s</span><span> </span><span>or the Underlying </span><span>Fund's ability to purchase or sell securities in such markets.</span><span> </span><span>Market or economic </span><span>disruptions could result in elevated tracking error and increased premiums or </span><span>discounts to the Fund's NAV. Additionally, an outbreak could impair the operations of </span><span>the Fund’s service providers, including BFA, which could adversely impact the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Governmental and quasi-governmental authorities and regulators throughout the world </span><span>may respond to an outbreak and any resulting economic disruptions with a variety of </span><span>fiscal and monetary policy changes, including direct capital infusions into companies </span><span>and other issuers, new monetary policy tools, and changes in interest rates. A reversal </span><span>of these policies, or the ineffectiveness of such policies, is likely to increase market </span><span>volatility, which could adversely affect the Fund’s investments.</span></div> <div><span>An outbreak may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social and economic risks in </span><span>certain countries or globally, which could adversely affect the Fund and its investments </span><span>and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Despite the development of vaccines, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its </span><span>effects cannot be predicted with certainty.</span></div> <div><span>Interest Rate Risk.</span><span> If interest rates rise, the value of fixed-income securities or other </span><span>instruments held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund would likely decrease. A measure </span><span>investors commonly use to determine this price sensitivity is called duration. Fixed-income</span><span> securities with longer durations tend to be more sensitive to interest rate </span><span>changes, usually making their prices more volatile than those of securities with shorter </span><span>durations. For example, if a bond has a duration of five years and interest rates rise, </span><span>the price of the bond will likely decline by a greater percentage than if the bond had a </span><span>one year duration. To the extent the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests a substantial </span><span>portion of its assets in fixed-income securities with longer duration, rising interest rates </span><span>may cause the value of the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments to decline </span><span>significantly, which would adversely affect the value of the Fund. An increase in interest </span><span>rates may lead to heightened volatility in the fixed-income markets and adversely </span><span>affect certain investments, including those held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. </span><span>Because rates on certain floating rate debt securities typically reset only periodically, </span><span>changes in prevailing interest rates (and particularly sudden and significant changes) </span><span>can be expected to cause some fluctuations in the net asset value of the Underlying </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>9</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fund to the extent that it invests in floating rate debt securities. In addition, decreases </span><span>in fixed income dealer market-making capacity may lead to lower trading volume, </span><span>heightened volatility, wider bid-ask spreads and less transparent pricing in certain </span><span>fixed-income markets.</span></div> <div><span>The historically low interest rate environment in recent years was created in part by the </span><span>world’s major central banks keeping their overnight policy interest rates at, near or </span><span>below zero percent and implementing monetary policy facilities, such as asset </span><span>purchase programs, to anchor longer-term interest rates below historical levels. During </span><span>periods of very low or negative interest rates, the Fund may be unable to maintain </span><span>positive returns or pay dividends to Fund shareholders. Certain countries have recently </span><span>experienced negative interest rates on certain fixed-income instruments. Very low or </span><span>negative interest rates may magnify interest rate risk. Changing interest rates, </span><span>including rates that fall below zero, may have unpredictable effects on markets, result </span><span>in heightened market volatility and detract from the Fund’s performance to the extent </span><span>the Fund is exposed to such interest rates. Additionally, under certain market </span><span>conditions in which interest rates are set at low levels and the market prices of </span><span>portfolio securities have increased, the Fund or the Underlying Fund may have a very </span><span>low or even negative yield. A low or negative yield would cause the Fund or the </span><span>Underlying Fund to lose money in certain conditions and over certain time periods. </span><span>Central banks may increase their short-term policy rates or begin phasing out, or </span><span>“</span><span>tapering,</span><span>”</span><span> accommodative monetary policy facilities in the future. The timing, </span><span>coordination, magnitude and effect of such policy changes on various markets are </span><span>uncertain, and such changes in monetary policy may adversely affect the value of the </span><span>Fund’s investments.</span></div> <div><span>Investment in the Underlying Fund Risk.</span><span> The Fund expects to invest a substantial </span><span>portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is </span><span>likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund. The Fund may </span><span>also invest in other funds, including money market funds. The Fund’s NAV will change </span><span>with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other investments based on their </span><span>market valuations. An investment in the Fund will entail more direct and indirect costs </span><span>and expenses than a direct investment in the Underlying Fund. For example, in addition </span><span>to the expenses of the Fund, the Fund indirectly pays a portion of the expenses </span><span>(including operating expenses and management fees) incurred by the Underlying Fund, </span><span>although some of such fees will be offset by the fee waiver by BFA.</span></div> <div><span>An investor in the Fund may receive taxable gains from portfolio transactions by the </span><span>Underlying Fund, as well as taxable gains from transactions in shares of the Underlying </span><span>Fund held by the Fund. The Fund and the Underlying Fund may also hold common </span><span>portfolio securities.</span></div> <div><span>As the Fund's allocation to the Underlying Fund changes from time to time, or to the </span><span>extent that the total annual fund operating expenses of the Underlying Fund change, </span><span>the weighted average operating expenses borne by the Fund may increase or decrease.</span></div> <div><span>Issuer Risk. </span><span>The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual </span><span>securities to which the Fund or the Underlying Fund has exposure. The Fund may be </span><span>adversely affected if an issuer of underlying securities held by the Fund or the </span><span>Underlying Fund is unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due. Any </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>issuer of these securities may perform poorly, causing the value of its securities to </span><span>decline. Poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions, competitive </span><span>pressures, changes in technology, expiration of patent protection, disruptions in </span><span>supply, labor problems or shortages, corporate restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, </span><span>credit deterioration of the issuer or other factors. Changes to the financial condition or </span><span>credit rating of an issuer of those securities may cause the value of the securities to </span><span>decline. An issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries, states </span><span>and regions in which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts </span><span>operations.</span></div> <div><span>Large Shareholder and Large-Scale Redemption Risk.</span><span> Certain shareholders, </span><span>including an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an </span><span>affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, a market maker, or another entity, may from time to time </span><span>own or manage a substantial amount of Fund shares or may invest in the Fund and </span><span>hold their investment for a limited period of time. These shareholders may also pledge </span><span>or loan Fund shares (to secure financing or otherwise), which may result in the shares </span><span>becoming concentrated in another party. There can be no assurance that any large </span><span>shareholder or large group of shareholders would not redeem their investment or that </span><span>the size of the Fund would be maintained. Redemptions of a large number of Fund </span><span>shares by these shareholders may adversely affect the Fund’s liquidity and net assets. </span><span>To the extent the Fund permits redemptions in cash, these redemptions may force the </span><span>Fund to sell portfolio securities when it might not otherwise do so, which may </span><span>negatively impact the Fund’s NAV, have a material effect on the market price of the </span><span>Shares and increase the Fund’s brokerage costs and/or accelerate the realization of </span><span>taxable income and/or gains and cause the Fund to make taxable distributions to its </span><span>shareholders earlier than the Fund otherwise would have. In addition, under certain </span><span>circumstances, non-redeeming shareholders may be treated as receiving a </span><span>disproportionately large taxable distribution during or with respect to such tax year. </span><span>The Fund also may be required to sell its more liquid Fund investments to meet a large </span><span>redemption, in which case the Fund’s remaining assets may be less liquid, more </span><span>volatile, and more difficult to price. To the extent these large shareholders transact in </span><span>shares on the secondary market, such transactions may account for a large </span><span>percentage of the trading volume for the shares of the Fund and may, therefore, have a </span><span>material upward or downward effect on the market price of the Fund shares. In </span><span>addition, large purchases of Fund shares may adversely affect the Fund’s performance </span><span>to the extent that the Fund is delayed in investing new cash and is required to maintain </span><span>a larger cash position than it ordinarily would, diluting its investment returns.</span></div> <div><span>Management Risk. </span><span>Because BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, </span><span>the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities not </span><span>included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that BFA’s </span><span>investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of </span><span>constraints, may not produce the intended results. The Fund is also subject to the risk </span><span>that the investment strategy of the Underlying Fund may not produce the intended </span><span>results.</span></div> <div><span>Market Risk.</span><span> The Fund</span><span> </span><span>and the Underlying Fund could lose money over short periods </span><span>due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>market downturns.</span><span> </span><span>Market risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future values of </span><span>financial instruments and may be influenced by price, currency and interest rate </span><span>movements. It represents the potential loss the Fund and the Underlying Fund may </span><span>suffer through holding financial instruments in the face of market movements or </span><span>uncertainty. The value of a security, asset, or other instrument may decline due to </span><span>changes in general market conditions, economic trends or events that are not </span><span>specifically related to the issuer of the security</span><span> </span><span>or other asset, or factors that affect a </span><span>particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group </span><span>of industries, sector or asset class. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of </span><span>terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, or </span><span>other events could have a significant impact on the Fund, the Underlying Fund and </span><span>their investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s</span><span> </span><span>or </span><span>Underlying Fund's NAV. During a general market downturn, multiple asset classes may </span><span>be negatively affected. Fixed-income securities with short-term maturities are generally </span><span>less sensitive to such changes than are fixed-income securities with longer-term </span><span>maturities. Changes in market conditions and interest rates generally do not have the </span><span>same impact on all types of securities and instruments.</span></div> <div><span>Market Trading Risk.</span></div> <div><span>Absence of Active Market.</span><span> Although shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund are </span><span>listed for trading on one or more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an </span><span>active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers </span><span>or Authorized Participants.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Secondary Listings. </span><span>The Fund's and the Underlying Fund's shares may be listed </span><span>or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange </span><span>where the Fund's primary listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made available </span><span>to non-U.S. investors through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to </span><span>depositary receipts. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s or the Underlying </span><span>Fund's shares will continue to trade on any such stock exchange or in any market or </span><span>that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares will continue to meet the requirements </span><span>for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's or the Underlying </span><span>Fund's shares may be less actively traded in certain markets than in others, and </span><span>investors are subject to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of </span><span>the market where they or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain </span><span>information available to investors who trade Fund or Underlying Fund shares on a U.S. </span><span>stock exchange during regular U.S. market hours may not be available to investors who </span><span>trade in other markets, which may result in secondary market prices in such markets </span><span>being less efficient.</span></div> <div><span>Secondary Market Trading Risk.</span><span> Shares of the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or the Underlying Fund may trade in </span><span>the secondary market at times when the Fund or the Underlying Fund does not accept </span><span>orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such times, shares may trade in the </span><span>secondary market with more significant premiums or discounts than might be </span><span>experienced at times when the Fund or the Underlying Fund accepts purchase and </span><span>redemption orders. If the Fund purchases shares of the Underlying Fund at a time when </span><span>the market price of Underlying Fund shares is at a premium to its NAV or sells </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>12</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Underlying Fund shares when their market price is at a discount to its NAV, the Fund </span><span>may incur losses.</span></div> <div><span>Secondary market trading in Fund or Underlying Fund shares may be halted by a stock </span><span>exchange because of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in </span><span>Fund or Underlying Fund shares on a stock exchange or in any market may be subject </span><span>to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to </span><span>“</span><span>circuit breaker</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>rules on the stock exchange or market.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund or the Underlying Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed on a </span><span>stock exchange, may be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased </span><span>volatility and price decreases associated with being sold short. In addition, trading </span><span>activity in derivative products based on the Fund or the Underlying Fund may lead to </span><span>increased trading volume and volatility in the secondary market for the shares of the </span><span>Fund or the Underlying Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV.</span><span> Shares </span><span>of the Fund and the Underlying Fund each trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above </span><span>or below the respective Fund’s and the Underlying Fund's most recent NAV. The NAV of </span><span>the Fund and the Underlying Fund are calculated at the end of each business day and </span><span>fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's </span><span>holdings. The trading price of each of the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's shares </span><span>fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours</span><span> </span><span>based on both market supply of and </span><span>demand for their shares and the underlying value of their portfolio holdings or NAV. As </span><span>a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s and the Underlying Fund's shares may deviate </span><span>significantly from NAV during periods of market volatility, including during periods of </span><span>significant redemption requests or other unusual market conditions. </span><span>ANY OF THESE </span><span>FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S OR THE UNDERLYING </span><span>FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</span><span>. However, </span><span>because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes </span><span>that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund or the Underlying Fund, as </span><span>applicable, are not likely to be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many </span><span>closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and </span><span>sometimes at premiums to, their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature is </span><span>designed to make it more likely that the Fund’s</span><span> </span><span>or the Underlying Fund's shares </span><span>normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the Fund’s or the Underlying </span><span>Fund's next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly with </span><span>their respective NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other </span><span>factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at </span><span>market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during </span><span>periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the </span><span>Fund or the Underlying Fund that differ significantly from their respective NAV. </span><span>Authorized Participants may be less willing to create or redeem Fund or Underlying </span><span>Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for such shares or its underlying </span><span>investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s or Underlying Fund's shares trading at </span><span>a premium or discount to NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.</span><span> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange </span><span>involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>13</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage </span><span>commission and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread</span><span>”</span><span>; </span><span>that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>bid</span><span>”</span><span> price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>ask</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>price).</span><span> </span><span>The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume </span><span>and market liquidity and wider if the Fund has less trading volume and market liquidity. </span><span>In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be </span><span>regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because </span><span>of the costs inherent in buying or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract </span><span>significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be </span><span>advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a </span><span>brokerage account.</span></div> <div><span>Non-U.S. Issuers Risk</span><span>. Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers have different risks from </span><span>securities issued by U.S. issuers. These risks include differences in accounting, </span><span>auditing and financial reporting standards, the possibility of expropriation or </span><span>confiscatory taxation, adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations, </span><span>political instability which could affect U.S. investments in non-U.S. countries, </span><span>uncertainties of transnational litigation, and potential restrictions on the flow of </span><span>international capital, including the possible seizure or nationalization of the securities </span><span>issued by non-U.S. issuers held by the Fund and the Underlying Fund. Non-U.S. issuers </span><span>may be subject to less governmental regulation than U.S. issuers. Moreover, individual </span><span>non-U.S. economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy in such </span><span>respects as growth of gross domestic product, rate of inflation, capital reinvestment, </span><span>resource self-sufficiency and balance of payment positions. Unfavorable political, </span><span>economic or governmental developments in non-U.S. countries could affect the </span><span>payment of a security’s principal and interest. Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers </span><span>may also be less liquid than, and more difficult to value than, securities of U.S. issuers. </span><span>In addition, the value of these securities may fluctuate due to changes in the exchange </span><span>rate of the issuer’s local currency against the U.S. dollar. </span></div> <div><span>Operational Risk.</span><span> The Fund and the Underlying Fund are exposed to operational risks </span><span>arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing </span><span>and communication errors, errors of the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's service </span><span>providers, counterparties or other third parties, failed or inadequate processes and </span><span>technology or systems failures. The Fund, the Underlying Fund and BFA seek to reduce </span><span>these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do </span><span>not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant </span><span>operational risks.</span></div> <div><span>Passive Investment Risk.</span><span> The Fund and the Underlying Fund are not actively </span><span>managed and may be affected by a general decline in market segments related to the </span><span>applicable</span><span> </span><span>Underlying Index. The Fund and the Underlying Fund invest in securities </span><span>included in, or representative of, the applicable Underlying Index, regardless of their </span><span>investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in </span><span>defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets. The </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fund may also be exposed to passive investment risk through its investment in the </span><span>Underlying Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Reliance on Trading Partners Risk.</span><span> The economies of many countries or regions in </span><span>which the Underlying Fund invests are highly dependent on trade with certain key </span><span>trading partners. Reduction in spending on products and services by these key trading </span><span>partners, institution of tariffs or other trade barriers or a slowdown in the economies of </span><span>key trading partners may adversely affect the performance of any company in which </span><span>the Underlying Fund invests and have a material adverse effect on the Fund’s </span><span>performance.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. </span><span>Investment in developed country issuers </span><span>may subject the Fund or the Underlying Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security, </span><span>economic and other risks associated with developed countries.</span><span>Developed countries </span><span>generally tend to rely on services sectors (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> the financial services sector) as the </span><span>primary means of economic growth. A prolonged slowdown in one or more services </span><span>sectors is likely to have a negative impact on economies of certain developed </span><span>countries, although economies of individual developed countries can be impacted by </span><span>slowdowns in other sectors. In the past, certain developed countries have been targets </span><span>of terrorism, and some geographic areas in which the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or the Underlying Fund </span><span>invests have experienced strained international relations due to territorial disputes, </span><span>historical animosities, defense concerns and other security concerns. These situations </span><span>may cause uncertainty in the financial markets in these countries or geographic areas </span><span>and may adversely affect the performance of the issuers to which the Fund or the </span><span>Underlying Fund has exposure. Heavy regulation of certain markets, including labor </span><span>and product markets, may have an adverse effect on certain issuers. Such regulations </span><span>may negatively affect economic growth or cause prolonged periods of recession. Many </span><span>developed countries are heavily indebted and face rising healthcare and retirement </span><span>expenses. In addition, price fluctuations of certain commodities and regulations </span><span>impacting the import of commodities may negatively affect developed country </span><span>economies.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the U.S.</span><span> A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade </span><span>regulations, inflation and/or an economic recession in the U.S. may have a material </span><span>adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed on U.S. exchanges. </span><span>Proposed and adopted policy and legislative changes in the U.S. are changing many </span><span>aspects of financial, commercial, public health, environmental, and other regulation </span><span>and may have a significant effect on U.S. markets generally, as well as on the value of </span><span>certain securities. Governmental agencies project that the U.S. will continue to </span><span>maintain elevated public debt levels for the foreseeable future. Although elevated debt </span><span>levels do not necessarily indicate or cause economic problems, elevated public debt </span><span>service costs may constrain future economic growth.</span></div> <div><span>The U.S. has developed increasingly strained relations with a number of foreign </span><span>countries. If relations with certain countries deteriorate, it could adversely affect U.S. </span><span>issuers as well as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also </span><span>experienced increased internal unrest and discord, as well as significant challenges in </span><span>managing and containing the outbreak of COVID-19. If these trends were to continue, </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>15</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>it may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the issuers in which the Fund </span><span>or the Underlying Fund invests.</span></div> <div><span>Security Risk. </span><span>Some geographic areas in which the Fund or Underlying Fund invests </span><span>have experienced acts of terrorism and strained international relations due to </span><span>territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense concerns and other security </span><span>concerns. These situations may cause uncertainty in the markets of these geographic </span><span>areas and may adversely affect their economies.</span></div> <div><span>Small Fund Risk. </span><span>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading </span><span>volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being </span><span>delisted if the Fund does not meet certain conditions of the listing exchange. If the </span><span>Fund were to be required to delist from the listing exchange, the value of the Fund may </span><span>rapidly decline and performance may be negatively impacted. Any resulting liquidation </span><span>of the Fund could cause the Fund to incur elevated transaction costs for the Fund and </span><span>negative tax consequences for its shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>Tax Risk.</span><span> The tax rules and limitations that apply to the Fund will cause some or all of </span><span>its income and gain to be taxable as ordinary income or at ordinary income rates, may </span><span>accelerate its recognition of income and gain, and may defer its use of losses, all of </span><span>which are expected to have negative tax consequences for the Fund and Fund </span><span>investors. Because the assets comprising the Underlying Index and held by the </span><span>Underlying Fund will not consist of stock, ordinary dividends from the Fund will not be </span><span>eligible for the reduced rates applicable to </span><span>“</span><span>qualified dividend income</span><span>”</span><span> or eligible for </span><span>the dividends-received deduction. The Fund expects that its ownership of shares of the </span><span>Underlying Fund and sale of call options thereon generally will constitute </span><span>“</span><span>straddles</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>(offsetting positions with respect to personal property) under section 1092 of the </span><span>Internal Revenue Code. The straddle rules generally do not apply if all the straddle’s </span><span>offsetting positions consist of </span><span>“</span><span>qualified covered call options</span><span>”</span><span> and the stock to be </span><span>purchased under the options, and the straddle is not part of a larger straddle. Unlike </span><span>certain other funds that utilize covered call strategies, the Fund does not anticipate </span><span>that this exception will be available because, as a general matter, the call options it </span><span>writes are not expected to be treated as </span><span>“</span><span>qualified covered call options.</span><span>”</span><span> The straddle </span><span>rules usually will terminate the Fund’s holding periods for its shares of the Underlying </span><span>Fund that become part of a straddle before the long-term capital gain holding period </span><span>(more than one year) has been reached, which is expected to eliminate the Fund’s </span><span>ability to recognize long-term capital gains from a sale or other disposition of such </span><span>shares. The straddle rules also usually will defer recognition of realized losses and </span><span>require the capitalization of certain interest expenses and carrying charges. Similarly, </span><span>“</span><span>wash sale</span><span>”</span><span> rules may apply to defer the recognition of loss by the Fund from the </span><span>disposition of stock or securities at a loss in a case in which identical or substantially </span><span>identical stock or securities (or an option to acquire such property) is or has been </span><span>acquired within a prescribed period. As a result of the foregoing, an investor may be </span><span>subject to significantly greater amounts of tax as a result of the investment than would </span><span>apply to an investment in a fund engaged in a different investment strategy.</span></div> <div><span>Tracking Error Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be subject to </span><span>“</span><span>tracking error,</span><span>”</span><span> which is the </span><span>divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error </span><span>may occur because of differences between the securities and other instruments held in </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>16</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing </span><span>differences</span><span> </span><span>(including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local </span><span>market close and the Fund's or an Underlying Fund's valuation of a security at the time </span><span>of calculation of the Fund's or Underlying Fund's NAV, respectively), transaction costs </span><span>incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of </span><span>the accrual or the valuation of distributions, the requirements to maintain pass-through </span><span>tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital </span><span>gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, changes to the Underlying </span><span>Index, the effect the Fund’s transactions would have on the market for the securities in </span><span>the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing </span><span>regulatory requirements, among other reasons. This risk may be heightened during </span><span>times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error </span><span>also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index </span><span>does not. </span><span>INDEX ETFs THAT TRACK INDICES WITH SIGNIFICANT </span><span>WEIGHT IN </span><span>OPTIONS </span><span>MAY EXPERIENCE HIGHER TRACKING ERROR THAN OTHER INDEX </span><span>ETFs THAT DO NOT TRACK SUCH INDICES.</span></div> <div><span>Valuation Risk.</span><span> The price the Fund and the Underlying Fund could receive upon the </span><span>sale of a security</span><span> </span><span>or other asset may differ from the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's </span><span>valuation of the security or other asset and from the value used by its underlying index, </span><span>particularly for securities or other assets that trade in low volume or volatile markets or </span><span>that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for </span><span>other reasons. Because non-U.S. exchanges may be open on days or during time </span><span>periods when the</span><span> </span><span>Underlying Fund does not price its shares, the value of the securities </span><span>or other assets in the Underlying Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time </span><span>periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s</span><span> </span><span>or the </span><span>Underlying Fund's shares. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund </span><span>shares on days when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or </span><span>more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received </span><span>had the securities not been fair valued or been valued using a different methodology. </span><span>The ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by </span><span>pricing services or other third-party service providers.</span></div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</span></div> <div><span>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated with its investments </span><span>and investment strategies</span><span> </span><span>either directly or indirectly through the Fund's investments </span><span>in the Underlying Fund. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the </span><span>significance of any particular risk factor.</span></div> <div><span>Close-Out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.</span><span> Regulations adopted by global </span><span>prudential regulators require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global </span><span>systemically important banking organizations to include contractual restrictions on </span><span>close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. </span><span>Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards </span><span>and other derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending </span><span>agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial </span><span>contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>17</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>proceedings and also prohibit the Fund from exercising default rights due to a </span><span>receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. These </span><span>requirements may increase credit risk and other risks to the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Consumer Cyclical Industry Risk.</span><span> The success of consumer cyclical companies is </span><span>tied closely to the performance of domestic and international economies, exchange </span><span>rates, interest rates, competition, consumer confidence, changes in demographics and </span><span>preferences. Companies in the consumer cyclical industry depend heavily on </span><span>disposable household income and consumer spending, and may be strongly affected </span><span>by social trends and marketing campaigns. These companies may be subject to severe </span><span>competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</span></div> <div><span>Energy Sector Risk. </span><span>The success of companies in</span><span>the energy sector may be cyclical </span><span>and highly dependent on energy prices. The market value of securities issued by </span><span>companies in the energy sector may decline for the following reasons, among others: </span><span>changes in the levels and volatility of global energy prices, energy supply and demand, </span><span>and capital expenditures on exploration and production of energy sources; exchange </span><span>rates, interest rates, economic conditions, and tax treatment; the enactment or </span><span>cessation of trade sanctions; war or other geopolitical conflicts; and energy </span><span>conservation efforts, increased competition and technological advances. Companies in </span><span>this sector may be subject to substantial government regulation and contractual fixed </span><span>pricing, which may increase the cost of doing business and limit the earnings of these </span><span>companies. A significant portion of the revenues of these companies may depend on a </span><span>relatively small number of customers, including governmental entities and utilities. As a </span><span>result, governmental budget constraints may have a material adverse effect on the </span><span>stock prices of companies in this sector. Energy companies may also operate in, or </span><span>engage in transactions involving, countries with less developed regulatory regimes or a </span><span>history of expropriation, nationalization or other adverse policies. Energy companies </span><span>also face a significant risk of liability from accidents resulting in injury or loss of life or </span><span>property, pollution or other environmental problems, equipment malfunctions or </span><span>mishandling of materials and a risk of loss from terrorism, cyber incident, political </span><span>strife or natural disasters. Any such event could have serious consequences for the </span><span>general population of the affected area and could have an adverse impact on the </span><span>Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's portfolio and the performance of the Fund. Energy </span><span>companies can be significantly affected by the supply of, and demand for, specific </span><span>products (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, oil and natural gas) and services, exploration and production spending, </span><span>government subsidization, world events and general economic conditions. Energy </span><span>companies may have relatively high levels of debt and may be more likely than other </span><span>companies to restructure their businesses if there are downturns in energy markets or </span><span>in the global economy.</span></div> <div><span>In the context of the COVID-19 outbreak and disputes among oil-producing countries </span><span>regarding potential limits on the production of crude oil, the energy sector has </span><span>experienced increased volatility. In particular, significant market volatility in the crude </span><span>oil markets as well as the oil futures markets resulted in the market price of the front </span><span>month WTI crude oil futures contracts (those with the nearest expiration date) falling </span><span>below zero for a period of time. Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February </span><span>24, 2022 has led to further disruptions and increased volatility in the energy and </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>18</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>commodity futures markets due to actual and potential disruptions in the supply and </span><span>demand for certain commodities, including oil and natural gas. In March 2022, the U.S. </span><span>announced that it would ban imports of oil, natural gas and coal from Russia. The effect </span><span>of the U.S. ban and any similar bans by other countries, as well as the extent and </span><span>duration of the Russian military action, resulting sanctions and associated market </span><span>disruptions on the energy sector, are impossible to predict and depend on a number of </span><span>factors. The effect of these events or any related developments could be significant </span><span>and may have a severe adverse effect on the performance of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>European Economic Risk. </span><span>The Economic and Monetary Union (the </span><span>“</span><span>eurozone</span><span>”</span><span>) of the </span><span>European Union (the </span><span>“</span><span>EU</span><span>”</span><span>) requires compliance by member states that are members of </span><span>the eurozone with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates and debt levels, </span><span>as well as fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every </span><span>country in Europe, including those countries that are not members of the eurozone. </span><span>Additionally, European countries outside of the eurozone may present economic risks </span><span>that are independent of the indirect effects that eurozone policies have on them. In </span><span>particular, the United Kingdom's (the </span><span>“</span><span>U.K.</span><span>”</span><span>) economy may be affected by global </span><span>economic, industrial and financial shifts. Changes in imports or exports, changes in </span><span>governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro (the </span><span>common currency of eurozone countries), the default or threat of default by an EU </span><span>member state on its sovereign debt and/or an economic recession in an EU member </span><span>state may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of other EU member </span><span>states and their trading partners. The European financial markets have historically </span><span>experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns </span><span>or government debt levels in several European countries, including, but not limited to, </span><span>Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. </span><span>These events have affected and may in the future adversely affect the exchange rate of </span><span>the euro and may significantly affect European countries.</span></div> <div><span>Responses to financial problems by European governments, central banks and others, </span><span>including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may </span><span>result in social unrest, may limit future growth and economic recovery or may have </span><span>other unintended consequences. Further defaults or restructurings by governments </span><span>and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, </span><span>financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more </span><span>countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The U.K. left the EU </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>Brexit</span><span>”</span><span> ) on January 31, 2020. The U.K. and EU reached an agreement on the terms of </span><span>their future trading relationship effective January 1, 2021, which principally relates to </span><span>the trading of goods rather than services, including financial services. Further </span><span>discussions are to be held between the U.K. and the EU in relation to matters not </span><span>covered by the trade agreement, such as financial services. The Fund and the </span><span>Underlying Fund face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and consequences </span><span>that may follow Brexit, including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and </span><span>interest rates. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, </span><span>economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political </span><span>institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. Brexit has also led to legal </span><span>uncertainty and could lead to politically divergent national laws and regulations as a </span><span>new relationship between the U.K. and EU is defined and the U.K. determines which EU </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>19</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects could adversely affect any of the </span><span>companies to which the Fund has exposure and any other assets in which the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or </span><span>the Underlying Fund invests. The political, economic and legal consequences of Brexit </span><span>are not yet fully known. In the short term, financial markets may experience </span><span>heightened volatility, particularly those in the U.K. and Europe, but possibly worldwide. </span><span>The U.K. and Europe may be less stable than they have been in recent years, and </span><span>investments in the U.K. and the EU may be difficult to value or subject to greater or </span><span>more frequent volatility. In the longer term, there is likely to be a period of significant </span><span>political, regulatory and commercial uncertainty as the U.K. continues to negotiate the </span><span>terms of its future trading relationships.</span></div> <div><span>Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain and the </span><span>independence movement in Scotland, as well as governmental or other responses to </span><span>such movements, may also create instability and uncertainty in the region. In addition, </span><span>the national politics of countries in the EU have been unpredictable and subject to </span><span>influence by disruptive political groups and ideologies. The governments of EU </span><span>countries may be subject to change and such countries may experience social and </span><span>political unrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments may result in </span><span>sudden and significant investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents </span><span>throughout Europe or war in the region could also impact financial markets. The impact </span><span>of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could </span><span>adversely affect the value and liquidity of the Fund's or Underlying Fund's investments.</span></div> <div><span>Russian Invasion of Ukraine</span><span>. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on </span><span>February 24, 2022. The extent and duration of the military action, resulting sanctions </span><span>and resulting future market disruptions, including declines in its stock markets and the </span><span>value of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but could be </span><span>significant. Disruptions caused by Russian military action or other actions (including </span><span>cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting actual and threatened responses to such </span><span>activity, including purchasing and financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in </span><span>consumer or purchaser preferences, sanctions, import and export restrictions, tariffs </span><span>or cyberattacks on the Russian government, Russian companies or Russian individuals, </span><span>including politicians, may impact Russia's economy and Russian issuers of securities in </span><span>which the Fund invests. Actual and threatened responses to Russian military action </span><span>may also impact the markets for certain Russian commodities, such as oil and natural </span><span>gas, as well as other sectors of the Russian economy, and are likely to have collateral </span><span>impacts on such sectors globally.</span></div> <div><span>Illiquid Investments Risk. </span><span>The Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, </span><span>immediately after the acquisition, the Fund would have invested more than 15% of its </span><span>net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the </span><span>Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in </span><span>seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the </span><span>investment. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, </span><span>particularly during periods of market turmoil. There can be no assurance that a security </span><span>or instrument that is deemed to be liquid when purchased will continue to be liquid for </span><span>as long as it is held by the Fund, and any security or instrument held by the Fund may </span><span>be deemed an illiquid investment pursuant to the Fund’s liquidity risk management </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>20</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>program. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid investments may </span><span>reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be unable to transact at </span><span>advantageous times or prices. An investment may be illiquid due to, among other </span><span>things, the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a </span><span>market in securities or instruments, the lack of an active market for such securities or </span><span>instruments, capital controls, delays or limits on repatriation of local currency, or </span><span>insolvency of local governments. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or </span><span>instruments with substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have </span><span>increased exposure to the risks associated with illiquid investments. Illiquid </span><span>investments may be harder to value, especially in changing markets. If the Fund is </span><span>forced to sell underlying investments at reduced prices or under unfavorable </span><span>conditions to meet redemption requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a </span><span>loss. This may be magnified in a rising interest rate environment or other </span><span>circumstances where redemptions from the Fund may be greater than normal. Other </span><span>market participants may be attempting to liquidate holdings at the same time as the </span><span>Fund, causing increased supply of the Fund’s underlying investments in the market and </span><span>contributing to illiquid investments risk and downward pricing pressure. In addition, if </span><span>the Fund is limited in its ability to sell illiquid investments during periods when </span><span>shareholders are redeeming their shares, the Fund will need to sell liquid securities to </span><span>meet redemption requests and illiquid securities will become a larger portion of the </span><span>Fund’s holdings. During periods of market volatility, liquidity in the market for the </span><span>Fund’s shares may be impacted by the liquidity in the market for the underlying </span><span>securities or instruments held by the Fund, which could lead to the Fund’s shares </span><span>trading at a premium or discount to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Technology Sector Risk.</span><span> Technology companies, including information technology </span><span>companies,</span><span> </span><span> face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which </span><span>may have an adverse effect on a company’s profit margins. Technology companies may </span><span>have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of </span><span>technology companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological </span><span>developments, frequent new product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth </span><span>rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Companies in the </span><span>technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and other intellectual property </span><span>rights. A technology company’s loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect </span><span>the company’s profitability. Companies in the technology sector are facing increased </span><span>government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or </span><span>regulatory action. The technology sector may also be adversely affected by changes or </span><span>trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced or characterized by </span><span>unpredictable factors.</span></div> <div><span>Telecommunications Sector Risk.</span><span> The telecommunications sector is subject to </span><span>extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with governmental </span><span>regulations, delays or failure to receive required regulatory approvals, or the </span><span>enactment of new regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of </span><span>telecommunications companies. Government actions around the world, specifically in </span><span>the area of pre-marketing clearance of products and prices, can be arbitrary and </span><span>unpredictable. The domestic telecommunications market is characterized by </span><span>increasing competition and regulation by various state and federal regulatory </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>21</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>authorities. Companies in the telecommunications sector may encounter distressed </span><span>cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing </span><span>competition, particularly in developing new products and services using new </span><span>technology. Technological innovations may make the products and services of certain </span><span>telecommunications companies obsolete. Telecommunications providers are generally </span><span>required to obtain franchises or licenses in order to provide services in a given </span><span>location. Licensing and franchise rights in the telecommunications sector are limited, </span><span>which may provide an advantage to certain participants. Limited availability of such </span><span>rights, high barriers to market entry and regulatory oversight, among other factors, </span><span>have led to consolidation of companies within the sector, which could lead to further </span><span>regulation or other negative effects in the future.</span></div> <div><span>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.</span><span> If certain aggregate and/or fund-level ownership </span><span>thresholds are reached through transactions undertaken by BFA, its affiliates or the </span><span>Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions or actions by an issuer or regulator, the </span><span>ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to purchase or </span><span>dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be </span><span>restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make </span><span>investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant threshold limits, and </span><span>such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio holdings</span><span> </span><span>compared to the performance of the Underlying Index.

BFA and its Affiliates provide investment </span><span>management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that may </span><span>follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA and its Affiliates are </span><span>involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management </span><span>activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in which their </span><span>interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or </span><span>one or more Affiliates act, or may act, as an investor, research provider, investment </span><span>manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, </span><span>adviser, trader, lender,</span><span> </span><span>index provider, agent and/or principal, and have other direct </span><span>and indirect interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other </span><span>instruments in which the Fund may directly or indirectly invest. The Fund may invest in </span><span>securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate </span><span>has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The Fund may also invest </span><span>in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which an Affiliate provides and is </span><span>compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of </span><span>such issuances. The Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in other </span><span>transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate provides or may in the future </span><span>provide research coverage. An Affiliate may have business relationships with, and </span><span>purchase or distribute or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants </span><span>or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, </span><span>and may receive compensation for such services. BFA or one or more Affiliates may </span><span>engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment </span><span>objectives similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for </span><span>transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the </span><span>Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end</span><span> investment companies (which may include investment companies that are </span><span>affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment </span><span>Company Act of 1940, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1940 Act</span><span>”</span><span>)).

As a result, an Affiliate may compete with </span><span>the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's </span><span>investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an Affiliate and of other </span><span>accounts managed by BlackRock or an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could </span><span>sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts </span><span>achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The opposite result is </span><span>also possible.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, the Fund may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an </span><span>Affiliate or</span><span> </span><span>its or their directors, officers, employees or clients have an adverse interest. </span><span>Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or managed by BFA or its </span><span>Affiliates may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or</span><span> </span><span>by </span><span>BFA or its Affiliates or their directors, officers or employees may have the effect of </span><span>diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund's activities may be limited because of regulatory restrictions applicable to </span><span>BFA or one or more Affiliates and/or their internal policies designed to comply with </span><span>such restrictions.</span></div> <div><span>It is also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients </span><span>(including other funds and separately managed accounts) may, subject to compliance </span><span>with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of the Fund.

Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, </span><span>shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a </span><span>Creation Unit.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange for trading during the </span><span>trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of </span><span>other publicly-traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>26</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or otherwise in the secondary </span><span>market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol </span><span>“</span><span>LQDW.</span><span>”</span></div> <div><span>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary market involves two </span><span>types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling </span><span>shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other </span><span>charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may be a significant </span><span>proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In </span><span>addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread,</span><span>”</span><span> that is, any difference between the </span><span>bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over time for shares of the Fund based </span><span>on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund </span><span>has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity (which is often the case for funds that are newly launched </span><span>or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity or illiquidity </span><span>of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller </span><span>funds or in instances of significant volatility of the underlying securities.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund does not impose restrictions on the frequency of purchases and redemptions </span><span>of Fund shares directly with the Fund. The Board determined not to adopt policies and </span><span>procedures designed to prevent or monitor for frequent purchases and redemptions of </span><span>Fund shares because the Fund generally sells and redeems its shares directly through </span><span>transactions that are in-kind and/or for cash, with a deadline for placing cash-related </span><span>transactions no later than the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio </span><span>securities. However, the Fund has taken certain measures (</span><span>e.g</span><span>., imposing transaction </span><span>fees on purchases and redemptions of Creation Units and reserving the right to reject </span><span>purchases of Creation Units under certain circumstances) to minimize the potential </span><span>consequences of frequent cash purchases and redemptions by Authorized Participants, </span><span>such as increased tracking error, disruption of portfolio management, dilution to the </span><span>Fund, and/or increased transaction costs. Further, the vast majority of trading in Fund </span><span>shares occurs on the secondary market, which does not involve the Fund directly, and </span><span>such trading is unlikely to cause many of the harmful effects of frequent cash </span><span>purchases or redemptions of Fund shares.</span></div> <div><span>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed is open for </span><span>trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays </span><span>(or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, </span><span>Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor </span><span>Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is Cboe </span><span>BZX.</span></div> <div><span>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act generally restricts investments by investment </span><span>companies, including foreign and unregistered investment companies, in the securities </span><span>of other investment companies. For example, a registered investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquired Fund</span><span>”</span><span>), such as the Fund, may not knowingly sell or otherwise dispose of any </span><span>security issued by the Acquired Fund to any investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquiring </span><span>Fund</span><span>”</span><span>) or any company or companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund if, immediately </span><span>after such sale or disposition: (i) more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of </span><span>the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and any company or companies </span><span>controlled by the Acquiring Fund or (ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding voting </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>27</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and other investment </span><span>companies and companies controlled by them. Although SEC rules may permit </span><span>registered investment companies and unit investment trusts (</span><span>“</span><span>Investing Funds</span><span>”</span><span>) that </span><span>enter into an investment agreement with the Trust to invest in iShares funds beyond </span><span>the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act subject to certain terms and </span><span>conditions, the Fund does not permit such investments. Accordingly, Investing Funds </span><span>must adhere to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act when investing </span><span>in the Fund. In addition, foreign investment companies are permitted to invest in the </span><span>Fund only up to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to any applicable SEC </span><span>no-action relief.</span></div> <div><span>Book Entry.</span><span> Shares of the Fund are held in book-entry form, which means that no </span><span>stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (</span><span>“</span><span>DTC</span><span>”</span><span>) or its nominee is </span><span>the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as shown on the records of </span><span>DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. </span><span>DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, </span><span>clearing corporations and other institutions that directly or indirectly maintain a </span><span>custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to </span><span>receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your </span><span>name, and you are not considered a registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise </span><span>any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its </span><span>participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other </span><span>securities that you hold in book-entry or </span><span>“</span><span>street name</span><span>”</span><span> form.</span></div> <div><span>Share Prices.</span><span> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market </span><span>generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as </span><span>the supply of and demand for ETF shares and underlying securities held by the Fund, </span><span>economic conditions and other factors.</span></div> <div><span>Determination of Net Asset Value. </span><span>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined </span><span>once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the close of regular trading hours of </span><span>the New York Stock Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>NYSE</span><span>”</span><span>) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day </span><span>that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that </span><span>any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are </span><span>translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as </span><span>quoted by one or more data service providers. The NAV of the Fund is calculated by </span><span>dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the value of its total assets, which </span><span>includes the value of the Underlying Fund shares in which the Fund invests, less total </span><span>liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally rounded to </span><span>the nearest cent.</span></div> <div><span>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities held by the Fund is </span><span>determined pursuant to BFA’s valuation policies and procedures. BFA has been </span><span>designated by the Board as the valuation designee for the Fund pursuant to Rule 2a-5 </span><span>under the Investment Company Act.</span></div> <div><span>Customized exchange-traded equity options may be valued using a mathematical </span><span>model which may incorporate a number of market data factors.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>28</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Equity securities and other equity instruments for which market quotations are readily </span><span>available are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the last </span><span>reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the last </span><span>traded price on the exchange or market on which the security or instrument is </span><span>primarily traded at the time of valuation. Shares of underlying open-end funds </span><span>(including money market funds) are valued at net asset value. Shares of underlying </span><span>exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs are valued at their most recent </span><span>closing price.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund values fixed-income portfolio securities using last available bid prices or </span><span>current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated prices) </span><span>supplied by the Fund's approved independent third-party pricing services, each in </span><span>accordance with BFA's valuation policies and procedures. Pricing services may use </span><span>matrix pricing or valuation models that utilize certain inputs and assumptions to derive </span><span>values. Pricing services generally value fixed-income securities assuming orderly </span><span>transactions of an institutional round lot size, but the Fund may hold or transact in such </span><span>securities in smaller odd lot sizes. Odd lots often trade at lower prices than institutional </span><span>round lots. An amortized cost method of valuation may be used with respect to debt </span><span>obligations with sixty days or less remaining to maturity unless BFA determines in good </span><span>faith that such method does not represent fair value.</span></div> <div><span>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities and money market instruments is substantially </span><span>completed each day at various times prior to the close of regular trading hours of the </span><span>NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are </span><span>determined as of such times.</span></div> <div><span>When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be </span><span>unreliable, BFA will fair value the Fund’s investments in accordance with its policies </span><span>and procedures. BFA may conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is </span><span>unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its </span><span>lack of trading or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent </span><span>price quotations or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security </span><span>or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent </span><span>to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is </span><span>listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is </span><span>available. A </span><span>“</span><span>significant event</span><span>”</span><span> is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable </span><span>business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s assets or liabilities, that </span><span>the event is likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or </span><span>closing market price of one or more assets held by, or liabilities of, the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The </span><span>fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might </span><span>reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to </span><span>extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments </span><span>using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market </span><span>valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been </span><span>sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value </span><span>prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the </span><span>prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>29</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the </span><span>performance of the Underlying Index.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends and Distributions</span></div> <div><span>General Policies.</span><span> Dividends from net investment income, if any, generally are declared </span><span>and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, </span><span>if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make </span><span>distributions on a more frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to </span><span>declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or </span><span>advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company or to avoid </span><span>imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are distributed on a </span><span>pro rata</span><span> </span><span>basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC </span><span>participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds </span><span>received from the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Dividend Reinvestment Service.</span><span> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the </span><span>Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment </span><span>Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend </span><span>distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the </span><span>availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers </span><span>may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this </span><span>service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains </span><span>will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in </span><span>the secondary market.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes.</span><span> As with any investment, you should consider how your investment in shares of </span><span>the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general </span><span>information, based on current law. There is no guarantee that shares of the Fund will </span><span>receive certain regulatory or accounting treatment. You should consult your own tax </span><span>professional about the tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Unless your investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred</span><span> retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally </span><span>will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax </span><span>consequences when the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes on Distributions.</span><span> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income, </span><span>including distributions out of the Fund's net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable </span><span>to you as ordinary income. The Fund's distributions of net long-term capital gains, if </span><span>any, in excess of net short-term capital losses are taxable as long-term capital gains, </span><span>regardless of how long you have held the shares. Long-term capital gains are eligible </span><span>for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, </span><span>depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts. Distributions </span><span>from the Fund are subject to a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax on </span><span>“</span><span>net </span><span>investment income,</span><span>”</span><span> for individuals with incomes exceeding $200,000 ($250,000 if </span><span>married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts. In general, your distributions are </span><span>subject to U.S. federal income tax for the year when they are paid. Certain </span><span>distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on December 31 of the </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>30</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>prior year. Certain states and localities may exempt from tax distributions attributable </span><span>to interest from U.S. federal government obligations.</span></div> <div><span>You may lose the ability to use foreign tax credits passed through by the Fund if your </span><span>Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending agreement.</span></div> <div><span>If the Fund's distributions exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits, all or </span><span>a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a </span><span>return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum </span><span>distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be </span><span>taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return </span><span>of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder's </span><span>cost basis and will result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those </span><span>shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost </span><span>basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the </span><span>shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends, interest and capital gains earned by the Underlying Fund with respect to </span><span>securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to withholding and other taxes </span><span>imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the </span><span>U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If more than 50% of the total assets of the </span><span>Underlying Fund at the close of a year consists of non-U.S. stocks or securities </span><span>(generally, for this purpose, depositary receipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S. </span><span>companies are treated as </span><span>“</span><span>non-U.S.</span><span>”</span><span>) (and 50% of the total assets of the Fund at the </span><span>close of the year consists of securities issued by non-U.S. issuers, or, at the close of </span><span>each quarter, shares of the Underlying Fund), the Fund may </span><span>“</span><span>pass through</span><span>”</span><span> to you </span><span>certain non-U.S. income taxes (including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund or the </span><span>Underlying Fund. This means that you would be considered to have received as an </span><span>additional dividend your share of such non-U.S. taxes, but you may be entitled to either </span><span>a corresponding tax deduction in calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain </span><span>limitations, a credit in calculating your U.S. federal income tax.</span></div> <div><span>For purposes of foreign tax credits for U.S. shareholders of the Fund, foreign capital </span><span>gains taxes may not produce associated foreign source income, limiting the availability </span><span>of such credits for U.S. persons.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund expects that its ownership of shares of the Underlying Fund and sale of call </span><span>options thereon generally will constitute </span><span>“</span><span>straddles</span><span>”</span><span> (offsetting positions with respect </span><span>to personal property) under section 1092 of the Internal Revenue Code. The straddle </span><span>rules usually will terminate the Fund’s holding periods for its shares of the Underlying </span><span>Fund that become part of a straddle before the long-term capital gain holding period </span><span>(more than one year) has been reached, which is expected to eliminate the Fund’s </span><span>ability to recognize long-term capital gains from a sale or other disposition of such </span><span>shares. The straddle rules also usually will defer recognition of realized losses and </span><span>require the capitalization of certain interest expenses and carrying charges. Further, </span><span>because the Fund is expected to invest in the Underlying Fund, the Fund’s realized </span><span>losses on sales of shares of such Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently </span><span>deferred as </span><span>“</span><span>wash sales.</span><span>”</span><span> Distributions of short-term capital gains by the Underlying </span><span>Fund will be recognized as ordinary income by the Fund and would not be offset by the </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>31</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fund’s capital loss carryforwards, if any. Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying </span><span>Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if you are a non-U.S. entity </span><span>(other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s </span><span>ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) </span><span>will generally be subject to a 30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless a lower treaty </span><span>rate applies provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income </span><span>realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital </span><span>gains or upon the sale or other disposition of shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, </span><span>interest and other income items paid to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S.</span><span> investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the U.S. Internal </span><span>Revenue Service (</span><span>“</span><span>IRS</span><span>”</span><span>) information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account </span><span>holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information </span><span>regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial </span><span>institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will </span><span>provide the IRS information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer </span><span>identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders; comply with due </span><span>diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts; report to the </span><span>IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax </span><span>on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account </span><span>holders who fail to provide the required information; and determine certain other </span><span>information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable </span><span>intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local </span><span>revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may </span><span>need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each </span><span>substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership, </span><span>unless certain exceptions apply.</span></div> <div><span>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup withholding at a 24% rate </span><span>will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer </span><span>identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes When Shares Are Sold.</span><span> Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale </span><span>of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been </span><span>held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund </span><span>shares held for one year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except </span><span>that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term</span><span> capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to </span><span>such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from </span><span>capital gain dividends, are included in </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income</span><span>”</span><span> for purposes of the </span><span>3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned above.</span></div> <div><span>The foregoing discussion summarizes some of the consequences under current U.S. </span><span>federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. </span><span>You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and sales of </span><span>shares. Consult your personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an </span><span>investment in shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>32</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Creations and Redemptions.</span><span> Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the </span><span>Fund are </span><span>“</span><span>created</span><span>”</span><span> at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in </span><span>block-size Creation Units or multiples thereof. Each </span><span>“</span><span>creator</span><span>”</span><span> or authorized participant </span><span>(an </span><span>“</span><span>Authorized Participant</span><span>”</span><span>) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, </span><span>BlackRock Investments, LLC (the </span><span>“</span><span>Distributor</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>BRIL</span><span>”</span><span>), an affiliate of BFA. An </span><span>Authorized Participant is a member or participant of a clearing agency registered with </span><span>the SEC, which has a written agreement with the Fund or one of its service providers </span><span>that allows such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and </span><span>redemption of Creation Units.</span></div> <div><span>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the Distributor and the Fund, </span><span>generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a </span><span>designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>creation basket</span><span>”</span><span>), and </span><span>an amount of cash (including any cash representing the value of substituted securities, </span><span>assets or other positions), if any, which together approximate the holdings of the Fund </span><span>in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. Similarly, shares can be </span><span>redeemed only in Creation Units, generally for a designated portfolio of securities, </span><span>assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>redemption basket</span><span>”</span><span>) held by the Fund and an amount of </span><span>cash (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted). The </span><span>Fund generally offers Creation Units partially for cash, but may, in certain </span><span>circumstances, offer Creation Units solely for cash or solely in-kind. Except when </span><span>aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by the Fund. Creation and </span><span>redemption baskets may differ and the Fund may accept </span><span>“</span><span>custom baskets.</span><span>”</span><span> More </span><span>information regarding custom baskets is contained in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> <div><span>The prices at which creations and redemptions occur are based on the next calculation </span><span>of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under </span><span>the authorized participant agreement.</span></div> <div><span>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation Units with the Fund. </span><span>Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or </span><span>for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>In the event of a system failure or other interruption, including disruptions at market </span><span>makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either </span><span>may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at </span><span>all, or the Fund may not be able to place or change orders.</span></div> <div><span>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind transactions, the Fund intends to comply </span><span>with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying </span><span>redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any </span><span>securities accepted for deposit and any securities used to satisfy redemption requests </span><span>will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities </span><span>Act of 1933, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1933 Act</span><span>”</span><span>). Further, an Authorized Participant that is </span><span>not a </span><span>“</span><span>qualified institutional buyer,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the </span><span>1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule </span><span>144A.</span></div> <div><span>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is either a member of the </span><span>Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>33</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to </span><span>creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations. Information about the </span><span>procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off </span><span>times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> <div><span>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing basis, at any point </span><span>during the life of the Fund a </span><span>“</span><span>distribution,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may </span><span>be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on </span><span>their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed </span><span>participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters </span><span>subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any </span><span>determination of whether one is an underwriter must take into account all the relevant </span><span>facts and circumstances of each particular case.</span></div> <div><span>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not </span><span>“</span><span>underwriters</span><span>”</span><span> but are </span><span>participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and </span><span>thus dealing with shares that are part of an </span><span>“</span><span>unsold allotment</span><span>”</span><span> within the meaning of </span><span>Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the 1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the </span><span>prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act.

Such payments, which may </span><span>be significant to the intermediary, are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments </span><span>are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or </span><span>indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type </span><span>are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may </span><span>make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or </span><span>the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other </span><span>financial incentives it is eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial </span><span>incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the </span><span>intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the </span><span>Fund or other iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding </span><span>these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. </span><span>Please contact your salesperson or </span><span>other investment professional for more information regarding any such </span><span>payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</span></div> <div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>35</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Financial Highlights</span></div> <div><span>The financial highlights table is intended to help investors understand the Fund’s </span><span>financial performance since inception.

Please </span><span>read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional </span><span>information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</span></div> <div><span>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund are listed for trading on </span><span>Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (</span><span>“</span><span>Cboe BZX</span><span>”</span><span>). The market price for a share of the Fund may </span><span>be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</span></div> <div><span>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly-traded securities. The Fund is designed to </span><span>track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund </span><span>represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other </span><span>instruments intended to track a market index. Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which </span><span>can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based </span><span>on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at </span><span>NAV solely by Authorized Participants and only in aggregations of a specified number of </span><span>shares (</span><span>“</span><span>Creation Units</span><span>”</span><span>). Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are </span><span>listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market </span><span>prices that change throughout the day.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund invests in a particular segment of the securities markets and seeks to track </span><span>the performance of an index consisting of securities and derivatives that is not </span><span>representative of the market as a whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of </span><span>broader asset allocation strategies. Accordingly, an investment in the Fund should not </span><span>constitute a complete investment program.</span></div> <div><span>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of financial instruments, and is </span><span>not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The </span><span>performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, </span><span>including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency valuations, asset valuations, corporate </span><span>actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of </span><span>representative sampling or from legal restrictions (such as diversification </span><span>requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to </span><span>time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments </span><span>to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise determined by BFA, any such change or </span><span>adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on </span><span>a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, </span><span>the Underlying Index performance shown for periods prior to the effective date of any </span><span>such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect </span><span>such change or adjustment. </span></div> <div><span>Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected </span><span>to have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. </span><span>“</span><span>Replication</span><span>”</span><span> is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all of the </span><span>securities in its underlying index in approximately the same proportions as in the </span><span>underlying index.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not insured or guaranteed by </span><span>the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or </span><span>any of its affiliates.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be changed without </span><span>shareholder approval.</span></div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Principal Risks</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The Fund is subject to various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of </span><span>which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability </span><span>to meet its investment objective. The Fund may be exposed to these risks directly or </span><span>indirectly through the Fund's investments in the Underlying Fund. You could lose all or </span><span>part of your investment in the Fund, and the Fund could underperform other </span><span>investments. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of </span><span>any particular risk factor. The Fund discloses its portfolio holdings daily at </span><span>www.iShares.com</span><span>.</span></div> <div><span>Asset Class Risk.</span><span> The securities</span><span> </span><span>and other assets in the Fund’s or the Underlying </span><span>Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that </span><span>track other issuers, countries, groups of countries, regions, industries, groups of </span><span>industries, markets, market segments, asset classes or sectors. Various types of </span><span>securities may experience cycles of outperformance and underperformance in </span><span>comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a number of factors </span><span>including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, global demand for </span><span>local products or resources, and regulation and governmental controls. This may cause </span><span>the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that invest in different asset </span><span>classes.</span></div> <div><span>Assets Under Management (AUM) Risk.</span><span> From time to time, an Authorized </span><span>Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s </span><span>adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a specific period </span><span>of time to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</span><span> </span><span>can be no assurance that any </span><span>such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund would be </span><span>maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. </span><span>Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of </span><span>those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption </span><span>transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized </span><span>Participants on an agency basis (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, on behalf of other market participants). To the </span><span>extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with </span><span>creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized </span><span>Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares </span><span>may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading </span><span>halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened </span><span>because ETFs, such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or </span><span>other securities or instruments that are less widely traded often involve greater </span><span>settlement and operational issues and capital costs for Authorized Participants, which </span><span>may limit the availability of Authorized Participants.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Calculation Methodology Risk.</span><span> The Index Provider</span><span> </span><span>relies on various sources of </span><span>information to assess the criteria of components of the Underlying Index, including </span><span>information that may be based on assumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund nor </span><span>BFA can offer assurances that the Index Provider's calculation methodology or sources </span><span>of information will provide an accurate assessment of included components.</span></div> <div><span>Call Risk.</span><span> During periods of falling interest rates, an issuer of a callable bond held by </span><span>the Underlying Fund may </span><span>“</span><span>call</span><span>”</span><span> or repay the security before its stated maturity, and the </span><span>Underlying Fund may have to reinvest the proceeds in securities with lower yields, </span><span>which would result in a decline in the Fund’s income, or in securities with greater risks </span><span>or with other less favorable features.</span></div> <div><span>Concentration Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, </span><span>including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than </span><span>the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's </span><span>investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular </span><span>issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of </span><span>industries, project types, group of project types, sector, market segment or asset </span><span>class. The Fund may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of those </span><span>securities and/or other assets, may experience increased price volatility and may be </span><span>more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences </span><span>affecting those securities and/or other assets than a fund that does not concentrate </span><span>its investments.</span></div> <div><span>Consumer Cyclical Industry Risk.</span><span> The success of consumer cyclical companies is </span><span>tied closely to the performance of domestic and international economies, exchange </span><span>rates, interest rates, competition, consumer confidence, changes in demographics and </span><span>preferences. Companies in the consumer cyclical industry depend heavily on </span><span>disposable household income and consumer spending, and may be strongly affected </span><span>by social trends and marketing campaigns. These companies may be subject to severe </span><span>competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</span></div> <div><span>Covered Call Option Risk.</span><span> By writing covered call options in return for the receipt of </span><span>premiums, the Fund will give up the opportunity to benefit from potential increases in </span><span>the value of the Underlying Fund above the exercise prices of the written options, but </span><span>will continue to bear the risk of declines in the value of the Underlying Fund. The </span><span>premiums received from the options may not be sufficient to offset any losses </span><span>sustained from the volatility of the Underlying Fund over time. In addition, the Fund’s </span><span>ability to sell shares of the Underlying Fund will be limited while the option is in effect </span><span>unless the Fund extinguishes the option position through the purchase of an offsetting </span><span>identical option prior to the expiration of the written option.</span></div> <div><span>The covered call strategy may be subject to imperfect matching or price correlation </span><span>between the written options and the Underlying Fund, which could reduce the Fund’s </span><span>returns. Exchanges may suspend the trading of options (for example due to volatile </span><span>markets or if trading in the Underlying Fund is halted). If trading is suspended, the Fund </span><span>may be unable to write or purchase options at times that may be desirable or </span><span>advantageous to the Fund to do so. If the Fund is unable to extinguish the option </span><span>position before exercise, the Fund may be required to deliver the corresponding shares </span><span>of the Underlying Fund, resulting in increased transaction costs, tracking error, </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>underinvestment, and potentially the realization of capital gains. Further, this could </span><span>lead to re-purchasing shares of the Underlying Fund or selling the corresponding </span><span>options at a less favorable price than the Fund might have received had the options </span><span>been extinguished. The Fund uses options which are struck once per month, and the </span><span>timing of changes in the price of the Underlying Fund may affect the Fund’s </span><span>performance. For example, if the Underlying Fund experiences a drop in price followed </span><span>by a quick rebound, the Fund may be unable to fully participate in the rebound if the </span><span>rebound occurs immediately after the Fund’s roll date. In addition, if trading is </span><span>suspended, the Fund may be unable to purchase an offsetting option for purposes of </span><span>closing out an existing written option at the originally scheduled time and date.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund will be affected by movements in interest rates and bond yields and the </span><span>resulting share price of the Underlying Fund. In a falling interest rate environment and </span><span>other environments in which credit spreads narrow, the Underlying Fund is generally </span><span>expected to appreciate in price, and the Fund may underperform the Underlying Fund </span><span>as price appreciation for the Fund is limited to the exercise prices of the options </span><span>written by the Fund. Credit spread is generally the difference in yield between two </span><span>bonds with the same maturity but different credit ratings and can be impacted by </span><span>interest rates or underlying economic conditions.</span></div> <div><span>Credit Risk.</span><span> Credit risk is the risk that the issuer or guarantor of a debt instrument or </span><span>the counterparty to a derivatives contract, repurchase agreement or loan of portfolio </span><span>securities will be unable or unwilling to make its timely interest and/or principal </span><span>payments when due or otherwise honor its obligations. There are varying degrees of </span><span>credit risk, depending on an issuer’s or counterparty’s financial condition and on the </span><span>terms of an obligation, which may be reflected in the issuer’s or counterparty’s credit </span><span>rating. There is the chance that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's portfolio holdings </span><span>will have their credit ratings downgraded or will default (</span><span>i.e., </span><span>fail to make scheduled </span><span>interest or principal payments), or that the market’s perception of an issuer’s </span><span>creditworthiness may worsen, potentially reducing the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's </span><span>income level or share price.</span></div> <div><span>Cybersecurity Risk.</span><span> The Fund,</span><span> </span><span>the Underlying Fund,</span><span> </span><span>Authorized Participants, service </span><span>providers and the relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information </span><span>security and related </span><span>“</span><span>cyber</span><span>”</span><span> risks both directly and through their service providers. </span><span>Similar types of cybersecurity risks are also present for issuers of securities in which </span><span>the Fund or the Underlying Fund invest, which could result in material adverse </span><span>consequences for such issuers and may cause the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's </span><span>investment in such issuers to lose value. In general, cyber incidents can result from </span><span>deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are not limited </span><span>to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, through </span><span>“</span><span>hacking</span><span>”</span><span> or malicious </span><span>software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, </span><span>corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyberattacks may also be carried </span><span>out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing </span><span>denial-of-service attacks on websites (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, efforts to make network services unavailable </span><span>to intended users). Recently, geopolitical tensions may have increased the scale and </span><span>sophistication of deliberate attacks, particularly those from nation-states or from </span><span>entities with nation-state backing. </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Cybersecurity failures by, or breaches of, the systems of the Fund's or the Underlying </span><span>Fund's adviser, distributor and other service providers (including, but not limited to, </span><span>index and benchmark providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and </span><span>administrators), market makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in </span><span>which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invest have the ability to cause disruptions and </span><span>impact business operations, potentially resulting in: financial losses, interference with </span><span>the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's ability to calculate its NAV, disclosure of </span><span>confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of erroneous </span><span>trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund, the </span><span>Underlying Fund or their service providers to transact business, violations of applicable </span><span>privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, </span><span>reimbursement or other compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In </span><span>addition, cyberattacks may render records of Fund assets and transactions, </span><span>shareholder ownership of Fund shares, and other data integral to the functioning of the </span><span>Fund or the Underlying Fund inaccessible, inaccurate or incomplete. Substantial costs </span><span>may be incurred by the Fund or the Underlying Fund in order to resolve or prevent </span><span>cyber incidents in the future. While the Fund and the Underlying Fund have established </span><span>business continuity plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, </span><span>such cyber incidents, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems, </span><span>including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified, that prevention and </span><span>remediation efforts will not be successful or that cyberattacks will go undetected. </span><span>Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place </span><span>by service providers to the Fund or Underlying Fund, issuers in which the Fund or </span><span>Underlying Fund invests, the Index Provider, market makers or Authorized Participants. </span><span>The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result.</span></div> <div><span>Derivatives Risk.</span><span>The Fund will use covered calls, which are options, in seeking to </span><span>achieve the Fund’s investment objective. The Fund’s use of options, like investment in </span><span>other derivatives, may reduce the Fund’s returns or increase volatility. A risk of the </span><span>Fund’s use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate with </span><span>the value of the underlying asset, the performance of the asset class to which the Fund </span><span>seeks exposure or to the performance of the overall securities markets. Since the </span><span>Fund’s covered call options are written on shares of the Underlying Fund, if the </span><span>increase in the price of the Underlying Fund is significantly above the exercise price of </span><span>a written option, the Fund would likely substantially underperform the Underlying Fund. </span><span>In addition, implied volatility is one of the primary inputs in options pricing. As volatility </span><span>increases, the value of an option also increases (and vice-versa). Changes in the level </span><span>of volatility can affect the amount of premium the Fund will receive from writing </span><span>options and increased volatility may increase the cost the Fund pays to close out an </span><span>open option position.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund’s use of derivatives may reduce the Fund’s returns or increase volatility. </span><span>Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, a currency, an index or a market </span><span>to fluctuate significantly in price within a short time period. Derivatives may also be </span><span>subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will </span><span>not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund’s use of derivatives is that the </span><span>fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the value of the underlying </span><span>asset, the performance of the asset class to which the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund seeks </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>exposure or the performance of the overall markets. The possible lack of a liquid </span><span>secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying </span><span>Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or </span><span>Underlying Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or </span><span>Underlying Fund to value accurately. The Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund could also suffer </span><span>losses related to its derivatives positions as a result of unanticipated market </span><span>movements, or movements between the time of periodic reallocations of Fund</span><span> </span><span>or </span><span>Underlying Fund assets, which losses are potentially unlimited. Certain derivatives may </span><span>give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund to greater </span><span>risk and increase its costs.</span><span> </span><span>To the extent that the Fund invests in rolling futures </span><span>contracts, it may be subject to additional risk. The impact of U.S. and global regulation </span><span>of derivatives may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of </span><span>derivatives, may delay or restrict the exercise by the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund of </span><span>termination rights or remedies upon a counterparty default under derivatives held by </span><span>the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund (which could result in losses), or may otherwise adversely </span><span>affect the value or performance of derivatives. In addition, the Fund's use of derivatives </span><span>may expose the Fund to risks related to potential operational issues, such as </span><span>documentation and settlement issues, systems failures, inadequate controls and </span><span>human error. Derivatives may also involve legal risks, including insufficient </span><span>documentation, insufficient capacity or authority of a counterparty, and legality and </span><span>enforceability of a contract.</span></div> <div><span>Distribution Tax Risk.</span><span> The Fund currently expects to make distributions on a regular </span><span>basis. While the Fund will normally pay its income as distributions, the Fund's </span><span>distributions may exceed the Fund's income and gains for the Fund's taxable year. The </span><span>Fund may be required to reduce its distributions if it has insufficient income. </span><span>Distributions in excess of the Fund's current and accumulated earnings and profits will </span><span>be treated as a return of capital. Distributions in excess of the Fund's minimum </span><span>distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund's earnings and profits, will be </span><span>taxable to Fund shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A </span><span>return of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the </span><span>shareholder's cost basis and will result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss </span><span>when those Fund shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a Fund </span><span>shareholder's cost basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as </span><span>capital gain, if the Fund shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets. </span><span>Because the Fund's distributions may consist of return of capital, the Fund may not be </span><span>an appropriate investment for investors who do not want their principal investment in </span><span>the Fund to decrease over time or who do not wish to receive return of capital in a </span><span>given period.</span></div> <div><span>Geographic Risk.</span><span> Some of the companies in which the Fund or the Underlying Fund </span><span>invests are located in parts of the world that have historically been prone to natural </span><span>disasters, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, droughts, floods, </span><span>hurricanes or tsunamis, and are economically sensitive to environmental events. Any </span><span>such event may adversely impact the economies of these geographic areas or business </span><span>operations of companies in these geographic areas, causing an adverse impact on the </span><span>value of the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>6</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>High Yield Securities Risk.</span><span> Securities that are rated below investment-grade </span><span>(commonly referred to as </span><span>“</span><span>junk bonds,</span><span>”</span><span> which may include those bonds rated below </span><span>“</span><span>BBB-</span><span>”</span><span> by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch, or below </span><span>“</span><span>Baa3</span><span>”</span><span> by Moody’s), or are unrated, </span><span>may be deemed speculative, may involve greater levels of risk than higher-rated </span><span>securities of similar maturity and may be more likely to default. </span></div> <div><span>The major risks of high yield securities investments include:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>High yield securities may be issued by less creditworthy issuers. Issuers of high yield </span><span>securities may have a larger amount of outstanding debt relative to their assets than </span><span>issuers of investment-grade bonds. In the event of an issuer’s bankruptcy, claims of </span><span>other creditors may have priority over the claims of high yield securities holders, </span><span>leaving few or no assets available to repay high yield securities holders.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>Prices of high yield securities are subject to extreme price fluctuations. Adverse </span><span>changes in an issuer’s industry and general economic conditions may have a greater </span><span>impact on the prices of high yield securities than on other higher rated fixed-income </span><span>securities. The credit rating of a high yield security does not necessarily address its </span><span>market value risk. Ratings and market value may change from time to time, </span><span>positively or negatively, to reflect new developments regarding the issuer.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>Issuers of high yield securities may be unable to meet their interest or principal </span><span>payment obligations because of an economic downturn, specific issuer </span><span>developments, or the unavailability of additional financing.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>High yield securities frequently have redemption features that permit an issuer to </span><span>repurchase the security from the Underlying Fund before it matures. If the issuer </span><span>redeems high yield securities held by the Underlying Fund, the Underlying Fund may </span><span>have to invest the proceeds in bonds with lower yields and may lose income.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>High yield securities may be less liquid than higher rated fixed-income securities, </span><span>even under normal economic conditions. There are fewer dealers in the high yield </span><span>securities market, and there may be significant differences in the prices quoted for </span><span>high yield securities by the dealers. Because high yield securities may be less liquid </span><span>than higher rated fixed-income securities, judgment may play a greater role in </span><span>valuing certain of the Fund's</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund's securities than is the case with </span><span>securities trading in a more liquid market.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>The Fund</span><span> </span><span>or the Underlying Fund may incur expenses to the extent necessary to </span><span>seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms with a defaulting issuer.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>Income Risk.</span><span> The Fund’s income may decline if yields fall because the Fund or the </span><span>Underlying Fund may hold a significant portion of short duration securities and/or </span><span>securities that have floating or variable interest rates. The Fund’s income may decline </span><span>because the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests in lower yielding bonds as bonds in its </span><span>portfolio mature, are near maturity or are called, or when the Fund or the Underlying </span><span>Fund needs to purchase additional bonds. The Fund’s income from option premiums </span><span>may fall due to changes in market conditions.</span></div> <div><span>Index-Related Risk.</span><span> The Fund seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to </span><span>the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as </span><span>published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any </span><span>agents that may act on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>7</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the </span><span>Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to </span><span>achieve, neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any </span><span>liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or </span><span>its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in line with </span><span>the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to </span><span>manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider </span><span>to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee against the Index Provider’s or </span><span>any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the </span><span>data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not </span><span>be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, </span><span>particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or </span><span>managers. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its </span><span>shareholders. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains </span><span>incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and </span><span>would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Shareholders </span><span>should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund </span><span>and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will </span><span>be borne by the Fund and its shareholders. Because the Index Provider is relatively new </span><span>to the creation of securities indexes, there may be a greater risk that index errors will </span><span>not be detected as quickly as they might be in the case of an index maintained by a </span><span>long-standing index provider.</span></div> <div><span>Unusual market conditions or other unforeseen circumstances (such as natural </span><span>disasters, political unrest or war) may impact the Index Provider or a third-party data </span><span>provider, and could cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance to the </span><span>Underlying Index. This could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or </span><span>expected composition. The postponement of a scheduled rebalance could mean that </span><span>constituents of the Underlying Index that would otherwise be removed at rebalance </span><span>due to changes in market value, issuer credit ratings, or other reasons may remain, </span><span>causing the performance and constituents of the Underlying Index to vary from those </span><span>expected under normal conditions. Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index </span><span>Provider or its agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying </span><span>Index due to reaching certain weighting constraints, unusual market conditions or </span><span>corporate events or, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index </span><span>constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances </span><span>its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the </span><span>Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such </span><span>portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Therefore, </span><span>errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the Index Provider or its agents </span><span>to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Infectious Illness Risk. </span><span>A widespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as the </span><span>COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect the economies of many nations and the </span><span>global economy and may impact individual issuers and capital markets in ways that </span><span>cannot be foreseen.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in travel restrictions, closed international </span><span>borders, disruption of healthcare services, prolonged quarantines, cancellations, </span><span>supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, temporary and permanent closures </span><span>of businesses, layoffs, defaults and other significant economic, social and political </span><span>impacts, as well as general concern and uncertainty.</span></div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in extreme volatility, severe losses, credit </span><span>deterioration of issuers, and disruptions in markets, which could adversely impact the </span><span>Fund and its investments, including impairing any hedging activity.</span></div> <div><span>Certain local markets may be subject to closures. Any suspension of trading in markets </span><span>in which the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or the Underlying Fund invests will have an impact on the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or </span><span>Underlying Fund and its investments and will impact the Fund’s</span><span> </span><span>or the Underlying </span><span>Fund's ability to purchase or sell securities in such markets.</span><span> </span><span>Market or economic </span><span>disruptions could result in elevated tracking error and increased premiums or </span><span>discounts to the Fund's NAV. Additionally, an outbreak could impair the operations of </span><span>the Fund’s service providers, including BFA, which could adversely impact the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Governmental and quasi-governmental authorities and regulators throughout the world </span><span>may respond to an outbreak and any resulting economic disruptions with a variety of </span><span>fiscal and monetary policy changes, including direct capital infusions into companies </span><span>and other issuers, new monetary policy tools, and changes in interest rates. A reversal </span><span>of these policies, or the ineffectiveness of such policies, is likely to increase market </span><span>volatility, which could adversely affect the Fund’s investments.</span></div> <div><span>An outbreak may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social and economic risks in </span><span>certain countries or globally, which could adversely affect the Fund and its investments </span><span>and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Despite the development of vaccines, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its </span><span>effects cannot be predicted with certainty.</span></div> <div><span>Interest Rate Risk.</span><span> If interest rates rise, the value of fixed-income securities or other </span><span>instruments held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund would likely decrease. A measure </span><span>investors commonly use to determine this price sensitivity is called duration. Fixed-income</span><span> securities with longer durations tend to be more sensitive to interest rate </span><span>changes, usually making their prices more volatile than those of securities with shorter </span><span>durations. For example, if a bond has a duration of five years and interest rates rise, </span><span>the price of the bond will likely decline by a greater percentage than if the bond had a </span><span>one year duration. To the extent the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests a substantial </span><span>portion of its assets in fixed-income securities with longer duration, rising interest rates </span><span>may cause the value of the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments to decline </span><span>significantly, which would adversely affect the value of the Fund. An increase in interest </span><span>rates may lead to heightened volatility in the fixed-income markets and adversely </span><span>affect certain investments, including those held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. </span><span>Because rates on certain floating rate debt securities typically reset only periodically, </span><span>changes in prevailing interest rates (and particularly sudden and significant changes) </span><span>can be expected to cause some fluctuations in the net asset value of the Underlying </span><span>Fund to the extent that it invests in floating rate debt securities. In addition, decreases </span><span>in fixed income dealer market-making capacity may lead to lower trading volume, </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>9</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>heightened volatility, wider bid-ask spreads and less transparent pricing in certain </span><span>fixed-income markets.</span></div> <div><span>The historically low interest rate environment in recent years was created in part by the </span><span>world’s major central banks keeping their overnight policy interest rates at, near or </span><span>below zero percent and implementing monetary policy facilities, such as asset </span><span>purchase programs, to anchor longer-term interest rates below historical levels. During </span><span>periods of very low or negative interest rates, the Fund may be unable to maintain </span><span>positive returns or pay dividends to Fund shareholders. Certain countries have recently </span><span>experienced negative interest rates on certain fixed-income instruments. Very low or </span><span>negative interest rates may magnify interest rate risk. Changing interest rates, </span><span>including rates that fall below zero, may have unpredictable effects on markets, result </span><span>in heightened market volatility and detract from the Fund’s performance to the extent </span><span>the Fund is exposed to such interest rates. Additionally, under certain market </span><span>conditions in which interest rates are set at low levels and the market prices of </span><span>portfolio securities have increased, the Fund or the Underlying Fund may have a very </span><span>low or even negative yield. A low or negative yield would cause the Fund or the </span><span>Underlying Fund to lose money in certain conditions and over certain time periods. </span><span>Central banks may increase their short-term policy rates or begin phasing out, or </span><span>“</span><span>tapering,</span><span>”</span><span> accommodative monetary policy facilities in the future. The timing, </span><span>coordination, magnitude and effect of such policy changes on various markets are </span><span>uncertain, and such changes in monetary policy may adversely affect the value of the </span><span>Fund’s investments.</span></div> <div><span>Investment in the Underlying Fund Risk.</span><span> The Fund expects to invest a substantial </span><span>portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is </span><span>likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund. The Fund may </span><span>also invest in other funds, including money market funds. The Fund’s NAV will change </span><span>with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other investments based on their </span><span>market valuations. An investment in the Fund will entail more direct and indirect costs </span><span>and expenses than a direct investment in the Underlying Fund. For example, in addition </span><span>to the expenses of the Fund, the Fund indirectly pays a portion of the expenses </span><span>(including operating expenses and management fees) incurred by the Underlying Fund, </span><span>although some of such fees will be offset by the fee waiver by BFA.</span></div> <div><span>An investor in the Fund may receive taxable gains from portfolio transactions by the </span><span>Underlying Fund, as well as taxable gains from transactions in shares of the Underlying </span><span>Fund held by the Fund. The Fund and the Underlying Fund may also hold common </span><span>portfolio securities.</span></div> <div><span>As the Fund's allocation to the Underlying Fund changes from time to time, or to the </span><span>extent that the total annual fund operating expenses of the Underlying Fund change, </span><span>the weighted average operating expenses borne by the Fund may increase or decrease.</span></div> <div><span>Issuer Risk. </span><span>The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual </span><span>securities to which the Fund or the Underlying Fund has exposure. The Fund may be </span><span>adversely affected if an issuer of underlying securities held by the Fund or the </span><span>Underlying Fund is unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due. Any </span><span>issuer of these securities may perform poorly, causing the value of its securities to </span><span>decline. Poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions, competitive </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>pressures, changes in technology, expiration of patent protection, disruptions in </span><span>supply, labor problems or shortages, corporate restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, </span><span>credit deterioration of the issuer or other factors. Changes to the financial condition or </span><span>credit rating of an issuer of those securities may cause the value of the securities to </span><span>decline. An issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries, states </span><span>and regions in which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts </span><span>operations.</span></div> <div><span>Large Shareholder and Large-Scale Redemption Risk.</span><span> Certain shareholders, </span><span>including an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an </span><span>affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, a market maker, or another entity, may from time to time </span><span>own or manage a substantial amount of Fund shares or may invest in the Fund and </span><span>hold their investment for a limited period of time. These shareholders may also pledge </span><span>or loan Fund shares (to secure financing or otherwise), which may result in the shares </span><span>becoming concentrated in another party. There can be no assurance that any large </span><span>shareholder or large group of shareholders would not redeem their investment or that </span><span>the size of the Fund would be maintained. Redemptions of a large number of Fund </span><span>shares by these shareholders may adversely affect the Fund’s liquidity and net assets. </span><span>To the extent the Fund permits redemptions in cash, these redemptions may force the </span><span>Fund to sell portfolio securities when it might not otherwise do so, which may </span><span>negatively impact the Fund’s NAV, have a material effect on the market price of the </span><span>Shares and increase the Fund’s brokerage costs and/or accelerate the realization of </span><span>taxable income and/or gains and cause the Fund to make taxable distributions to its </span><span>shareholders earlier than the Fund otherwise would have. In addition, under certain </span><span>circumstances, non-redeeming shareholders may be treated as receiving a </span><span>disproportionately large taxable distribution during or with respect to such tax year. </span><span>The Fund also may be required to sell its more liquid Fund investments to meet a large </span><span>redemption, in which case the Fund’s remaining assets may be less liquid, more </span><span>volatile, and more difficult to price. To the extent these large shareholders transact in </span><span>shares on the secondary market, such transactions may account for a large </span><span>percentage of the trading volume for the shares of the Fund and may, therefore, have a </span><span>material upward or downward effect on the market price of the Fund shares. In </span><span>addition, large purchases of Fund shares may adversely affect the Fund’s performance </span><span>to the extent that the Fund is delayed in investing new cash and is required to maintain </span><span>a larger cash position than it ordinarily would, diluting its investment returns.</span></div> <div><span>Management Risk. </span><span>Because BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, </span><span>the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities not </span><span>included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that BFA’s </span><span>investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of </span><span>constraints, may not produce the intended results. The Fund is also subject to the risk </span><span>that the investment strategy of the Underlying Fund may not produce the intended </span><span>results.</span></div> <div><span>Market Risk.</span><span> The Fund</span><span> </span><span>and the Underlying Fund could lose money over short periods </span><span>due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged </span><span>market downturns.</span><span> </span><span>Market risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future values of </span><span>financial instruments and may be influenced by price, currency and interest rate </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>movements. It represents the potential loss the Fund and the Underlying Fund may </span><span>suffer through holding financial instruments in the face of market movements or </span><span>uncertainty. The value of a security, asset, or other instrument may decline due to </span><span>changes in general market conditions, economic trends or events that are not </span><span>specifically related to the issuer of the security</span><span> </span><span>or other asset, or factors that affect a </span><span>particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group </span><span>of industries, sector or asset class. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of </span><span>terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, or </span><span>other events could have a significant impact on the Fund, the Underlying Fund and </span><span>their investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s</span><span> </span><span>or </span><span>Underlying Fund's NAV. During a general market downturn, multiple asset classes may </span><span>be negatively affected. Fixed-income securities with short-term maturities are generally </span><span>less sensitive to such changes than are fixed-income securities with longer-term </span><span>maturities. Changes in market conditions and interest rates generally do not have the </span><span>same impact on all types of securities and instruments.</span></div> <div><span>Market Trading Risk.</span></div> <div><span>Absence of Active Market.</span><span> Although shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund are </span><span>listed for trading on one or more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an </span><span>active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers </span><span>or Authorized Participants.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Secondary Listings. </span><span>The Fund's and the Underlying Fund's shares may be listed </span><span>or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange </span><span>where the Fund's primary listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made available </span><span>to non-U.S. investors through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to </span><span>depositary receipts. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s or the Underlying </span><span>Fund's shares will continue to trade on any such stock exchange or in any market or </span><span>that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares will continue to meet the requirements </span><span>for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's or the Underlying </span><span>Fund's shares may be less actively traded in certain markets than in others, and </span><span>investors are subject to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of </span><span>the market where they or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain </span><span>information available to investors who trade Fund or Underlying Fund shares on a U.S. </span><span>stock exchange during regular U.S. market hours may not be available to investors who </span><span>trade in other markets, which may result in secondary market prices in such markets </span><span>being less efficient.</span></div> <div><span>Secondary Market Trading Risk.</span><span> Shares of the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or the Underlying Fund may trade in </span><span>the secondary market at times when the Fund or the Underlying Fund does not accept </span><span>orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such times, shares may trade in the </span><span>secondary market with more significant premiums or discounts than might be </span><span>experienced at times when the Fund or the Underlying Fund accepts purchase and </span><span>redemption orders. If the Fund purchases shares of the Underlying Fund at a time when </span><span>the market price of Underlying Fund shares is at a premium to its NAV or sells </span><span>Underlying Fund shares when their market price is at a discount to its NAV, the Fund </span><span>may incur losses.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>12</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Secondary market trading in Fund or Underlying Fund shares may be halted by a stock </span><span>exchange because of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in </span><span>Fund or Underlying Fund shares on a stock exchange or in any market may be subject </span><span>to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to </span><span>“</span><span>circuit breaker</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>rules on the stock exchange or market.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund or the Underlying Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed on a </span><span>stock exchange, may be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased </span><span>volatility and price decreases associated with being sold short. In addition, trading </span><span>activity in derivative products based on the Fund or the Underlying Fund may lead to </span><span>increased trading volume and volatility in the secondary market for the shares of the </span><span>Fund or the Underlying Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV.</span><span> Shares </span><span>of the Fund and the Underlying Fund each trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above </span><span>or below the respective Fund’s and the Underlying Fund's most recent NAV. The NAV of </span><span>the Fund and the Underlying Fund are calculated at the end of each business day and </span><span>fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's </span><span>holdings. The trading price of each of the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's shares </span><span>fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours</span><span> </span><span>based on both market supply of and </span><span>demand for their shares and the underlying value of their portfolio holdings or NAV. As </span><span>a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s and the Underlying Fund's shares may deviate </span><span>significantly from NAV during periods of market volatility, including during periods of </span><span>significant redemption requests or other unusual market conditions. </span><span>ANY OF THESE </span><span>FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S OR THE UNDERLYING </span><span>FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</span><span>. However, </span><span>because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes </span><span>that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund or the Underlying Fund, as </span><span>applicable, are not likely to be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many </span><span>closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and </span><span>sometimes at premiums to, their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature is </span><span>designed to make it more likely that the Fund’s</span><span> </span><span>or the Underlying Fund's shares </span><span>normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the Fund’s or the Underlying </span><span>Fund's next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly with </span><span>their respective NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other </span><span>factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at </span><span>market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during </span><span>periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the </span><span>Fund or the Underlying Fund that differ significantly from their respective NAV. </span><span>Authorized Participants may be less willing to create or redeem Fund or Underlying </span><span>Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for such shares or its underlying </span><span>investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s or Underlying Fund's shares trading at </span><span>a premium or discount to NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.</span><span> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange </span><span>involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or </span><span>selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage </span><span>commission and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread</span><span>”</span><span>; </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>13</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>bid</span><span>”</span><span> price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>ask</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>price).</span><span> </span><span>The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume </span><span>and market liquidity and wider if the Fund has less trading volume and market liquidity. </span><span>In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be </span><span>regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because </span><span>of the costs inherent in buying or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract </span><span>significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be </span><span>advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a </span><span>brokerage account.</span></div> <div><span>Operational Risk.</span><span> The Fund and the Underlying Fund are exposed to operational risks </span><span>arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing </span><span>and communication errors, errors of the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's service </span><span>providers, counterparties or other third parties, failed or inadequate processes and </span><span>technology or systems failures. The Fund, the Underlying Fund and BFA seek to reduce </span><span>these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do </span><span>not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant </span><span>operational risks.</span></div> <div><span>Passive Investment Risk.</span><span> The Fund and the Underlying Fund are not actively </span><span>managed and may be affected by a general decline in market segments related to the </span><span>applicable</span><span> </span><span>Underlying Index. The Fund and the Underlying Fund invest in securities </span><span>included in, or representative of, the applicable Underlying Index, regardless of their </span><span>investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in </span><span>defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets. The </span><span>Fund may also be exposed to passive investment risk through its investment in the </span><span>Underlying Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Privately Issued Securities Risk. </span><span>The Underlying Fund will invest in privately issued </span><span>securities, including those that are normally purchased pursuant to Rule 144A or </span><span>Regulation S under the 1933 Act. Privately issued securities typically may be resold </span><span>only to qualified institutional buyers, or in a privately negotiated transaction, or to a </span><span>limited number of purchasers, or in limited quantities after they have been held for a </span><span>specified period of time and other conditions are met for an exemption from </span><span>registration. Because there may be relatively few potential purchasers for such </span><span>securities, especially under adverse market or economic conditions or in the event of </span><span>adverse changes in the financial condition of the issuer, the Underlying Fund may find </span><span>it more difficult to sell such securities when it may be advisable to do so or it may be </span><span>able to sell such securities only at prices lower than if such securities were more </span><span>widely held and traded. At times, it also may be more difficult to determine the fair </span><span>value of such securities for purposes of computing the Fund’s NAV due to the absence </span><span>of an active trading market. There can be no assurance that a privately issued security </span><span>that is deemed to be liquid when purchased will continue to be liquid for as long as it is </span><span>held by the Fund</span><span> </span><span>and the Underlying Fund, and its value may decline as a result.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the U.S.</span><span> A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade </span><span>regulations, inflation and/or an economic recession in the U.S. may have a material </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed on U.S. exchanges. </span><span>Proposed and adopted policy and legislative changes in the U.S. are changing many </span><span>aspects of financial, commercial, public health, environmental, and other regulation </span><span>and may have a significant effect on U.S. markets generally, as well as on the value of </span><span>certain securities. Governmental agencies project that the U.S. will continue to </span><span>maintain elevated public debt levels for the foreseeable future. Although elevated debt </span><span>levels do not necessarily indicate or cause economic problems, elevated public debt </span><span>service costs may constrain future economic growth.</span></div> <div><span>The U.S. has developed increasingly strained relations with a number of foreign </span><span>countries. If relations with certain countries deteriorate, it could adversely affect U.S. </span><span>issuers as well as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also </span><span>experienced increased internal unrest and discord, as well as significant challenges in </span><span>managing and containing the outbreak of COVID-19. If these trends were to continue, </span><span>it may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the issuers in which the Fund </span><span>or the Underlying Fund invests.</span></div> <div><span>Security Risk. </span><span>Some geographic areas in which the Fund or Underlying Fund invests </span><span>have experienced acts of terrorism and strained international relations due to </span><span>territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense concerns and other security </span><span>concerns. These situations may cause uncertainty in the markets of these geographic </span><span>areas and may adversely affect their economies.</span></div> <div><span>Small Fund Risk. </span><span>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading </span><span>volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being </span><span>delisted if the Fund does not meet certain conditions of the listing exchange. If the </span><span>Fund were to be required to delist from the listing exchange, the value of the Fund may </span><span>rapidly decline and performance may be negatively impacted. Any resulting liquidation </span><span>of the Fund could cause the Fund to incur elevated transaction costs for the Fund and </span><span>negative tax consequences for its shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>Tax Risk.</span><span> The tax rules and limitations that apply to the Fund will cause some or all of </span><span>its income and gain to be taxable as ordinary income or at ordinary income rates, may </span><span>accelerate its recognition of income and gain, and may defer its use of losses, all of </span><span>which are expected to have negative tax consequences for the Fund and Fund </span><span>investors. Because the assets comprising the Underlying Index and held by the </span><span>Underlying Fund will not consist of stock, ordinary dividends from the Fund will not be </span><span>eligible for the reduced rates applicable to </span><span>“</span><span>qualified dividend income</span><span>”</span><span> or eligible for </span><span>the dividends-received deduction. The Fund expects that its ownership of shares of the </span><span>Underlying Fund and sale of call options thereon generally will constitute </span><span>“</span><span>straddles</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>(offsetting positions with respect to personal property) under section 1092 of the </span><span>Internal Revenue Code. The straddle rules generally do not apply if all the straddle’s </span><span>offsetting positions consist of </span><span>“</span><span>qualified covered call options</span><span>”</span><span> and the stock to be </span><span>purchased under the options, and the straddle is not part of a larger straddle. Unlike </span><span>certain other funds that utilize covered call strategies, the Fund does not anticipate </span><span>that this exception will be available because, as a general matter, the call options it </span><span>writes are not expected to be treated as </span><span>“</span><span>qualified covered call options.</span><span>”</span><span> The straddle </span><span>rules usually will terminate the Fund’s holding periods for its shares of the Underlying </span><span>Fund that become part of a straddle before the long-term capital gain holding period </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>15</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>(more than one year) has been reached, which is expected to eliminate the Fund’s </span><span>ability to recognize long-term capital gains from a sale or other disposition of such </span><span>shares. The straddle rules also usually will defer recognition of realized losses and </span><span>require the capitalization of certain interest expenses and carrying charges. Similarly, </span><span>“</span><span>wash sale</span><span>”</span><span> rules may apply to defer the recognition of loss by the Fund from the </span><span>disposition of stock or securities at a loss in a case in which identical or substantially </span><span>identical stock or securities (or an option to acquire such property) is or has been </span><span>acquired within a prescribed period. As a result of the foregoing, an investor may be </span><span>subject to significantly greater amounts of tax as a result of the investment than would </span><span>apply to an investment in a fund engaged in a different investment strategy.</span></div> <div><span>Telecommunications Sector Risk.</span><span> The telecommunications sector is subject to </span><span>extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with governmental </span><span>regulations, delays or failure to receive required regulatory approvals, or the </span><span>enactment of new regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of </span><span>telecommunications companies. Government actions around the world, specifically in </span><span>the area of pre-marketing clearance of products and prices, can be arbitrary and </span><span>unpredictable. The domestic telecommunications market is characterized by </span><span>increasing competition and regulation by various state and federal regulatory </span><span>authorities. Companies in the telecommunications sector may encounter distressed </span><span>cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing </span><span>competition, particularly in developing new products and services using new </span><span>technology. Technological innovations may make the products and services of certain </span><span>telecommunications companies obsolete. Telecommunications providers are generally </span><span>required to obtain franchises or licenses in order to provide services in a given </span><span>location. Licensing and franchise rights in the telecommunications sector are limited, </span><span>which may provide an advantage to certain participants. Limited availability of such </span><span>rights, high barriers to market entry and regulatory oversight, among other factors, </span><span>have led to consolidation of companies within the sector, which could lead to further </span><span>regulation or other negative effects in the future.</span></div> <div><span>Tracking Error Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be subject to </span><span>“</span><span>tracking error,</span><span>”</span><span> which is the </span><span>divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error </span><span>may occur because of differences between the securities and other instruments held in </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing </span><span>differences</span><span> </span><span>(including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local </span><span>market close and the Fund's or an Underlying Fund's valuation of a security at the time </span><span>of calculation of the Fund's or Underlying Fund's NAV, respectively), transaction costs </span><span>incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of </span><span>the accrual or the valuation of distributions, the requirements to maintain pass-through </span><span>tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital </span><span>gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, changes to the Underlying </span><span>Index, the effect the Fund’s transactions would have on the market for the securities in </span><span>the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing </span><span>regulatory requirements, among other reasons. This risk may be heightened during </span><span>times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error </span><span>also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index </span><span>does not. </span><span>INDEX ETFs THAT TRACK INDICES WITH SIGNIFICANT </span><span>WEIGHT IN </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>16</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>OPTIONS </span><span>MAY EXPERIENCE HIGHER TRACKING ERROR THAN OTHER INDEX </span><span>ETFs THAT DO NOT TRACK SUCH INDICES.</span></div> <div><span>Valuation Risk.</span><span> The price the Fund and the Underlying Fund could receive upon the </span><span>sale of a security</span><span> </span><span>or other asset may differ from the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's </span><span>valuation of the security or other asset and from the value used by its underlying index, </span><span>particularly for securities or other assets that trade in low volume or volatile markets or </span><span>that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for </span><span>other reasons. Because non-U.S. exchanges may be open on days or during time </span><span>periods when the</span><span> </span><span>Underlying Fund does not price its shares, the value of the securities </span><span>or other assets in the Underlying Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time </span><span>periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s</span><span> </span><span>or the </span><span>Underlying Fund's shares. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund </span><span>shares on days when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or </span><span>more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received </span><span>had the securities not been fair valued or been valued using a different methodology. </span><span>The ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by </span><span>pricing services or other third-party service providers.</span></div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</span></div> <div><span>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated with its investments </span><span>and investment strategies</span><span> </span><span>either directly or indirectly through the Fund's investments </span><span>in the Underlying Fund. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the </span><span>significance of any particular risk factor.</span></div> <div><span>Capital Goods Industry Risk. </span><span>Companies in the capital goods group of industries </span><span>include aerospace and defense, building products, construction and engineering, and </span><span>other manufacturers of capital intensive products. Companies in the capital goods </span><span>industry may be affected by fluctuations in the business cycle and by other factors </span><span>affecting manufacturing demands. The capital goods industry depends heavily on </span><span>corporate spending. Companies in the capital goods industry may perform well during </span><span>times of economic expansion, but as economic conditions worsen, the demand for </span><span>capital goods may decrease. Many capital goods are sold internationally, and </span><span>companies in this industry may be affected by market conditions in other countries and </span><span>regions.</span></div> <div><span>Close-Out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.</span><span> Regulations adopted by global </span><span>prudential regulators require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global </span><span>systemically important banking organizations to include contractual restrictions on </span><span>close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. </span><span>Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards </span><span>and other derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending </span><span>agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial </span><span>contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution </span><span>proceedings and also prohibit the Fund from exercising default rights due to a </span><span>receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. These </span><span>requirements may increase credit risk and other risks to the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>17</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Consumer Services Industry Risk.</span><span> The success of firms in the consumer services </span><span>industry and certain retailers (including food and beverage, general retailers, media, </span><span>and travel and leisure companies) is tied closely to the performance of the domestic </span><span>and international economies, interest rates, exchange rates and consumer confidence. </span><span>The consumer services industry depends heavily on disposable household income and </span><span>consumer spending. Companies in the consumer services industry may be subject to </span><span>severe competition, which may also have an adverse impact on their profitability. </span><span>Companies in the consumer services industry are facing increased government and </span><span>regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or regulatory action. </span><span>Changes in consumer demographics and preferences in the countries in which the </span><span>issuers of securities held by the Underlying Fund are located and in the countries to </span><span>which they export their products may affect the success of consumer products.</span></div> <div><span>Consumer Staples Sector Risk.</span><span> Companies in the consumer staples sector may be </span><span>affected by the regulation of various product components and production methods, </span><span>marketing campaigns and changes in the global economy, consumer spending and </span><span>consumer demand. Tobacco and tobacco-related companies, in particular, may be </span><span>adversely affected by new laws, regulations and litigation. Companies in the consumer </span><span>staples sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity </span><span>prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. These companies may be </span><span>subject to severe competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</span></div> <div><span>Energy Sector Risk. </span><span>The success of companies in</span><span>the energy sector may be cyclical </span><span>and highly dependent on energy prices. The market value of securities issued by </span><span>companies in the energy sector may decline for the following reasons, among others: </span><span>changes in the levels and volatility of global energy prices, energy supply and demand, </span><span>and capital expenditures on exploration and production of energy sources; exchange </span><span>rates, interest rates, economic conditions, and tax treatment; the enactment or </span><span>cessation of trade sanctions; war or other geopolitical conflicts; and energy </span><span>conservation efforts, increased competition and technological advances. Companies in </span><span>this sector may be subject to substantial government regulation and contractual fixed </span><span>pricing, which may increase the cost of doing business and limit the earnings of these </span><span>companies. A significant portion of the revenues of these companies may depend on a </span><span>relatively small number of customers, including governmental entities and utilities. As a </span><span>result, governmental budget constraints may have a material adverse effect on the </span><span>stock prices of companies in this sector. Energy companies may also operate in, or </span><span>engage in transactions involving, countries with less developed regulatory regimes or a </span><span>history of expropriation, nationalization or other adverse policies. Energy companies </span><span>also face a significant risk of liability from accidents resulting in injury or loss of life or </span><span>property, pollution or other environmental problems, equipment malfunctions or </span><span>mishandling of materials and a risk of loss from terrorism, cyber incident, political </span><span>strife or natural disasters. Any such event could have serious consequences for the </span><span>general population of the affected area and could have an adverse impact on the </span><span>Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's portfolio and the performance of the Fund. Energy </span><span>companies can be significantly affected by the supply of, and demand for, specific </span><span>products (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, oil and natural gas) and services, exploration and production spending, </span><span>government subsidization, world events and general economic conditions. Energy </span><span>companies may have relatively high levels of debt and may be more likely than other </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>18</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>companies to restructure their businesses if there are downturns in energy markets or </span><span>in the global economy.</span></div> <div><span>In the context of the COVID-19 outbreak and disputes among oil-producing countries </span><span>regarding potential limits on the production of crude oil, the energy sector has </span><span>experienced increased volatility. In particular, significant market volatility in the crude </span><span>oil markets as well as the oil futures markets resulted in the market price of the front </span><span>month WTI crude oil futures contracts (those with the nearest expiration date) falling </span><span>below zero for a period of time. Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February </span><span>24, 2022 has led to further disruptions and increased volatility in the energy and </span><span>commodity futures markets due to actual and potential disruptions in the supply and </span><span>demand for certain commodities, including oil and natural gas. In March 2022, the U.S. </span><span>announced that it would ban imports of oil, natural gas and coal from Russia. The effect </span><span>of the U.S. ban and any similar bans by other countries, as well as the extent and </span><span>duration of the Russian military action, resulting sanctions and associated market </span><span>disruptions on the energy sector, are impossible to predict and depend on a number of </span><span>factors. The effect of these events or any related developments could be significant </span><span>and may have a severe adverse effect on the performance of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>European Economic Risk. </span><span>The Economic and Monetary Union (the </span><span>“</span><span>eurozone</span><span>”</span><span>) of the </span><span>European Union (the </span><span>“</span><span>EU</span><span>”</span><span>) requires compliance by member states that are members of </span><span>the eurozone with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates and debt levels, </span><span>as well as fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every </span><span>country in Europe, including those countries that are not members of the eurozone. </span><span>Additionally, European countries outside of the eurozone may present economic risks </span><span>that are independent of the indirect effects that eurozone policies have on them. In </span><span>particular, the United Kingdom's (the </span><span>“</span><span>U.K.</span><span>”</span><span>) economy may be affected by global </span><span>economic, industrial and financial shifts. Changes in imports or exports, changes in </span><span>governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro (the </span><span>common currency of eurozone countries), the default or threat of default by an EU </span><span>member state on its sovereign debt and/or an economic recession in an EU member </span><span>state may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of other EU member </span><span>states and their trading partners. The European financial markets have historically </span><span>experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns </span><span>or government debt levels in several European countries, including, but not limited to, </span><span>Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. </span><span>These events have affected and may in the future adversely affect the exchange rate of </span><span>the euro and may significantly affect European countries.</span></div> <div><span>Responses to financial problems by European governments, central banks and others, </span><span>including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may </span><span>result in social unrest, may limit future growth and economic recovery or may have </span><span>other unintended consequences. Further defaults or restructurings by governments </span><span>and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, </span><span>financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more </span><span>countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The U.K. left the EU </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>Brexit</span><span>”</span><span>) on January 31, 2020. The U.K. and EU reached an agreement on the terms of </span><span>their future trading relationship effective January 1, 2021, which principally relates to </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>19</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>the trading of goods rather than services, including financial services. Further </span><span>discussions are to be held between the U.K. and the EU in relation to matters not </span><span>covered by the trade agreement, such as financial services. The Fund and the </span><span>Underlying Fund face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and consequences </span><span>that may follow Brexit, including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and </span><span>interest rates. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, </span><span>economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political </span><span>institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. Brexit has also led to legal </span><span>uncertainty and could lead to politically divergent national laws and regulations as a </span><span>new relationship between the U.K. and EU is defined and the U.K. determines which EU </span><span>laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects could adversely affect any of the </span><span>companies to which the Fund has exposure and any other assets in which the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or </span><span>the Underlying Fund invests. The political, economic and legal consequences of Brexit </span><span>are not yet fully known. In the short term, financial markets may experience </span><span>heightened volatility, particularly those in the U.K. and Europe, but possibly worldwide. </span><span>The U.K. and Europe may be less stable than they have been in recent years, and </span><span>investments in the U.K. and the EU may be difficult to value or subject to greater or </span><span>more frequent volatility. In the longer term, there is likely to be a period of significant </span><span>political, regulatory and commercial uncertainty as the U.K. continues to negotiate the </span><span>terms of its future trading relationships.</span></div> <div><span>Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain and the </span><span>independence movement in Scotland, as well as governmental or other responses to </span><span>such movements, may also create instability and uncertainty in the region. In addition, </span><span>the national politics of countries in the EU have been unpredictable and subject to </span><span>influence by disruptive political groups and ideologies. The governments of EU </span><span>countries may be subject to change and such countries may experience social and </span><span>political unrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments may result in </span><span>sudden and significant investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents </span><span>throughout Europe or war in the region could also impact financial markets. The impact </span><span>of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could </span><span>adversely affect the value and liquidity of the Fund's or Underlying Fund's investments.</span></div> <div><span>Russian Invasion of Ukraine</span><span>. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on </span><span>February 24, 2022. The extent and duration of the military action, resulting sanctions </span><span>and resulting future market disruptions, including declines in its stock markets and the </span><span>value of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but could be </span><span>significant. Disruptions caused by Russian military action or other actions (including </span><span>cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting actual and threatened responses to such </span><span>activity, including purchasing and financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in </span><span>consumer or purchaser preferences, sanctions, import and export restrictions, tariffs </span><span>or cyberattacks on the Russian government, Russian companies or Russian individuals, </span><span>including politicians, may impact Russia's economy and Russian issuers of securities in </span><span>which the Fund invests. Actual and threatened responses to Russian military action </span><span>may also impact the markets for certain Russian commodities, such as oil and natural </span><span>gas, as well as other sectors of the Russian economy, and are likely to have collateral </span><span>impacts on such sectors globally.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>20</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Financials Sector Risk.</span><span> Companies in the financials sector</span><span> </span><span>of an economy are subject </span><span>to extensive governmental regulation and intervention, which may adversely affect the </span><span>scope of their activities, the prices they can charge, the amount of capital they must </span><span>maintain and, potentially, their size. The extent to which the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or the Underlying </span><span>Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is </span><span>limited by applicable law. Governmental regulation may change frequently and may </span><span>have significant adverse consequences for companies in the financials sector, </span><span>including effects not intended by such regulation. Increased risk taking by banks may </span><span>also result in greater overall risk in the U.S. and global financials sector. The impact of </span><span>changes in capital requirements, or recent or future regulation in various countries, on </span><span>any individual financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be </span><span>predicted. </span></div> <div><span>Certain risks may impact the value of investments in the financials sector more </span><span>severely than those of investments outside this sector, including the risks associated </span><span>with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage. Companies in the </span><span>financials sector are exposed directly to the credit risk of their borrowers and </span><span>counterparties, who may be leveraged to an unknown degree, including through swaps </span><span>and other derivatives products. Financial services companies may have significant </span><span>exposure to the same borrowers and counterparties, with the result that a borrower’s </span><span>or counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations to one company may affect other </span><span>companies with exposure to the same borrower or counterparty. This </span><span>interconnectedness of risk may result in significant negative impacts to companies </span><span>with direct exposure to the defaulting counterparty as well as adverse cascading </span><span>effects in the markets and the financials sector generally. Companies in the financials </span><span>sector may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and loan losses, </span><span>decreases in the availability of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades </span><span>and adverse conditions in other related markets. Insurance companies, in particular, </span><span>may be subject to severe price competition and/or rate regulation, which may have an </span><span>adverse impact on their profitability. The financials sector is particularly sensitive to </span><span>fluctuations in interest rates. The financials sector is also a target for cyberattacks, and </span><span>may experience technology malfunctions and disruptions. Cybersecurity incidents and </span><span>technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector </span><span>and have reportedly caused losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively </span><span>impact the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Illiquid Investments Risk. </span><span>The Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, </span><span>immediately after the acquisition, the Fund would have invested more than 15% of its </span><span>net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the </span><span>Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in </span><span>seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the </span><span>investment. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, </span><span>particularly during periods of market turmoil. There can be no assurance that a security </span><span>or instrument that is deemed to be liquid when purchased will continue to be liquid for </span><span>as long as it is held by the Fund, and any security or instrument held by the Fund may </span><span>be deemed an illiquid investment pursuant to the Fund’s liquidity risk management </span><span>program. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid investments may </span><span>reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be unable to transact at </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>21</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>advantageous times or prices. An investment may be illiquid due to, among other </span><span>things, the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a </span><span>market in securities or instruments, the lack of an active market for such securities or </span><span>instruments, capital controls, delays or limits on repatriation of local currency, or </span><span>insolvency of local governments. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or </span><span>instruments with substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have </span><span>increased exposure to the risks associated with illiquid investments. Illiquid </span><span>investments may be harder to value, especially in changing markets. If the Fund is </span><span>forced to sell underlying investments at reduced prices or under unfavorable </span><span>conditions to meet redemption requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a </span><span>loss. This may be magnified in a rising interest rate environment or other </span><span>circumstances where redemptions from the Fund may be greater than normal. Other </span><span>market participants may be attempting to liquidate holdings at the same time as the </span><span>Fund, causing increased supply of the Fund’s underlying investments in the market and </span><span>contributing to illiquid investments risk and downward pricing pressure. In addition, if </span><span>the Fund is limited in its ability to sell illiquid investments during periods when </span><span>shareholders are redeeming their shares, the Fund will need to sell liquid securities to </span><span>meet redemption requests and illiquid securities will become a larger portion of the </span><span>Fund’s holdings. During periods of market volatility, liquidity in the market for the </span><span>Fund’s shares may be impacted by the liquidity in the market for the underlying </span><span>securities or instruments held by the Fund, which could lead to the Fund’s shares </span><span>trading at a premium or discount to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Non-U.S. Issuers Risk</span><span>. Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers have different risks from </span><span>securities issued by U.S. issuers. These risks include differences in accounting, </span><span>auditing and financial reporting standards, the possibility of expropriation or </span><span>confiscatory taxation, adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations, </span><span>political instability which could affect U.S. investments in non-U.S. countries, </span><span>uncertainties of transnational litigation, and potential restrictions on the flow of </span><span>international capital, including the possible seizure or nationalization of the securities </span><span>issued by non-U.S. issuers held by the Fund and the Underlying Fund. Non-U.S. issuers </span><span>may be subject to less governmental regulation than U.S. issuers. Moreover, individual </span><span>non-U.S. economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy in such </span><span>respects as growth of gross domestic product, rate of inflation, capital reinvestment, </span><span>resource self-sufficiency and balance of payment positions. Unfavorable political, </span><span>economic or governmental developments in non-U.S. countries could affect the </span><span>payment of a security’s principal and interest. Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers </span><span>may also be less liquid than, and more difficult to value than, securities of U.S. issuers. </span><span>In addition, the value of these securities may fluctuate due to changes in the exchange </span><span>rate of the issuer’s local currency against the U.S. dollar. </span></div> <div><span>Reliance on Trading Partners Risk.</span><span> The economies of many countries or regions in </span><span>which the Underlying Fund invests are highly dependent on trade with certain key </span><span>trading partners. Reduction in spending on products and services by these key trading </span><span>partners, institution of tariffs or other trade barriers or a slowdown in the economies of </span><span>key trading partners may adversely affect the performance of any company in which </span><span>the Underlying Fund invests and have a material adverse effect on the Fund’s </span><span>performance.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>22</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. </span><span>Investment in developed country issuers </span><span>may subject the Fund or the Underlying Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security, </span><span>economic and other risks associated with developed countries.</span><span>Developed countries </span><span>generally tend to rely on services sectors (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> the financial services sector) as the </span><span>primary means of economic growth. A prolonged slowdown in one or more services </span><span>sectors is likely to have a negative impact on economies of certain developed </span><span>countries, although economies of individual developed countries can be impacted by </span><span>slowdowns in other sectors. In the past, certain developed countries have been targets </span><span>of terrorism, and some geographic areas in which the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or the Underlying Fund </span><span>invests have experienced strained international relations due to territorial disputes, </span><span>historical animosities, defense concerns and other security concerns. These situations </span><span>may cause uncertainty in the financial markets in these countries or geographic areas </span><span>and may adversely affect the performance of the issuers to which the Fund or the </span><span>Underlying Fund has exposure. Heavy regulation of certain markets, including labor </span><span>and product markets, may have an adverse effect on certain issuers. Such regulations </span><span>may negatively affect economic growth or cause prolonged periods of recession. Many </span><span>developed countries are heavily indebted and face rising healthcare and retirement </span><span>expenses. In addition, price fluctuations of certain commodities and regulations </span><span>impacting the import of commodities may negatively affect developed country </span><span>economies.</span></div> <div><span>Technology Sector Risk.</span><span> Technology companies, including information technology </span><span>companies,</span><span> </span><span>face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may </span><span>have an adverse effect on a company’s profit margins. Technology companies may </span><span>have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of </span><span>technology companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological </span><span>developments, frequent new product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth </span><span>rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Companies in the </span><span>technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and other intellectual property </span><span>rights. A technology company’s loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect </span><span>the company’s profitability. Companies in the technology sector are facing increased </span><span>government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or </span><span>regulatory action. The technology sector may also be adversely affected by changes or </span><span>trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced or characterized by </span><span>unpredictable factors.</span></div> <div><span>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.</span><span> If certain aggregate and/or fund-level ownership </span><span>thresholds are reached through transactions undertaken by BFA, its affiliates or the </span><span>Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions or actions by an issuer or regulator, the </span><span>ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to purchase or </span><span>dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be </span><span>restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make </span><span>investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant threshold limits, and </span><span>such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio holdings</span><span> </span><span>compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This </span><span>may increase the risk of the Fund being underinvested to the Underlying Index and </span><span>increase the risk of tracking error.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>23</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>For example, in certain circumstances where the Fund invests in securities issued by </span><span>companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or </span><span>international markets, is subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or </span><span>invests in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits on the </span><span>aggregate and/or fund-level amount invested or voted by BFA and its affiliates for their </span><span>proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Fund) that may not be </span><span>exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if </span><span>exceeded, may cause BFA and its affiliates, the Fund or other client accounts to suffer </span><span>disadvantages or business restrictions.</span></div> <div><span>Portfolio Holdings Information</span></div> <div><span>A description of the Trust's policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Fund's Statement of Additional </span><span>Information (</span><span>“</span><span>SAI</span><span>”</span><span>).

BFA provides an investment </span><span>program for the Fund and manages the investment of the Fund’s assets. In managing </span><span>the Fund, BFA may draw upon the trading, research and expertise of its asset </span><span>management affiliates for portfolio decisions and management with respect to </span><span>portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's investment objective, BFA uses </span><span>teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists and other investment specialists. </span><span>This team approach brings together many disciplines and leverages BFA’s extensive </span><span>resources.</span></div> <div><span>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and the Trust (entered </span><span>into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the </span><span>Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with </span><span>respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of </span><span>portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, </span><span>and litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of </span><span>the Trustees who are not </span><span>“</span><span>interested persons</span><span>”</span><span> of the Trust).</span></div> <div><span>Effective October 6, 2023, for its investment advisory services to the Fund, BFA is paid </span><span>a management fee from the Fund, as a percentage of the Fund’s average daily net </span><span>assets, at the annual rate of 0.20%.

BFA and its Affiliates provide investment </span><span>management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that may </span><span>follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA and its Affiliates are </span><span>involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management </span><span>activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in which their </span><span>interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or </span><span>one or more Affiliates act, or may act, as an investor, research provider, investment </span><span>manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, </span><span>adviser, trader, lender,</span><span> </span><span>index provider, agent and/or principal, and have other direct </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>26</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>and indirect interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other </span><span>instruments in which the Fund may directly or indirectly invest. The Fund may invest in </span><span>securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate </span><span>has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The Fund may also invest </span><span>in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which an Affiliate provides and is </span><span>compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of </span><span>such issuances. The Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in other </span><span>transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate provides or may in the future </span><span>provide research coverage. An Affiliate may have business relationships with, and </span><span>purchase or distribute or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants </span><span>or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, </span><span>and may receive compensation for such services. BFA or one or more Affiliates may </span><span>engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment </span><span>objectives similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for </span><span>transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the </span><span>Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end</span><span> investment companies (which may include investment companies that are </span><span>affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment </span><span>Company Act of 1940, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1940 Act</span><span>”</span><span>)). The trading activities of BFA and </span><span>these Affiliates are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly </span><span>by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate having positions in certain securities </span><span>that are senior or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities </span><span>that are owned by the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to share any investment </span><span>opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with </span><span>the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's </span><span>investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an Affiliate and of other </span><span>accounts managed by BlackRock or an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could </span><span>sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts </span><span>achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The opposite result is </span><span>also possible.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, the Fund may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an </span><span>Affiliate or</span><span> </span><span>its or their directors, officers, employees or clients have an adverse interest. </span><span>Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or managed by BFA or its </span><span>Affiliates may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or</span><span> </span><span>by </span><span>BFA or its Affiliates or their directors, officers or employees may have the effect of </span><span>diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund's activities may be limited because of regulatory restrictions applicable to </span><span>BFA or one or more Affiliates and/or their internal policies designed to comply with </span><span>such restrictions.</span></div> <div><span>It is also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients </span><span>(including other funds and separately managed accounts) may, subject to compliance </span><span>with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of the Fund.

See the SAI for further information.</span></div> <div><span>Shareholder Information</span></div> <div><span>Additional shareholder information, including how to buy and sell shares of the Fund, is </span><span>available free of charge by calling toll-free: 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or visiting </span><span>our website at www.iShares.com.</span></div> <div><span>Buying and Selling Shares.</span><span> Shares of the Fund may be acquired or redeemed directly </span><span>from the Fund only in Creation Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the </span><span>Creations </span><span>and Redemptions</span><span> section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, </span><span>shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a </span><span>Creation Unit.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange for trading during the </span><span>trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of </span><span>other publicly-traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment </span><span>for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or otherwise in the secondary </span><span>market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol </span><span>“</span><span>HYGW.</span><span>”</span></div> <div><span>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary market involves two </span><span>types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling </span><span>shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other </span><span>charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may be a significant </span><span>proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In </span><span>addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread,</span><span>”</span><span> that is, any difference between the </span><span>bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over time for shares of the Fund based </span><span>on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund </span><span>has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity (which is often the case for funds that are newly launched </span><span>or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity or illiquidity </span><span>of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller </span><span>funds or in instances of significant volatility of the underlying securities.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund does not impose restrictions on the frequency of purchases and redemptions </span><span>of Fund shares directly with the Fund. The Board determined not to adopt policies and </span><span>procedures designed to prevent or monitor for frequent purchases and redemptions of </span><span>Fund shares because the Fund generally sells and redeems its shares directly through </span><span>transactions that are in-kind and/or for cash, with a deadline for placing cash-related </span><span>transactions no later than the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio </span><span>securities. However, the Fund has taken certain measures (</span><span>e.g</span><span>., imposing transaction </span><span>fees on purchases and redemptions of Creation Units and reserving the right to reject </span><span>purchases of Creation Units under certain circumstances) to minimize the potential </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>28</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>consequences of frequent cash purchases and redemptions by Authorized Participants, </span><span>such as increased tracking error, disruption of portfolio management, dilution to the </span><span>Fund, and/or increased transaction costs. Further, the vast majority of trading in Fund </span><span>shares occurs on the secondary market, which does not involve the Fund directly, and </span><span>such trading is unlikely to cause many of the harmful effects of frequent cash </span><span>purchases or redemptions of Fund shares.</span></div> <div><span>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed is open for </span><span>trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays </span><span>(or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, </span><span>Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor </span><span>Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is Cboe </span><span>BZX.</span></div> <div><span>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act generally restricts investments by investment </span><span>companies, including foreign and unregistered investment companies, in the securities </span><span>of other investment companies. For example, a registered investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquired Fund</span><span>”</span><span>), such as the Fund, may not knowingly sell or otherwise dispose of any </span><span>security issued by the Acquired Fund to any investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquiring </span><span>Fund</span><span>”</span><span>) or any company or companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund if, immediately </span><span>after such sale or disposition: (i) more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of </span><span>the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and any company or companies </span><span>controlled by the Acquiring Fund or (ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding voting </span><span>stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and other investment </span><span>companies and companies controlled by them. Although SEC rules may permit </span><span>registered investment companies and unit investment trusts (</span><span>“</span><span>Investing Funds</span><span>”</span><span>) that </span><span>enter into an investment agreement with the Trust to invest in iShares funds beyond </span><span>the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act subject to certain terms and </span><span>conditions, the Fund does not permit such investments. Accordingly, Investing Funds </span><span>must adhere to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act when investing </span><span>in the Fund. In addition, foreign investment companies are permitted to invest in the </span><span>Fund only up to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to any applicable SEC </span><span>no-action relief.</span></div> <div><span>Book Entry.</span><span> Shares of the Fund are held in book-entry form, which means that no </span><span>stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (</span><span>“</span><span>DTC</span><span>”</span><span>) or its nominee is </span><span>the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as shown on the records of </span><span>DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. </span><span>DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, </span><span>clearing corporations and other institutions that directly or indirectly maintain a </span><span>custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to </span><span>receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your </span><span>name, and you are not considered a registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise </span><span>any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its </span><span>participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other </span><span>securities that you hold in book-entry or </span><span>“</span><span>street name</span><span>”</span><span> form.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>29</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Share Prices.</span><span> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market </span><span>generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as </span><span>the supply of and demand for ETF shares and underlying securities held by the Fund, </span><span>economic conditions and other factors.</span></div> <div><span>Determination of Net Asset Value. </span><span>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined </span><span>once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the close of regular trading hours of </span><span>the New York Stock Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>NYSE</span><span>”</span><span>) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day </span><span>that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that </span><span>any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are </span><span>translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as </span><span>quoted by one or more data service providers. The NAV of the Fund is calculated by </span><span>dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the value of its total assets, which </span><span>includes the value of the Underlying Fund shares in which the Fund invests, less total </span><span>liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally rounded to </span><span>the nearest cent.</span></div> <div><span>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities held by the Fund is </span><span>determined pursuant to BFA’s valuation policies and procedures. BFA has been </span><span>designated by the Board as the valuation designee for the Fund pursuant to Rule 2a-5 </span><span>under the Investment Company Act.</span></div> <div><span>Customized exchange-traded equity options may be valued using a mathematical </span><span>model which may incorporate a number of market data factors.</span></div> <div><span>Equity securities and other equity instruments for which market quotations are readily </span><span>available are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the last </span><span>reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the last </span><span>traded price on the exchange or market on which the security or instrument is </span><span>primarily traded at the time of valuation. Shares of underlying open-end funds </span><span>(including money market funds) are valued at net asset value. Shares of underlying </span><span>exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs are valued at their most recent </span><span>closing price.</span> <br/><span>The Fund values fixed-income portfolio securities using last available bid prices or </span><span>current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated prices) </span><span>supplied by the Fund's approved independent third-party pricing services, each in </span><span>accordance with BFA's valuation policies and procedures. Pricing services may use </span><span>matrix pricing or valuation models that utilize certain inputs and assumptions to derive </span><span>values. Pricing services generally value fixed-income securities assuming orderly </span><span>transactions of an institutional round lot size, but the Fund may hold or transact in such </span><span>securities in smaller odd lot sizes. Odd lots often trade at lower prices than institutional </span><span>round lots. An amortized cost method of valuation may be used with respect to debt </span><span>obligations with sixty days or less remaining to maturity unless BFA determines in good </span><span>faith that such method does not represent fair value.</span></div> <div><span>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities and money market instruments is substantially </span><span>completed each day at various times prior to the close of regular trading hours of the </span><span>NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are </span><span>determined as of such times.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>30</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be </span><span>unreliable, BFA will fair value the Fund’s investments in accordance with its policies </span><span>and procedures. BFA may conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is </span><span>unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its </span><span>lack of trading or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent </span><span>price quotations or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security </span><span>or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent </span><span>to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is </span><span>listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is </span><span>available. A </span><span>“</span><span>significant event</span><span>”</span><span> is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable </span><span>business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s assets or liabilities, that </span><span>the event is likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or </span><span>closing market price of one or more assets held by, or liabilities of, the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The </span><span>fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might </span><span>reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to </span><span>extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments </span><span>using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market </span><span>valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been </span><span>sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value </span><span>prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the </span><span>prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, </span><span>which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the </span><span>performance of the Underlying Index.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends and Distributions</span></div> <div><span>General Policies.</span><span> Dividends from net investment income, if any, generally are declared </span><span>and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, </span><span>if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make </span><span>distributions on a more frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to </span><span>declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or </span><span>advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company or to avoid </span><span>imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are distributed on a </span><span>pro rata</span><span> </span><span>basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC </span><span>participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds </span><span>received from the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Dividend Reinvestment Service.</span><span> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the </span><span>Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment </span><span>Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend </span><span>distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the </span><span>availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers </span><span>may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this </span><span>service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains </span><span>will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in </span><span>the secondary market.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>31</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxes.</span><span> As with any investment, you should consider how your investment in shares of </span><span>the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general </span><span>information, based on current law. There is no guarantee that shares of the Fund will </span><span>receive certain regulatory or accounting treatment. You should consult your own tax </span><span>professional about the tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Unless your investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred</span><span> retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally </span><span>will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax </span><span>consequences when the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes on Distributions.</span><span> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income, </span><span>including distributions out of the Fund's net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable </span><span>to you as ordinary income. The Fund's distributions of net long-term capital gains, if </span><span>any, in excess of net short-term capital losses are taxable as long-term capital gains, </span><span>regardless of how long you have held the shares. Long-term capital gains are eligible </span><span>for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, </span><span>depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts. Distributions </span><span>from the Fund are subject to a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax on </span><span>“</span><span>net </span><span>investment income,</span><span>”</span><span> for individuals with incomes exceeding $200,000 ($250,000 if </span><span>married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts. In general, your distributions are </span><span>subject to U.S. federal income tax for the year when they are paid. Certain </span><span>distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on December 31 of the </span><span>prior year. Certain states and localities may exempt from tax distributions attributable </span><span>to interest from U.S. federal government obligations.</span></div> <div><span>You may lose the ability to use foreign tax credits passed through by the Fund if your </span><span>Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending agreement.</span></div> <div><span>If the Fund's distributions exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits, all or </span><span>a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a </span><span>return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum </span><span>distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be </span><span>taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return </span><span>of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder's </span><span>cost basis and will result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those </span><span>shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost </span><span>basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the </span><span>shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends, interest and capital gains earned by the Underlying Fund with respect to </span><span>securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to withholding and other taxes </span><span>imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the </span><span>U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. If more than 50% of the total assets of the </span><span>Underlying Fund at the close of a year consists of non-U.S. stocks or securities </span><span>(generally, for this purpose, depositary receipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S. </span><span>companies are treated as </span><span>“</span><span>non-U.S.</span><span>”</span><span>) (and 50% of the total assets of the Fund at the </span><span>close of the year consists of securities issued by non-U.S. issuers, or, at the close of </span><span>each quarter, shares of the Underlying Fund), the Fund may </span><span>“</span><span>pass through</span><span>”</span><span> to you </span><span>certain non-U.S. income taxes (including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund or the </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>32</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Underlying Fund. This means that you would be considered to have received as an </span><span>additional dividend your share of such non-U.S. taxes, but you may be entitled to either </span><span>a corresponding tax deduction in calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain </span><span>limitations, a credit in calculating your U.S. federal income tax.</span></div> <div><span>For purposes of foreign tax credits for U.S. shareholders of the Fund, foreign capital </span><span>gains taxes may not produce associated foreign source income, limiting the availability </span><span>of such credits for U.S. persons.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund expects that its ownership of shares of the Underlying Fund and sale of call </span><span>options thereon generally will constitute </span><span>“</span><span>straddles</span><span>”</span><span> (offsetting positions with respect </span><span>to personal property) under section 1092 of the Internal Revenue Code. The straddle </span><span>rules usually will terminate the Fund’s holding periods for its shares of the Underlying </span><span>Fund that become part of a straddle before the long-term capital gain holding period </span><span>(more than one year) has been reached, which is expected to eliminate the Fund’s </span><span>ability to recognize long-term capital gains from a sale or other disposition of such </span><span>shares. The straddle rules also usually will defer recognition of realized losses and </span><span>require the capitalization of certain interest expenses and carrying charges. Further, </span><span>because the Fund is expected to invest in the Underlying Fund, the Fund’s realized </span><span>losses on sales of shares of such Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently </span><span>deferred as </span><span>“</span><span>wash sales.</span><span>”</span><span> Distributions of short-term capital gains by the Underlying </span><span>Fund will be recognized as ordinary income by the Fund and would not be offset by the </span><span>Fund’s capital loss carryforwards, if any. Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying </span><span>Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if you are a non-U.S. entity </span><span>(other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s </span><span>ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) </span><span>will generally be subject to a 30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless a lower treaty </span><span>rate applies provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income </span><span>realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital </span><span>gains or upon the sale or other disposition of shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, </span><span>interest and other income items paid to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S.</span><span> investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the U.S. Internal </span><span>Revenue Service (</span><span>“</span><span>IRS</span><span>”</span><span>) information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account </span><span>holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information </span><span>regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial </span><span>institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will </span><span>provide the IRS information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer </span><span>identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders; comply with due </span><span>diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts; report to the </span><span>IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax </span><span>on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account </span><span>holders who fail to provide the required information; and determine certain other </span><span>information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable </span><span>intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local </span><span>revenue authorities with similar account holder information.

Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund </span><span>shares held for one year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except </span><span>that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term</span><span> capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to </span><span>such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from </span><span>capital gain dividends, are included in </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income</span><span>”</span><span> for purposes of the </span><span>3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned above.</span></div> <div><span>The foregoing discussion summarizes some of the consequences under current U.S. </span><span>federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. </span><span>You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and sales of </span><span>shares. Consult your personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an </span><span>investment in shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</span></div> <div><span>Creations and Redemptions.</span><span> Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the </span><span>Fund are </span><span>“</span><span>created</span><span>”</span><span> at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in </span><span>block-size Creation Units or multiples thereof. Each </span><span>“</span><span>creator</span><span>”</span><span> or authorized participant </span><span>(an </span><span>“</span><span>Authorized Participant</span><span>”</span><span>) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, </span><span>BlackRock Investments, LLC (the </span><span>“</span><span>Distributor</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>BRIL</span><span>”</span><span>), an affiliate of BFA. An </span><span>Authorized Participant is a member or participant of a clearing agency registered with </span><span>the SEC, which has a written agreement with the Fund or one of its service providers </span><span>that allows such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and </span><span>redemption of Creation Units.</span></div> <div><span>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the Distributor and the Fund, </span><span>generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a </span><span>designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>creation basket</span><span>”</span><span>), and </span><span>an amount of cash (including any cash representing the value of substituted securities, </span><span>assets or other positions), if any, which together approximate the holdings of the Fund </span><span>in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. Similarly, shares can be </span><span>redeemed only in Creation Units, generally for a designated portfolio of securities, </span><span>assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>redemption basket</span><span>”</span><span>) held by the Fund and an amount of </span><span>cash (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted). The </span><span>Fund generally offers Creation Units partially for cash, but may, in certain </span><span>circumstances, offer Creation Units solely for cash or solely in-kind. Except when </span><span>aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by the Fund. Creation and </span><span>redemption baskets may differ and the Fund may accept </span><span>“</span><span>custom baskets.</span><span>”</span><span> More </span><span>information regarding custom baskets is contained in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>34</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The prices at which creations and redemptions occur are based on the next calculation </span><span>of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under </span><span>the authorized participant agreement.</span></div> <div><span>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation Units with the Fund. </span><span>Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or </span><span>for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>In the event of a system failure or other interruption, including disruptions at market </span><span>makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either </span><span>may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at </span><span>all, or the Fund may not be able to place or change orders.</span></div> <div><span>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind transactions, the Fund intends to comply </span><span>with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying </span><span>redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any </span><span>securities accepted for deposit and any securities used to satisfy redemption requests </span><span>will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the 1933 Act. </span><span>Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a </span><span>“</span><span>qualified institutional buyer,</span><span>”</span><span> as such </span><span>term is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted </span><span>securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</span></div> <div><span>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is either a member of the </span><span>Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a </span><span>DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to </span><span>creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations. Information about the </span><span>procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off </span><span>times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> <div><span>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing basis, at any point </span><span>during the life of the Fund a </span><span>“</span><span>distribution,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may </span><span>be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on </span><span>their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed </span><span>participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters </span><span>subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any </span><span>determination of whether one is an underwriter must take into account all the relevant </span><span>facts and circumstances of each particular case.</span></div> <div><span>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not </span><span>“</span><span>underwriters</span><span>”</span><span> but are </span><span>participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and </span><span>thus dealing with shares that are part of an </span><span>“</span><span>unsold allotment</span><span>”</span><span> within the meaning of </span><span>Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the 1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the </span><span>prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For </span><span>delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of </span><span>Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is available only with respect to transactions on a </span><span>national securities exchange.</span></div> <div><span>Householding.</span><span> Householding is an option available to certain Fund investors. </span><span>Householding is a method of delivery, based on the preference of the individual </span><span>investor, in which a single copy of certain shareholder documents can be delivered to </span><span>investors who share the same address, even if their accounts are registered under </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>35</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>different names. Please contact your broker-dealer if you are interested in enrolling in </span><span>householding and receiving a single copy of prospectuses and other shareholder </span><span>documents, or if you are currently enrolled in householding and wish to change your </span><span>householding status.</span></div> <div><span>Distribution</span></div> <div><span>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the Fund on an agency basis. </span><span>The Distributor does not maintain a secondary market in shares of the Fund. The </span><span>Distributor has no role in determining the policies of the Fund or the securities that are </span><span>purchased or sold by the Fund. The Distributor’s principal address is 1 University </span><span>Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</span></div> <div><span>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers, registered investment advisers, </span><span>banks or other intermediaries (together, </span><span>“</span><span>intermediaries</span><span>”</span><span>) related to marketing </span><span>activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the </span><span>development of technology platforms and reporting systems, data provision services, </span><span>or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their </span><span>customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may </span><span>be significant to the intermediary, are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments </span><span>are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or </span><span>indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type </span><span>are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may </span><span>make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or </span><span>the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other </span><span>financial incentives it is eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial </span><span>incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the </span><span>intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the </span><span>Fund or other iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding </span><span>these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. </span><span>Please contact your salesperson or </span><span>other investment professional for more information regarding any such </span><span>payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</span></div> <div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>36</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Financial Highlights</span></div> <div><span>The financial highlights table is intended to help investors understand the Fund’s </span><span>financial performance since inception.

The </span><span>performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, </span><span>including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency valuations, asset valuations, corporate </span><span>actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of </span><span>representative sampling or from legal restrictions (such as diversification </span><span>requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to </span><span>time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments </span><span>to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise determined by BFA, any such change or </span><span>adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on </span><span>a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, </span><span>the Underlying Index performance shown for periods prior to the effective date of any </span><span>such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect </span><span>such change or adjustment. </span></div> <div><span>Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected </span><span>to have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. </span><span>“</span><span>Replication</span><span>”</span><span> is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all of the </span><span>securities in its underlying index in approximately the same proportions as in the </span><span>underlying index.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not insured or guaranteed by </span><span>the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or </span><span>any of its affiliates.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be changed without </span><span>shareholder approval.</span></div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Principal Risks</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The Fund is subject to various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of </span><span>which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability </span><span>to meet its investment objective. The Fund may be exposed to these risks directly or </span><span>indirectly through the Fund's investments in the Underlying Fund. You could lose all or </span><span>part of your investment in the Fund, and the Fund could underperform other </span><span>investments. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of </span><span>any particular risk factor. The Fund discloses its portfolio holdings daily at </span><span>www.iShares.com</span><span>.</span></div> <div><span>Asset Class Risk.</span><span> The securities</span><span> </span><span>and other assets in the Fund’s or the Underlying </span><span>Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that </span><span>track other issuers, countries, groups of countries, regions, industries, groups of </span><span>industries, markets, market segments, asset classes or sectors. Various types of </span><span>securities may experience cycles of outperformance and underperformance in </span><span>comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a number of factors </span><span>including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, global demand for </span><span>local products or resources, and regulation and governmental controls. This may cause </span><span>the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that invest in different asset </span><span>classes.</span></div> <div><span>Assets Under Management (AUM) Risk.</span><span> From time to time, an Authorized </span><span>Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s </span><span>adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a specific period </span><span>of time to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</span><span> </span><span>can be no assurance that any </span><span>such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund would be </span><span>maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. </span><span>Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of </span><span>those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption </span><span>transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized </span><span>Participants on an agency basis (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, on behalf of other market participants). To the </span><span>extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with </span><span>creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized </span><span>Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares </span><span>may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading </span><span>halts or delisting.</span></div> <div><span>Calculation Methodology Risk.</span><span> The Index Provider</span><span> </span><span>relies on various sources of </span><span>information to assess the criteria of components of the Underlying Index, including </span><span>information that may be based on assumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund nor </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>BFA can offer assurances that the Index Provider's calculation methodology or sources </span><span>of information will provide an accurate assessment of included components.</span></div> <div><span>Concentration Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, </span><span>including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than </span><span>the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's </span><span>investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular </span><span>issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of </span><span>industries, project types, group of project types, sector, market segment or asset </span><span>class. The Fund may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of those </span><span>securities and/or other assets, may experience increased price volatility and may be </span><span>more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences </span><span>affecting those securities and/or other assets than a fund that does not concentrate </span><span>its investments.</span></div> <div><span>Covered Call Option Risk.</span><span> By writing covered call options in return for the receipt of </span><span>premiums, the Fund will give up the opportunity to benefit from potential increases in </span><span>the value of the Underlying Fund above the exercise prices of the written options, but </span><span>will continue to bear the risk of declines in the value of the Underlying Fund. The </span><span>premiums received from the options may not be sufficient to offset any losses </span><span>sustained from the volatility of the Underlying Fund over time. In addition, the Fund’s </span><span>ability to sell shares of the Underlying Fund will be limited while the option is in effect </span><span>unless the Fund extinguishes the option position through the purchase of an offsetting </span><span>identical option prior to the expiration of the written option.</span></div> <div><span>The covered call strategy may be subject to imperfect matching or price correlation </span><span>between the written options and the Underlying Fund, which could reduce the Fund’s </span><span>returns. Exchanges may suspend the trading of options (for example due to volatile </span><span>markets or if trading in the Underlying Fund is halted). If trading is suspended, the Fund </span><span>may be unable to write or purchase options at times that may be desirable or </span><span>advantageous to the Fund to do so. If the Fund is unable to extinguish the option </span><span>position before exercise, the Fund may be required to deliver the corresponding shares </span><span>of the Underlying Fund, resulting in increased transaction costs, tracking error, </span><span>underinvestment, and potentially the realization of capital gains. Further, this could </span><span>lead to re-purchasing shares of the Underlying Fund or selling the corresponding </span><span>options at a less favorable price than the Fund might have received had the options </span><span>been extinguished. The Fund uses options which are struck once per month, and the </span><span>timing of changes in the price of the Underlying Fund may affect the Fund’s </span><span>performance. For example, if the Underlying Fund experiences a drop in price followed </span><span>by a quick rebound, the Fund may be unable to fully participate in the rebound if the </span><span>rebound occurs immediately after the Fund’s roll date. In addition, if trading is </span><span>suspended, the Fund may be unable to purchase an offsetting option for purposes of </span><span>closing out an existing written option at the originally scheduled time and date.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund will be affected by movements in interest rates and bond yields and the </span><span>resulting share price of the Underlying Fund. In a falling interest rate environment and </span><span>other environments in which credit spreads narrow, the Underlying Fund is generally </span><span>expected to appreciate in price, and the Fund may underperform the Underlying Fund </span><span>as price appreciation for the Fund is limited to the exercise prices of the options </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>written by the Fund. Credit spread is generally the difference in yield between two </span><span>bonds with the same maturity but different credit ratings and can be impacted by </span><span>interest rates or underlying economic conditions.</span></div> <div><span>Cybersecurity Risk.</span><span> The Fund,</span><span> </span><span>the Underlying Fund,</span><span> </span><span>Authorized Participants, service </span><span>providers and the relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information </span><span>security and related </span><span>“</span><span>cyber</span><span>”</span><span> risks both directly and through their service providers. </span><span>Similar types of cybersecurity risks are also present for issuers of securities in which </span><span>the Fund or the Underlying Fund invest, which could result in material adverse </span><span>consequences for such issuers and may cause the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's </span><span>investment in such issuers to lose value. In general, cyber incidents can result from </span><span>deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are not limited </span><span>to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, through </span><span>“</span><span>hacking</span><span>”</span><span> or malicious </span><span>software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, </span><span>corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyberattacks may also be carried </span><span>out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing </span><span>denial-of-service attacks on websites (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, efforts to make network services unavailable </span><span>to intended users). Recently, geopolitical tensions may have increased the scale and </span><span>sophistication of deliberate attacks, particularly those from nation-states or from </span><span>entities with nation-state backing. </span></div> <div><span>Cybersecurity failures by, or breaches of, the systems of the Fund's or the Underlying </span><span>Fund's adviser, distributor and other service providers (including, but not limited to, </span><span>index and benchmark providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and </span><span>administrators), market makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in </span><span>which the Fund or the Underlying Fund invest have the ability to cause disruptions and </span><span>impact business operations, potentially resulting in: financial losses, interference with </span><span>the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's ability to calculate its NAV, disclosure of </span><span>confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of erroneous </span><span>trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund, the </span><span>Underlying Fund or their service providers to transact business, violations of applicable </span><span>privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, </span><span>reimbursement or other compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In </span><span>addition, cyberattacks may render records of Fund assets and transactions, </span><span>shareholder ownership of Fund shares, and other data integral to the functioning of the </span><span>Fund or the Underlying Fund inaccessible, inaccurate or incomplete. Substantial costs </span><span>may be incurred by the Fund or the Underlying Fund in order to resolve or prevent </span><span>cyber incidents in the future. While the Fund and the Underlying Fund have established </span><span>business continuity plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, </span><span>such cyber incidents, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems, </span><span>including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified, that prevention and </span><span>remediation efforts will not be successful or that cyberattacks will go undetected. </span><span>Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place </span><span>by service providers to the Fund or Underlying Fund, issuers in which the Fund or </span><span>Underlying Fund invests, the Index Provider, market makers or Authorized Participants. </span><span>The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Derivatives Risk.</span><span>The Fund will use covered calls, which are options, in seeking to </span><span>achieve the Fund’s investment objective. The Fund’s use of options, like investment in </span><span>other derivatives, may reduce the Fund’s returns or increase volatility. A risk of the </span><span>Fund’s use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate with </span><span>the value of the underlying asset, the performance of the asset class to which the Fund </span><span>seeks exposure or to the performance of the overall securities markets. Since the </span><span>Fund’s covered call options are written on shares of the Underlying Fund, if the </span><span>increase in the price of the Underlying Fund is significantly above the exercise price of </span><span>a written option, the Fund would likely substantially underperform the Underlying Fund. </span><span>In addition, implied volatility is one of the primary inputs in options pricing. As volatility </span><span>increases, the value of an option also increases (and vice-versa). Changes in the level </span><span>of volatility can affect the amount of premium the Fund will receive from writing </span><span>options and increased volatility may increase the cost the Fund pays to close out an </span><span>open option position.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund’s use of derivatives may reduce the Fund’s returns or increase volatility. </span><span>Volatility is defined as the characteristic of a security, a currency, an index or a market </span><span>to fluctuate significantly in price within a short time period. Derivatives may also be </span><span>subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will </span><span>not fulfill its contractual obligation. A risk of the Fund’s use of derivatives is that the </span><span>fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the value of the underlying </span><span>asset, the performance of the asset class to which the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund seeks </span><span>exposure or the performance of the overall markets. The possible lack of a liquid </span><span>secondary market for derivatives and the resulting inability of the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying </span><span>Fund to sell or otherwise close a derivatives position could expose the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or </span><span>Underlying Fund to losses and could make derivatives more difficult for the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or </span><span>Underlying Fund to value accurately. The Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund could also suffer </span><span>losses related to its derivatives positions as a result of unanticipated market </span><span>movements, or movements between the time of periodic reallocations of Fund</span><span> </span><span>or </span><span>Underlying Fund assets, which losses are potentially unlimited. Certain derivatives may </span><span>give rise to a form of leverage and may expose the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund to greater </span><span>risk and increase its costs.</span><span> </span><span>To the extent that the Fund invests in rolling futures </span><span>contracts, it may be subject to additional risk. The impact of U.S. and global regulation </span><span>of derivatives may make derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of </span><span>derivatives, may delay or restrict the exercise by the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund of </span><span>termination rights or remedies upon a counterparty default under derivatives held by </span><span>the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund (which could result in losses), or may otherwise adversely </span><span>affect the value or performance of derivatives. In addition, the Fund's use of derivatives </span><span>may expose the Fund to risks related to potential operational issues, such as </span><span>documentation and settlement issues, systems failures, inadequate controls and </span><span>human error. Derivatives may also involve legal risks, including insufficient </span><span>documentation, insufficient capacity or authority of a counterparty, and legality and </span><span>enforceability of a contract.</span></div> <div><span>Distribution Tax Risk.</span><span> The Fund currently expects to make distributions on a regular </span><span>basis. While the Fund will normally pay its income as distributions, the Fund's </span><span>distributions may exceed the Fund's income and gains for the Fund's taxable year. The </span><span>Fund may be required to reduce its distributions if it has insufficient income. </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Distributions in excess of the Fund's current and accumulated earnings and profits will </span><span>be treated as a return of capital. Distributions in excess of the Fund's minimum </span><span>distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund's earnings and profits, will be </span><span>taxable to Fund shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A </span><span>return of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the </span><span>shareholder's cost basis and will result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss </span><span>when those Fund shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a Fund </span><span>shareholder's cost basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as </span><span>capital gain, if the Fund shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets. </span><span>Because the Fund's distributions may consist of return of capital, the Fund may not be </span><span>an appropriate investment for investors who do not want their principal investment in </span><span>the Fund to decrease over time or who do not wish to receive return of capital in a </span><span>given period.</span></div> <div><span>Income Risk.</span><span> The Fund’s income may decline if yields fall because the Fund or the </span><span>Underlying Fund may hold a significant portion of short duration securities and/or </span><span>securities that have floating or variable interest rates. The Fund’s income may decline </span><span>because the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests in lower yielding bonds as bonds in its </span><span>portfolio mature, are near maturity, or when the Fund or the Underlying Fund needs to </span><span>purchase additional bonds. The Fund’s income from option premiums may fall due to </span><span>changes in market conditions.</span></div> <div><span>Index-Related Risk.</span><span> The Fund seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to </span><span>the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as </span><span>published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any </span><span>agents that may act on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that </span><span>the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the </span><span>Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to </span><span>achieve, neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any </span><span>liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or </span><span>its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in line with </span><span>the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to </span><span>manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider </span><span>to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee against the Index Provider’s or </span><span>any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the </span><span>data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not </span><span>be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, </span><span>particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or </span><span>managers. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its </span><span>shareholders. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains </span><span>incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and </span><span>would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Shareholders </span><span>should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund </span><span>and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will </span><span>be borne by the Fund and its shareholders. Because the Index Provider is relatively new </span><span>to the creation of securities indexes, there may be a greater risk that index errors will </span><span>not be detected as quickly as they might be in the case of an index maintained by a </span><span>long-standing index provider.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>6</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Unusual market conditions or other unforeseen circumstances (such as natural </span><span>disasters, political unrest or war) may impact the Index Provider or a third-party data </span><span>provider, and could cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance to the </span><span>Underlying Index. This could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or </span><span>expected composition. The postponement of a scheduled rebalance could mean that </span><span>constituents of the Underlying Index that would otherwise be removed at rebalance </span><span>due to changes in market value, issuer credit ratings, or other reasons may remain, </span><span>causing the performance and constituents of the Underlying Index to vary from those </span><span>expected under normal conditions. Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index </span><span>Provider or its agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying </span><span>Index due to reaching certain weighting constraints, unusual market conditions or </span><span>corporate events or, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index </span><span>constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances </span><span>its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the </span><span>Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such </span><span>portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Therefore, </span><span>errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the Index Provider or its agents </span><span>to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Infectious Illness Risk. </span><span>A widespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as the </span><span>COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect the economies of many nations and the </span><span>global economy and may impact individual issuers and capital markets in ways that </span><span>cannot be foreseen.</span></div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in travel restrictions, closed international </span><span>borders, disruption of healthcare services, prolonged quarantines, cancellations, </span><span>supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, temporary and permanent closures </span><span>of businesses, layoffs, defaults and other significant economic, social and political </span><span>impacts, as well as general concern and uncertainty.</span></div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in extreme volatility, severe losses, credit </span><span>deterioration of issuers, and disruptions in markets, which could adversely impact the </span><span>Fund and its investments, including impairing any hedging activity.</span></div> <div><span>Certain local markets may be subject to closures. Any suspension of trading in markets </span><span>in which the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or the Underlying Fund invests will have an impact on the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or </span><span>Underlying Fund and its investments and will impact the Fund’s</span><span> </span><span>or the Underlying </span><span>Fund's ability to purchase or sell securities in such markets.</span><span> </span><span>Market or economic </span><span>disruptions could result in elevated tracking error and increased premiums or </span><span>discounts to the Fund's NAV. Additionally, an outbreak could impair the operations of </span><span>the Fund’s service providers, including BFA, which could adversely impact the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Governmental and quasi-governmental authorities and regulators throughout the world </span><span>may respond to an outbreak and any resulting economic disruptions with a variety of </span><span>fiscal and monetary policy changes, including direct capital infusions into companies </span><span>and other issuers, new monetary policy tools, and changes in interest rates. A reversal </span><span>of these policies, or the ineffectiveness of such policies, is likely to increase market </span><span>volatility, which could adversely affect the Fund’s investments.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>7</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>An outbreak may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social and economic risks in </span><span>certain countries or globally, which could adversely affect the Fund and its investments </span><span>and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Despite the development of vaccines, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its </span><span>effects cannot be predicted with certainty.</span></div> <div><span>Interest Rate Risk.</span><span> If interest rates rise, the value of fixed-income securities or other </span><span>instruments held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund would likely decrease. A measure </span><span>investors commonly use to determine this price sensitivity is called duration. Fixed-income</span><span> securities with longer durations tend to be more sensitive to interest rate </span><span>changes, usually making their prices more volatile than those of securities with shorter </span><span>durations. For example, if a bond has a duration of five years and interest rates rise, </span><span>the price of the bond will likely decline by a greater percentage than if the bond had a </span><span>one year duration. To the extent the Fund or the Underlying Fund invests a substantial </span><span>portion of its assets in fixed-income securities with longer duration, rising interest rates </span><span>may cause the value of the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's investments to decline </span><span>significantly, which would adversely affect the value of the Fund. An increase in interest </span><span>rates may lead to heightened volatility in the fixed-income markets and adversely </span><span>affect certain investments, including those held by the Fund or the Underlying Fund. In </span><span>addition, decreases in fixed income dealer market-making capacity may lead to lower </span><span>trading volume, heightened volatility, wider bid-ask spreads and less transparent </span><span>pricing in certain fixed-income markets.</span></div> <div><span>The historically low interest rate environment in recent years was created in part by the </span><span>world’s major central banks keeping their overnight policy interest rates at, near or </span><span>below zero percent and implementing monetary policy facilities, such as asset </span><span>purchase programs, to anchor longer-term interest rates below historical levels. During </span><span>periods of very low or negative interest rates, the Fund may be unable to maintain </span><span>positive returns or pay dividends to Fund shareholders. Certain countries have recently </span><span>experienced negative interest rates on certain fixed-income instruments. Very low or </span><span>negative interest rates may magnify interest rate risk. Changing interest rates, </span><span>including rates that fall below zero, may have unpredictable effects on markets, result </span><span>in heightened market volatility and detract from the Fund’s performance to the extent </span><span>the Fund is exposed to such interest rates. Additionally, under certain market </span><span>conditions in which interest rates are set at low levels and the market prices of </span><span>portfolio securities have increased, the Fund or the Underlying Fund may have a very </span><span>low or even negative yield. A low or negative yield would cause the Fund or the </span><span>Underlying Fund to lose money in certain conditions and over certain time periods. </span><span>Central banks may increase their short-term policy rates or begin phasing out, or </span><span>“</span><span>tapering,</span><span>”</span><span> accommodative monetary policy facilities in the future. The timing, </span><span>coordination, magnitude and effect of such policy changes on various markets are </span><span>uncertain, and such changes in monetary policy may adversely affect the value of the </span><span>Fund’s investments.</span></div> <div><span>Investment in the Underlying Fund Risk.</span><span> The Fund expects to invest a substantial </span><span>portion of its assets in the Underlying Fund, so the Fund’s investment performance is </span><span>likely to be directly related to the performance of the Underlying Fund. The Fund may </span><span>also invest in other funds, including money market funds. The Fund’s NAV will change </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>with changes in the value of the Underlying Fund and other investments based on their </span><span>market valuations. An investment in the Fund will entail more direct and indirect costs </span><span>and expenses than a direct investment in the Underlying Fund. For example, in addition </span><span>to the expenses of the Fund, the Fund indirectly pays a portion of the expenses </span><span>(including operating expenses and management fees) incurred by the Underlying Fund, </span><span>although some of such fees will be offset by the fee waiver by BFA.</span></div> <div><span>An investor in the Fund may receive taxable gains from portfolio transactions by the </span><span>Underlying Fund, as well as taxable gains from transactions in shares of the Underlying </span><span>Fund held by the Fund. The Fund and the Underlying Fund may also hold common </span><span>portfolio securities.</span></div> <div><span>As the Fund's allocation to the Underlying Fund changes from time to time, or to the </span><span>extent that the total annual fund operating expenses of the Underlying Fund change, </span><span>the weighted average operating expenses borne by the Fund may increase or decrease.</span></div> <div><span>Issuer Risk. </span><span>The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual </span><span>securities to which the Fund or the Underlying Fund has exposure. The Fund may be </span><span>adversely affected if an issuer of underlying securities held by the Fund or the </span><span>Underlying Fund is unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due. Any </span><span>issuer of these securities may perform poorly, causing the value of its securities to </span><span>decline. Poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions, competitive </span><span>pressures, changes in technology, expiration of patent protection, disruptions in </span><span>supply, labor problems or shortages, corporate restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, </span><span>credit deterioration of the issuer or other factors. Changes to the financial condition or </span><span>credit rating of an issuer of those securities may cause the value of the securities to </span><span>decline. An issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries, states </span><span>and regions in which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts </span><span>operations.</span></div> <div><span>Large Shareholder and Large-Scale Redemption Risk.</span><span> Certain shareholders, </span><span>including an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an </span><span>affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, a market maker, or another entity, may from time to time </span><span>own or manage a substantial amount of Fund shares or may invest in the Fund and </span><span>hold their investment for a limited period of time. These shareholders may also pledge </span><span>or loan Fund shares (to secure financing or otherwise), which may result in the shares </span><span>becoming concentrated in another party. There can be no assurance that any large </span><span>shareholder or large group of shareholders would not redeem their investment or that </span><span>the size of the Fund would be maintained. Redemptions of a large number of Fund </span><span>shares by these shareholders may adversely affect the Fund’s liquidity and net assets. </span><span>To the extent the Fund permits redemptions in cash, these redemptions may force the </span><span>Fund to sell portfolio securities when it might not otherwise do so, which may </span><span>negatively impact the Fund’s NAV, have a material effect on the market price of the </span><span>Shares and increase the Fund’s brokerage costs and/or accelerate the realization of </span><span>taxable income and/or gains and cause the Fund to make taxable distributions to its </span><span>shareholders earlier than the Fund otherwise would have. In addition, under certain </span><span>circumstances, non-redeeming shareholders may be treated as receiving a </span><span>disproportionately large taxable distribution during or with respect to such tax year. </span><span>The Fund also may be required to sell its more liquid Fund investments to meet a large </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>9</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>redemption, in which case the Fund’s remaining assets may be less liquid, more </span><span>volatile, and more difficult to price. To the extent these large shareholders transact in </span><span>shares on the secondary market, such transactions may account for a large </span><span>percentage of the trading volume for the shares of the Fund and may, therefore, have a </span><span>material upward or downward effect on the market price of the Fund shares. In </span><span>addition, large purchases of Fund shares may adversely affect the Fund’s performance </span><span>to the extent that the Fund is delayed in investing new cash and is required to maintain </span><span>a larger cash position than it ordinarily would, diluting its investment returns.</span></div> <div><span>Management Risk. </span><span>Because BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, </span><span>the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities not </span><span>included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that BFA’s </span><span>investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of </span><span>constraints, may not produce the intended results. The Fund is also subject to the risk </span><span>that the investment strategy of the Underlying Fund may not produce the intended </span><span>results.</span></div> <div><span>Market Risk.</span><span> The Fund</span><span> </span><span>and the Underlying Fund could lose money over short periods </span><span>due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged </span><span>market downturns.</span><span> </span><span>Market risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future values of </span><span>financial instruments and may be influenced by price, currency and interest rate </span><span>movements. It represents the potential loss the Fund and the Underlying Fund may </span><span>suffer through holding financial instruments in the face of market movements or </span><span>uncertainty. The value of a security, asset, or other instrument may decline due to </span><span>changes in general market conditions, economic trends or events that are not </span><span>specifically related to the issuer of the security</span><span> </span><span>or other asset, or factors that affect a </span><span>particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group </span><span>of industries, sector or asset class. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of </span><span>terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, or </span><span>other events could have a significant impact on the Fund, the Underlying Fund and </span><span>their investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s</span><span> </span><span>or </span><span>Underlying Fund's NAV. During a general market downturn, multiple asset classes may </span><span>be negatively affected. Fixed-income securities with short-term maturities are generally </span><span>less sensitive to such changes than are fixed-income securities with longer-term </span><span>maturities. Changes in market conditions and interest rates generally do not have the </span><span>same impact on all types of securities and instruments.</span></div> <div><span>Market Trading Risk.</span></div> <div><span>Absence of Active Market.</span><span> Although shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund are </span><span>listed for trading on one or more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an </span><span>active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers </span><span>or Authorized Participants.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Secondary Listings. </span><span>The Fund's and the Underlying Fund's shares may be listed </span><span>or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange </span><span>where the Fund's primary listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made available </span><span>to non-U.S. investors through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to </span><span>depositary receipts. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s or the Underlying </span><span>Fund's shares will continue to trade on any such stock exchange or in any market or </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>that the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's shares will continue to meet the requirements </span><span>for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's or the Underlying </span><span>Fund's shares may be less actively traded in certain markets than in others, and </span><span>investors are subject to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of </span><span>the market where they or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain </span><span>information available to investors who trade Fund or Underlying Fund shares on a U.S. </span><span>stock exchange during regular U.S. market hours may not be available to investors who </span><span>trade in other markets, which may result in secondary market prices in such markets </span><span>being less efficient.</span></div> <div><span>Secondary Market Trading Risk.</span><span> Shares of the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or the Underlying Fund may trade in </span><span>the secondary market at times when the Fund or the Underlying Fund does not accept </span><span>orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such times, shares may trade in the </span><span>secondary market with more significant premiums or discounts than might be </span><span>experienced at times when the Fund or the Underlying Fund accepts purchase and </span><span>redemption orders. If the Fund purchases shares of the Underlying Fund at a time when </span><span>the market price of Underlying Fund shares is at a premium to its NAV or sells </span><span>Underlying Fund shares when their market price is at a discount to its NAV, the Fund </span><span>may incur losses.</span></div> <div><span>Secondary market trading in Fund or Underlying Fund shares may be halted by a stock </span><span>exchange because of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in </span><span>Fund or Underlying Fund shares on a stock exchange or in any market may be subject </span><span>to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to </span><span>“</span><span>circuit breaker</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>rules on the stock exchange or market.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund or the Underlying Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed on a </span><span>stock exchange, may be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased </span><span>volatility and price decreases associated with being sold short. In addition, trading </span><span>activity in derivative products based on the Fund or the Underlying Fund may lead to </span><span>increased trading volume and volatility in the secondary market for the shares of the </span><span>Fund or the Underlying Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund and the Underlying Fund May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV.</span><span> Shares </span><span>of the Fund and the Underlying Fund each trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above </span><span>or below the respective Fund’s and the Underlying Fund's most recent NAV. The NAV of </span><span>the Fund and the Underlying Fund are calculated at the end of each business day and </span><span>fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's </span><span>holdings. The trading price of each of the Fund's and the Underlying Fund's shares </span><span>fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours</span><span> </span><span>based on both market supply of and </span><span>demand for their shares and the underlying value of their portfolio holdings or NAV. As </span><span>a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s and the Underlying Fund's shares may deviate </span><span>significantly from NAV during periods of market volatility, including during periods of </span><span>significant redemption requests or other unusual market conditions. </span><span>ANY OF THESE </span><span>FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S OR THE UNDERLYING </span><span>FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</span><span>. However, </span><span>because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes </span><span>that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund or the Underlying Fund, as </span><span>applicable, are not likely to be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and </span><span>sometimes at premiums to, their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature is </span><span>designed to make it more likely that the Fund’s</span><span> </span><span>or the Underlying Fund's shares </span><span>normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the Fund’s or the Underlying </span><span>Fund's next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly with </span><span>their respective NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other </span><span>factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at </span><span>market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during </span><span>periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the </span><span>Fund or the Underlying Fund that differ significantly from their respective NAV. </span><span>Authorized Participants may be less willing to create or redeem Fund or Underlying </span><span>Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for such shares or its underlying </span><span>investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s or Underlying Fund's shares trading at </span><span>a premium or discount to NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.</span><span> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange </span><span>involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or </span><span>selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage </span><span>commission and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread</span><span>”</span><span>; </span><span>that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>bid</span><span>”</span><span> price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>ask</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>price).</span><span> </span><span>The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume </span><span>and market liquidity and wider if the Fund has less trading volume and market liquidity. </span><span>In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be </span><span>regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because </span><span>of the costs inherent in buying or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract </span><span>significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be </span><span>advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a </span><span>brokerage account.</span></div> <div><span>Operational Risk.</span><span> The Fund and the Underlying Fund are exposed to operational risks </span><span>arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing </span><span>and communication errors, errors of the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's service </span><span>providers, counterparties or other third parties, failed or inadequate processes and </span><span>technology or systems failures. The Fund, the Underlying Fund and BFA seek to reduce </span><span>these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do </span><span>not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant </span><span>operational risks.</span></div> <div><span>Passive Investment Risk.</span><span> The Fund and the Underlying Fund are not actively </span><span>managed and may be affected by a general decline in market segments related to the </span><span>applicable</span><span> </span><span>Underlying Index. The Fund and the Underlying Fund invest in securities </span><span>included in, or representative of, the applicable Underlying Index, regardless of their </span><span>investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in </span><span>defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets. The </span><span>Fund may also be exposed to passive investment risk through its investment in the </span><span>Underlying Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>12</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the U.S.</span><span> A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade </span><span>regulations, inflation and/or an economic recession in the U.S. may have a material </span><span>adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed on U.S. exchanges. </span><span>Proposed and adopted policy and legislative changes in the U.S. are changing many </span><span>aspects of financial, commercial, public health, environmental, and other regulation </span><span>and may have a significant effect on U.S. markets generally, as well as on the value of </span><span>certain securities. Governmental agencies project that the U.S. will continue to </span><span>maintain elevated public debt levels for the foreseeable future. Although elevated debt </span><span>levels do not necessarily indicate or cause economic problems, elevated public debt </span><span>service costs may constrain future economic growth.</span></div> <div><span>The U.S. has developed increasingly strained relations with a number of foreign </span><span>countries. If relations with certain countries deteriorate, it could adversely affect U.S. </span><span>issuers as well as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also </span><span>experienced increased internal unrest and discord, as well as significant challenges in </span><span>managing and containing the outbreak of COVID-19. If these trends were to continue, </span><span>it may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the issuers in which the Fund </span><span>or the Underlying Fund invests.</span></div> <div><span>Small Fund Risk. </span><span>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading </span><span>volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being </span><span>delisted if the Fund does not meet certain conditions of the listing exchange. If the </span><span>Fund were to be required to delist from the listing exchange, the value of the Fund may </span><span>rapidly decline and performance may be negatively impacted. Any resulting liquidation </span><span>of the Fund could cause the Fund to incur elevated transaction costs for the Fund and </span><span>negative tax consequences for its shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>Tax Risk.</span><span> The tax rules and limitations that apply to the Fund will cause some or all of </span><span>its income and gain to be taxable as ordinary income or at ordinary income rates, may </span><span>accelerate its recognition of income and gain, and may defer its use of losses, all of </span><span>which are expected to have negative tax consequences for the Fund and Fund </span><span>investors. Because the assets comprising the Underlying Index and held by the </span><span>Underlying Fund will not consist of stock, ordinary dividends from the Fund will not be </span><span>eligible for the reduced rates applicable to </span><span>“</span><span>qualified dividend income</span><span>”</span><span> or eligible for </span><span>the dividends-received deduction. The Fund expects that its ownership of shares of the </span><span>Underlying Fund and sale of call options thereon generally will constitute </span><span>“</span><span>straddles</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>(offsetting positions with respect to personal property) under section 1092 of the </span><span>Internal Revenue Code. The straddle rules generally do not apply if all the straddle’s </span><span>offsetting positions consist of </span><span>“</span><span>qualified covered call options</span><span>”</span><span> and the stock to be </span><span>purchased under the options, and the straddle is not part of a larger straddle. Unlike </span><span>certain other funds that utilize covered call strategies, the Fund does not anticipate </span><span>that this exception will be available because, as a general matter, the call options it </span><span>writes are not expected to be treated as </span><span>“</span><span>qualified covered call options.</span><span>”</span><span> The straddle </span><span>rules usually will terminate the Fund’s holding periods for its shares of the Underlying </span><span>Fund that become part of a straddle before the long-term capital gain holding period </span><span>(more than one year) has been reached, which is expected to eliminate the Fund’s </span><span>ability to recognize long-term capital gains from a sale or other disposition of such </span><span>shares. The straddle rules also usually will defer recognition of realized losses and </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>13</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>require the capitalization of certain interest expenses and carrying charges. Similarly, </span><span>“</span><span>wash sale</span><span>”</span><span> rules may apply to defer the recognition of loss by the Fund from the </span><span>disposition of stock or securities at a loss in a case in which identical or substantially </span><span>identical stock or securities (or an option to acquire such property) is or has been </span><span>acquired within a prescribed period. As a result of the foregoing, an investor may be </span><span>subject to significantly greater amounts of tax as a result of the investment than would </span><span>apply to an investment in a fund engaged in a different investment strategy.</span></div> <div><span>Tracking Error Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be subject to </span><span>“</span><span>tracking error,</span><span>”</span><span> which is the </span><span>divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error </span><span>may occur because of differences between the securities and other instruments held in </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences, </span><span>transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, </span><span>differences in timing of the accrual or the valuation of distributions, the requirements </span><span>to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize </span><span>the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, </span><span>changes to the Underlying Index, the effect the Fund’s transactions would have on the </span><span>market for the securities in the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying </span><span>with various new or existing regulatory requirements, among other reasons. This risk </span><span>may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market </span><span>conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, </span><span>while the Underlying Index does not. </span><span>INDEX ETFs THAT TRACK INDICES WITH </span><span>SIGNIFICANT </span><span>WEIGHT IN OPTIONS </span><span>MAY EXPERIENCE HIGHER TRACKING </span><span>ERROR THAN OTHER INDEX ETFs THAT DO NOT TRACK SUCH INDICES.</span></div> <div><span>U.S. Treasury Obligations Risk. </span><span>U.S. Treasury obligations may differ from other </span><span>securities in their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and other </span><span>characteristics. Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial condition or credit </span><span>rating of the U.S. government may cause the value of the Fund's or the Underlying </span><span>Fund's U.S. Treasury obligations to decline. Direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury have </span><span>historically involved little risk of loss of principal if held to maturity. However, due to </span><span>fluctuations in interest rates, the market value of such securities may vary during the </span><span>period shareholders own shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</span></div> <div><span>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated with its investments </span><span>and investment strategies</span><span> </span><span>either directly or indirectly through the Fund's investments </span><span>in the Underlying Fund. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the </span><span>significance of any particular risk factor.</span></div> <div><span>Close-Out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.</span><span> Regulations adopted by global </span><span>prudential regulators require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global </span><span>systemically important banking organizations to include contractual restrictions on </span><span>close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. </span><span>Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards </span><span>and other derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending </span><span>agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial </span><span>contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>proceedings and also prohibit the Fund from exercising default rights due to a </span><span>receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. These </span><span>requirements may increase credit risk and other risks to the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Illiquid Investments Risk. </span><span>The Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, </span><span>immediately after the acquisition, the Fund would have invested more than 15% of its </span><span>net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the </span><span>Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in </span><span>seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the </span><span>investment. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, </span><span>particularly during periods of market turmoil. There can be no assurance that a security </span><span>or instrument that is deemed to be liquid when purchased will continue to be liquid for </span><span>as long as it is held by the Fund, and any security or instrument held by the Fund may </span><span>be deemed an illiquid investment pursuant to the Fund’s liquidity risk management </span><span>program. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid investments may </span><span>reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be unable to transact at </span><span>advantageous times or prices. An investment may be illiquid due to, among other </span><span>things, the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a </span><span>market in securities or instruments</span><span> </span><span>or the lack of an active market for such securities </span><span>or instruments. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or instruments with </span><span>substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have increased exposure to </span><span>the risks associated with illiquid investments. Illiquid investments may be harder to </span><span>value, especially in changing markets. If the Fund is forced to sell underlying </span><span>investments at reduced prices or under unfavorable conditions to meet redemption </span><span>requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. This may be magnified in </span><span>a rising interest rate environment or other circumstances where redemptions from the </span><span>Fund may be greater than normal. Other market participants may be attempting to </span><span>liquidate holdings at the same time as the Fund, causing increased supply of the Fund’s </span><span>underlying investments in the market and contributing to illiquid investments risk and </span><span>downward pricing pressure. In addition, if the Fund is limited in its ability to sell illiquid </span><span>investments during periods when shareholders are redeeming their shares, the Fund </span><span>will need to sell liquid securities to meet redemption requests and illiquid securities will </span><span>become a larger portion of the Fund’s holdings. During periods of market volatility, </span><span>liquidity in the market for the Fund’s shares may be impacted by the liquidity in the </span><span>market for the underlying securities or instruments held by the Fund, which could lead </span><span>to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.</span><span> If certain aggregate and/or fund-level ownership </span><span>thresholds are reached through transactions undertaken by BFA, its affiliates or the </span><span>Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions or actions by an issuer or regulator, the </span><span>ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to purchase or </span><span>dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be </span><span>restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make </span><span>investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant threshold limits, and </span><span>such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio holdings</span><span> </span><span>compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This </span><span>may increase the risk of the Fund being underinvested to the Underlying Index and </span><span>increase the risk of tracking error.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>15</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>For example, in certain circumstances where the Fund invests in securities issued by </span><span>companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or </span><span>international markets, is subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or </span><span>invests in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits on the </span><span>aggregate and/or fund-level amount invested or voted by BFA and its affiliates for their </span><span>proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Fund) that may not be </span><span>exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if </span><span>exceeded, may cause BFA and its affiliates, the Fund or other client accounts to suffer </span><span>disadvantages or business restrictions.</span></div> <div><span>Portfolio Holdings Information</span></div> <div><span>A description of the Trust's policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Fund's Statement of Additional </span><span>Information (</span><span>“</span><span>SAI</span><span>”</span><span>).

In addition, the securities in the Underlying Fund’s </span><span>underlying index must be fixed-rate and denominated in U.S. dollars. Excluded from the </span><span>Underlying Fund’s underlying index are inflation-linked securities, Treasury bills, cash </span><span>management bills, any government agency debt issued with or without a government </span><span>guarantee and zero-coupon issues that have been stripped from coupon-paying bonds. </span><span>The Underlying Fund’s underlying index is market value weighted, and the securities in </span><span>the Underlying Fund’s underlying index are updated on the last business day of each </span><span>month.</span></div> <div><span>In managing the Underlying Fund, BFA uses a representative sampling index strategy. </span><span>Representative sampling is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a </span><span>representative sample of securities that collectively have an investment profile similar </span><span>to a specified benchmark index. Securities selected for the Underlying Fund are </span><span>expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such </span><span>as market value and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return </span><span>variability, duration, maturity, credit ratings and yield) and liquidity measures similar to </span><span>those of the applicable underlying index. The Underlying Fund may or may not hold all </span><span>of the securities that are included in its underlying index and may hold certain </span><span>securities that are not included in its underlying index.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>16</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Management</span></div> <div><span>Investment Adviser.</span><span> As investment adviser, BFA has overall responsibility for the </span><span>general management and administration of the Fund. BFA provides an investment </span><span>program for the Fund and manages the investment of the Fund’s assets. In managing </span><span>the Fund, BFA may draw upon the trading, research and expertise of its asset </span><span>management affiliates for portfolio decisions and management with respect to </span><span>portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's investment objective, BFA uses </span><span>teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists and other investment specialists. </span><span>This team approach brings together many disciplines and leverages BFA’s extensive </span><span>resources.</span></div> <div><span>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and the Trust (entered </span><span>into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the </span><span>Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with </span><span>respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of </span><span>portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, </span><span>and litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of </span><span>the Trustees who are not </span><span>“</span><span>interested persons</span><span>”</span><span> of the Trust).</span></div> <div><span>Effective October 6, 2023, for its investment advisory services to the Fund, BFA is paid </span><span>a management fee from the Fund, as a percentage of the Fund’s average daily net </span><span>assets, at the annual rate of 0.20%. Prior to October 6, 2023 and for the fiscal year </span><span>ended October 31, 2022, BFA was paid a management fee from the Fund, as a </span><span>percentage of the Fund’s average daily net assets, net of any applicable waivers, at the </span><span>annual rate of 0.20%. Prior to October 6, 2023, BFA had contractually agreed to waive </span><span>a portion of its management fees so that the Fund’s total annual fund operating </span><span>expenses after the fee waiver was equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses </span><span>attributable to the Fund’s investment in TLT, after taking into account any fee waivers </span><span>by TLT, plus 0.20%. The contractual waiver was terminated as of October 6, 2023, by </span><span>written agreement of the Trust and BFA. In addition, BFA may from time to time </span><span>voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses in order to limit total annual fund </span><span>operating expenses (excluding Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any). Any such </span><span>voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any time.</span></div> <div><span>BFA is located at 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. It is an indirect wholly-owned</span><span> subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (</span><span>“</span><span>BlackRock</span><span>”</span><span>). As of December 31, 2022, BFA and </span><span>its affiliates provided investment advisory services for assets in excess of $8.6 trillion. </span><span>BFA and its affiliates trade and invest for their own accounts in the actual securities </span><span>and types of securities in which the Fund may also invest, which may affect the price of </span><span>such securities.</span></div> <div><span>A discussion regarding the basis for the approval by the Trust's Board of Trustees (the </span><span>“</span><span>Board</span><span>”</span><span>) of the Investment Advisory Agreement with BFA is available in the Fund's </span><span>Annual Report for the period ended October 31.</span></div> <div><span>Portfolio Managers.</span><span> Jennifer Hsui, Orlando Montalvo, Greg Savage and Paul </span><span>Whitehead are primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund.

BFA and its Affiliates provide investment </span><span>management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that may </span><span>follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA and its Affiliates are </span><span>involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management </span><span>activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in which their </span><span>interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or </span><span>one or more Affiliates act, or may act, as an investor, research provider, investment </span><span>manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, </span><span>adviser, trader, lender,</span><span> </span><span>index provider, agent and/or principal, and have other direct </span><span>and indirect interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other </span><span>instruments in which the Fund may directly or indirectly invest. The Fund may invest in </span><span>securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate </span><span>has significant debt or equity investments or other interests.

The Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in other </span><span>transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate provides or may in the future </span><span>provide research coverage. An Affiliate may have business relationships with, and </span><span>purchase or distribute or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants </span><span>or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, </span><span>and may receive compensation for such services. BFA or one or more Affiliates may </span><span>engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment </span><span>objectives similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for </span><span>transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the </span><span>Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end</span><span> investment companies (which may include investment companies that are </span><span>affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment </span><span>Company Act of 1940, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1940 Act</span><span>”</span><span>)). The trading activities of BFA and </span><span>these Affiliates are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly </span><span>by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate having positions in certain securities </span><span>that are senior or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities </span><span>that are owned by the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to share any investment </span><span>opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with </span><span>the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's </span><span>investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an Affiliate and of other </span><span>accounts managed by BlackRock or an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could </span><span>sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts </span><span>achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The opposite result is </span><span>also possible.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, the Fund may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an </span><span>Affiliate or</span><span> </span><span>its or their directors, officers, employees or clients have an adverse interest. </span><span>Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or managed by BFA or its </span><span>Affiliates may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or</span><span> </span><span>by </span><span>BFA or its Affiliates or their directors, officers or employees may have the effect of </span><span>diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund's activities may be limited because of regulatory restrictions applicable to </span><span>BFA or one or more Affiliates and/or their internal policies designed to comply with </span><span>such restrictions.</span></div> <div><span>It is also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients </span><span>(including other funds and separately managed accounts) may, subject to compliance </span><span>with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of the Fund. The price, availability, </span><span>liquidity, and (in some cases) expense ratio of the Fund may be impacted by purchases </span><span>and sales of the Fund by BlackRock and/or its advisory clients.</span></div> <div><span>The activities of BFA and its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers or </span><span>employees may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>19</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>and its shareholders.

Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, </span><span>shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a </span><span>Creation Unit.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange for trading during the </span><span>trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of </span><span>other publicly-traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment </span><span>for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or otherwise in the secondary </span><span>market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol </span><span>“</span><span>TLTW.</span><span>”</span></div> <div><span>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary market involves two </span><span>types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling </span><span>shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other </span><span>charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may be a significant </span><span>proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In </span><span>addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread,</span><span>”</span><span> that is, any difference between the </span><span>bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over time for shares of the Fund based </span><span>on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund </span><span>has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity (which is often the case for funds that are newly launched </span><span>or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity or illiquidity </span><span>of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller </span><span>funds or in instances of significant volatility of the underlying securities.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund does not impose restrictions on the frequency of purchases and redemptions </span><span>of Fund shares directly with the Fund. The Board determined not to adopt policies and </span><span>procedures designed to prevent or monitor for frequent purchases and redemptions of </span><span>Fund shares because the Fund generally sells and redeems its shares directly through </span><span>transactions that are in-kind and/or for cash, with a deadline for placing cash-related </span><span>transactions no later than the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio </span><span>securities. However, the Fund has taken certain measures (</span><span>e.g</span><span>., imposing transaction </span><span>fees on purchases and redemptions of Creation Units and reserving the right to reject </span><span>purchases of Creation Units under certain circumstances) to minimize the potential </span><span>consequences of frequent cash purchases and redemptions by Authorized Participants, </span><span>such as increased tracking error, disruption of portfolio management, dilution to the </span><span>Fund, and/or increased transaction costs. Further, the vast majority of trading in Fund </span><span>shares occurs on the secondary market, which does not involve the Fund directly, and </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>20</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>such trading is unlikely to cause many of the harmful effects of frequent cash </span><span>purchases or redemptions of Fund shares.</span></div> <div><span>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed is open for </span><span>trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays </span><span>(or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, </span><span>Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor </span><span>Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is Cboe </span><span>BZX.</span></div> <div><span>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act generally restricts investments by investment </span><span>companies, including foreign and unregistered investment companies, in the securities </span><span>of other investment companies. For example, a registered investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquired Fund</span><span>”</span><span>), such as the Fund, may not knowingly sell or otherwise dispose of any </span><span>security issued by the Acquired Fund to any investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquiring </span><span>Fund</span><span>”</span><span>) or any company or companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund if, immediately </span><span>after such sale or disposition: (i) more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of </span><span>the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and any company or companies </span><span>controlled by the Acquiring Fund or (ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding voting </span><span>stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and other investment </span><span>companies and companies controlled by them. Although SEC rules may permit </span><span>registered investment companies and unit investment trusts (</span><span>“</span><span>Investing Funds</span><span>”</span><span>) that </span><span>enter into an investment agreement with the Trust to invest in iShares funds beyond </span><span>the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act subject to certain terms and </span><span>conditions, the Fund does not permit such investments. Accordingly, Investing Funds </span><span>must adhere to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act when investing </span><span>in the Fund. In addition, foreign investment companies are permitted to invest in the </span><span>Fund only up to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to any applicable SEC </span><span>no-action relief.</span></div> <div><span>Book Entry.</span><span> Shares of the Fund are held in book-entry form, which means that no </span><span>stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (</span><span>“</span><span>DTC</span><span>”</span><span>) or its nominee is </span><span>the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as shown on the records of </span><span>DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. </span><span>DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, </span><span>clearing corporations and other institutions that directly or indirectly maintain a </span><span>custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to </span><span>receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your </span><span>name, and you are not considered a registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise </span><span>any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its </span><span>participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other </span><span>securities that you hold in book-entry or </span><span>“</span><span>street name</span><span>”</span><span> form.</span></div> <div><span>Share Prices.</span><span> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market </span><span>generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as </span><span>the supply of and demand for ETF shares and underlying securities held by the Fund, </span><span>economic conditions and other factors.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>21</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Determination of Net Asset Value. </span><span>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined </span><span>once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the close of regular trading hours of </span><span>the New York Stock Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>NYSE</span><span>”</span><span>) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day </span><span>that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that </span><span>any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are </span><span>translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as </span><span>quoted by one or more data service providers. The NAV of the Fund is calculated by </span><span>dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the value of its total assets, which </span><span>includes the value of the Underlying Fund shares in which the Fund invests, less total </span><span>liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally rounded to </span><span>the nearest cent.</span></div> <div><span>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities held by the Fund is </span><span>determined pursuant to BFA’s valuation policies and procedures. BFA has been </span><span>designated by the Board as the valuation designee for the Fund pursuant to Rule 2a-5 </span><span>under the Investment Company Act.</span></div> <div><span>Customized exchange-traded equity options may be valued using a mathematical </span><span>model which may incorporate a number of market data factors.</span></div> <div><span>Equity securities and other equity instruments for which market quotations are readily </span><span>available are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the last </span><span>reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the last </span><span>traded price on the exchange or market on which the security or instrument is </span><span>primarily traded at the time of valuation. Shares of underlying open-end funds </span><span>(including money market funds) are valued at net asset value. Shares of underlying </span><span>exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs are valued at their most recent </span><span>closing price. </span></div> <div><span>The Fund values fixed-income portfolio securities using last available bid prices or </span><span>current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated prices) </span><span>supplied by the Fund's approved independent third-party pricing services, each in </span><span>accordance with BFA's valuation policies and procedures. Pricing services may use </span><span>matrix pricing or valuation models that utilize certain inputs and assumptions to derive </span><span>values. Pricing services generally value fixed-income securities assuming orderly </span><span>transactions of an institutional round lot size, but the Fund may hold or transact in such </span><span>securities in smaller odd lot sizes. Odd lots often trade at lower prices than institutional </span><span>round lots. An amortized cost method of valuation may be used with respect to debt </span><span>obligations with sixty days or less remaining to maturity unless BFA determines in good </span><span>faith that such method does not represent fair value.</span></div> <div><span>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities and money market instruments is substantially </span><span>completed each day at various times prior to the close of regular trading hours of the </span><span>NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are </span><span>determined as of such times.</span></div> <div><span>When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be </span><span>unreliable, BFA will fair value the Fund’s investments in accordance with its policies </span><span>and procedures. BFA may conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is </span><span>unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>22</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>lack of trading or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent </span><span>price quotations or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security </span><span>or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent </span><span>to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is </span><span>listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is </span><span>available. A </span><span>“</span><span>significant event</span><span>”</span><span> is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable </span><span>business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s assets or liabilities, that </span><span>the event is likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or </span><span>closing market price of one or more assets held by, or liabilities of, the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The </span><span>fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might </span><span>reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to </span><span>extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments </span><span>using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market </span><span>valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been </span><span>sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value </span><span>prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the </span><span>prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, </span><span>which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the </span><span>performance of the Underlying Index.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends and Distributions</span></div> <div><span>General Policies.</span><span> Dividends from net investment income, if any, generally are declared </span><span>and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, </span><span>if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make </span><span>distributions on a more frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to </span><span>declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or </span><span>advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company or to avoid </span><span>imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are distributed on a </span><span>pro rata</span><span> </span><span>basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC </span><span>participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds </span><span>received from the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Dividend Reinvestment Service.</span><span> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the </span><span>Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment </span><span>Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend </span><span>distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the </span><span>availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers </span><span>may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this </span><span>service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains </span><span>will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in </span><span>the secondary market.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes.</span><span> As with any investment, you should consider how your investment in shares of </span><span>the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general </span><span>information, based on current law. There is no guarantee that shares of the Fund will </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>23</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>receive certain regulatory or accounting treatment. You should consult your own tax </span><span>professional about the tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Unless your investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred</span><span> retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally </span><span>will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax </span><span>consequences when the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes on Distributions.</span><span> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income, </span><span>including distributions out of the Fund's net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable </span><span>to you as ordinary income. The Fund's distributions of net long-term capital gains, if </span><span>any, in excess of net short-term capital losses are taxable as long-term capital gains, </span><span>regardless of how long you have held the shares. Long-term capital gains are eligible </span><span>for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, </span><span>depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts. Distributions </span><span>from the Fund are subject to a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax on </span><span>“</span><span>net </span><span>investment income,</span><span>”</span><span> for individuals with incomes exceeding $200,000 ($250,000 if </span><span>married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts. In general, your distributions are </span><span>subject to U.S. federal income tax for the year when they are paid. Certain </span><span>distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on December 31 of the </span><span>prior year. Certain states and localities may exempt from tax distributions attributable </span><span>to interest from U.S. federal government obligations.</span></div> <div><span>If the Fund's distributions exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits, all or </span><span>a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a </span><span>return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum </span><span>distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be </span><span>taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return </span><span>of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder's </span><span>cost basis and will result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those </span><span>shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost </span><span>basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the </span><span>shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund expects that its ownership of shares of the Underlying Fund and sale of call </span><span>options thereon generally will constitute </span><span>“</span><span>straddles</span><span>”</span><span> (offsetting positions with respect </span><span>to personal property) under section 1092 of the Internal Revenue Code. The straddle </span><span>rules usually will terminate the Fund’s holding periods for its shares of the Underlying </span><span>Fund that become part of a straddle before the long-term capital gain holding period </span><span>(more than one year) has been reached, which is expected to eliminate the Fund’s </span><span>ability to recognize long-term capital gains from a sale or other disposition of such </span><span>shares. The straddle rules also usually will defer recognition of realized losses and </span><span>require the capitalization of certain interest expenses and carrying charges. Further, </span><span>because the Fund is expected to invest in the Underlying Fund, the Fund’s realized </span><span>losses on sales of shares of such Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently </span><span>deferred as </span><span>“</span><span>wash sales.</span><span>”</span><span> Distributions of short-term capital gains by the Underlying </span><span>Fund will be recognized as ordinary income by the Fund and would not be offset by the </span><span>Fund’s capital loss carryforwards, if any. Capital loss carryforwards of the Underlying </span><span>Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>24</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if you are a non-U.S. entity </span><span>(other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s </span><span>ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) </span><span>will generally be subject to a 30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless a lower treaty </span><span>rate applies provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income </span><span>realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital </span><span>gains or upon the sale or other disposition of shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, </span><span>interest and other income items paid to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S.</span><span> investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the U.S. Internal </span><span>Revenue Service (</span><span>“</span><span>IRS</span><span>”</span><span>) information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account </span><span>holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information </span><span>regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial </span><span>institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will </span><span>provide the IRS information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer </span><span>identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders; comply with due </span><span>diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts; report to the </span><span>IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax </span><span>on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account </span><span>holders who fail to provide the required information; and determine certain other </span><span>information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable </span><span>intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local </span><span>revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may </span><span>need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each </span><span>substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership, </span><span>unless certain exceptions apply.</span></div> <div><span>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup withholding at a 24% rate </span><span>will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer </span><span>identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes When Shares Are Sold.</span><span> Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale </span><span>of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been </span><span>held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund </span><span>shares held for one year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except </span><span>that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term</span><span> capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to </span><span>such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from </span><span>capital gain dividends, are included in </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income</span><span>”</span><span> for purposes of the </span><span>3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned above.</span></div> <div><span>The foregoing discussion summarizes some of the consequences under current U.S. </span><span>federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. </span><span>You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and sales of </span><span>shares. Certain states and localities may exempt from tax distributions attributable to </span><span>interest from U.S. federal government obligations. Consult your personal tax advisor </span><span>about the potential tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund under all </span><span>applicable tax laws.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>25</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Creations and Redemptions.</span><span> Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the </span><span>Fund are </span><span>“</span><span>created</span><span>”</span><span> at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in </span><span>block-size Creation Units or multiples thereof. Each </span><span>“</span><span>creator</span><span>”</span><span> or authorized participant </span><span>(an </span><span>“</span><span>Authorized Participant</span><span>”</span><span>) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, </span><span>BlackRock Investments, LLC (the </span><span>“</span><span>Distributor</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>BRIL</span><span>”</span><span>), an affiliate of BFA. An </span><span>Authorized Participant is a member or participant of a clearing agency registered with </span><span>the SEC, which has a written agreement with the Fund or one of its service providers </span><span>that allows such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and </span><span>redemption of Creation Units.</span></div> <div><span>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the Distributor and the Fund, </span><span>generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a </span><span>designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>creation basket</span><span>”</span><span>), and </span><span>an amount of cash (including any cash representing the value of substituted securities, </span><span>assets or other positions), if any, which together approximate the holdings of the Fund </span><span>in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. Similarly, shares can be </span><span>redeemed only in Creation Units, generally for a designated portfolio of securities, </span><span>assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>redemption basket</span><span>”</span><span>) held by the Fund and an amount of </span><span>cash (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted). The </span><span>Fund generally offers Creation Units partially for cash, but may, in certain </span><span>circumstances, offer Creation Units solely for cash or solely in-kind. Except when </span><span>aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by the Fund. Creation and </span><span>redemption baskets may differ and the Fund may accept </span><span>“</span><span>custom baskets.</span><span>”</span><span> More </span><span>information regarding custom baskets is contained in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> <div><span>The prices at which creations and redemptions occur are based on the next calculation </span><span>of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under </span><span>the authorized participant agreement.</span></div> <div><span>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation Units with the Fund. </span><span>Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or </span><span>for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>In the event of a system failure or other interruption, including disruptions at market </span><span>makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either </span><span>may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at </span><span>all, or the Fund may not be able to place or change orders.</span></div> <div><span>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind transactions, the Fund intends to comply </span><span>with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying </span><span>redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any </span><span>securities accepted for deposit and any securities used to satisfy redemption requests </span><span>will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities </span><span>Act of 1933, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1933 Act</span><span>”</span><span>). Further, an Authorized Participant that is </span><span>not a </span><span>“</span><span>qualified institutional buyer,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the </span><span>1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule </span><span>144A.</span></div> <div><span>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is either a member of the </span><span>Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>26</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to </span><span>creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations. Information about the </span><span>procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off </span><span>times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> <div><span>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing basis, at any point </span><span>during the life of the Fund a </span><span>“</span><span>distribution,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may </span><span>be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on </span><span>their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed </span><span>participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters </span><span>subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any </span><span>determination of whether one is an underwriter must take into account all the relevant </span><span>facts and circumstances of each particular case.</span></div> <div><span>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not </span><span>“</span><span>underwriters</span><span>”</span><span> but are </span><span>participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and </span><span>thus dealing with shares that are part of an </span><span>“</span><span>unsold allotment</span><span>”</span><span> within the meaning of </span><span>Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the 1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the </span><span>prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For </span><span>delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of </span><span>Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is available only with respect to transactions on a </span><span>national securities exchange.</span></div> <div><span>Householding.</span><span> Householding is an option available to certain Fund investors. </span><span>Householding is a method of delivery, based on the preference of the individual </span><span>investor, in which a single copy of certain shareholder documents can be delivered to </span><span>investors who share the same address, even if their accounts are registered under </span><span>different names. Please contact your broker-dealer if you are interested in enrolling in </span><span>householding and receiving a single copy of prospectuses and other shareholder </span><span>documents, or if you are currently enrolled in householding and wish to change your </span><span>householding status.</span></div> <div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>27</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Distribution</span></div> <div><span>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the Fund on an agency basis. </span><span>The Distributor does not maintain a secondary market in shares of the Fund. The </span><span>Distributor has no role in determining the policies of the Fund or the securities that are </span><span>purchased or sold by the Fund. The Distributor’s principal address is 1 University </span><span>Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</span></div> <div><span>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers, registered investment advisers, </span><span>banks or other intermediaries (together, </span><span>“</span><span>intermediaries</span><span>”</span><span>) related to marketing </span><span>activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the </span><span>development of technology platforms and reporting systems, data provision services, </span><span>or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their </span><span>customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may </span><span>be significant to the intermediary, are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments </span><span>are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or </span><span>indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type </span><span>are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may </span><span>make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or </span><span>the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other </span><span>financial incentives it is eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial </span><span>incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the </span><span>intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the </span><span>Fund or other iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding </span><span>these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. </span><span>Please contact your salesperson or </span><span>other investment professional for more information regarding any such </span><span>payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</span></div> <div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>28</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Financial Highlights</span></div> <div><span>The financial highlights table is intended to help investors understand the Fund’s </span><span>financial performance since inception.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>General Description of the Trust and the Funds</span></div> <div><span>The Trust currently consists of more than 310 investment series or portfolios. The Trust was organized as a Delaware </span><span>statutory trust on December 16, 1999 and is authorized to have multiple series or portfolios. The Trust is an open-end </span><span>management investment company registered with the SEC under the 1940 Act. The offering of the Trust’s shares is </span><span>registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1933 Act</span><span>”</span><span>). This SAI relates to the following Funds:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond BuyWrite Strategy ETF</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>iShares High Yield Corporate Bond BuyWrite Strategy ETF</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>iShares Investment Grade Corporate Bond BuyWrite Strategy ETF</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>Each Fund is managed by BlackRock Fund Advisors (</span><span>“</span><span>BFA</span><span>”</span><span>), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc., and </span><span>generally seeks to track the investment results of the specific benchmark index identified in the applicable Prospectus for that </span><span>Fund (each, an </span><span>“</span><span>Underlying Index</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund offers and issues shares at their net asset value per share (</span><span>“</span><span>NAV</span><span>”</span><span>) only in aggregations of a specified number of </span><span>shares (each, a </span><span>“</span><span>Creation Unit</span><span>”</span><span>), generally in exchange for a designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions </span><span>(including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) included in its Underlying Index (the </span><span>“</span><span>Deposit </span><span>Securities</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>Creation Basket</span><span>”</span><span>), together with the deposit of a specified cash payment (the </span><span>“</span><span>Cash Component</span><span>”</span><span>). Shares of </span><span>each Fund are listed for trading on Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (the </span><span>“</span><span>Listing Exchange</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>Cboe BZX</span><span>”</span><span>), a national securities </span><span>exchange. Shares of each Fund are traded in the secondary market and elsewhere at market prices that may be at, above or </span><span>below the Fund's NAV. Shares are redeemable only in Creation Units by Authorized Participants (as defined in the </span><span>Creation </span><span>and Redemption of Creation Units-Role of the Authorized Participant</span><span> section of this SAI), and, generally, in exchange for </span><span>portfolio securities and a Cash Amount (as defined in the </span><span>Redemption of Creation Units</span><span> section of this SAI). Creation Units </span><span>typically are a specified number of shares, generally 25,000 or multiples thereof.</span></div> <div><span>The Trust reserves the right to permit or require that creations and redemptions of shares are effected fully or partially in cash </span><span>and reserves the right to permit or require the substitution of Deposit Securities in lieu of cash. Shares may be issued in </span><span>advance of receipt of Deposit Securities, subject to various conditions, including a requirement that the Authorized </span><span>Participant maintain with the Trust collateral as set forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants. The Trust may use </span><span>such collateral at any time to purchase Deposit Securities. See the </span><span>Creation and Redemption of Creation Units</span><span> section of this </span><span>SAI. Transaction fees and other costs associated with creations or redemptions that include a cash portion may be higher </span><span>than the transaction fees and other costs associated with in-kind creations or redemptions. In all cases, conditions with </span><span>respect to creations and redemptions of shares and fees will be limited in accordance with the requirements of SEC rules and </span><span>regulations applicable to management investment companies offering redeemable securities.</span></div> <div><span>Exchange Listing and Trading</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>A discussion of exchange listing and trading matters associated with an investment in each Fund is contained in the </span><span>Shareholder Information</span><span> section of each Fund's Prospectus. The discussion below supplements, and should be read in </span><span>conjunction with, that section of the applicable Prospectus.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of each Fund are listed for trading, and trade throughout the day, on the Listing Exchange and in other secondary </span><span>markets. Shares of the Funds may also be listed on certain non-U.S. exchanges. There can be no assurance that the </span><span>requirements of the Listing Exchange necessary to maintain the listing of shares of a Fund will continue to be met. The </span><span>Listing Exchange may, but is not required to, remove the shares of a Fund from listing if, among other things: (i) following the </span><span>initial 12-month period beginning upon the commencement of trading of Fund shares, there are fewer than 50 record and/or </span><span>beneficial owners of shares of a Fund; (ii) a Fund is no longer eligible to operate in reliance on Rule 6c-11 under the </span><span>Investment Company Act; (iii) any of the other listing requirements are not continuously maintained; or (iv) any event shall </span><span>occur or condition shall exist that, in the opinion of the Listing Exchange, makes further dealings on the Listing Exchange </span><span>inadvisable. The Listing Exchange will also remove shares of a Fund from listing and trading upon termination of the Fund.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>As in the case of other publicly-traded securities, when you buy or sell shares of a Fund through a broker, you may incur a </span><span>brokerage commission determined by that broker, as well as other charges.</span></div> <div><span>The Trust reserves the right to adjust the share price of the Funds in the future to maintain convenient trading ranges for </span><span>investors. Any adjustments would be accomplished through stock splits or reverse stock splits, which would have no effect </span><span>on the net assets of the Funds or an investor's equity interest in the Funds.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Investment Strategies and Risks of the Funds</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing a substantial portion of its assets in the Underlying Funds, </span><span>which are the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (for the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond BuyWrite Strategy ETF), the </span><span>iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (for the iShares High Yield Corporate Bond BuyWrite Strategy ETF) and the </span><span>iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (for the iShares Investment Grade Corporate Bond BuyWrite Strategy </span><span>ETF), and options on the Underlying Funds. Each Fund may also invest in investments that provide substantially similar </span><span>exposure to securities in the Underlying Index. Each Fund operates as an index fund and is not actively managed. Adverse </span><span>performance of a security in a Fund’s portfolio will ordinarily not result in the elimination of the security from the Fund’s </span><span>portfolio.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Each Fund engages in representative sampling, which is investing in a sample of securities selected by BFA to have a </span><span>collective investment profile similar to that of the Fund's Underlying Index. Securities selected have aggregate investment </span><span>characteristics (based on market value and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as yield, credit rating, </span><span>maturity and duration) and liquidity measures similar to those of the Fund’s Underlying Index. A fund that uses </span><span>representative sampling generally does not hold all of the securities that are in its underlying index.</span></div> <div><span>Although the Funds do not seek leveraged returns, certain instruments used by the Funds or Underlying Funds may have a </span><span>leveraging effect as described below.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Bonds.</span><span>  </span><span>Each Fund, either directly or through its investments in the Underlying Fund, invests a substantial portion of its assets </span><span>in U.S. dollar-denominated bonds. A bond is an interest-bearing security issued by a U.S. or non-U.S. company or </span><span>governmental unit. The issuer of a bond has a contractual obligation to pay interest at a stated rate on specific dates and to </span><span>repay principal (the bond’s face value) periodically or on a specified maturity date. Bonds generally are used by issuers to </span><span>borrow money from investors.</span></div> <div><span>An issuer may have the right to redeem or </span><span>“</span><span>call</span><span>”</span><span> a bond before maturity, in which case a fund may have to reinvest the </span><span>proceeds at lower market rates.</span><span> </span><span>Similarly, a fund may have to reinvest interest income or payments received when bonds </span><span>mature, sometimes at lower market rates. Most bonds bear interest income at a </span><span>“</span><span>coupon</span><span>”</span><span> rate that is fixed for the life of the </span><span>bond. The value of a fixed-rate bond usually rises when market interest rates fall, and falls when market interest rates rise. </span><span>Accordingly, a fixed-rate bond’s yield (income as a percent of the bond’s current value) may differ from its coupon rate as its </span><span>value rises or falls. When an investor purchases a fixed-rate bond at a price that is greater than its face value, the investor is </span><span>purchasing the bond at a premium. Conversely, when an investor purchases a fixed-rate bond at a price that is less than its </span><span>face value, the investor is purchasing the bond at a discount. Fixed-rate bonds that are purchased at a discount pay less </span><span>current income than securities with comparable yields that are purchased at face value, with the result that prices for such </span><span>fixed-rate securities can be more volatile than prices for such securities that are purchased at face value. Other types of </span><span>bonds bear interest at an interest rate that is adjusted periodically. Interest rates on </span><span>“</span><span>floating rate</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>variable rate</span><span>”</span><span> bonds </span><span>may be higher or lower than current market rates for fixed-rate bonds of comparable quality with similar final maturities. </span><span>Because of their adjustable interest rates, the value of </span><span>“</span><span>floating rate</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>variable rate</span><span>”</span><span> bonds fluctuates much less in </span><span>response to market interest rate movements than the value of fixed-rate bonds, but their value may decline if their interest </span><span>rates do not rise as much, or as quickly, as interest rates in general. Each Fund or an Underlying Fund may treat some of </span><span>these bonds as having a shorter maturity for purposes of calculating the weighted average maturity of its investment </span><span>portfolio. Generally, prices of higher quality issues tend to fluctuate less with changes in market interest rates than prices of </span><span>lower quality issues and prices of longer maturity issues tend to fluctuate more than prices of shorter maturity issues. Bonds </span><span>may be senior or subordinated obligations. Senior obligations generally have the first claim on an issuer’s earnings and assets </span><span>and, in the event of liquidation, are paid before subordinated obligations. Bonds may be unsecured (backed only by the </span><span>issuer’s general creditworthiness) or secured (backed by specified collateral).</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Borrowing. </span><span> </span><span>Each Fund may borrow for temporary or emergency purposes, including to meet payments due from </span><span>redemptions or to facilitate the settlement of securities or other transactions.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The purchase of securities while borrowings are outstanding may have the effect of leveraging a Fund or Underlying Fund. </span><span>The incurrence of leverage increases a Fund’s or Underlying Fund's exposure to risk, and borrowed funds are subject to </span><span>interest costs that will reduce net income. Purchasing securities while borrowings are outstanding creates special risks, such </span><span>as the potential for greater volatility in the NAV of Fund or Underlying Fund shares and in the yield on a Fund’s or Underlying </span><span>Fund's portfolio. In addition, the interest expenses from borrowings may exceed the income generated by a Fund’s or </span><span>Underlying Fund's portfolio and, therefore, the amount available (if any) for distribution to shareholders as dividends may be </span><span>reduced. BFA may determine to maintain outstanding borrowings if it expects that the benefits to a Fund’s shareholders will </span><span>outweigh the current reduced return.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Certain types of borrowings by a Fund or Underlying Fund must be made from a bank or may result in a Fund or Underlying </span><span>Fund being subject to covenants in credit agreements relating to asset coverage, portfolio composition requirements and </span><span>other matters. It is not anticipated that observance of such covenants would impede BFA’s management of a Fund’s portfolio </span><span>in accordance with a Fund’s investment objectives and policies. However, a breach of any such covenants not cured within </span><span>the specified cure period may result in acceleration of outstanding indebtedness and require a Fund to dispose of portfolio </span><span>investments at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so.</span></div> <div><span>Corporate Bonds.</span><span>  </span><span>The iShares High Yield Corporate Bond BuyWrite Strategy ETF, iShares Investment Grade Corporate Bond </span><span>BuyWrite Strategy ETF and their Underlying Funds invest a substantial portion of their assets in investment-grade and/or </span><span>high yield corporate bonds. High yield corporate bonds may be deemed speculative and more volatile than higher rated </span><span>securities of similar maturity. The investment return of corporate bonds reflects interest earned on the security and changes </span><span>in the market value of the security. The market value of a corporate bond may be affected by changes in the market rate of </span><span>interest, the credit rating of the issuer, the issuer’s performance and perceptions of the issuer in the marketplace. There is a </span><span>risk that the issuers of the securities may not be able to meet their obligations on interest or principal payments at the time </span><span>called for by an instrument.</span></div> <div><span>Derivatives. </span><span> </span><span>Certain of the Funds or Underlying Funds may use instruments referred to as derivatives. Derivatives are </span><span>financial instruments the value of which is derived from another security, a commodity (such as gold or oil), a currency or an </span><span>index (a measure of value or rates, such as the S&amp;P 500 Index or the prime lending rate). Derivatives allow a Fund or </span><span>Underlying Fund to increase or decrease the level of risk to which a Fund or Underlying Fund is exposed more quickly and </span><span>efficiently than transactions in other types of instruments. The Funds may use derivatives for hedging purposes. The Funds </span><span>or Underlying Funds may also use derivatives for speculative purposes to seek to enhance returns. The use of a derivative is </span><span>speculative if a Fund or Underlying Fund is primarily seeking to achieve gains, rather than to offset the risk of other positions. </span><span>When a Fund or Underlying Fund invests in a derivative for speculative purposes, a Fund or Underlying Fund will be fully </span><span>exposed to the risks of loss of that derivative, which may sometimes be greater than the derivative’s cost. Unless otherwise </span><span>permitted, a Fund or Underlying Fund may not use any derivatives to gain exposure to an asset or class of assets that it </span><span>would be prohibited by its investment restrictions from purchasing directly.</span></div> <div><span>Diversification Status. </span><span> </span><span>Each Fund is classified as a diversified fund under the 1940 Act. This means that each Fund may not </span><span>purchase securities of an issuer (other than (i) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or </span><span>instrumentalities and (ii) securities of other investment companies) if, with respect to 75% of its total assets, (a) more than </span><span>5% of the Fund’s total assets would be invested in securities of that issuer or (b) the Fund would hold more than 10% of the </span><span>outstanding voting securities of that issuer. With respect to the remaining 25% of its total assets, each Fund may invest more </span><span>than 5% of its assets in one issuer. Under the 1940 Act, each Fund cannot change its classification from diversified to non-diversified</span><span> without shareholder approval.</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund intends to maintain the required level of diversification and otherwise conduct its operations so as to qualify as a </span><span>regulated investment company (</span><span>“</span><span>RIC</span><span>”</span><span>) for purposes of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>Internal </span><span>Revenue Code</span><span>”</span><span>), and to relieve the Fund of any liability for U.S. federal income tax to the extent that its earnings are </span><span>distributed to shareholders, provided that the Fund satisfies a minimum distribution requirement. Compliance with the </span><span>diversification requirements of the Internal Revenue Code may limit the investment flexibility of the Funds and may make it </span><span>less likely that the Funds will meet their respective investment objectives.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Futures, Options on Futures and Securities Options.</span><span>  </span><span>Futures contracts, options on futures and securities options may be </span><span>used by a Fund to simulate investment in its Underlying Index, to facilitate trading or to reduce transaction costs. Each Fund </span><span>or an Underlying Fund may enter into futures contracts and options on futures that are traded on a U.S. or non-U.S. futures </span><span>exchange. Each Fund or an Underlying Fund will not use futures, options on futures or securities options for speculative </span><span>purposes. Each Fund intends to use futures and options on futures in accordance with Rule 4.5 of the Commodity Futures </span><span>Trading Commission (the </span><span>“</span><span>CFTC</span><span>”</span><span>) promulgated under the Commodity Exchange Act (</span><span>“</span><span>CEA</span><span>”</span><span>). BFA, with respect to the Funds, </span><span>has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term </span><span>“</span><span>commodity pool operator</span><span>”</span><span> in accordance with Rule 4.5 so that BFA, </span><span>with respect to such Funds, is not subject to registration or regulation as a commodity pool operator under the CEA. See the </span><span>Regulation Regarding Derivatives </span><span>section of this SAI for more information.</span></div> <div><span>Futures contracts provide for the future sale by one party and purchase by another party of a specified amount of a specific </span><span>instrument or index at a specified future time and at a specified price. Stock index contracts are based on investments that </span><span>reflect the market value of common stock of the firms included in the investments. Each Fund or an Underlying Fund may </span><span>enter into futures contracts to purchase securities indexes when BFA anticipates purchasing the underlying securities and </span><span>believes prices will rise before the purchase will be made. Upon entering into a futures contract, a Fund or an Underlying </span><span>Fund will be required to deposit with the broker an amount of cash or cash equivalents known as </span><span>“</span><span>initial margin,</span><span>”</span><span> which is </span><span>similar to a performance bond or good faith deposit on the contract and is returned to the Fund or an Underlying Fund upon </span><span>termination of the futures contract if all contractual obligations have been satisfied. Subsequent payments, known as </span><span>“</span><span>variation margin,</span><span>”</span><span> will be made to and from the broker daily as the price of the instrument or index underlying the futures </span><span>contract fluctuates, making the long and short positions in the futures contract more or less valuable, a process known as </span><span>“</span><span>marking-to-market.</span><span>”</span><span> At any time prior to the expiration of a futures contract, each Fund or an Underlying Fund may elect to </span><span>close the position by taking an opposite position, which will operate to terminate the Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's </span><span>existing position in the contract. An option on a futures contract, as contrasted with a direct investment in such a contract, </span><span>gives the purchaser the right, but no obligation, in return for the premium paid, to assume a position in the underlying </span><span>futures contract at a specified exercise price at any time prior to the expiration date of the option. Upon exercise of an option, </span><span>the delivery of the futures position by the writer of the option to the holder of the option will be accompanied by delivery of </span><span>the accumulated balance in the writer’s futures margin account that represents the amount by which the market price of the </span><span>futures contract exceeds (in the case of a call) or is less than (in the case of a put) the exercise price of the option on the </span><span>futures contract.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The potential for loss related to the purchase of an option on a futures contract is limited to the premium paid for the option </span><span>plus transaction costs. Because the value of the option is fixed at the point of sale, there are no daily cash payments by the </span><span>purchaser to reflect changes in the value of the underlying contract; however, the value of the option changes daily and that </span><span>change would be reflected in the NAV of each Fund or an Underlying Fund. The potential for loss related to writing call </span><span>options is unlimited. The potential for loss related to writing put options is limited to the agreed-upon price per share, also </span><span>known as the </span><span>“</span><span>strike price,</span><span>”</span><span> less the premium received from writing the put. The Funds or an Underlying Fund may purchase </span><span>and write put and call options on futures contracts that are traded on an exchange as a hedge against changes in value of </span><span>their portfolio securities or in anticipation of the purchase of securities, and may enter into closing transactions with respect </span><span>to such options to terminate existing positions. There is no guarantee that such closing transactions can be effected.</span></div> <div><span>Securities options are used to achieve a Fund’s objective of tracking its Underlying Index.</span><span> </span><span>A call option gives a holder the right </span><span>to purchase a specific security at a specified price (</span><span>“</span><span>exercise price</span><span>”</span><span>) within a specified period of time. A put option gives a </span><span>holder the right to sell a specific security at an exercise price within a specified period of time. The initial purchaser of a call </span><span>option pays the </span><span>“</span><span>writer</span><span>”</span><span> a premium, which is paid at the time of purchase and is retained by the writer whether or not such </span><span>option is exercised. The Fund writes (sells) call options as part of its investment strategy of seeking to track the Underlying </span><span>Index.The Underlying Fund may purchase put options to hedge its portfolio against the risk of a decline in the market value </span><span>of securities held and may purchase call options to hedge against an increase in the price of securities it is committed to </span><span>purchase. Each Fund or an Underlying Fund may write put and call options along with a long position in options to increase </span><span>its ability to hedge against a change in the market value of the securities it holds or is committed to purchase. Each Fund or </span><span>an Underlying Fund may purchase or sell securities options on a U.S. or non-U.S. securities exchange or in the over-the-counter</span><span> (</span><span>“</span><span>OTC</span><span>”</span><span>) market through a transaction with a dealer. Options on a securities index are typically settled on a net basis </span><span>based on the appreciation or depreciation of the index level over the strike price. Options on single name securities may be </span><span>cash- or physically-settled, depending upon the market in which they are traded. Options may be structured so as to be </span><span>exercisable only on certain dates or on a daily basis. Options may also be structured to have conditions to exercise (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, </span><span>“</span><span>Knock-in Events</span><span>”</span><span>) or conditions that trigger termination (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, </span><span>“</span><span>Knock-out Events</span><span>”</span><span>).</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>High Yield Securities.</span><span>  </span><span>Certain of the Underlying Funds may invest in non-investment grade or </span><span>“</span><span>high yield</span><span>”</span><span> fixed-income or </span><span>convertible securities are commonly known to investors as </span><span>“</span><span>junk bonds</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>high yield bonds.</span><span>”</span><span> These are generally debt </span><span>securities that are rated below investment grade by one or more of the major rating agencies or are unrated securities that </span><span>BFA believes are of comparable quality. While generally providing greater income and opportunity for gain, non-investment </span><span>grade debt securities may be subject to greater risks than securities that have higher credit ratings, including a high risk of </span><span>default, and their yields will fluctuate over time. High yield securities will generally be in the lower rating categories of </span><span>recognized rating agencies (rated below Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (</span><span>“</span><span>Moody's</span><span>”</span><span>) or below BBB- by Standard &amp; </span><span>Poor's</span><span>®</span><span> Global Ratings, a subsidiary of S&amp;P Global (</span><span>“</span><span>S&amp;P Global Ratings</span><span>”</span><span>) or Fitch Ratings, Inc. (</span><span>“</span><span>Fitch</span><span>”</span><span>)) or be unrated. The </span><span>credit rating of a high yield security does not necessarily address its market value risk, and ratings may from time to time </span><span>change, positively or negatively, to reflect developments regarding the issuer’s financial condition. High yield securities are </span><span>considered to be speculative with respect to the capacity of the issuer to timely repay principal and pay interest in accordance </span><span>with the terms of the obligation and may have more credit risk than higher rated securities.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The major risks of high yield bond investments include the following:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>High yield bonds may be issued by less creditworthy issuers. These securities are vulnerable to adverse changes in </span><span>the issuer’s industry or to general economic conditions. Issuers of high yield bonds may be unable to meet their </span><span>interest or principal payment obligations because of an economic downturn, specific issuer developments or the </span><span>unavailability of additional financing.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The issuers of high yield bonds may have a larger amount of outstanding debt relative to their assets than issuers of </span><span>investment grade bonds. If the issuer experiences financial stress, it may be unable to meet its debt obligations. The </span><span>issuer’s ability to pay its debt obligations also may be lessened by specific issuer developments, or the unavailability </span><span>of additional financing. Issuers of high yield securities are often in the growth stage of their development and/or </span><span>involved in a reorganization or takeover.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>High yield bonds are frequently ranked junior to claims by other creditors. If the issuer cannot meet its obligations, </span><span>the senior obligations are generally paid off before the junior obligations, which will potentially limit an Underlying </span><span>Fund’s ability to fully recover principal, to receive interest payments when senior securities are in default or to </span><span>receive restructuring benefits paid to holders of more senior classes of debt. Thus, investors in high yield securities </span><span>frequently have a lower degree of protection with respect to principal and interest payments than do investors in </span><span>higher rated securities.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>High yield bonds frequently have redemption features that permit an issuer to repurchase the security from an </span><span>Underlying Fund before it matures. If an issuer redeems the high yield bonds, an Underlying Fund may have to </span><span>invest the proceeds in bonds with lower yields and may lose income.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Prices of high yield bonds are subject to extreme fluctuations. Negative economic developments may have a greater </span><span>impact on the prices of high yield bonds than on those of other higher rated fixed-income securities.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Under certain economic and/or market conditions, an Underlying Fund may have difficulty disposing of certain high </span><span>yield securities due to the limited number of investors in that sector of the market. There are fewer dealers in the </span><span>high yield bond market, and there may be significant differences in the prices quoted for high yield bonds by </span><span>dealers, and such quotations may not be the actual prices available for a purchase or sale. Judgment may play a </span><span>greater role in the prices and values generated for such securities than in the case of securities trading in a more </span><span>liquid market.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The secondary markets for high yield securities are not as liquid as the secondary markets for higher rated </span><span>securities. The secondary markets for high yield securities are concentrated in relatively few market makers and, </span><span>participants in the markets are mostly institutional investors, including insurance companies, banks, other financial </span><span>institutions and mutual funds. In addition, the trading volume for high yield securities is generally lower than that </span><span>for higher rated securities and the secondary markets could contract under adverse market or economic conditions </span><span>independent of any specific adverse changes in the condition of a particular issuer. Under certain economic and/or </span><span>market conditions, an Underlying Fund may have difficulty disposing of certain high yield securities due to the </span><span>limited number of investors in that sector of the market. An illiquid secondary market may adversely affect the </span><span>market price of the high yield security, which may result in increased difficulty selling the particular issue and </span><span>obtaining accurate market quotations on the issue when valuing an Underlying Fund's assets. Market quotations on </span><span>high yield securities are available only from a limited number of dealers, and such quotations may not be the actual </span><span>prices available for a purchase or sale. When the secondary market for high yield securities becomes more illiquid, </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>or in the absence of readily available market quotations for such securities, the relative lack of reliable objective data </span><span>makes it more difficult to value such securities, and judgment plays a more important role in determining such </span><span>valuations.</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>An Underlying Fund may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new </span><span>terms with a defaulting issuer.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The high yield bond markets may react strongly to adverse news about an issuer or the economy, or to the </span><span>perception or expectation of adverse news, whether or not it is based on fundamental analysis. Additionally, prices </span><span>for high yield securities may be affected by legislative and regulatory developments. These developments could </span><span>adversely affect an Underlying Fund’s NAV and investment practices, the secondary market for high yield securities, </span><span>the financial condition of issuers of these securities and the value and liquidity of outstanding high yield securities, </span><span>especially in a thinly traded market. For example, federal legislation requiring the divestiture by federally insured </span><span>savings and loan associations of their investments in high yield bonds and limiting the deductibility of interest by </span><span>certain corporate issuers of high yield bonds adversely affected the market in the past.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>Investing in Underlying Funds Risk. </span><span> </span><span>Because each Fund invests in one or more underlying funds that are ETFs that seek </span><span>investment results corresponding to their own underlying indexes, the Fund is indirectly exposed to index-related risk and </span><span>tracking error risk. Index-related risk is the risk that there may be errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness </span><span>of the data included in an underlying index for an underlying fund that may not be identified and corrected for a period of </span><span>time. Gains, losses or costs associated with such errors will be borne directly by the underlying fund tracking such an index </span><span>and its shareholders and indirectly by the Fund and its shareholders. An index provider for an underlying fund may carry out </span><span>additional ad hoc rebalances to an underlying index in order, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index </span><span>constituents. Where such an index rebalance occurs and an underlying fund in turn rebalances its portfolio to bring it in line </span><span>with its underlying index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio rebalancing will be borne </span><span>directly by the underlying fund and indirectly by the Fund. Tracking error risk is the risk that the performance of an </span><span>underlying fund will diverge from that of its underlying index, which may reduce each Fund’s returns and have an adverse </span><span>impact on each Fund’s strategy. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual </span><span>market conditions.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Lending Portfolio Securities.</span><span>  </span><span>Each Fund and Underlying Fund may lend portfolio securities to certain borrowers that BFA </span><span>determines to be creditworthy, including borrowers affiliated with BFA. The borrowers provide collateral that is maintained in </span><span>an amount at least equal to the current market value of the securities loaned. No securities loan shall be made on behalf of a </span><span>Fund or an Underlying Fund if, as a result, the aggregate value of all securities loans of a Fund or an Underlying Fund exceeds </span><span>one-third of the value of a Fund's or an Underlying Fund's total assets (including the value of the collateral received). A Fund </span><span>or Underlying Fund may terminate a loan at any time and obtain the return of the securities loaned. Each Fund or Underlying </span><span>Fund receives, by way of substitute payment, the value of any interest or cash or non-cash distributions paid on the loaned </span><span>securities that it would have otherwise received if the securities were not on loan.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>With respect to loans that are collateralized by cash, the borrower may be entitled to receive a fee based on the amount of </span><span>cash collateral. The Funds or the Underlying Funds are compensated by any positive difference between the amount earned </span><span>on the reinvestment of cash collateral and the fee paid to the borrower. In the case of collateral other than cash, a Fund or </span><span>Underlying Fund is compensated by a fee paid by the borrower equal to a percentage of the market value of the loaned </span><span>securities. Any cash collateral received by the Fund or Underlying Fund for such loans, and uninvested cash, may be </span><span>reinvested in certain short-term instruments either directly on behalf of each Fund or Underlying Fund or through one or </span><span>more joint accounts or money market funds, including those affiliated with BFA; such investments are subject to investment </span><span>risk. Other investment companies in which a Fund or an Underlying Fund invests can be expected to incur fees and expenses </span><span>for operations, such as investment advisory and administration fees, that would be in addition to those incurred by a Fund or </span><span>an Underlying Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund and Underlying Fund conduct their securities lending pursuant to an exemptive order from the SEC permitting </span><span>them to lend portfolio securities to borrowers affiliated with the Fund or Underlying Fund and to retain an affiliate of the Fund </span><span>or Underlying Fund to act as securities lending agent. To the extent that a Fund or Underlying Fund engages in securities </span><span>lending, BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>BTC</span><span>”</span><span>) acts as securities lending agent for the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying </span><span>Fund, subject to the overall supervision of BFA. BTC administers the lending program in accordance with guidelines approved </span><span>by the Trust's Board of Trustees (the </span><span>“</span><span>Board,</span><span>”</span><span> the trustees of which are the </span><span>“</span><span>Trustees</span><span>”</span><span>). JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>JPMorgan</span><span>”</span><span>) serves as custodian for the Funds in connection with certain securities lending activities.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>6</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Securities lending involves exposure to certain risks, including operational risk (i.e., the risk of losses resulting from problems </span><span>in the settlement and accounting process), </span><span>“</span><span>gap</span><span>”</span><span> risk (i.e., the risk of a mismatch between the return on cash collateral </span><span>reinvestments and the fees a Fund or Underlying Fund has agreed to pay a borrower), foreign exchange risk (i.e., the risk of a </span><span>shortfall at default when a cash collateral investment is denominated in a currency other than the currency of the assets </span><span>being loaned due to movements in foreign exchange rates), and credit, legal, counterparty and market risks (including the </span><span>risk that market events could lead the Fund or Underlying Fund to recall loaned securities or to lend less or not at all, which </span><span>could lead to reduced securities lending revenue). If a securities lending counterparty were to default, a Fund or Underlying </span><span>Fund would be subject to the risk of a possible delay in receiving collateral or in recovering the loaned securities, or to a </span><span>possible loss of rights in the collateral. In the event a borrower does not return a Fund’s or Underlying Fund's securities as </span><span>agreed, the Fund’s</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund's ability to participate in a corporate action event may be impacted, or the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or </span><span>Underlying Fund may experience losses if the proceeds received from liquidating the collateral do not at least equal the value </span><span>of the loaned security at the time the collateral is liquidated, plus the transaction costs incurred in purchasing replacement </span><span>securities. This latter event could trigger adverse tax consequences for a Fund or Underlying Fund. A Fund or Underlying </span><span>Fund could lose money if its short-term investment of the collateral declines in value over the period of the loan. Substitute </span><span>payments received by a Fund or Underlying Fund representing dividends paid on securities loaned out by the Fund or </span><span>Underlying Fund will not be considered qualified dividend income. BTC will take into account the tax effects on shareholders </span><span>caused by this difference in connection with a Fund’s or Underlying Fund's securities lending program. Substitute payments </span><span>received on tax-exempt securities loaned out will not be tax-exempt income. There could also be changes in the status of </span><span>issuers under applicable laws and regulations, including tax regulations, that may impact the regulatory or tax treatment of </span><span>loaned securities and could, for example, result in a delay in the payment of dividend equivalent payments owed to a Fund or </span><span>Underlying Fund (as permitted by applicable law).</span></div> <div><span>Regulations adopted by global prudential regulators require certain bank-regulated counterparties and certain of their </span><span>affiliates to include in certain financial contracts, including many securities lending agreements, terms that delay or restrict </span><span>the rights of counterparties, such as the Fund or Underlying Fund, to terminate such agreements, foreclose upon collateral, </span><span>exercise other default rights or restrict transfers of credit support in the event that the counterparty and/or its affiliates are </span><span>subject to certain types of resolution or insolvency proceedings. It is possible that these requirements, as well as potential </span><span>additional government regulation and other developments in the market, could adversely affect the Fund’s or Underlying </span><span>Fund's ability to terminate existing securities lending agreements or to realize amounts to be received under such </span><span>agreements.</span></div> <div><span>Liquidity Risk Management.</span><span>  </span><span>Rule 22e-4 under the Investment Company Act (the </span><span>“</span><span>Liquidity Rule</span><span>”</span><span>) requires open-end funds, </span><span>including exchange-traded funds (</span><span>“</span><span>ETFs</span><span>”</span><span>) such as the Funds, to establish a liquidity risk management program (the </span><span>“</span><span>Liquidity Program</span><span>”</span><span>) and enhance disclosures regarding fund liquidity. As required by the Liquidity Rule, the Funds have </span><span>implemented a Liquidity Program, and the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees of the Trust, has </span><span>appointed BFA as the administrator of the Liquidity Program. Under the Liquidity Program, BFA assesses, manages, and </span><span>periodically reviews each Fund’s liquidity risk and classifies each investment held by a Fund as a </span><span>“</span><span>highly liquid investment,</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>“</span><span>moderately liquid investment,</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>“</span><span>less liquid investment</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>illiquid investment.</span><span>”</span><span> The Liquidity Rule defines </span><span>“</span><span>liquidity risk</span><span>”</span><span> as </span><span>the risk that a Fund could not meet requests to redeem shares issued by a Fund without significant dilution of the remaining </span><span>investors’ interest in a Fund. The liquidity of a Fund's portfolio investments is determined based on relevant market, trading </span><span>and investment-specific considerations under the Liquidity Program. There are exclusions from certain portions of the </span><span>liquidity risk management program requirements for </span><span>“</span><span>in-kind</span><span>”</span><span> ETFs, as defined in the Liquidity Rule. To the extent that an </span><span>investment is deemed to be an illiquid investment or a less liquid investment, a Fund can expect to be exposed to greater </span><span>liquidity risk.</span></div> <div><span>Non-U.S. Securities. </span><span> </span><span>Certain obligations or securities of non-U.S. issuers may be deemed to be located in a particular country </span><span>if: (i) the principal trading market for the security is in such country, (ii) the issuer is organized under the laws of such </span><span>country, (iii) the issuer derives at least 50% of its revenues or profits from such country or has at least 50% of its assets </span><span>situated in such country or, (iv) the issuer is the government of the particular country.</span></div> <div><span>Privately Issued Securities.</span><span>  </span><span> Each Fund or Underlying Fund may invest in privately issued securities, including those that may </span><span>be resold only in accordance with Rule 144A or Regulation S under the 1933 Act (</span><span>“</span><span>Restricted Securities</span><span>”</span><span>). Restricted </span><span>Securities are not publicly-traded and are subject to a variety of restrictions, which limit a purchaser's ability to acquire or </span><span>resell such securities. Accordingly, the liquidity of the market for specific Restricted Securities may vary. Delay or difficulty in </span><span>selling such securities may result in a loss to a Fund.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>7</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Ratings. </span><span> </span><span>An investment-grade rating generally means the security or issuer is rated investment-grade by one or more of </span><span>Moody’s, S&amp;P Global Ratings, Fitch, or another credit rating agency designated as a nationally recognized statistical rating </span><span>organization (</span><span>“</span><span>NRSRO</span><span>”</span><span>) by the SEC, or is unrated but considered to be of equivalent quality by BFA. Generally, bonds rated </span><span>Baa3 or above by Moody’s or BBB- or above by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch are considered </span><span>“</span><span>investment-grade</span><span>”</span><span> securities, </span><span>bonds rated Baa are considered medium grade obligations subject to moderate credit risk and may possess certain </span><span>speculative characteristics, while bonds rated BBB are regarded as having adequate capacity to meet financial commitments. </span><span>In recent years, the U.S. and certain other countries experienced a credit rating downgrade; these downgrades or additional </span><span>downgrades in the future may result in the deterioration of investor confidence.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Subsequent to purchase by a Fund or an Underlying Fund, a rated security may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced </span><span>below an investment-grade rating. Bonds rated below Baa3 by Moody’s or below BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings or Fitch are </span><span>generally considered below investment-grade quality and are obligations of issuers that are generally considered </span><span>predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal according to the terms of </span><span>the obligation and, therefore, carry greater investment risk, including the possibility of issuer default and bankruptcy and </span><span>increased market price volatility. Such lower-rated securities are commonly referred to as </span><span>“</span><span>junk bonds</span><span>”</span><span> and are subject to a </span><span>substantial degree of credit risk. Please see Appendix B of this SAI for a description of each rating category of Moody's, S&amp;P </span><span>Global Ratings and Fitch and BFA's treatment of investments that are not rated by any of the rating agencies.</span></div> <div><span>Regulation Regarding Derivatives.</span><span>  </span><span>The CFTC subjects advisers to registered investment companies to regulation by the </span><span>CFTC if a fund that is advised by the adviser either (i) invests, directly or indirectly, more than a prescribed level of its </span><span>liquidation value in CFTC-regulated futures, options and swaps</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>CFTC Derivatives</span><span>”</span><span>) or (ii) markets itself as providing </span><span>investment exposure to such instruments. The CFTC also subjects advisers to registered investment companies to regulation </span><span>by the CFTC if the registered investment company invests in one or more commodity pools.</span><span> </span><span>NDFs and cash-settled currency </span><span>forwards as well as futures, options on futures, currency options and swaps entered into by a Fund will be treated as CFTC </span><span>Derivatives for these purposes. Physically-settled foreign currency forward contracts will generally be treated as CFTC </span><span>Derivatives, however these contracts are not treated as CFTC regulated-swaps and are not subject to certain of the CFTC’s </span><span>rules with respect to swaps. To the extent a Fund uses CFTC Derivatives, it intends to do so below such prescribed levels and </span><span>intends not to market itself as a </span><span>“</span><span>commodity pool</span><span>”</span><span> or a vehicle for trading such instruments.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BFA has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term </span><span>“</span><span>commodity pool operator</span><span>”</span><span> under the CEA pursuant to Rule 4.5 </span><span>under the CEA with respect to each of the Funds. BFA is not, therefore, subject to registration or regulation as a </span><span>“</span><span>commodity </span><span>pool operator</span><span>”</span><span> under the CEA with respect to the Funds.</span></div> <div><span>Derivative contracts, including, without limitation, swaps, currency forwards, and non-deliverable forwards, are subject to </span><span>regulation under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (</span><span>“</span><span>Dodd-Frank Act</span><span>”</span><span>) in the U.S. and under </span><span>comparable regimes in Europe, Asia and other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Swaps, non-deliverable forwards and certain other </span><span>derivatives traded in the OTC market are subject to variation margin and initial margin requirements. Implementation of the </span><span>margining and other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding clearing, mandatory trading, reporting and documentation </span><span>of swaps and other derivatives have impacted and may continue to impact the costs to a Fund of trading these instruments </span><span>and, as a result, may affect returns to investors in a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Rule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act permits a Fund to enter into Derivatives Transactions (as defined below) and </span><span>certain other transactions notwithstanding the restrictions on the issuance of </span><span>“</span><span>senior securities</span><span>”</span><span> under Section 18 of the </span><span>Investment Company Act. Section 18 of the Investment Company Act, among other things, prohibits open-end funds, </span><span>including the Funds, from issuing or selling any </span><span>“</span><span>senior security,</span><span>”</span><span> other than borrowing from a bank (subject to a requirement </span><span>to maintain 300% </span><span>“</span><span>asset coverage</span><span>”</span><span>). </span></div> <div><span>Under Rule 18f-4, </span><span>“</span><span>Derivatives Transactions</span><span>”</span><span> include the following: (1) any swap, security-based swap (including a contract </span><span>for differences), futures contract, forward contract, option (excluding purchased options), any combination of the foregoing, </span><span>or any similar instrument, under which a Fund is or may be required to make any payment or delivery of cash or other assets </span><span>during the life of the instrument or at maturity or early termination, whether as margin or settlement payment or otherwise; </span><span>(2) any short sale borrowing; (3) reverse repurchase agreements and similar financing transactions (</span><span>e.g</span><span>., recourse and non-recourse</span><span> tender option bonds, and borrowed bonds), if a Fund elects to treat these transactions as Derivatives Transactions </span><span>under Rule 18f-4; and (4) when-issued or forward-settling securities (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, firm and standby commitments, including to-be-announced</span><span> (</span><span>“</span><span>TBA</span><span>”</span><span>) commitments, and dollar rolls) and non-standard settlement cycle securities, unless the Fund intends to </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The DRMP is administered by a </span><span>“</span><span>derivatives risk manager,</span><span>”</span><span> who is </span><span>appointed by the Board, including a majority of Independent Directors/Trustees, and periodically reviews the DRMP and </span><span>reports to the Board.</span></div> <div><span>Rule 18f-4 provides an exception from the DRMP, VaR limit and certain other requirements if a Fund's </span><span>“</span><span>derivatives exposure</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>(as defined in Rule 18f-4) is limited to 10% of its net assets (as calculated in accordance with Rule 18f-4) and the Fund </span><span>adopts and implements written policies and procedures reasonably designed to manage its derivatives risks (the </span><span>“</span><span>Limited </span><span>Derivatives User Exception</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> <div><span>Repurchase Agreements.</span><span>  </span><span>A repurchase agreement is an instrument under which the purchaser (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, a Fund or an </span><span>Underlying Fund) acquires a security and the seller agrees, at the time of the sale, to repurchase the security at a mutually </span><span>agreed-upon time and price, thereby determining the yield during the purchaser’s holding period. Repurchase agreements </span><span>may be construed to be collateralized loans by the purchaser to the seller secured by the securities transferred to the </span><span>purchaser. If a repurchase agreement is construed to be a collateralized loan, the underlying securities will not be considered </span><span>to be owned by a Fund or an Underlying Fund but only to constitute collateral for the seller’s obligation to pay the repurchase </span><span>price, and, in the event of a default by the seller, the Fund and its Underlying Fund may suffer time delays and incur costs or </span><span>losses in connection with the disposition of the collateral.</span></div> <div><span>In any repurchase transaction, the collateral for a repurchase agreement may include: (i) cash items; (ii) obligations issued by </span><span>the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities; or (iii) obligations that, at the time the repurchase agreement is </span><span>entered into, are determined to (A) have exceptionally strong capacity to meet their financial obligations and (B) are </span><span>sufficiently liquid such that they can be sold at approximately their carrying value in the ordinary course of business within </span><span>seven days.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Repurchase agreements pose certain risks for a Fund or an Underlying Fund, should it decide to utilize them. Such risks are </span><span>not unique to the Fund and its Underlying Fund, but are inherent in repurchase agreements. Each Fund and its Underlying </span><span>Fund seek to minimize such risks, but because of the inherent legal uncertainties involved in repurchase agreements, such </span><span>risks cannot be eliminated. Lower quality collateral and collateral with a longer maturity may be subject to greater price </span><span>fluctuations than higher quality collateral and collateral with a shorter maturity. If the repurchase agreement counterparty </span><span>were to default, lower quality collateral may be more difficult to liquidate than higher quality collateral. Should the </span><span>counterparty default and the amount of collateral not be sufficient to cover the counterparty’s repurchase obligation, a Fund </span><span>or an Underlying Fund would likely retain the status of an unsecured creditor of the counterparty (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the position a Fund or </span><span>an Underlying Fund would normally be in if it were to hold, pursuant to its investment policies, other unsecured debt </span><span>securities of the defaulting counterparty) with respect to the amount of the shortfall. As an unsecured creditor, a Fund or an </span><span>Underlying Fund would be at risk of losing some or all of the principal and income involved in the transaction.</span></div> <div><span>Reverse Repurchase Agreements.</span><span>  </span><span>Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities with an agreement to </span><span>repurchase the securities at an agreed-upon price, date and interest payment and have the characteristics of borrowing. </span><span>Generally, the effect of such transactions is that each Fund </span><span> </span><span>or an Underlying Fund can recover all or most of the cash </span><span>invested in the portfolio securities involved during the term of the reverse repurchase agreement, while in many cases the </span><span>Fund </span><span> </span><span>or an Underlying Fund is able to keep some of the interest income associated with those securities. Such transactions </span><span>are advantageous only if each Fund </span><span> </span><span>or an Underlying Fund has an opportunity to earn a rate of interest on the cash derived </span><span>from these transactions that is greater than the interest cost of obtaining the same amount of cash. Opportunities to realize </span><span>earnings from the use of the proceeds equal to or greater than the interest required to be paid may not always be available, </span><span>and each Fund </span><span> </span><span>or an Underlying Fund intends to use the reverse repurchase technique only when BFA believes it will be </span><span>advantageous to the Fund or an Underlying Fund. The use of reverse repurchase agreements may exaggerate any increase or </span><span>decrease in the value of the Fund’s or its Underlying Fund's assets. The use of reverse repurchase agreements is a form of </span><span>leverage, and the proceeds obtained through reverse repurchase agreements may be invested in additional securities.</span></div> <div><span>Rule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act permits each Fund or an Underlying Fund to enter into reverse repurchase </span><span>agreements and similar financing transactions (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> recourse and non-recourse tender option bonds, borrowed bonds) </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>9</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

(See </span><span>“</span><span>Regulation Regarding Derivatives</span><span>”</span><span> above.)</span></div> <div><span>Securities of Investment Companies. </span><span> </span><span>Each Fund and Underlying Fund may invest in the securities of other investment </span><span>companies (including money market funds) to the extent permitted by law, regulation, exemptive order or SEC staff </span><span>guidance. Under the 1940 Act, a fund’s investment in investment companies is limited to, subject to certain exceptions, (i) </span><span>3% of the total outstanding voting stock of any one investment company, (ii) 5% of the fund’s total assets with respect to </span><span>any one investment company, and (iii) 10% of the fund’s total assets with respect to investment companies in the aggregate. </span><span>To the extent allowed by law or regulation,</span><span> </span><span>the Funds and the Underlying Funds intend from time to time to invest their </span><span>assets in securities of investment companies, including, but not limited to, money market funds, including those advised by </span><span>BFA or otherwise affiliated with BFA, in excess of the limits discussed above. Other investment companies in which a Fund or </span><span>an Underlying Fund invests can be expected to incur fees and expenses for operations, such as investment advisory and </span><span>administration fees, which would be in addition to those incurred by a </span><span> </span><span>Fund or an Underlying Fund. Pursuant to guidance </span><span>issued by the SEC staff, fees and expenses of money market funds used for cash collateral received in connection with loans </span><span>of securities are not treated as Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, which reflect a fund's </span><span>pro rata </span><span>share of the fees and </span><span>expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies</span><span> </span><span>(as disclosed in the Prospectus, as applicable).</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The Funds or the Underlying Funds may purchase shares of ETFs for the same reason it would purchase (and as an </span><span>alternative to purchasing) futures contracts – to obtain relatively low-cost exposure to the stock market while maintaining </span><span>flexibility to meet the liquidity needs of the Funds or Underlying Funds. ETF shares enjoy several advantages over futures </span><span>contracts. Depending on the market, the holding period, and other factors, ETF shares can be less costly than futures </span><span>contracts. In addition, ETF shares can be purchased for smaller sums and offer exposure to market sectors and styles for </span><span>which there is no suitable or liquid futures contract. The Funds and the Underlying Funds may also purchase ETF shares for </span><span>other purposes, including improving its ability to track their underlying index (in the case of the Underlying Funds). The </span><span>Funds and the Underlying Funds may invest in shares of ETFs that are advised by BFA.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Short-Term Instruments and Temporary Investments.</span><span>  </span><span>Each Fund and the Underlying Funds may invest in short-term </span><span>instruments, including money market instruments, on an ongoing basis to provide liquidity or for other reasons. Money </span><span>market instruments are generally short-term investments that may include, but are not limited to: (i) shares of money market </span><span>funds (including those advised by BFA or otherwise affiliated with BFA); (ii) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. </span><span>government, its agencies or instrumentalities (including government-sponsored enterprises); (iii) negotiable certificates of </span><span>deposit (</span><span>“</span><span>CDs</span><span>”</span><span>), bankers’ acceptances, fixed-time deposits and other obligations of U.S. and non-U.S. banks (including non-U.S.</span><span> branches) and similar institutions; (iv) commercial paper rated, at the date of purchase, </span><span>“</span><span>Prime-1</span><span>”</span><span> by Moody's, </span><span>“</span><span>F-1</span><span>”</span><span> by </span><span>Fitch, or </span><span>“</span><span>A-1</span><span>”</span><span> by S&amp;P Global Ratings, or if unrated, of comparable quality as determined by BFA; (v) non-convertible </span><span>corporate debt securities (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, bonds and debentures) with remaining maturities at the date of purchase of not more than </span><span>397 days and that have been determined to present minimal credit risks, in accordance with the requirements set forth in </span><span>Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act; (vi) repurchase agreements; and (vii) short-term U.S. dollar-denominated obligations of non-U.S.</span><span> banks (including U.S. branches) that, in the opinion of BFA, are of comparable quality to obligations of U.S. banks that </span><span>may be purchased by a Fund. Any of these instruments may be purchased on a current or forward-settled basis. Time </span><span>deposits are non-negotiable deposits maintained in banking institutions for specified periods of time at stated interest rates. </span><span>Bankers’ acceptances are time drafts drawn on commercial banks by borrowers, usually in connection with international </span><span>transactions.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Future Developments.</span><span>  </span><span>The board of each Fund or Underlying Fund may, in the future, authorize a Fund</span><span> </span><span>or an Underlying </span><span>Fund to invest in securities contracts and investments, other than those listed in this SAI and in the applicable Prospectus, </span><span>provided they are consistent with each Fund's or Underlying Fund's investment objective and do not violate any of its </span><span>investment restrictions or policies.</span></div> <div><span>General Considerations and Risks</span></div> <div><span>A discussion of some of the principal risks associated with an investment in a Fund is contained in the applicable Prospectus. </span><span>Because each Fund expects to obtain its exposure substantially through its investment in the Underlying Funds, shareholders </span><span>should be aware that the risks of investment in particular types of securities, economic sectors and geographic locations </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>discussed below may be borne by the Fund through its investment in the Underlying Funds. Through its investment in the </span><span>Underlying Funds, each Fund will also bear the risks described below associated with the Underlying Funds' use of portfolio </span><span>management techniques, such as borrowing arrangements and use of derivatives, in addition to the risks associated with </span><span>those activities if the Funds engage in them directly.</span></div> <div><span>An investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding that the value of the Fund’s portfolio</span><span> </span><span>securities, including its </span><span>investment in the Underlying Funds, may fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the issuers of the </span><span>portfolio securities, the value of bonds in general, and other factors that affect the market. The order of the below risk factors </span><span>does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</span></div> <div><span>Borrowing Risk. </span><span> </span><span>Borrowing may exaggerate changes in the NAV of Fund or Underlying Fund shares and in the return on a </span><span>Fund’s or Underlying Fund's portfolio. Borrowing will cause a Fund or Underlying Fund to incur interest expense and other </span><span>fees. The costs of borrowing may reduce a Fund’s or Underlying Fund's return. Borrowing may cause a Fund or Underlying </span><span>Fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations.</span></div> <div><span>Call Risk. </span><span> </span><span>During periods of falling interest rates, an issuer of a callable bond held by the Funds or Underlying Funds may </span><span>“</span><span>call</span><span>”</span><span> or repay the security before its stated maturity, and a Fund or an Underlying Fund may have to reinvest the proceeds in </span><span>securities with lower yields or interest rates that would not benefit from the hedging strategies used by the Fund. This might </span><span>result in a decline in a Fund's or Underlying Fund's income, or in securities with greater risks or with other less favorable </span><span>features.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Extension Risk. </span><span> </span><span>During periods of rising interest rates, certain debt obligations may be paid off substantially more slowly </span><span>than originally anticipated and the value of those securities may fall sharply, resulting in a decline in a Fund’s or Underlying </span><span>Fund's income and potentially in the value of a Fund’s or Underlying Fund's investments.</span></div> <div><span>Illiquid Investments Risk.</span><span>  </span><span>Each Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, immediately after the acquisition, the Fund </span><span>would have invested more than 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that a </span><span>Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less without </span><span>significantly changing the market value of the investment. The liquidity of an investment will be determined based on </span><span>relevant market, trading and investment specific considerations as set out in the Liquidity Program as required by the </span><span>Liquidity Rule. Illiquid investments may trade at a discount to comparable, more liquid investments and a Fund may not be </span><span>able to dispose of illiquid investments in a timely fashion or at their expected prices. If illiquid investments exceed 15% of a </span><span>Fund’s net assets, the Liquidity Rule and the Liquidity Program will require that certain remedial actions be taken.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Issuer Insolvency Risk.</span><span>  </span><span>Each Fund's and Underlying Fund's potential exposure to financially or operationally troubled issuers </span><span>involves a high degree of credit and market risk, which may be heightened during an economic downturn or recession. </span><span>Should an issuer of securities held by a Fund or Underlying Fund become involved in a bankruptcy proceeding, reorganization </span><span>or financial restructuring, a wide variety of considerations make an evaluation of the outcome of a Fund’s or Underlying </span><span>Fund's exposure to the issuer uncertain.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>During the period of a bankruptcy proceeding, reorganization or financial restructuring, it is unlikely that each Fund or an </span><span>Underlying Fund will receive any interest payments on the securities of the issuer. Each Fund or an Underlying Fund will be </span><span>subject to significant uncertainty as to whether the reorganization or restructuring will be completed, and each Fund or an </span><span>Underlying Fund may bear certain extraordinary expenses to protect and recover its investment. Each Fund or an Underlying </span><span>Fund will also be subject to significant uncertainty as to when and in what manner and for what value the obligations </span><span>evidenced by the securities of the issuer held by a Fund or Underlying Fund will eventually be satisfied. Even if a plan of </span><span>reorganization or restructuring is adopted with respect to the securities of the issuer held by each Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund, </span><span>there can be no assurance that the securities or other assets received by a Fund or Underlying Fund in connection with such </span><span>plan of reorganization or restructuring will not have a lower value or income potential than may have been anticipated or no </span><span>value. A Fund or an Underlying Fund may be unable to enforce their claims or rights in any collateral or may have its claims or </span><span>security interest in any collateral challenged, disallowed or subordinated to the claims or security interests of other creditors. </span><span>In addition, amendments to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or other relevant laws could alter the expected outcome or introduce </span><span>greater uncertainty regarding the outcome of each Fund's or Underlying Fund's securities holdings in the issuer. In a </span><span>bankruptcy proceeding, a reorganization or restructuring, the securities of the issuer held by a Fund or Underlying Fund could </span><span>be re-characterized, or each Fund or an Underlying Fund may receive different securities or other assets, including equity </span><span>securities. These types of equity securities include, but are not limited to: common stock; preferred stock (including </span><span>convertible preferred stock); bonds, notes and debentures convertible into common or preferred stock; stock purchase </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>warrants and rights; equity interests in trusts; and depositary receipts. The value of equity securities received by each Fund or </span><span>an Underlying Fund could decline if the financial condition of the issuer deteriorates or if overall market and economic </span><span>conditions, or conditions within the issuer’s region or industry, deteriorate.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>To the extent that a Fund or Underlying Fund receives other assets in connection with a bankruptcy proceeding, </span><span>reorganization or financial restructuring, a Fund or Underlying Fund may also be subject to additional risks associated with </span><span>the assets received. One example of assets that a Fund or Underlying Fund could receive is an interest in one or more loans </span><span>made to the issuer as part of a workout agreed to by a consortium of lienholders and creditors of the issuer. A Fund or </span><span>Underlying Fund may receive such interests in loans to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act.</span></div> <div><span>Securities or other assets received in a reorganization or restructuring typically entail a higher degree of risk than investments </span><span>in securities of issuers that have not undergone a reorganization or restructuring and may be subject to heavy selling or </span><span>downward pricing pressure after completion of the reorganization or restructuring. The post-reorganization/restructuring </span><span>assets and securities may also be illiquid and difficult to sell or value. If a Fund or Underlying Fund participates in negotiations </span><span>with respect to a plan of reorganization or restructuring with respect to securities of the issuer held by a Fund or Underlying </span><span>Fund, each Fund or Underlying Fund also may be restricted from disposing such securities for a period of time. If a Fund or </span><span>Underlying Fund becomes involved in such proceedings, each Fund or an Underlying Fund may have more active </span><span>participation in the affairs of the issuer than that assumed generally by an investor.</span></div> <div><span>LIBOR Risk. </span><span> </span><span>A Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund may be exposed to financial instruments that are tied to the London Interbank </span><span>Offered Rate (</span><span>“</span><span>LIBOR</span><span>”</span><span>) to determine payment obligations, financing terms, hedging strategies or investment value. A Fund’s </span><span>investments may pay interest at floating rates based on LIBOR or may be subject to interest caps or floors based on LIBOR. A </span><span>Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund may also obtain financing at floating rates based on LIBOR. Derivative instruments utilized by a </span><span>Fund may also reference LIBOR.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>LIBOR Replacement Risk. </span><span> </span><span>The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (</span><span>“</span><span>FCA</span><span>”</span><span>), which regulates LIBOR announced </span><span>that a majority of USD LIBOR settings will no longer be published after June 30, 2023. All other LIBOR settings and certain </span><span>other interbank offered rates, such as the Euro Overnight Index Average (</span><span>“</span><span>EONIA</span><span>”</span><span>) ceased to be published after December 31, </span><span>2021. The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (</span><span>“</span><span>SOFR</span><span>”</span><span>) is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight </span><span>collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities in the repurchase agreement (</span><span>“</span><span>repo</span><span>”</span><span>) market and has been used increasingly on a </span><span>voluntary basis in new instruments and transactions. On March 15, 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate Act was signed into </span><span>law in the U.S., providing a statutory fallback mechanism to replace LIBOR with a benchmark rate that is selected by the </span><span>Federal Reserve Board and based on SOFR for certain contracts that reference LIBOR without adequate fallback provisions. </span><span>On December 16, 2022, the Federal Reserve Board adopted regulations implementing the Adjustable Interest Rate Act by </span><span>identifying benchmark rates based on SOFR that will replace LIBOR in different categories of financial contracts after June 30, </span><span>2023.</span></div> <div><span>The regulations include provisions that (i) provide a safe harbor for selection or use of a replacement benchmark rate </span><span>selected by the Federal Reserve Board; (ii) clarify who may choose the replacement benchmark rate selected by the Federal </span><span>Reserve Board; and (iii) ensure that contracts adopting a replacement benchmark rate selected by the Federal Reserve Board </span><span>will not be interrupted or terminated following the replacement of LIBOR. These regulations apply only contracts governed by </span><span>U.S. law, among other limitations. Similar legislation and regulations have been and may be further adopted in other </span><span>jurisdictions.</span></div> <div><span>Neither the effect of the LIBOR transition process nor its ultimate success can yet be known. Not all existing LIBOR-based </span><span>instruments may have alternative rate-setting provisions and there remains uncertainty regarding the willingness and ability </span><span>of issuers to add alternative rate-setting provisions in certain existing instruments. Parties to contracts, securities or other </span><span>instruments using LIBOR may disagree on transition rates or the application of applicable transition regulations, potentially </span><span>resulting in uncertainty of performance and the possibility of litigation. A Fund may have instruments linked to other </span><span>interbank offered rates and currencies that may also cease to be published in the future.</span></div> <div><span>The effect of these changes on a Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund will vary based on, among other things, existing fallback or </span><span>termination provisions in individual contracts and the potential renegotiation of existing contracts. In many cases, if an </span><span>instrument falls back to an alternative reference rate, including SOFR, the alternative reference rate will not perform the same </span><span>as LIBOR because the alternative reference rate does not include a credit-sensitive component in the rate calculation. In the </span><span>event of a credit crisis, floating rate instruments using certain alternative reference rates could perform differently than those </span><span>instruments using a rate indexed to the interbank lending market.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>12</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Money Market Instruments Risk. </span><span> </span><span>A Fund may hold money market instruments. The value of money market instruments </span><span>may be affected by changes in interest rates or in the credit ratings of the investments, among other things. If a significant </span><span>amount of a Fund's assets is invested in money market instruments, it may be more difficult for the Fund to achieve its </span><span>investment objective. An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance </span><span>Corporation or any other government agency. It is possible to lose money by investing in a money market fund. Money </span><span>market funds other than U.S. government money market funds and retail money market funds </span><span>“</span><span>float</span><span>”</span><span> their NAV instead of </span><span>using a stable $1.00 per share price.</span></div> <div><span>Operational Risk.</span><span>  </span><span>BFA and a Fund's or Underlying Fund's other service providers may experience disruptions or operating </span><span>errors such as processing errors or human errors, inadequate or failed internal or external processes, or systems or </span><span>technology failures, that could negatively impact the Funds or Underlying Funds. While service providers are required to have </span><span>appropriate operational risk management policies and procedures, their methods of operational risk management may differ </span><span>from a Fund’s or Underlying Fund's in the setting of priorities, the personnel and resources available or the effectiveness of </span><span>relevant controls. BFA, through its monitoring and oversight of service providers, seeks to ensure that service providers take </span><span>appropriate precautions to avoid and mitigate risks that could lead to disruptions and operating errors. However, it is not </span><span>possible for BFA or the other Fund or Underlying Fund service providers to identify all of the operational risks that may affect </span><span>a Fund or Underlying Fund or to develop processes and controls to completely eliminate or mitigate their occurrence or </span><span>effects.</span></div> <div><span>Prepayment Risk. </span><span> </span><span>During periods of falling interest rates, issuers of certain debt obligations may repay principal prior to the </span><span>security’s maturity, which may cause a Fund or an Underlying Fund to have to reinvest in securities with lower yields or </span><span>higher risk of default, resulting in a decline in the Fund’s or Underlying Fund's income or return potential. Also, if a security </span><span>subject to prepayment had been purchased at a premium, the value of the premium would be lost in the event of </span><span>prepayment.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Futures and Options on Futures Transactions.</span><span>  </span><span>There are several risks accompanying the utilization of futures </span><span>contracts and options on futures contracts. A position in futures contracts and options on futures contracts may be closed </span><span>only on the exchange on which the contract was made (or a linked exchange). While each Fund or Underlying Fund plans to </span><span>utilize futures contracts only if an active market exists for such contracts, there is no guarantee that a liquid market will exist </span><span>for the contract at a specified time. Futures contracts, by definition, project price levels in the future and not current levels of </span><span>valuation; therefore, market circumstances may result in a discrepancy between the price of the future and the movement in </span><span>a Fund's or Underlying Fund's portfolio. In the event of adverse price movements, a Fund or Underlying Fund would continue </span><span>to be required to make daily cash payments to maintain its required margin. In such situations, if a Fund or Underlying Fund </span><span>has insufficient cash, it may have to sell portfolio securities to meet daily margin requirements at a time when it may be </span><span>disadvantageous to do so. In addition, a Fund or Underlying Fund may be required to deliver the instruments underlying the </span><span>futures contracts it has sold.</span></div> <div><span>The risk of loss in trading futures contracts or uncovered call options in some strategies (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, selling uncovered stock index </span><span>futures contracts) is potentially unlimited. The Funds do not plan to use futures and options contracts in this way. The risk of </span><span>a futures position may still be large as traditionally measured due to the low margin deposits required. In many cases, a </span><span>relatively small price movement in a futures contract may result in immediate and substantial loss or gain to the investor </span><span>relative to the size of a required margin deposit. The Funds, however, intend to utilize futures and options contracts in a </span><span>manner designed to limit the risk exposure to levels comparable to a direct investment in the types of stocks in which it </span><span>invests.</span></div> <div><span>Utilization of futures and options on futures by a Fund or Underlying Fund involves the risk of loss of margin deposits in the </span><span>event of bankruptcy of a broker with whom a Fund or Underlying Fund has an open position in the futures contract or </span><span>option. The purchase of put or call options will be based upon predictions by BFA as to anticipated trends, which predictions </span><span>could prove to be incorrect.</span></div> <div><span>Because the futures market generally imposes less burdensome margin requirements than the securities market, an </span><span>increased amount of participation by speculators in the futures market could result in price fluctuations. Certain financial </span><span>futures exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures contract prices during a single trading day. The daily </span><span>limit establishes the maximum amount by which the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the </span><span>previous day’s settlement price at the end of a trading session. Once the daily limit has been reached in a particular type of </span><span>contract, no trades may be made on that day at a price beyond that limit. It is possible that futures contract prices could </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>13</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

In the event of adverse price </span><span>movements, each Fund or Underlying Fund would be required to make daily cash payments of variation margin.</span></div> <div><span>Securities Lending Risk. </span><span> </span><span>A Fund or an Underlying Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk </span><span>that a Fund or an Underlying Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities </span><span>in a timely manner or at all. A Fund or an Underlying Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of </span><span>collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events </span><span>could also trigger adverse tax consequences for a Fund</span><span> </span><span>or an Underlying Fund.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>U.S. Treasury Obligations Risk. </span><span> </span><span>U.S. Treasury obligations may differ from other securities in their interest rates, maturities, </span><span>times of issuance and other characteristics. Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial condition or credit rating of the </span><span>U.S. government may cause the value of a Fund's U.S. Treasury obligations to decline. U.S. Treasury securities are rated AA+ </span><span>by S&amp;P Global Ratings. A downgrade of the rating of U.S. Treasury securities may cause the value of a Fund's U.S. Treasury </span><span>obligations to decline. Because U.S. government debt obligations are often used as a benchmark for other borrowing </span><span>arrangements, a downgrade could also result in higher interest rates for a range of borrowers, cause disruptions in the </span><span>international bond markets and have a substantial adverse effect on the U.S. and global economy.</span></div> <div><span>A high national debt level may increase market pressures to meet government funding needs, which may drive debt cost </span><span>higher and lead the government to issue additional debt, thereby increasing refinancing risk. A high national debt also raises </span><span>concerns that the U.S. government will not be able to make principal or interest payments when they are due. If market </span><span>participants determine that U.S. sovereign debt levels have become unsustainable, the value of the U.S. dollar could decline, </span><span>thus increasing inflationary pressures, particularly with respect to services outsourced to non-U.S. providers and imported </span><span>goods and constrain or prevent the U.S. government from implementing effective countercyclical fiscal policy in economic </span><span>downturns. Direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury have historically involved little risk of loss of principal if held to maturity. </span><span>However, due to fluctuations in interest rates, the market value of such securities may vary during the period that </span><span>shareholders own shares of a Fund. Notwithstanding that U.S. Treasury obligations are backed by the full faith and credit of </span><span>the U.S., circumstances could arise that would prevent the timely payment of interest or principal, which would result in </span><span>losses to a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Valuation Risk. </span><span> </span><span>In certain circumstances, a Fund’s or an Underlying Fund's securities may be valued using techniques other </span><span>than market quotations. The value established for a security may be different from what would be produced through the use </span><span>of another methodology or if the value had been priced using market quotations. Securities that are valued using methods </span><span>other than market quotations, including </span><span>“</span><span>fair valued</span><span>”</span><span> securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation in their value from one </span><span>day to the next than would be the case if market quotations were used. In addition, there is no assurance that a Fund </span><span> </span><span>and an </span><span>Underlying Fund could sell a security for the value established for it at any time, and it is possible that a Fund or the </span><span>Underlying Fund could incur a loss if a security is sold for less than its established value.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Asia.</span><span>  </span><span> Investments in securities of issuers in certain Asian countries involve risks not typically associated </span><span>with investments in securities of issuers in other regions. Such heightened risks</span><span> </span><span>include, among others, expropriation and/or </span><span>nationalization of assets, confiscatory taxation, piracy of intellectual property, data and other security breaches (especially of </span><span>data stored electronically), political instability, including authoritarian and/or military involvement in governmental decision-making,</span><span> armed conflict and social instability as a result of religious, ethnic and/or socio-economic unrest. Certain Asian </span><span>economies have experienced rapid rates of economic growth and industrialization in recent years, and there is no assurance </span><span>that these rates of economic growth and industrialization will be maintained.</span></div> <div><span>Certain Asian countries have democracies with relatively short histories, which may increase the risk of political instability. </span><span>These countries have faced political and military unrest, and further unrest could present a risk to their local economies and </span><span>securities markets. Indonesia and the Philippines have each experienced violence and terrorism, which has negatively </span><span>impacted their economies. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial military capabilities, and historical tensions </span><span>between the two countries present the risk of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of </span><span>hostilities between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on </span><span>the entire Asian region. Certain Asian countries have also developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if </span><span>these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. Political, religious, and </span><span>border disputes persist in India. India has recently experienced and may continue to experience civil unrest and hostilities </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Increased political and social unrest in these geographic areas could adversely affect </span><span>the performance of investments in this region.</span></div> <div><span>Certain governments in this region administer prices on several basic goods, including fuel and electricity, within their </span><span>respective countries. Certain governments may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector in their </span><span>respective countries and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on </span><span>the economic conditions in this region, which in turn could have a negative impact on private sector companies. There is also </span><span>the possibility of diplomatic developments adversely affecting investments in the region.</span></div> <div><span>Corruption and the perceived lack of a rule of law in dealings with international companies in certain Asian countries may </span><span>discourage foreign investment and could negatively impact the long-term growth of certain economies in this region. In </span><span>addition, certain countries in the region are experiencing high unemployment and corruption, and have fragile banking </span><span>sectors.</span></div> <div><span>Some economies in this region are dependent on a range of commodities, including oil, natural gas and coal. Accordingly, </span><span>they are strongly affected by international commodity prices and particularly vulnerable to any weakening in global demand </span><span>for these products. The market for securities in this region may also be directly influenced by the flow of international capital, </span><span>and by the economic and market conditions of neighboring countries. China is a key trading partner of many Asian countries </span><span>and any changes in trading relationships between China and other Asian countries may affect the region as a whole. Adverse </span><span>economic conditions or developments in neighboring countries may increase investors' perception of the risk of investing in </span><span>the region as a whole, which may adversely impact the market value of the securities issued by companies in the region.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. </span><span> </span><span>Many countries with developed markets have recently experienced significant </span><span>economic pressures. These countries generally tend to rely on the services sectors (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, the financial services sector) as the </span><span>primary source of economic growth and may be susceptible to the risks of individual service sectors. For example, companies </span><span>in the financial services sector are subject to governmental regulation and, recently, government intervention, which may </span><span>adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge and amount of capital they must maintain. </span><span>Dislocations in the financial sector and perceived or actual governmental influence over certain financial companies may lead </span><span>to credit rating downgrades and, as a result, impact, among other things, revenue growth for such companies. If financial </span><span>companies experience a prolonged decline in revenue growth, certain developed countries that rely heavily on financial </span><span>companies as an economic driver may experience a correlative slowdown. Concerns have emerged with respect to the </span><span>economic health of certain developed countries. These concerns primarily stem from heavy indebtedness of many developed </span><span>countries and their perceived inability to continue to service high debt loads without simultaneously implementing stringent </span><span>austerity measures. Such concerns have led to tremendous downward pressure on the economies of these countries. As a </span><span>result, it is possible that interest rates on debt of certain developed countries may rise to levels that make it difficult for such </span><span>countries to service such debt. Spending on health care and retirement pensions in most developed countries has risen </span><span>dramatically. Medical innovation, extended life expectancy and higher public expectations are likely to continue the increase </span><span>in health care and pension costs. Any increase in health care and pension costs will likely have a negative impact on the </span><span>economic growth of many developed countries. Certain developed countries rely on imports of certain key items, such as </span><span>crude oil, natural gas, and other commodities. As a result, an increase in demand for, or price fluctuations of, certain </span><span>commodities may negatively affect developed country economies. Developed market countries generally are dependent on </span><span>the economies of certain key trading partners. Changes in any one economy may cause an adverse impact on several </span><span>developed countries. In addition, heavy regulation of, among others, labor and product markets may have an adverse effect </span><span>on certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause prolonged periods of recession. Such </span><span>risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of a Fund’s or the Underlying Fund's investments.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Europe. </span><span> </span><span>Investing in European countries may expose a Fund or Underlying Fund to the economic and </span><span>political risks associated with Europe in general and the specific European countries in which it invests. The economies and </span><span>markets of European countries are often closely connected and interdependent, and events in one European country can </span><span>have an adverse impact on other European countries. A Fund or Underlying Fund may make investments in securities of </span><span>issuers that are domiciled in, have significant operations in, or that are listed on at least one securities exchange within </span><span>member states of the European Union (the </span><span>“</span><span>EU</span><span>”</span><span>). A number of countries within the EU are also members of the Economic </span><span>and Monetary Union (the </span><span>“</span><span>eurozone</span><span>”</span><span>) and have adopted the euro as their currency. Eurozone membership requires member </span><span>states to comply with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates, debt levels and fiscal and monetary controls, each </span><span>of which may significantly affect every country in Europe. Changes in import or export tariffs, changes in governmental or EU </span><span>regulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro and other currencies of certain EU countries which are not in </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>15</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>the eurozone, the default or threat of default by an EU member state on its sovereign debt, and/or an economic recession in </span><span>an EU member state may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of other EU member states and their trading </span><span>partners. Although certain European countries are not in the eurozone, many of these countries are obliged to meet the </span><span>criteria for joining the eurozone.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Consequently, these countries must comply with many of the restrictions noted above. The European financial markets have </span><span>experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns, government debt levels and the </span><span>possible default of government debt in several European countries, including, but not limited to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, </span><span>France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. In order to prevent further economic deterioration, certain </span><span>countries, without prior warning, can institute </span><span>“</span><span>capital controls.</span><span>”</span><span> Countries may use these controls to restrict volatile </span><span>movements of capital entering and exiting their country. Such controls may negatively affect a Fund’s or Underlying Fund's </span><span>investments. A default or debt restructuring by any European country would adversely impact holders of that country’s debt </span><span>and sellers of credit default swaps linked to that country’s creditworthiness, which may be located in countries other than </span><span>those listed above. In addition, the credit ratings of certain European countries were downgraded in the past. These events </span><span>have adversely affected the value and exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect the economies of </span><span>every country in Europe, including countries that do not use the euro and non-EU member states. Responses to the financial </span><span>problems by European governments, central banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce </span><span>the desired results, may result in social unrest and may limit future growth and economic recovery or have other unintended </span><span>consequences. Further defaults or restructurings by governments and other entities of their debt could have additional </span><span>adverse effects on economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more countries </span><span>may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The impact of these actions, especially if they occur in a disorderly </span><span>fashion, is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely impact the value of a Fund’s or Underlying </span><span>Fund's investments in the region.</span></div> <div><span>The United Kingdom (the </span><span>“</span><span>U.K.</span><span>”</span><span>) left the EU (</span><span>“</span><span>Brexit</span><span>”</span><span>) on January 31, 2020. Brexit could adversely affect European or </span><span>worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political </span><span>institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets.</span></div> <div><span>Certain European countries have also developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were </span><span>to worsen, they could adversely affect European issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The national politics of countries in </span><span>Europe have been unpredictable and subject to influence by disruptive political groups and ideologies, including for example, </span><span>secessionist movements. The governments of European countries may be subject to change and such countries may </span><span>experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments may result in sudden and </span><span>significant investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe or war in the region also could impact </span><span>financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching</span><span> </span><span>and could adversely affect </span><span>the value and liquidity of a Fund's or Underlying Fund's investments.</span></div> <div><span>Russian Invasion of Ukraine</span><span>. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The extent and duration </span><span>of the military action, resulting sanctions and resulting future market disruptions, including declines in its stock markets and </span><span>the value of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but could be significant. Disruptions caused by Russian </span><span>military action or other actions (including cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting actual and threatened responses to such </span><span>activity, including purchasing and financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer or purchaser preferences, </span><span>sanctions, import and export restrictions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Russian government, Russian companies or Russian </span><span>individuals, including politicians, may impact Russia's economy, Russian issuers of securities in which a Fund invests, or the </span><span>economies of Europe as a whole. Actual and threatened responses to Russian military action may also impact the markets for </span><span>certain Russian commodities, such as oil and natural gas, as well as other sectors of the Russian economy, and are likely to </span><span>have collateral impacts on such sectors across Europe and globally.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Middle East. </span><span> </span><span>Many Middle Eastern countries have little or no democratic tradition, and the political </span><span>and legal systems in such countries may have an adverse impact on a Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund. Many economies in the </span><span>Middle East are highly reliant on income from the sale of oil and natural gas or trade with countries involved in the sale of oil </span><span>and natural gas, and their economies are therefore vulnerable to changes in the market for oil and natural gas and foreign </span><span>currency values. As global demand for oil and natural gas fluctuates, many Middle Eastern economies may be significantly </span><span>impacted.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>16</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>In addition, many Middle Eastern governments have exercised and continue to exercise substantial influence over many </span><span>aspects of the private sector. In certain cases, a Middle Eastern country’s government may own or control many companies, </span><span>including some of the largest companies in the country. Accordingly, governmental actions in the future could have a </span><span>significant effect on economic conditions in Middle Eastern countries. This could affect private sector companies and a </span><span>Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund, as well as the value of securities in such Fund's or Underlying Fund's portfolios.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Certain Middle Eastern markets are in the earliest stages of development. As a result, there may be a high concentration of </span><span>market capitalization and trading volume in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries, as well as </span><span>a high concentration of investors and financial intermediaries. Brokers in Middle Eastern countries typically are fewer in </span><span>number and less capitalized than brokers in the U.S.</span></div> <div><span>The legal systems in certain Middle Eastern countries also may have an adverse impact on a Fund or an Underlying Fund. For </span><span>example, the potential liability of a shareholder in a U.S. corporation with respect to acts of the corporation generally is </span><span>limited to the amount of the shareholder’s investment. However, the notion of limited liability is less clear in certain Middle </span><span>Eastern countries. A Fund or Underlying Fund therefore may be liable in certain Middle Eastern countries for the acts of a </span><span>corporation in which it invests for an amount greater than their actual investment in that corporation. Similarly, the rights of </span><span>investors in Middle Eastern issuers may be more limited than those of shareholders of a U.S. corporation. It may be difficult or </span><span>impossible to obtain or enforce a legal judgment in a Middle Eastern country. Some Middle Eastern countries prohibit or </span><span>impose substantial restrictions on investments in their capital markets, particularly their equity markets, by foreign entities </span><span>such as a Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund. For example, certain countries may require governmental approval prior to investment by </span><span>foreign persons or limit the amount of investment by foreign persons in a particular issuer. Certain Middle Eastern countries </span><span>may also limit investment by foreign persons to only a specific class of securities of an issuer that may have less </span><span>advantageous terms (including price) than securities of the issuer available for purchase by nationals of the relevant Middle </span><span>Eastern country.</span></div> <div><span>The manner in which foreign investors may invest in companies in certain Middle Eastern countries, as well as limitations on </span><span>those investments, may have an adverse impact on the operations of a Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund. For example, in certain of </span><span>these countries, a Fund or Underlying Fund may be required to invest initially through a local broker or other entity and then </span><span>have the shares that were purchased re-registered in the name of a Fund or Underlying Fund. Re-registration in some </span><span>instances may not be possible on a timely basis. This may result in a delay during which a Fund or Underlying Fund may be </span><span>denied certain of its rights as an investor, including rights as to dividends or to be made aware of certain corporate actions. </span><span>There also may be instances where a Fund or Underlying Fund places a purchase order but is subsequently informed, at the </span><span>time of re-registration, that the permissible allocation of the investment to foreign investors has already been filled and, </span><span>consequently, a Fund or Underlying Fund may not be able to invest in the relevant company.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Substantial limitations may exist in certain Middle Eastern countries with respect to a Fund’s or Underlying Fund's ability to </span><span>repatriate investment income or capital gains. A Fund or Underlying Fund could be adversely affected by delays in, or a </span><span>refusal to grant, any required governmental approval for repatriation of capital, as well as by the application to a Fund or </span><span>Underlying Fund of any restrictions on investment.</span></div> <div><span>Certain Middle Eastern countries may be heavily dependent upon international trade and, consequently, have been and may </span><span>continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values and </span><span>other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade. These countries also have been </span><span>and may continue to be adversely impacted by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade. In addition, </span><span>certain issuers located in Middle Eastern countries in which a Fund or Underlying Fund invests may operate in, or have </span><span>dealings with, countries subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations, </span><span>and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer may sustain damage </span><span>to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer which operates in, or has dealings with, such countries. A Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying </span><span>Fund, as an investor in such issuers, will be indirectly subject to those risks.</span></div> <div><span>Certain Middle Eastern countries have strained relations with other Middle Eastern countries due to territorial disputes, </span><span>historical animosities, international alliances, defense concerns or other reasons, which may adversely affect the economies </span><span>of these Middle Eastern countries. Certain Middle Eastern countries experience significant unemployment, as well as </span><span>widespread underemployment. There has also been a recent increase in recruitment efforts and an aggressive push for </span><span>territorial control by terrorist groups in the region, which has led to an outbreak of warfare and hostilities. Warfare in Syria has </span><span>spread to surrounding areas, including many portions of Iraq and Turkey. Such hostilities may continue into the future or may </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>17</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The Canadian and Mexican economies are </span><span>significantly affected by developments in the U.S. economy. Since the implementation of the North American Free Trade </span><span>Agreement (</span><span>“</span><span>NAFTA</span><span>”</span><span>) in 1994 among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, total merchandise trade among the three countries has </span><span>increased. However, political developments including the implementation of tariffs by the U.S., and the renegotiation of </span><span>NAFTA in the form of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (</span><span>“</span><span>USMCA</span><span>”</span><span>), which replaced NAFTA on July 1, 2020, could </span><span>negatively affect North America’s economic outlook and, as a result, the value of securities held by a Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying </span><span>Fund. Policy and legislative changes in one country may have a significant effect on North American markets generally, as </span><span>well as on the value of certain securities held by a Fund or Underlying Fund. </span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Basic Materials Industry. </span><span> </span><span>Issuers in the basic materials industry could be adversely affected by </span><span>commodity price volatility, exchange rate fluctuations, social and political unrest, import controls and increased competition. </span><span>Companies in the basic materials industry may be subject to swift fluctuations in supply and demand. Fluctuations may be </span><span>caused by events relating to political and economic developments, the environmental impact of basic materials operations, </span><span>and the success of exploration projects. Production of industrial materials often exceeds demand as a result of over-building </span><span>or economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns. Issuers in the basic materials industry are at risk for </span><span>environmental damage and product liability claims and may be adversely affected by depletion of resources, delays in </span><span>technical progress, labor relations, tax and government regulations related to changes to, among other things, energy and </span><span>environmental policies.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Capital Goods Industry. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the capital goods industry may be affected by fluctuations in </span><span>the business cycle and by other factors affecting manufacturing demands. Companies in the capital goods industry depend </span><span>heavily on corporate spending. Companies in the capital goods industry may perform well during times of economic </span><span>expansion, and as economic conditions worsen, the demand for capital goods may decrease due to weakening demand, </span><span>worsening business cash flows, tighter credit controls and deteriorating profitability. During times of economic volatility, </span><span>corporate spending may fall and adversely affect the capital goods industry. This industry may also be affected by changes in </span><span>interest rates, corporate tax rates and other government policies. Many capital goods are sold internationally and such </span><span>companies are subject to market conditions in other countries and regions.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Cyclical Industry. </span><span> </span><span>A Fund or Underlying Fund may invest in consumer cyclical companies, </span><span>which rely heavily on business cycles and economic conditions. Consumer cyclical companies include automotive </span><span>manufacturers, retail companies, and housing-related companies. The consumer cyclical industry can be significantly </span><span>affected by several factors, including, without limitation, the performance of domestic and international economies, </span><span>exchange rates, changing consumer tastes and trends, marketing campaigns, cyclical revenue generation, consumer </span><span>confidence, commodity price volatility, labor relations, interest rates, import and export controls, intense competition, </span><span>technological developments and government regulation.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Services Industry. </span><span> </span><span>The success of firms in the consumer services industry and certain </span><span>retailers (including food and beverage, general retailers, media, and travel and leisure) is tied closely to the performance of </span><span>the domestic and international economy, interest rates, exchange rates, competition and consumer confidence. The </span><span>consumer services industry depends heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending. Companies in the </span><span>consumer services industry may be subject to severe competition, which may also have an adverse impact on their </span><span>profitability. Companies in the consumer services industry are facing increased government and regulatory scrutiny and may </span><span>be subject to adverse government or regulatory action. Changes in demographics and consumer preferences may affect the </span><span>success of consumer service providers.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Staples Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the consumer staples sector may be adversely affected by </span><span>changes in the global economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, and production </span><span>spending. Companies in the consumer staples sector may also be affected by changes in global economic, environmental </span><span>and political events, economic conditions, the depletion of resources, and government regulation. For instance, government </span><span>regulations may affect the permissibility of using various food additives and production methods of companies that make </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>18</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

In addition, tobacco companies may be adversely affected by the </span><span>adoption of proposed legislation and/or by litigation. Companies in the consumer staples sector also may be subject to risks </span><span>pertaining to the supply of, demand for and prices of raw materials. The prices of raw materials fluctuate in response to a </span><span>number of factors, including, without limitation, changes in government agricultural support programs, exchange rates, </span><span>import and export controls, changes in international agricultural and trading policies, and seasonal and weather conditions. </span><span>Companies in the consumer staples sector may be subject to severe competition, which may also have an adverse impact on </span><span>their profitability.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Energy Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the energy sector are strongly affected by the levels and volatility of </span><span>global energy prices, energy supply and demand, government regulations and policies, energy production and conservation </span><span>efforts, technological change, development of alternative energy sources, and other factors that they cannot control. These </span><span>companies may also lack resources and have limited business lines. Energy companies may have relatively high levels of debt </span><span>and may be more likely to restructure their businesses if there are downturns in certain energy markets or in the global </span><span>economy. If an energy company in a Fund's or Underlying Fund's portfolio becomes distressed, a Fund or Underlying Fund </span><span>could lose all or a substantial portion of its investment.</span></div> <div><span>The energy sector is cyclical and is highly dependent on commodity prices; prices and supplies of energy may fluctuate </span><span>significantly over short and long periods of time due to, among other things, national and international political changes, </span><span>Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (</span><span>“</span><span>OPEC</span><span>”</span><span>) policies, changes in relationships among OPEC members and </span><span>between OPEC and oil-importing nations, the regulatory environment, taxation policies, the enactment or cessation of trade </span><span>sanctions, war or other geopolitical conflicts, and the economies of the key energy-consuming countries. Commodity prices </span><span>have recently been subject to increased volatility, which may negatively affect companies in which a Fund or Underlying Fund </span><span>invests. For example, in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak and disputes among oil-producing countries regarding </span><span>potential limits on the production of crude oil, the energy sector has experienced increased volatility. In particular, significant </span><span>market volatility occurred in the crude oil markets as well as the oil futures markets, which resulted in the market price of </span><span>certain crude oil futures contracts falling below zero for a period of time.</span></div> <div><span>Companies in the energy sector may be adversely affected by terrorism, war, cyber incidents, natural disasters or other </span><span>catastrophes. Companies in the energy sector are at risk of civil liability from accidents resulting in injury, loss of life or </span><span>property, pollution or other environmental damage claims. Disruptions in the oil industry or shifts in fuel consumption may </span><span>significantly impact companies in this sector. Significant oil and gas deposits are located in emerging markets countries </span><span>where corruption and security may raise significant risks, in addition to the other risks of investing in emerging markets. </span><span>Additionally, the Middle East, where many companies in the energy sector may operate, has historically and recently </span><span>experienced widespread social unrest.</span></div> <div><span>Companies in the energy sector may also be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates, interest rates, economic </span><span>conditions, tax treatment, government regulation and intervention, negative perception, efforts at energy conservation and </span><span>world events in the regions in which the companies operate (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and </span><span>property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest, </span><span>violence or labor unrest). Because a significant portion of revenues of companies in this sector is derived from a relatively </span><span>small number of customers that are largely composed of governmental entities and utilities, governmental budget </span><span>constraints may have a significant impact on the stock prices of companies in this sector. The energy sector is highly </span><span>regulated. Entities operating in the energy sector are subject to significant regulation of nearly every aspect of their </span><span>operations by governmental agencies. Such regulation can change rapidly or over time in both scope and intensity. Stricter </span><span>laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be enacted in the future which would likely increase compliance costs and </span><span>may materially adversely affect the financial performance of companies in the energy sector. Energy companies may have </span><span>relatively high levels of debt and may be more likely than companies in other sectors to restructure their businesses during </span><span>economic downturns or adversity in global energy markets.</span></div> <div><span>Russia's large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 has led to further disruptions and increased volatility in the </span><span>energy and commodity futures markets due to actual and potential disruptions in the supply and demand for certain </span><span>commodities, including oil and natural gas. The U.S. and certain European countries have announced bans or restrictions on </span><span>imports of hydrocarbon commodities from Russia. The effect of such bans and any similar restrictions by other countries, as </span><span>well as the extent, scope and duration of the conflict, resulting sanctions and associated market disruptions on the energy </span><span>sector, are impossible to predict and depend on a number of factors. The effect of these events or any related developments </span><span>could be significant and may have a severe adverse effect on the performance of a Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>19</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Financials Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the financials sector include regional and money center banks, </span><span>securities brokerage firms, asset management companies, savings banks and thrift institutions, specialty finance companies </span><span>(</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, credit card, mortgage providers), insurance and insurance brokerage firms, consumer finance firms, financial </span><span>conglomerates and foreign banking and financial companies.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Most financial companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which limits their activities and may affect their </span><span>ability to earn a profit from a given line of business. Government regulation may change frequently and may have significant </span><span>adverse consequences for companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by the regulation. Direct </span><span>governmental intervention in the operations of financial companies and financial markets may materially and adversely affect </span><span>the companies in which a Fund or Underlying Fund invests, including legislation in many countries that may increase </span><span>government regulation, repatriation and other intervention. The impact of governmental intervention and legislative changes </span><span>on any individual financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. The valuation of financial </span><span>companies has been and continues to be subject to unprecedented volatility and may be influenced by unpredictable factors, </span><span>including interest rate risk and sovereign debt default. Certain financial businesses are subject to intense competitive </span><span>pressures, including market share and price competition. Financial companies in foreign countries are subject to market </span><span>specific and general regulatory and interest rate concerns. In particular, government regulation in certain foreign countries </span><span>may include taxes and controls on interest rates, credit availability, minimum capital requirements, bans on short sales, limits </span><span>on prices and restrictions on currency transfers. In addition, companies in the financials sector may be the targets of hacking </span><span>and potential theft of proprietary or customer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse </span><span>effect on their businesses.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The profitability of banks, savings and loan associations and financial companies is largely dependent on the availability and </span><span>cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change; for instance, when interest rates go up, the </span><span>value of securities issued by many types of companies in the financials sector generally goes down. In other words, financial </span><span>companies may be adversely affected in certain market cycles, including, without limitation, during periods of rising interest </span><span>rates, which may restrict the availability and increase the cost of capital, and during periods of declining economic </span><span>conditions, which may cause, among other things, credit losses due to financial difficulties of borrowers.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>In addition, general economic conditions are important to the operations of these companies, and financial difficulties of </span><span>borrowers may have an adverse effect on the profitability of financial companies. Companies in the financials sector are </span><span>exposed directly to the credit risk of their borrowers and counterparties, who may be leveraged to an unknown degree, </span><span>including through swaps and other derivatives products, and who at times may be unable to meet their obligations to the </span><span>financial services companies. Financial services companies may have significant exposure to the same borrowers and </span><span>counterparties, with the result that a borrower’s or counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations to one company may affect </span><span>other companies with exposure to the same borrower or counterparty. This interconnectedness of risk, including cross-default</span><span> risk, may result in significant negative impacts to the financial condition and reputation of companies with direct </span><span>exposure to the defaulting counterparty as well as adverse cascading effects in the markets and the financials sector </span><span>generally. Financial companies can be highly dependent upon access to capital markets, and any impediments to such </span><span>access, such as adverse overall economic conditions or a negative perception in the capital markets of a financial company’s </span><span>financial condition or prospects, could adversely affect its business. Deterioration of credit markets can have an adverse </span><span>impact on a broad range of financial markets, causing certain financial companies to incur large losses. In these conditions, </span><span>companies in the financials sector may experience significant declines in the valuation of their assets, take actions to raise </span><span>capital and even cease operations. Some financial companies may also be required to accept or borrow significant amounts </span><span>of capital from government sources and may face future government-imposed restrictions on their businesses or increased </span><span>government intervention. In addition, there is no guarantee that governments will provide any such relief in the future. These </span><span>actions may cause the securities of many companies in the financials sector to decline in value.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Technology Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Technology companies are characterized by periodic new product introductions, </span><span>innovations and evolving industry standards, and, as a result, face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, </span><span>which may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Companies in the technology sector are often smaller and less </span><span>experienced companies and may be subject to greater risks than larger companies; these risks may be heightened for </span><span>technology companies in foreign markets. Technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial </span><span>resources or personnel. The products of technology companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological </span><span>developments and frequent new product introduction, changes in consumer and business purchasing patterns, </span><span>unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. In addition, a rising interest </span><span>rate environment tends to negatively affect companies in the technology sector because, in such an environment, those </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>20</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>companies with high market valuations may appear less attractive to investors, which may cause sharp decreases in the </span><span>companies’ market prices. Companies in the technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property </span><span>rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Companies in the </span><span>technology sector are facing increased government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or </span><span>regulatory action. The technology sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which </span><span>may be influenced or characterized by unpredictable factors. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network </span><span>security breaches, certain companies in the technology sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of </span><span>proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Telecommunications Sector. </span><span> </span><span>The telecommunications sector of a country’s economy is often </span><span>subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with governmental regulations, delays or failure to </span><span>receive required regulatory approvals, or the enactment of new regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of </span><span>telecommunications companies. Government actions around the world, specifically in the area of pre-marketing clearance of </span><span>products and prices, can be arbitrary and unpredictable. Companies in the telecommunications sector may experience </span><span>distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition, particularly in </span><span>developing new products and services using new technology. Technological innovations may make the products and services </span><span>of certain telecommunications companies obsolete. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network security </span><span>breaches, certain companies in the telecommunications sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of </span><span>proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Transportation Industry. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the transportation industry may be adversely affected by </span><span>changes in the economy, increases in fuel and operating costs, labor relations, technology developments, exchange rates, </span><span>insurance costs, industry competition and government regulation. Companies in the transportation industry are also affected </span><span>by severe weather events, mass casualty accidents or environmental catastrophes, acts of terrorism and other similar events </span><span>that target or damage transportation infrastructure or vessels, war or risk of war, widespread disruption of technology </span><span>systems and increasing equipment and operational costs. Such global or regional events and conditions may adversely affect </span><span>the operations, financial condition and liquidity of companies in the transportation industry and cause insurance premiums </span><span>to increase dramatically or result in insurance coverage becoming unavailable for certain business lines or assets. Securities </span><span>of companies in the transportation industry are generally cyclical and occasionally subject to sharp price movements.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Utilities Sector. </span><span> </span><span>The utilities sector may be adversely affected by changing commodity prices, </span><span>government regulation stipulating rates charged by utilities, increased tariffs, changes in tax laws, interest rate fluctuations </span><span>and changes in the cost of providing specific utility services. The utilities industry is also subject to potential terrorist attacks, </span><span>natural disasters and severe weather conditions, as well as regulatory and operational burdens associated with the operation </span><span>and maintenance of nuclear facilities. Government regulators monitor and control utility revenues and costs, and therefore </span><span>may limit utility profits. In certain countries, regulatory authorities may also restrict a company’s access to new markets, </span><span>thereby diminishing the company’s long-term prospects.</span></div> <div><span>There are substantial differences among the regulatory practices and policies of various jurisdictions, and any regulatory </span><span>agency may make major shifts in policy from time to time. There is no assurance that regulatory authorities will, in the future, </span><span>grant rate increases. Additionally, existing and possible future regulatory legislation may make it even more difficult for </span><span>utilities to obtain adequate relief. Certain of the issuers of securities held in a Fund's or Underlying Fund's portfolio may own </span><span>or operate nuclear generating facilities. Governmental authorities may from time to time review existing policies and impose </span><span>additional requirements governing the licensing, construction and operation of nuclear power plants. Prolonged changes in </span><span>climate conditions can also have a significant impact on both the revenues of an electric and gas utility as well as the </span><span>expenses of a utility, particularly a hydro-based electric utility.</span></div> <div><span>The rates that traditional regulated utility companies may charge their customers generally are subject to review and </span><span>limitation by governmental regulatory commissions. Rate changes may occur only after a prolonged approval period or may </span><span>not occur at all, which could adversely affect utility companies when costs are rising. The value of regulated utility debt </span><span>securities (and, to a lesser extent, equity securities) tends to have an inverse relationship to the movement of interest rates. </span><span>Certain utility companies have experienced full or partial deregulation in recent years. These utility companies are frequently </span><span>more similar to industrial companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been permitted by regulators to </span><span>diversify outside of their original geographic regions and their traditional lines of business. As a result, some companies may </span><span>be forced to defend their core business and may be less profitable. Deregulation may also permit a utility company to expand </span><span>outside of its traditional lines of business and engage in riskier ventures.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>21</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The Cboe LQD BuyWrite Index is designed to measure the performance of a strategy of holding the </span><span>iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (</span><span>“</span><span>LQD</span><span>”</span><span>) while writing (selling) one-month call options to generate </span><span>income.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Index Methodology</span><span>. The Underlying Index is a total return index that consists of a long LQD position and a short LQD call </span><span>option position that expires in the next month. The Underlying Index is rebalanced monthly, with the </span><span>“</span><span>roll date</span><span>”</span><span> on the </span><span>business day preceding the standard monthly listed option expiry date, typically the third Friday of each month. On the initial </span><span>roll date of the Underlying Index, the long LQD position and the short LQD call option position are entered simultaneously. </span><span>The expiring call option is </span><span>“</span><span>European-Style</span><span>”</span><span> and </span><span>“</span><span>PM-settled</span><span>”</span><span> on the roll date. </span><span>“</span><span>European-Style</span><span>”</span><span> means the options can only </span><span>be exercised on their expiration date. </span><span>“</span><span>PM-settled</span><span>”</span><span> means the options expire at the market close. The Underlying Index </span><span>methodology assumes that the expiring LQD call option is bought back at a mid-price calculated by the index provider </span><span>through a model utilizing implied volatility based on the listed American-style options at 4:00 p.m. ET on the roll date. The </span><span>strike price of the new LQD call option is the listed option strike closest to 100% of the closing value of LQD on the business </span><span>day prior to the roll date, and the option premium collected is the bid price of the option calculated by the index provider </span><span>through a model utilizing implied volatility based on the listed American-style options at 4:00 p.m. ET on the roll date. The </span><span>Underlying Index is a total return index that is rebalanced monthly. Dividends paid on LQD and the value of the option </span><span>premium deemed received from the sold call options are </span><span>“</span><span>re-invested</span><span>”</span><span> in the strategy.</span></div> <div><span>Investment Policies</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The Board has adopted as fundamental policies the following numbered investment policies, which cannot be changed </span><span>without the approval of the holders of a majority of the applicable Fund’s outstanding voting securities. A vote of a majority </span><span>of the outstanding voting securities of each Fund is defined in the Investment Company Act as the lesser of (i) 67% or more </span><span>of the voting securities present at a shareholder meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting </span><span>securities of each Fund are present or represented by proxy, or (ii) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of </span><span>each Fund. Each Fund has also adopted certain non-fundamental investment policies, including its investment objective. </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>24</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Non-fundamental investment policies may be changed by the Board without shareholder approval.

The SEC staff has taken the position that investment of 25% or </span><span>more of a fund’s total assets in one or more issuers conducting their principal activities in the same industry or group of </span><span>industries constitutes concentration. It is possible that interpretations of concentration could change in the future. The policy </span><span>in (1) above will be interpreted to refer to concentration as that term may be interpreted from time to time. The policy also </span><span>will be interpreted to permit investment without limit in the following: securities of the U.S. government and its agencies or </span><span>instrumentalities; securities of state, territory, possession or municipal governments and their authorities, agencies, </span><span>instrumentalities or political subdivisions; and repurchase agreements collateralized by any such obligations. Accordingly, </span><span>issuers of the foregoing securities will not be considered to be members of any industry. There also will be no limit on </span><span>investment in issuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or country. Finance companies will be considered to be in the </span><span>industries of their parents if their activities are primarily related to financing the activities of the parents. Each foreign </span><span>government will be considered to be a member of a separate industry. With respect to each Fund's industry classifications, </span><span>each Fund currently utilizes any one or more of the industry sub-classifications used by one or more widely recognized </span><span>market indexes or rating group indexes, and/or as defined by Fund management. The policy also will be interpreted to give </span><span>broad authority to each Fund as to how to classify issuers within or among industries.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to borrowing money set forth in (2) above, the Investment Company Act </span><span>permits each Fund to borrow money in amounts of up to one-third of the Fund's total assets from banks for any purpose, </span><span>and to borrow up to 5% of the Fund's total assets from banks or other lenders for temporary purposes. (The Fund's total </span><span>assets include the amounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks attendant to borrowing, the Investment Company Act requires </span><span>each Fund to maintain at all times an </span><span>“</span><span>asset coverage</span><span>”</span><span> of at least 300% of the amount of its borrowings. Asset coverage </span><span>means the ratio that the value of each Fund’s total assets (including amounts borrowed), minus liabilities other than </span><span>borrowings, bears to the aggregate amount of all borrowings. Borrowing money to increase portfolio holdings is known as </span><span>“</span><span>leveraging.</span><span>”</span><span> Certain trading practices and investments, such as reverse repurchase agreements, may be considered to be </span><span>borrowings or involve leverage and thus are subject to the Investment Company Act restrictions. In accordance with Rule 18f-4</span><span> under the Investment Company Act, when each Fund engages in reverse repurchase agreements and similar financing </span><span>transactions, the Fund may either (i) maintain asset coverage of at least 300% with respect to such transactions and any </span><span>other borrowings in the aggregate, or (ii) treat such transactions as </span><span>“</span><span>derivatives transactions</span><span>”</span><span> and comply with Rule 18f-4 </span><span>with respect to such transactions.

<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered to be borrowings under the policy. Practices and </span><span>investments that may involve leverage but are not considered to be borrowings are not subject to the policy.</span></div> <div><span>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to underwriting set forth in (5) above, the Investment Company Act does not </span><span>prohibit a fund from engaging in the underwriting business or from underwriting the securities of other issuers; in fact, in the </span><span>case of diversified funds, the Investment Company Act permits a fund to have underwriting commitments of up to 25% of its </span><span>assets under certain circumstances. Those circumstances currently are that the amount of a fund’s underwriting </span><span>commitments, when added to the value of a fund’s investments in issuers where a fund owns more than 10% of the </span><span>outstanding voting securities of those issuers, cannot exceed the 25% cap. A fund engaging in transactions involving the </span><span>acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act. Although it is </span><span>not believed that the application of the 1933 Act provisions described above would cause a fund to be engaged in the </span><span>business of underwriting, the policy in (5) above will be interpreted not to prevent a fund from engaging in transactions </span><span>involving the acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities, regardless of whether a fund may be considered to be an </span><span>underwriter under the 1933 Act or is otherwise engaged in the underwriting business to the extent permitted by applicable </span><span>law.</span></div> <div><span>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to lending set forth in (7) above, the Investment Company Act does not </span><span>prohibit each Fund from making loans (including lending its securities); however, SEC staff interpretations currently prohibit </span><span>funds from lending more than one-third of their total assets (including lending its securities), except through the purchase of </span><span>debt obligations or the use of repurchase agreements. In addition, collateral arrangements with respect to options, forward </span><span>currency and futures transactions and other derivative instruments (as applicable), as well as delays in the settlement of </span><span>securities transactions, will not be considered loans.</span></div> <div><span>Non-Fundamental Investment Policies</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy not to make short sales of securities or maintain a short position, except to </span><span>the extent permitted by each Fund's Prospectus and SAI, as amended from time to time, and applicable law.</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental investment policy in accordance with Rule 35d-1 under the Investment Company </span><span>Act to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the value of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for </span><span>investment purposes, in component securities in each Fund's Underlying Index. Each Fund also has adopted a policy to </span><span>provide its shareholders with at least 60 days’ prior written notice of any change in such policy. If, subsequent to an </span><span>investment, the 80% requirement is no longer met, a Fund’s future investments will be made in a manner that will bring the </span><span>Fund into compliance with this policy.</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy not to purchase securities of other investment companies, except to the </span><span>extent permitted by the Investment Company Act. As a matter of policy, however, each Fund will not purchase shares of any </span><span>registered open-end investment company or registered unit investment trust, in reliance on Section 12(d)(1)(F) or (G) (the </span><span>“</span><span>fund of funds</span><span>”</span><span> provisions) of the Investment Company Act, at any time each Fund has knowledge that its shares are </span><span>purchased by another investment company investor in reliance on the provisions of subparagraph (G) of Section 12(d)(1).</span></div> <div><span>Unless otherwise indicated, all limitations under each Fund's fundamental or non-fundamental investment policies apply </span><span>only at the time that a transaction is undertaken. Any change in the percentage of each Fund's assets invested in certain </span><span>securities or other instruments resulting from market fluctuations or other changes in each Fund’s total assets will not </span><span>require each Fund to dispose of an investment until BFA determines that it is practicable to sell or close out the investment </span><span>without undue market or tax consequences.</span></div> <div><span>Continuous Offering</span></div> <div><span>The method by which Creation Units are created and traded may raise certain issues under applicable securities laws. </span><span>Because new Creation Units are issued and sold by the Funds on an ongoing basis, at any point a </span><span>“</span><span>distribution,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term </span><span>is used in the 1933 Act, may occur. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, </span><span>depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render </span><span>them statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus delivery requirement and liability provisions of the 1933 Act.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>26</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>For example, a broker-dealer firm or its client may be deemed a statutory underwriter if it takes Creation Units after placing </span><span>an order with the Distributor, breaks them down into constituent shares and sells such shares directly to customers or if it </span><span>chooses to couple the creation of new shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand </span><span>for shares. A determination of whether one is an underwriter for purposes of the 1933 Act must take into account all of the </span><span>facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the broker-dealer or its client in the particular case and the examples </span><span>mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that could lead to a categorization as </span><span>an underwriter.</span></div> <div><span>Broker-dealer firms should also note that dealers who are not </span><span>“</span><span>underwriters</span><span>”</span><span> but are effecting transactions in shares, </span><span>whether or not participating in the distribution of shares, generally are required to deliver a prospectus. This is because the </span><span>prospectus delivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act is not available in respect of such transactions as a result of </span><span>Section 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that incur a prospectus delivery obligation with respect to shares of the Funds are </span><span>reminded that, pursuant to Rule 153 under the 1933 Act, a prospectus delivery obligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the 1933 </span><span>Act owed to an exchange member in connection with a sale on the Listing Exchange generally is satisfied by the fact that the </span><span>prospectus is available at the Listing Exchange upon request. The prospectus delivery mechanism provided in Rule 153 is </span><span>available only with respect to transactions on an exchange.</span></div> <div><span>Management</span></div> <div><span>Trustees and Officers. </span><span> </span><span>The Board has responsibility for the overall management and operations of the Funds, including </span><span>general supervision of the duties performed by BFA and other service providers. Each Trustee serves until he or she resigns, is </span><span>removed, dies, retires or becomes incapacitated. Each officer shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and </span><span>qualifies or until his or her death, resignation or removal. Trustees who are not </span><span>“</span><span>interested persons</span><span>”</span><span> (as defined in the 1940 </span><span>Act) of the Trust are referred to as independent trustees (</span><span>“</span><span>Independent Trustees</span><span>”</span><span>).</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The registered investment companies advised by BFA or its affiliates (the </span><span>“</span><span>BlackRock-advised Funds</span><span>”</span><span>) are organized into one </span><span>complex of open-end equity, multi-asset, index and money market funds and ETFs (the </span><span>“</span><span>BlackRock Multi-Asset Complex</span><span>”</span><span>), </span><span>one complex of closed-end funds and open-end non-index fixed-income funds (including ETFs) (the </span><span>“</span><span>BlackRock Fixed-Income</span><span> Complex</span><span>”</span><span>) and one complex of ETFs (</span><span>“</span><span>Exchange-Traded Fund Complex</span><span>”</span><span>) (each, a </span><span>“</span><span>BlackRock Fund Complex</span><span>”</span><span>). Each </span><span>Fund is included in the Exchange-Traded Fund Complex. Each Trustee also serves as a Director of iShares, Inc. and a Trustee </span><span>of iShares U.S. ETF Trust, and, as a result, oversees all of the funds within the Exchange-Traded Fund Complex, which </span><span>consists of 381 funds as of March 1, 2023. With the exception of Robert S. Kapito, Salim Ramji, Dominik Rohé and Aaron </span><span>Wasserman, the address of each Trustee and officer is c/o BlackRock, Inc., 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.

The Board has engaged BFA to manage the Funds on a </span><span>day-to-day basis. The Board is responsible for overseeing BFA and other service providers in the operations of the Funds in </span><span>accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, applicable provisions of state and other laws and the Trust’s charter. The </span><span>Board is currently composed of nine members, seven of whom are Independent Trustees. The Board currently conducts </span><span>regular in person meetings four times a year. In addition, the Board frequently holds special in person or telephonic meetings </span><span>or informal conference calls to discuss specific matters that may arise or require action between regular meetings. The </span><span>Independent Trustees meet regularly outside the presence of management, in executive session or with other service </span><span>providers to the Trust.</span></div> <div><span>The Board has appointed an Independent Trustee to serve in the role of Board Chair. The Board Chair’s role is to preside at all </span><span>meetings of the Board and to act as a liaison with service providers, officers, attorneys, and other Trustees generally between </span><span>meetings. The Board Chair may also perform such other functions as may be delegated by the Board from time to time. The </span><span>Board has established seven standing Committees: a Nominating and Governance Committee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c) </span><span>Committee, a Securities Lending Committee, a Risk Committee, an Equity Plus Committee and a Fixed Income Plus </span><span>Committee to assist the Board in the oversight and direction of the business and affairs of the Funds, and from time to time </span><span>the Board may establish ad hoc committees or informal working groups to review and address the policies and practices of </span><span>the Funds with respect to certain specified matters. The Chair of each standing Committee is an Independent Trustee. The </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>33</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>role of the Chair of each Committee is to preside at all meetings of the Committee and to act as a liaison with service </span><span>providers, officers, attorneys and other Trustees between meetings. Each standing Committee meets regularly to conduct the </span><span>oversight functions delegated to the Committee by the Board and reports its finding to the Board. The Board and each </span><span>standing Committee conduct annual assessments of their oversight function and structure. The Board has determined that </span><span>the Board’s leadership structure is appropriate because it allows the Board to exercise independent judgment over </span><span>management and it allocates areas of responsibility among committees of Independent Trustees and the full Board to </span><span>enhance effective oversight.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Day-to-day risk management with respect to the Funds is the responsibility of BFA or other service providers (depending on </span><span>the nature of the risk), subject to the supervision of BFA. Each Fund is subject to a number of risks, including investment, </span><span>compliance, operational, reputational, counterparty and valuation risks, among others. While there are a number of risk </span><span>management functions performed by BFA and other service providers, as applicable, it is not possible to identify and </span><span>eliminate all of the risks applicable to the Funds. The Trustees have an oversight role in this area, satisfying themselves that </span><span>risk management processes and controls are in place and operating effectively. Risk oversight forms part of the Board’s </span><span>general oversight of each Fund and is addressed as part of various Board and committee activities. In some cases, risk </span><span>management issues are specifically addressed in presentations and discussions. For example, BFA has an independent </span><span>dedicated Risk and Quantitative Analysis Group (</span><span>“</span><span>RQA</span><span>”</span><span>) that assists BFA in managing fiduciary and corporate risks, including </span><span>investment, operational, counterparty credit and enterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet with the Board to discuss their </span><span>analysis and methodologies, as well as specific risk topics such as operational and counterparty risks relating to the Funds. </span><span>The Board, directly or through a committee, also reviews reports from, among others, management and the independent </span><span>registered public accounting firm for the Trust, as appropriate, regarding risks faced by each Fund and management’s risk </span><span>functions. The Board has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer who oversees the implementation and testing of the Trust's </span><span>compliance program, including assessments by independent third parties, and reports to the Board regarding compliance </span><span>matters for the Trust and its principal service providers. In testing and maintaining the compliance program, the Chief </span><span>Compliance Officer (and his or her delegates) assesses key compliance risks affecting each Fund, and addresses them in </span><span>periodic reports to the Board. In addition, the Audit Committee meets with both the Funds' independent registered public </span><span>accounting firm and BFA’s internal audit group to review risk controls in place that support each Fund as well as test results. </span><span>Board oversight of risk is also performed as needed between meetings through communications between BFA and the Board. </span><span>The Independent Trustees have engaged independent legal counsel to assist them in performing their oversight </span><span>responsibilities. From time to time, the Board may modify the manner in which it conducts risk oversight. The Board’s </span><span>oversight role does not make it a guarantor of the Funds' investment performance or other activities.</span></div> <div><span>Committees of the Board of Trustees.</span><span>  </span><span>The members of the Audit Committee are Richard L. Fagnani (Chair), Cecilia H. </span><span>Herbert and Madhav V. Rajan, each of whom is an Independent Trustee. The purposes of the Audit Committee are to assist </span><span>the Board (i) in its oversight of the Trust's accounting and financial reporting principles and policies and related controls and </span><span>procedures maintained by or on behalf of the Trust; (ii) in its oversight of the Trust's financial statements and the </span><span>independent audit thereof; (iii) in selecting, evaluating and, where deemed appropriate, replacing the independent </span><span>accountants (or nominating the independent accountants to be proposed for shareholder approval in any proxy statement); </span><span>(iv) in evaluating the independence of the independent accountants; (v) in complying with legal and regulatory requirements </span><span>that relate to the Trust's accounting and financial reporting, internal controls, compliance controls and independent audits; </span><span>and (vi) to assume such other responsibilities as may be delegated by the Board.

These businesses and interests include potential multiple advisory, financial and </span><span>other relationships with, or interests in, companies and interests in securities or other instruments that may be purchased or </span><span>sold by a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock has proprietary interests in, and may manage or advise with respect to, accounts or funds (including separate </span><span>accounts and other funds and collective investment vehicles) that have investment objectives similar to those of a Fund </span><span>and/or that engage in transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and instruments as the Funds. BlackRock is </span><span>also a major participant in the global currency, equities, swap and fixed income markets, in each case, for the accounts of </span><span>clients and, in some cases, on a proprietary basis. As such, BlackRock is or may be actively engaged in transactions in the </span><span>same securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests. Such activities could affect the prices and availability of </span><span>the securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests, which could have an adverse impact on a Fund's </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>41</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>performance. Such transactions, particularly in respect of most proprietary accounts or client accounts, will be executed </span><span>independently of a Fund's transactions and thus at prices or rates that may be more or less favorable than those obtained by </span><span>the Funds.</span></div> <div><span>When BlackRock seeks to purchase or sell the same assets for managed accounts, including a Fund, the assets actually </span><span>purchased or sold may be allocated among the accounts on a basis determined in its good faith discretion to be equitable. In </span><span>some cases, this system may adversely affect the size or price of the assets purchased or sold for a Fund. In addition, </span><span>transactions in investments by one or more other accounts managed by BlackRock may have the effect of diluting or </span><span>otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of a Fund, particularly, but not limited to, with respect to </span><span>small-capitalization, emerging market or less liquid strategies. This may occur with respect to BlackRock-advised accounts </span><span>when investment decisions regarding a Fund are based on research or other information that is also used to support </span><span>decisions for other accounts. When BlackRock implements a portfolio decision or strategy on behalf of another account </span><span>ahead of, or contemporaneously with, similar decisions or strategies for a Fund, market impact, liquidity constraints, or other </span><span>factors could result in the Fund receiving less favorable trading results and the costs of implementing such decisions or </span><span>strategies could be increased or the Fund could otherwise be disadvantaged. BlackRock may, in certain cases, elect to </span><span>implement internal policies and procedures designed to limit such consequences, which may cause a Fund to be unable to </span><span>engage in certain activities, including purchasing or disposing of securities, when it might otherwise be desirable for it to do </span><span>so.</span></div> <div><span>Conflicts may also arise because portfolio decisions regarding a Fund may benefit other accounts managed by BlackRock. For </span><span>example, the sale of a long position or establishment of a short position by a Fund may impair the price of the same security </span><span>sold short by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its other accounts or funds, and the purchase of a security or covering of a </span><span>short position in a security by a Fund may increase the price of the same security held by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or </span><span>its other accounts or funds. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, certain Funds may invest their assets in </span><span>other funds advised by BlackRock, including funds that are managed by one or more of the same portfolio managers, which </span><span>could result in conflicts of interest relating to asset allocation, timing of Fund purchases and sales, and increased </span><span>remuneration and profitability for BlackRock, and/or its personnel, including portfolio managers.</span></div> <div><span>In certain circumstances, BlackRock, on behalf of the Funds, may seek to buy from or sell securities to another fund or </span><span>account advised by BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is not required to) effect purchases and sales between BlackRock clients </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>cross trades</span><span>”</span><span>), including the Funds, if BlackRock believes such transactions are appropriate based on each party's </span><span>investment objectives and guidelines, subject to applicable law and regulation. There may be potential conflicts of interest or </span><span>regulatory issues relating to these transactions which could limit BlackRock’s decision to engage in these transactions for the </span><span>Funds. BlackRock may have a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities to the parties in such </span><span>transactions. On any occasion when a Fund participates in a cross trade, BlackRock will comply with procedures adopted </span><span>under applicable rules and SEC guidance.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock and its clients may pursue or enforce rights with respect to an issuer in which a Fund has invested, and those </span><span>activities may have an adverse effect on the Fund. As a result, prices, availability, liquidity and terms of a Fund's investments </span><span>may be negatively impacted by the activities of BlackRock or its clients, and transactions for the Fund may be impaired or </span><span>effected at prices or terms that may be less favorable than would otherwise have been the case.</span></div> <div><span>The results of a Fund’s investment activities may differ significantly from the results achieved by BlackRock for its proprietary </span><span>accounts or other accounts (including investment companies or collective investment vehicles) which it manages or advises. </span><span>It is possible that one or more accounts managed or advised by BlackRock and such other accounts will achieve investment </span><span>results that are substantially more or less favorable than the results achieved by a Fund. Moreover, it is possible that a Fund </span><span>will sustain losses during periods in which one or more proprietary or other accounts managed or advised by BlackRock </span><span>achieve significant profits. The opposite result is also possible.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>From time to time, a Fund may be restricted from purchasing or selling securities, or from engaging in other investment </span><span>activities because of regulatory, legal or contractual requirements applicable to BlackRock or other accounts managed or </span><span>advised by BlackRock, and/or the internal policies of BlackRock designed to comply with such requirements. As a result, </span><span>there may be periods, for example, when BlackRock will not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions in certain </span><span>securities or instruments with respect to which BlackRock is performing services or when position limits have been reached. </span><span>For example, the investment activities of BlackRock for its proprietary accounts and accounts under its management may </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>42</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>limit the investment opportunities for a Fund in certain emerging and other markets in which limitations are imposed upon </span><span>the amount of investment, in the aggregate or in individual issuers, by affiliated foreign investors.</span></div> <div><span>In connection with its management of a Fund, BlackRock may have access to certain fundamental analysis and proprietary </span><span>technical models developed by BlackRock. BlackRock will not be under any obligation, however, to effect transactions on </span><span>behalf of a Fund in accordance with such analysis and models. In addition, BlackRock will not have any obligation to make </span><span>available any information regarding its proprietary activities or strategies, or the activities or strategies used for other </span><span>accounts managed by them, for the benefit of the management of a Fund and it is not anticipated that BlackRock will have </span><span>access to such information for the purpose of managing the Fund. The proprietary activities or portfolio strategies of </span><span>BlackRock, or the activities or strategies used for accounts managed by BlackRock or other client accounts could conflict </span><span>with the transactions and strategies employed by BlackRock in managing a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>The Funds may be included in investment models developed by BlackRock for use by clients and financial advisors. To the </span><span>extent clients invest in these investment models and increase the assets under management of the Funds, the investment </span><span>management fee amounts paid by the Funds to BlackRock may also increase. The price, availability and liquidity of a Fund </span><span>may be impacted by purchases and sales of the Fund by model-driven investment portfolios, as well as by BlackRock itself </span><span>and by its advisory clients.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, certain principals and certain employees of a Fund’s investment adviser are also principals or employees of other </span><span>business units or entities within BlackRock. As a result, these principals and employees may have obligations to such other </span><span>business units or entities or their clients and such obligations to other business units or entities or their clients may be a </span><span>consideration of which investors in a Fund should be aware.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may enter into transactions and invest in securities, instruments and currencies on behalf of a Fund in which </span><span>clients of BlackRock or, to the extent permitted by the SEC and applicable law, BlackRock serves as the counterparty, principal </span><span>or issuer. In such cases, such party's interests in the transaction will be adverse to the interests of the Fund, and such party </span><span>may have no incentive to assure that the Fund obtains the best possible prices or terms in connection with the transactions. </span><span>In addition, the purchase, holding and sale of such investments by a Fund may enhance the profitability of BlackRock.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may also create, write or issue derivatives for clients based on the underlying securities, currencies or instruments </span><span>in which a Fund may invest or on the performance of the Fund. An entity in which BlackRock has a significant minority </span><span>interest will create, write or issue options which may be based on the performance of certain Funds. BlackRock has the right </span><span>to receive a portion of the gross revenue earned by such entity. Options writing by such entity on a Fund could potentially </span><span>lead to increased purchase activity with respect to the Fund and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock has entered into an arrangement with Markit Indices Limited, the index provider for underlying fixed-income </span><span>indexes used by certain iShares funds, related to derivative fixed-income products that are based on such iShares funds. </span><span>BlackRock may receive certain payments for licensing intellectual property belonging to BlackRock and for facilitating the </span><span>provision of data in connection with such derivative products, which may include payments based on the trading volumes of, </span><span>or revenues generated by, the derivative products. However, BlackRock will not receive any such payments on those derivative </span><span>products utilized by the Funds or other BlackRock funds or accounts. Other funds and accounts managed by BlackRock may </span><span>from time to time transact in such derivative products, which could contribute to the viability or success of such derivative </span><span>products by making them more appealing to funds and accounts managed by third parties, and in turn lead to increased </span><span>payments to BlackRock. Trading activity in such derivative products could also potentially lead to increased purchase activity </span><span>with respect to these iShares funds and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</span></div> <div><span>A Fund may, subject to applicable law, purchase investments that are the subject of an underwriting or other distribution by </span><span>BlackRock and may also enter into transactions with other clients of BlackRock where such other clients have interests </span><span>adverse to those of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>At times, these activities may cause business units or entities within BlackRock to give advice to clients that may cause these </span><span>clients to take actions adverse to the interests of a Fund. To the extent such transactions are permitted, a Fund will deal with </span><span>BlackRock on an arm’s-length basis.</span></div> <div><span>To the extent authorized by applicable law, BlackRock may act as broker, dealer, agent, lender or adviser or in other </span><span>commercial capacities for a Fund. It is anticipated that the commissions, mark-ups, mark-downs, financial advisory fees, </span><span>underwriting and placement fees, sales fees, financing and commitment fees, brokerage fees, other fees, compensation or </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>43</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>profits, rates, terms and conditions charged by BlackRock will be in its view commercially reasonable, although BlackRock, </span><span>including its sales personnel, will have an interest in obtaining fees and other amounts that are favorable to BlackRock and </span><span>such sales personnel, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. Index based funds may use an index provider that is </span><span>affiliated with another service provider of a Fund or BlackRock that acts as a broker, dealer, agent, lender or in other </span><span>commercial capacities for a Fund or BlackRock.</span></div> <div><span>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock (and its personnel and other distributors) will be entitled to retain fees and other </span><span>amounts that they receive in connection with their service to the Funds as broker, dealer, agent, lender, adviser or in other </span><span>commercial capacities. No accounting to the Funds or their shareholders will be required, and no fees or other compensation </span><span>payable by the Funds or their shareholders will be reduced by reason of receipt by BlackRock of any such fees or other </span><span>amounts.</span></div> <div><span>When BlackRock acts as broker, dealer, agent, adviser or in other commercial capacities in relation to the Funds, BlackRock </span><span>may take commercial steps in its own interests, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. A Fund will be required to </span><span>establish business relationships with its counterparties based on the Fund's own credit standing. BlackRock will not have any </span><span>obligation to allow its credit to be used in connection with a Fund's establishment of its business relationships, nor is it </span><span>expected that the Fund's counterparties will rely on the credit of BlackRock in evaluating the Fund's creditworthiness.</span></div> <div><span>BTC, an affiliate of BFA pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, acts as securities lending agent to, and receives a share of securities </span><span>lending revenues from, the Funds. BlackRock will also receive compensation for managing the reinvestment of the cash </span><span>collateral from securities lending. There are potential conflicts of interests in managing a securities lending program, </span><span>including but not limited to: (i) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to increase or decrease the </span><span>amount of securities on loan or to lend particular securities in order to generate additional risk-adjusted revenue for </span><span>BlackRock and its affiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to allocate loans to clients </span><span>that would provide more revenue to BlackRock. As described further below, BlackRock seeks to mitigate this conflict by </span><span>providing its securities lending clients with equal lending opportunities over time in order to approximate </span><span>pro rata </span><span>allocation. </span></div> <div><span>As part of its securities lending program, BlackRock indemnifies the Funds and certain other clients and/or funds against a </span><span>shortfall in collateral in the event of borrower default. On a regular basis, BlackRock calculates the potential dollar exposure of </span><span>collateral shortfall resulting from a borrower default (</span><span>“</span><span>shortfall risk</span><span>”</span><span>) in the securities lending program. BlackRock establishes </span><span>program-wide borrower limits (</span><span>“</span><span>credit limits</span><span>”</span><span>) to actively manage borrower-specific credit exposure. BlackRock oversees the </span><span>risk model that calculates projected collateral shortfall values using loan-level factors such as loan and collateral type and </span><span>market value as well as specific borrower credit characteristics. When necessary, BlackRock may adjust securities lending </span><span>program attributes by restricting eligible collateral or reducing borrower credit limits. As a result, the management of </span><span>program-wide exposure as well as BlackRock-specific indemnification exposure may affect the amount of securities lending </span><span>activity BlackRock may conduct at any given point in time by reducing the volume of lending opportunities for certain loans </span><span>(including by asset type, collateral type and/or revenue profile).</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock uses a predetermined systematic process in order to approximate </span><span>pro rata</span><span> allocation over time. In order to allocate </span><span>a loan to a portfolio: (i) BlackRock as a whole must have sufficient lending capacity pursuant to the various program limits </span><span>(</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> indemnification exposure limit and borrower credit limits); (ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset at the time a </span><span>loan opportunity arrives; and (iii) the lending portfolio must also have enough inventory, either on its own or when </span><span>aggregated with other portfolios into one single market delivery, to satisfy the loan request. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to </span><span>provide equal lending opportunities for all portfolios, independent of whether BlackRock indemnifies the portfolio. Equal </span><span>opportunities for lending portfolios does not guarantee equal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-term outcomes for </span><span>individual clients may vary due to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on different securities, and the overall limits imposed by </span><span>the firm.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may decline to make a securities loan on behalf of a Fund, discontinue lending on behalf of a Fund or terminate a </span><span>securities loan on behalf of a Fund for any reason, including but not limited to regulatory requirements and/or market rules, </span><span>liquidity considerations, or credit considerations, which may impact Funds by reducing or eliminating the volume of lending </span><span>opportunities for certain types of loans, loans in particular markets, loans of particular securities or types of securities, or for </span><span>loans overall.</span></div> <div><span>Purchases and sales of securities and other assets for a Fund may be bunched or aggregated with orders for other BlackRock </span><span>client accounts, including with accounts that pay different transaction costs solely due to the fact that they have different </span><span>research payment arrangements. BlackRock, however, is not required to bunch or aggregate orders if portfolio management </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>44</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>decisions for different accounts are made separately, or if they determine that bunching or aggregating is not practicable or </span><span>required, or in cases involving client direction.</span></div> <div><span>Prevailing trading activity frequently may make impossible the receipt of the same price or execution on the entire volume of </span><span>securities purchased or sold. When this occurs, the various prices may be averaged, and the Funds will be charged or </span><span>credited with the average price. Thus, the effect of the aggregation may operate on some occasions to the disadvantage of </span><span>the Funds. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Funds will not be charged the same commission or commission </span><span>equivalent rates in connection with a bunched or aggregated order.</span></div> <div><span>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock may select brokers that furnish BlackRock, the Funds, other BlackRock client accounts or </span><span>personnel, directly or through correspondent relationships, with research or other appropriate services which provide, in </span><span>BlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to BlackRock in the investment decision-making process (including with respect to </span><span>futures, fixed-price offerings and OTC transactions). Such research or other services may include, to the extent permitted by </span><span>law, research reports on companies, industries and securities; economic and financial data; financial publications; proxy </span><span>analysis; trade industry seminars; computer data bases; research-oriented software and other services and products. </span><span>Research or other services obtained in this manner may be used in servicing any or all of the Funds and other BlackRock </span><span>client accounts, including in connection with BlackRock client accounts other than those that pay commissions to the broker </span><span>relating to the research or other service arrangements. Such products and services may disproportionately benefit other </span><span>BlackRock client accounts relative to the Funds based on the amount of brokerage commissions paid by the Funds and such </span><span>other BlackRock client accounts. For example, research or other services that are paid for through one client's commissions </span><span>may not be used in managing that client's account. In addition, other BlackRock client accounts may receive the benefit, </span><span>including disproportionate benefits, of economies of scale or price discounts in connection with products and services that </span><span>may be provided to the Funds and to such other BlackRock client accounts. To the extent that BlackRock uses soft dollars, it </span><span>will not have to pay for those products and services itself.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock does not currently enter into arrangements to use the Funds' assets for, or participate in, soft dollars, although </span><span>BlackRock may receive research that is bundled with the trade execution, clearing, and/or settlement services provided by a </span><span>particular broker-dealer. To the extent that BlackRock receives research on this basis, many of the same conflicts related to </span><span>traditional soft dollars may exist. For example, the research effectively will be paid by client commissions that also will be </span><span>used to pay for the execution, clearing, and settlement services provided by the broker-dealer and will not be paid by </span><span>BlackRock. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may endeavor to execute trades through brokers who, pursuant to </span><span>such arrangements, provide research or other services in order to ensure the continued receipt of research or other services </span><span>BlackRock believes are useful in its investment decision-making process. BlackRock may from time to time choose not to </span><span>engage in the above described arrangements to varying degrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may also </span><span>enter into commission sharing arrangements under which BlackRock may execute transactions through a broker-dealer, and </span><span>request that the broker-dealer allocate a portion of the commissions or commission credits to another firm that provides </span><span>research to BlackRock. To the extent that BlackRock engages in commission sharing arrangements, many of the same </span><span>conflicts related to traditional soft dollars may exist.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may utilize certain electronic crossing networks (</span><span>“</span><span>ECNs</span><span>”</span><span>) (including, without limitation, ECNs in which BlackRock </span><span>has an investment or other interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law) in executing client</span><span> </span><span>securities transactions for </span><span>certain types of securities. These ECNs may charge fees for their services, including access fees and transaction fees. The </span><span>transaction fees, which are similar to commissions or markups/markdowns, will generally be charged to clients and, like </span><span>commissions and markups/markdowns, would generally be included in the cost of the securities purchased. Access fees </span><span>may be paid by BlackRock even though incurred in connection with executing transactions on behalf of clients, including the </span><span>Funds. In certain circumstances, ECNs may offer volume discounts that will reduce the access fees typically paid by </span><span>BlackRock. BlackRock will only utilize ECNs consistent with its obligation to seek to obtain best execution in client </span><span>transactions.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock owns a minority interest in, and is a member of, Members Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>MEMX</span><span>”</span><span>), a newly created U.S. stock </span><span>exchange. Transactions for a Fund may be executed on MEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue </span><span>for execution of orders placed by BlackRock traders on behalf of such Funds. In addition, transactions in Fund shares may be </span><span>executed on MEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue for the execution of such orders.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock has adopted policies and procedures designed to prevent conflicts of interest from influencing proxy voting </span><span>decisions that it makes on behalf of advisory clients, including the Funds, and to help ensure that such decisions are made in </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>45</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>accordance with BlackRock's fiduciary obligations to its clients. Nevertheless, notwithstanding such proxy voting policies and </span><span>procedures, actual proxy voting decisions of BlackRock may have the effect of favoring the interests of other clients or </span><span>businesses of other divisions or units of BlackRock, provided that BlackRock believes such voting decisions to be in </span><span>accordance with its fiduciary obligations. For a more detailed discussion of these policies and procedures, see the </span><span>Proxy </span><span>Voting Policy</span><span> section of this SAI.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>It is also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients (including other funds and separately </span><span>managed accounts) may, subject to compliance with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of a Fund. Increasing a Fund’s </span><span>assets may enhance liquidity, investment flexibility and diversification and may contribute to economies of scale that tend to </span><span>reduce the Fund's expense ratio. BlackRock reserves the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to sell into the </span><span>market or redeem in Creation Units through an Authorized Participant at any time some or all of the shares of a Fund </span><span>acquired for its own accounts or the account of a BlackRock advisory client. A large sale or redemption of shares of a Fund by </span><span>BlackRock itself or a BlackRock advisory client could significantly reduce the asset size of the Fund, which might have an </span><span>adverse effect on the Fund's liquidity, investment flexibility, portfolio diversification, expense ratio or ability to comply with the </span><span>listing requirements for the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>It is possible that a Fund may invest in securities of, or engage in transactions with, companies in which BlackRock has </span><span>significant debt or equity investments or other interests. A Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by </span><span>entities for which BlackRock provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the </span><span>sale of such issuances. In making investment decisions for a Fund, BlackRock is not permitted to obtain or use material non-public</span><span> information acquired by any unit of BlackRock in the course of these activities. In addition, from time to time, the </span><span>activities of BlackRock may limit a Fund's flexibility in purchases and sales of securities. As indicated below, BlackRock may </span><span>engage in transactions with companies in which BlackRock-advised funds or other clients of BlackRock have an investment.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock, its personnel and other financial service providers may have interests in promoting sales of the Funds. With </span><span>respect to BlackRock and its personnel, the remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of the Funds or </span><span>other products may be greater than remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of certain funds or other </span><span>products that might be provided or offered. BlackRock and its sales personnel may directly or indirectly receive a portion of </span><span>the fees and commissions charged to the Funds or their shareholders. BlackRock and its advisory or other personnel may </span><span>also benefit from increased amounts of assets under management. Fees and commissions may also be higher than for other </span><span>products or services, and the remuneration and profitability to BlackRock and such personnel resulting from transactions on </span><span>behalf of or management of the Funds may be greater than the remuneration and profitability resulting from other funds or </span><span>products.</span></div> <div><span>Third parties, including service providers to BlackRock or a Fund, may sponsor events (including, but not limited to, </span><span>marketing and promotional activities and presentations, educational training programs and conferences) for registered </span><span>representatives, other professionals and individual investors. There is a potential conflict of interest as such sponsorships </span><span>may defray the costs of such activities to BlackRock, and may provide an incentive to BlackRock to retain such third parties to </span><span>provide services to a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may provide valuation assistance to certain clients with respect to certain securities or other investments and the </span><span>valuation recommendations made for such clients' accounts may differ from the valuations for the same securities or </span><span>investments assigned by a Fund's pricing vendors, especially if such valuations are based on broker-dealer quotes or other </span><span>data sources unavailable to the Fund's pricing vendors. While BlackRock will generally communicate its valuation information </span><span>or determinations to a Fund's pricing vendors and/or fund accountants, there may be instances where the Fund's pricing </span><span>vendors or fund accountants assign a different valuation to a security or other investment than the valuation for such </span><span>security or investment determined or recommended by BlackRock.</span></div> <div><span>As disclosed in more detail in the </span><span>Determination of Net Asset Value</span><span> section in this SAI, when market quotations are not </span><span>readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, each Fund’s investments are valued at fair value by BFA. BFA has been </span><span>designated as each Fund’s valuation designee pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act and acts through </span><span>BFA’s Rule 2a-5 Committee (the </span><span>“</span><span>2a-5 Committee</span><span>”</span><span>), with assistance from other BFA pricing committees and in accordance </span><span>with BFA’s policies and procedures (the </span><span>“</span><span>Valuation Procedures</span><span>”</span><span>). When determining a </span><span>“</span><span>fair value price,</span><span>”</span><span> the 2a-5 Committee </span><span>seeks to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or liability in </span><span>an arm’s-length transaction. The price generally may not be determined based on what a Fund might reasonably expect to </span><span>receive for selling an asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. While fair value </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>46</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>determinations will be based upon all available factors that BFA deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be </span><span>based on analytical values determined by BFA using proprietary or third-party valuation models, fair value represents only a </span><span>good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in </span><span>retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair </span><span>values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a </span><span>holding or holdings are valued by the 2a-5 Committee at fair value, may have the effect of diluting or increasing the economic </span><span>interest of existing shareholders and may affect the amount of revenue received by BFA with respect to services for which it </span><span>receives an asset-based fee.</span></div> <div><span>To the extent permitted by applicable law, a Fund may invest all or some of its short-term cash investments in any money </span><span>market fund or similarly-managed private fund advised or managed by BlackRock. In connection with any such investments, </span><span>a Fund, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, may pay its share of expenses of a money market fund or other similarly-managed</span><span> private fund in which it invests, which may result in a Fund bearing some additional expenses.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock and its directors, officers and employees, may buy and sell securities or other investments for their own accounts </span><span>and may have conflicts of interest with respect to investments made on behalf of a Fund. As a result of differing trading and </span><span>investment strategies or constraints, positions may be taken by directors, officers and employees that are the same, different </span><span>from or made at different times than positions taken for a Fund. To lessen the possibility that a Fund will be adversely </span><span>affected by this personal trading, each Fund, BFA and BlackRock have each adopted a code of ethics in compliance with </span><span>Section 17(j) of the 1940 Act that restricts securities trading in the personal accounts of investment professionals and others </span><span>who normally come into possession of information regarding a Fund's portfolio transactions. Each code of ethics is available </span><span>by contacting BlackRock at the telephone number on the back cover of each Fund’s Prospectus or by accessing the EDGAR </span><span>Database on the SEC's Internet site at http://www.sec.gov, and copies may be obtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by </span><span>e-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock will not purchase securities or other property from, or sell securities or other property to, a Fund, except that a </span><span>Fund may in accordance with rules or guidance adopted under the 1940 Act engage in transactions with another Fund or </span><span>accounts that are affiliated with a Fund as a result of common officers, directors, or investment advisers or pursuant to </span><span>exemptive orders granted to the Funds and/or BlackRock by the SEC. These transactions would be effected in circumstances </span><span>in which BlackRock determined that it would be appropriate for a Fund to purchase and another client of BlackRock to sell, or </span><span>a Fund to sell and another client of BlackRock to purchase, the same security or instrument on the same day. From time to </span><span>time, the activities of a Fund may be restricted because of regulatory requirements applicable to BlackRock and/or </span><span>BlackRock's internal policies designed to comply with, limit the applicability of, or otherwise relate to such requirements. A </span><span>client not advised by BlackRock would not be subject to some of those considerations. There may be periods when </span><span>BlackRock may not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions, or may otherwise restrict or limit its advice in certain </span><span>securities or instruments issued by or related to companies for which BlackRock is performing advisory or other services or </span><span>has proprietary positions. For example, when BlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or risk management services for a </span><span>company, BlackRock may be prohibited from or limited in purchasing or selling securities of that company on behalf of a </span><span>Fund, particularly where such services result in BlackRock obtaining material non-public information about the company </span><span>(</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, in connection with participation in a creditors’ committee). Similar situations could arise if personnel of BlackRock serve </span><span>as directors of companies the securities of which a Fund wishes to purchase or sell. However, if permitted by applicable law, </span><span>and where consistent with BlackRock’s policies and procedures (including the necessary implementation of appropriate </span><span>information barriers), the Funds may purchase securities or instruments that are issued by such companies, are the subject </span><span>of an advisory or risk management assignment by BlackRock, or where personnel of BlackRock are directors or officers of the </span><span>issuer.</span></div> <div><span>The investment activities of BlackRock for its proprietary accounts and for client accounts may also limit the investment </span><span>strategies and rights of the Funds. For example, in certain circumstances where the Funds invest in securities issued by </span><span>companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or international markets, or are subject to </span><span>corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or invest in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits </span><span>on the aggregate amount invested by BlackRock for their proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Funds) </span><span>that may not be exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if exceeded, may cause </span><span>BlackRock, the Funds or other client accounts to suffer disadvantages or business restrictions.</span></div> <div><span>If certain aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either through the actions of BlackRock or a Fund or as a result of </span><span>third-party transactions, the ability of BlackRock, on behalf of clients (including the Funds), to purchase or dispose of </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>47</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. As </span><span>a result, BlackRock, on behalf of its clients (including the Funds), may limit purchases, sell existing investments, or otherwise </span><span>restrict, forgo or limit the exercise of rights (including transferring, outsourcing or limiting voting rights or forgoing the right </span><span>to receive dividends) when BlackRock, in its sole discretion, deems it appropriate in light of potential regulatory or other </span><span>restrictions on ownership or other consequences resulting from reaching investment thresholds.</span></div> <div><span>In those circumstances where ownership thresholds or limitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks to allocate limited </span><span>investment opportunities equitably among clients (including the Funds), taking into consideration benchmark weight and </span><span>investment strategy. BlackRock has adopted certain controls designed to prevent the occurrence of a breach of any </span><span>applicable ownership threshold or limits, including, for example, when ownership in certain securities nears an applicable </span><span>threshold, BlackRock may remove such securities from the list of Deposit Securities to be delivered to the Fund in connection </span><span>with purchases of Creation Units of such Fund and may limit purchases in such securities to the issuer's weighting in the </span><span>applicable benchmark used by BlackRock to manage such Fund. If client (including Fund) holdings of an issuer exceed an </span><span>applicable threshold and BlackRock is unable to obtain relief to enable the continued holding of such investments, it may be </span><span>necessary to sell down these positions to meet the applicable limitations. In these cases, benchmark overweight positions </span><span>will be sold prior to benchmark positions being reduced to meet applicable limitations.</span></div> <div><span>In addition to the foregoing, other ownership thresholds may trigger reporting requirements to governmental and regulatory </span><span>authorities, and such reports may entail the disclosure of the identity of a client or BlackRock’s intended strategy with respect </span><span>to such security or asset.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may not serve as an Authorized Participant in the creation and redemption of iShares ETFs.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may maintain securities indices. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, the Funds may seek to license and use </span><span>such indices as part of their investment strategy. Index based funds that seek to track the performance of securities indices </span><span>also may use the name of the index or index provider in the fund name. Index providers, including BlackRock (to the extent </span><span>permitted by applicable law), may be paid licensing fees for use of their index or index name. BlackRock may benefit from the </span><span>Funds using BlackRock indices by creating increasing acceptance in the marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is not </span><span>obligated to license its indices to a Fund and the Funds are under no obligation to use BlackRock indices. Any Fund that </span><span>enters into a license for a BlackRock index cannot be assured that the terms of any index licensing agreement with BlackRock </span><span>will be as favorable as those terms offered to other licensees.</span></div> <div><span>The custody arrangement described in </span><span>“</span><span>Investment Advisory, Administrative and Distribution Services</span><span>”</span><span> may lead to potential </span><span>conflicts of interest with BlackRock where BlackRock has agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse ordinary operating expenses </span><span>in order to cap expenses of the Funds (or where BlackRock charges a unitary management fee). This is because the custody </span><span>arrangements with certain Funds' custodian may have the effect of reducing custody fees when the Funds leave cash </span><span>balances uninvested. This could be viewed as having the potential to provide BlackRock an incentive to keep high positive </span><span>cash balances for Funds in order to offset fund custody fees that BlackRock might otherwise reimburse or pay. However, </span><span>BlackRock’s portfolio managers do not intentionally keep uninvested balances high, but rather make investment decisions </span><span>that they anticipate will be beneficial to fund performance. For funds without a unitary management fee, when a fund’s </span><span>actual operating expense ratio exceeds a stated cap, a reduction in custody fees reduces the amount of waivers and/or </span><span>reimbursements BlackRock would be required to make to the fund.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may enter into contractual arrangements with third-party service providers to a Fund (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, custodians, </span><span>administrators and index providers) pursuant to which BlackRock receives fee discounts or concessions in recognition of </span><span>BlackRock’s overall relationship with such service providers. BlackRock may also enter into contractual arrangements with </span><span>such service providers pursuant to which BlackRock incurs additional costs if the service provider’s services are terminated </span><span>with respect to a Fund. To the extent that BlackRock is responsible for paying these service providers out of its management </span><span>fee, the benefits of any such fee discounts or concessions, or any additional costs, may accrue, in whole or in part, to </span><span>BlackRock, which could result in conflicts of interest relating to the use or termination of service providers to a Fund.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock owns or has an ownership interest in certain trading, portfolio management, operations and/or information </span><span>systems used by Fund service providers. These systems are, or will be, used by a Fund service provider in connection with the </span><span>provision of services to accounts managed by BlackRock and funds managed and sponsored by BlackRock, including the </span><span>Funds, that engage the service provider (typically the custodian). A Fund’s service provider remunerates BlackRock for the </span><span>use of the systems. A Fund service provider’s payments to BlackRock for the use of these systems may enhance the </span><span>profitability of BlackRock.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>48</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock’s receipt of fees from a service provider in connection with the use of systems provided by BlackRock may create </span><span>an incentive for BlackRock to recommend that a Fund enter into or renew an arrangement with the service provider.</span></div> <div><span>In recognition of a BlackRock client’s overall relationship with BlackRock, BlackRock may offer special pricing arrangements </span><span>for certain services provided by BlackRock. Any such special pricing arrangements will not apply to the client’s investment in </span><span>a Fund.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Present and future activities of BlackRock (including BFA), its directors, officers and employees, in addition to those described </span><span>in this section, may give rise to additional conflicts of interest.</span></div> <div><span>Investment Advisory, Administrative and </span><span>Distribution Services</span></div> <div><span>Investment Adviser. </span><span> </span><span>BFA serves as investment adviser to each Fund pursuant to an investment advisory agreement between </span><span>the Trust, on behalf of each Fund, and BFA. BFA is a California corporation indirectly owned by BlackRock, Inc. and is </span><span>registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Under the investment advisory </span><span>agreement, BFA, subject to the supervision of the Board and in conformity with the stated investment policies of each Fund, </span><span>manages and administers the Trust and the investment of each Fund’s assets. BFA is responsible for placing purchase and </span><span>sale orders and providing continuous supervision of the investment portfolio of each Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Pursuant to the investment advisory agreement, BFA may, from time to time, in its sole discretion and to the extent permitted </span><span>by applicable law, appoint one or more sub-advisers, including, without limitation, affiliates of BFA, to perform investment </span><span>advisory or other services with respect to a Fund. In addition, BFA may delegate certain of its investment advisory functions </span><span>under the investment advisory agreement to one or more of its affiliates to the extent permitted by applicable law. BFA may </span><span>terminate any or all sub-advisers or such delegation arrangements in its sole discretion upon appropriate notice at any time </span><span>to the extent permitted by applicable law.</span></div> <div><span>BFA is responsible, under the investment advisory agreement, for substantially all expenses of the Funds, including the cost </span><span>of transfer agency, custody, fund administration, legal, audit and other services. BFA is not responsible for, and the Funds will </span><span>bear, the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of </span><span>portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or </span><span>expenses, and litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of the Independent Trustees).</span></div> <div><span>BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses to reduce the Total Annual Fund Operating </span><span>Expenses (excluding Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be </span><span>eliminated by BFA at any time.</span></div> <div><span>The following table sets forth the management fee at the annual rate (as a percentage of each Fund's average daily net </span><span>assets) BFA received from each Fund for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022 and the management fees (net of waivers) </span><span>each Fund paid BFA for the fiscal years noted:</span></div> <div><span> </span></div> <div> </div> <div>

In addition, BFA Entities make </span><span>payments to Intermediaries that make shares of the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products available to </span><span>their clients, in some cases at a waived or reduced commission rate or ticket charge, develop new products that feature </span><span>iShares, create educational content about the Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products that is featured on an </span><span>Intermediary’s platform, or otherwise promote the Funds, other iShares funds and exchange-traded products. BFA Entities </span><span>may also reimburse expenses or make payments from their own assets to Intermediaries or other persons in consideration of </span><span>services or other activities that the BFA Entities believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in the Funds, </span><span>other iShares funds or exchange-traded products. Payments of the type described above are sometimes referred to as </span><span>revenue-sharing payments.</span></div> <div><span>Payments to an Intermediary may be significant to the Intermediary, and amounts that Intermediaries pay to your </span><span>salesperson or other investment professional may also be significant for your salesperson or other investment professional. </span><span>Because an Intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it will recommend or make available to its </span><span>clients, what services to provide for various products, or what marketing content to make available to its clients based on </span><span>payments it receives or is eligible to receive, such payments may create conflicts of interest between the Intermediary and its </span><span>clients. These financial incentives may cause the Intermediary to recommend the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded</span><span> products, or otherwise promote the Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products over other investments. </span><span>The same conflicts of interest and financial incentives exist with respect to your salesperson or other investment professional </span><span>if he or she receives similar payments from his or her Intermediary firm.</span></div> <div><span>In addition to the payments described above, BFA Entities have developed proprietary tools, calculators and related </span><span>interactive or digital content that is made available through the www.BlackRock.com website at no additional cost to </span><span>Intermediaries. BlackRock may configure these tools and calculators and localize the content for Intermediaries as part of its </span><span>customary digital marketing support and promotion of the Funds, other iShares funds, exchange-traded products and </span><span>BlackRock mutual funds.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>As of March 1, 2013, BFA Entities have contractual arrangements to make payments (in addition to payments for Education </span><span>Costs or Publishing Costs) to one Intermediary, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC (</span><span>“</span><span>FBS</span><span>”</span><span>). Effective June 4, 2016, this </span><span>relationship was expanded to include National Financial Services, LLC (</span><span>“</span><span>NFS</span><span>”</span><span>), an affiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this special, </span><span>long-term and significant arrangement (the </span><span>“</span><span>Marketing Program</span><span>”</span><span>), FBS, NFS and certain of their affiliates (collectively </span><span>“</span><span>Fidelity</span><span>”</span><span>) have agreed, among other things, to actively promote iShares funds to customers, investment professionals and </span><span>other intermediaries and in advertising campaigns as the preferred exchange-traded product, to offer certain iShares funds in </span><span>certain Fidelity platforms and investment programs, in some cases at a waived or reduced commission rate or ticket charge, </span><span>and to provide marketing data to BFA Entities. BFA Entities have agreed to facilitate the Marketing Program by, among other </span><span>things, making certain payments to FBS and NFS for marketing and implementing certain brokerage and investment </span><span>programs. Upon termination of the arrangement, the BFA Entities will make additional payments to FBS and/or NFS based </span><span>upon a number of criteria, including the overall success of the Marketing Program and the level of services provided by FBS </span><span>and NFS during the wind-down period.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, BFA Entities may enter into other contractual arrangements with Intermediaries and certain other third parties </span><span>that the BFA Entities believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in iShares funds. Such agreements may </span><span>include payments by BFA Entities to such Intermediaries and third parties for data collection and provision, technology </span><span>support, platform enhancement, or educational content, co-marketing and cross-promotional efforts. Payments made </span><span>pursuant to such arrangements may vary in any year and may be different for different Intermediaries and third parties. In </span><span>certain cases, the payments described in the preceding sentence may be subject to certain minimum payment levels. As of </span><span>the date of this SAI, the Intermediaries and other third parties receiving one or more types of the contractual payments </span><span>described above include (in addition to FBS and NFS): Advisor Credit Exchange, Avantax Investment Services, Inc., BNY </span><span>Mellon Capital Markets, LLC, BNY Mellon Performance &amp; Risk Analytics, LLC, Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Inc., Clearstream Fund </span><span>Centre AG, Commonwealth Equity Services, LLC, Dorsey Wright and Associates, LLC, E*Trade Securities LLC, Envestnet Asset </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>55</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Any additions, modifications, or deletions to Intermediaries and other </span><span>third parties listed above that have occurred since the date of this SAI are not included in the list.</span></div> <div><span>Further, BFA Entities make Education Costs and Publishing Costs payments to other Intermediaries that are not listed in the </span><span>immediately preceding paragraph. BFA Entities may determine to make such payments based on any number of metrics. For </span><span>example, BFA Entities may make payments at year-end or other intervals in a fixed amount, an amount based upon an </span><span>Intermediary’s services at defined levels or an amount based on the Intermediary’s net sales of one or more iShares funds in a </span><span>year or other period, any of which arrangements may include an agreed-upon minimum or maximum payment, or any </span><span>combination of the foregoing. As of the date of this SAI, BFA anticipates that the payments paid by BFA Entities in connection </span><span>with the Funds, iShares funds and exchange-traded products in general will be immaterial to BFA Entities in the aggregate for </span><span>the next year. </span><span>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such </span><span>payments or financial incentives his or her Intermediary firm may receive. Any payments made, or financial incentives </span><span>offered, by the BFA Entities to an Intermediary may create the incentive for the Intermediary to encourage customers to </span><span>buy shares of the Funds, other iShares funds or other exchange-traded products.</span></div> <div><span>The Funds may participate in certain market maker incentive programs of a national securities exchange in which an affiliate </span><span>of the Funds would pay a fee to the exchange used for the purpose of incentivizing one or more market makers in the </span><span>securities of a Fund to enhance the liquidity and quality of the secondary market of securities of a Fund. The fee would then </span><span>be credited by the exchange to one or more market makers that meet or exceed liquidity and market quality standards with </span><span>respect to the securities of a Fund. Each market maker incentive program is subject to approval from the SEC. Any such fee </span><span>payments made to an exchange will be made by an affiliate of a Fund solely for the benefit of a Fund and will not be paid </span><span>from any Fund assets. Other funds managed by BFA may also participate in such programs.</span></div> <div><span>Determination of Net Asset Value</span></div> <div><span>Valuation of Shares. </span><span>The NAV for each Fund is generally calculated as of the close of regular trading hours on the New York </span><span>Stock Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>NYSE</span><span>”</span><span>) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time) on each business day the NYSE is open. Valuation of assets held </span><span>by a Fund is as follows:</span></div> <div><span>Equity Investments. </span><span>Equity securities traded on a recognized securities exchange (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, NYSE), on separate trading boards of a </span><span>securities exchange or through a market system that provides contemporaneous transaction pricing information (each an </span><span>“</span><span>Exchange</span><span>”</span><span>) are valued using information obtained via independent pricing services, generally at the closing price or, if an </span><span>Exchange closing price is not available, the last traded price on that Exchange prior to the time as of which the assets or </span><span>liabilities are valued. However, under certain circumstances, other means of determining current market value may be used. If </span><span>an equity security is traded on more than one Exchange, the current market value of the security where it is primarily traded </span><span>generally will be used. In the event that there are no sales involving an equity security held by a Fund on a day on which a </span><span>Fund values such security, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BFA determines that such prior day’s price no longer </span><span>reflects the fair value of the security, in which case such asset would be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below).</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Fixed-Income Investments. </span><span>Fixed-income securities for which market quotations are readily available are generally valued </span><span>using such securities’ current market value. A Fund values fixed-income portfolio securities using the last available bid prices </span><span>or current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated prices) supplied by a Fund’s approved </span><span>independent third-party pricing services, each in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. The pricing services may use </span><span>matrix pricing or valuation models that utilize certain inputs and assumptions to derive values, including transaction data </span><span>(</span><span>e.g</span><span>., recent representative bids and offers), credit quality information, perceived market movements, news, and other </span><span>relevant information and by other methods, which may include consideration of: yields or prices of securities of comparable </span><span>quality, coupon, maturity and type; indications as to values from dealers; general market conditions; and/or other factors and </span><span>assumptions. Pricing services generally value fixed-income securities assuming orderly transactions of an institutional round </span><span>lot size, but a Fund may hold or transact in such securities in smaller, odd lot sizes. Odd lots may trade at lower prices than </span><span>institutional round lots. The amortized cost method of valuation may be used with respect to debt obligations with 60 days </span><span>or less remaining to maturity unless such method does not represent fair value. Certain fixed-income investments, including </span><span>asset-backed and mortgage-related securities, may be valued based on valuation models that consider the estimated cash </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>56</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

In the event that there is no mean price available for an </span><span>exchange traded equity option held by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values such option, the last bid (long positions) or </span><span>ask (short positions) price, if available, will be used as the value of such option. If no bid or ask price is available on a day on </span><span>which a Fund values such option, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BFA determines that such prior day’s price no </span><span>longer reflects the fair value of the option, in which case such option will be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below). </span><span>Customized exchange-traded equity options, as well as OTC derivatives, may be valued using a mathematical model which </span><span>may incorporate a number of market data factors. Financial futures contracts and options thereon, which are traded on </span><span>exchanges, are valued at their last sale price or settle price as of the close of such exchanges. Swap agreements and other </span><span>derivatives are generally valued daily based upon quotations from market makers or by a pricing service in accordance with </span><span>the Valuation Procedures.</span></div> <div><span>Underlying Funds. </span><span>Shares of underlying open-end funds (including money market funds) are valued at NAV. Shares of </span><span>underlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs will be valued at their most recent closing price.</span></div> <div><span>General Valuation Information. </span><span>Prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services, broker-dealers or market </span><span>makers to value a Fund’s securities and other assets and liabilities are based on information available at the time a Fund </span><span>values its assets and liabilities. In the event that a pricing service quotation is revised or updated subsequent to the day on </span><span>which a Fund valued such security, the revised pricing service quotation generally will be applied prospectively. Such </span><span>determination will be made considering pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding the revision.</span></div> <div><span>The price a Fund could receive upon the sale of any particular portfolio investment may differ from a Fund’s valuation of the </span><span>investment, particularly for assets that trade in thin or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair valuation methodology </span><span>or a price provided by an independent pricing service. As a result, the price received upon the sale of an investment may be </span><span>less than the value ascribed by a Fund, and a Fund could realize a greater than expected loss or lesser than expected gain </span><span>upon the sale of the investment. A Fund’s ability to value its investment may also be impacted by technological issues and/or </span><span>errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</span></div> <div><span>All cash, receivables and current payables are carried on a Fund’s books at their fair value.</span></div> <div><span>In the event that application of the methods of valuation discussed above result in a price for a security which is deemed not </span><span>to be representative of the fair market value of such security, the security will be valued by, under the direction of or in </span><span>accordance with a method approved by BFA, each Fund’s valuation designee, as reflecting fair value. All other assets and </span><span>liabilities (including securities for which market quotations are not readily available) held by a Fund (including restricted </span><span>securities) are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by BFA pursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any assets and </span><span>liabilities which are denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates.</span></div> <div><span>Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate </span><span>a Fund’s NAV and the prices used in the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between a Fund’s </span><span>performance and the performance of the Underlying Index.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Fair Value.</span><span> When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, a Fund’s investments are </span><span>valued at fair value (</span><span>“</span><span>Fair Value Assets</span><span>”</span><span>). Fair Value Assets are valued by BFA in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. </span><span>Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act, the Board of Trustees has designated BFA as the valuation </span><span>designee for the respective Funds for which it serves as investment adviser. BFA may reasonably conclude that a market </span><span>quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if, among other things, a security or other asset or liability does not have a </span><span>price source due to its complete lack of trading, if BFA believes a market quotation from a broker-dealer or other source is </span><span>unreliable (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, where it varies significantly from a recent trade, or no longer reflects the fair value of the security or other </span><span>asset or liability subsequent to the most recent market quotation), or where the security or other asset or liability is only </span><span>thinly traded or due to the occurrence of a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation. For this </span><span>purpose, a </span><span>“</span><span>significant event</span><span>”</span><span> is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment, that an event has </span><span>occurred after the close of trading for an asset or liability but prior to or at the time of pricing a Fund’s assets or liabilities, is </span><span>likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or closing market price of one or more assets held by, or </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>57</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>liabilities of, a Fund. On any day the NYSE is open and a foreign market or the primary exchange on which a foreign asset or </span><span>liability is traded is closed, such asset or liability will be valued using the prior day’s price, provided that BFA is not aware of </span><span>any significant event or other information that would cause such price to no longer reflect the fair value of the asset or </span><span>liability, in which case such asset or liability would be treated as a Fair Value Asset.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BFA’s Rule 2a-5 Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving methodologies by investment type and significant </span><span>inputs used in the fair valuation of Fund assets or liabilities. In addition, a Fund’s accounting agent assists BFA by periodically </span><span>endeavoring to confirm the prices it receives from all third-party pricing services, index providers and broker-dealers and </span><span>regularly evaluating the values assigned to the securities and other assets and liabilities of a Fund. The pricing of all Fair Value </span><span>Assets is subsequently reported to the Board or a committee thereof.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>When determining the price for a Fair Value Asset, BFA will seek to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect </span><span>to receive from the current sale of that asset or liability in an arm’s-length transaction on the date on which the asset or </span><span>liability is being valued, and does not seek to determine the price a Fund might reasonably expect to receive for selling an </span><span>asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. Fair value determinations will be based upon all </span><span>available factors that BFA deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be based on analytical values determined </span><span>by BFA using proprietary or third-party valuation models.</span></div> <div><span>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. When determining the fair value of an </span><span>investment, one or more fair value methodologies may be used (depending on certain factors, including the asset type). For </span><span>example, the investment may be initially priced based on the original cost of the investment or, alternatively, using proprietary </span><span>or third-party models that may rely upon one or more unobservable inputs. Prices of actual, executed or historical </span><span>transactions in the relevant investment (or comparable instruments) or, where appropriate, an appraisal by a third-party </span><span>experienced in the valuation of similar instruments, may also be used as a basis for establishing the fair value of an </span><span>investment.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could </span><span>have been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a </span><span>Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a holding or holdings are valued at fair value, may have the </span><span>effect of diluting or increasing the economic interest of existing shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund’s annual audited financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally </span><span>accepted in the United States of America (</span><span>“</span><span>US GAAP</span><span>”</span><span>), follow the requirements for valuation set forth in Financial </span><span>Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, </span><span>“</span><span>Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>ASC 820</span><span>”</span><span>), which defines and establishes a framework for measuring fair value under US GAAP and expands financial </span><span>statement disclosure requirements relating to fair value measurements.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Generally, ASC 820 and other accounting rules applicable to funds and various assets in which they invest are evolving. Such </span><span>changes may adversely affect a Fund. For example, the evolution of rules governing the determination of the fair market </span><span>value of assets or liabilities, to the extent such rules become more stringent, would tend to increase the cost and/or reduce </span><span>the availability of third-party determinations of fair market value. This may in turn increase the costs associated with selling </span><span>assets or affect their liquidity due to a Fund’s inability to obtain a third-party determination of fair market value.</span></div> <div><span>Brokerage Transactions</span></div> <div><span>Subject to policies established by the Board, BFA is primarily responsible for the execution of a Fund’s portfolio transactions </span><span>and the allocation of brokerage. BFA does not execute transactions through any particular broker or dealer, but seeks to </span><span>obtain the best net results for the Funds, taking into account such factors as price (including the applicable brokerage </span><span>commission or dealer spread), size of order, difficulty of execution, operational facilities of the firm and the firm’s risk and skill </span><span>in positioning blocks of securities. While BFA generally seeks reasonable trade execution costs, a Fund does not necessarily </span><span>pay the lowest spread or commission available, and payment of the lowest commission or spread is not necessarily </span><span>consistent with obtaining the best price and execution in particular transactions. Subject to applicable legal requirements, </span><span>BFA may select a broker based partly upon brokerage or research services provided to BFA and its clients, including a Fund. In </span><span>return for such services, BFA may cause a Fund to pay a higher commission than other brokers would charge if BFA </span><span>determines in good faith that the commission is reasonable in relation to the services provided.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>58</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>In selecting brokers or dealers to execute portfolio transactions, BFA seeks to obtain the best price and most favorable </span><span>execution for a Fund and may take into account a variety of factors including: (i) the size, nature and character of the security </span><span>or instrument being traded and the markets in which it is purchased or sold; (ii) the desired timing of the transaction; (iii) </span><span>BFA’s knowledge of the expected commission rates and spreads currently available; (iv) the activity existing and expected in </span><span>the market for the particular security or instrument, including any anticipated execution difficulties; (v) the full range of </span><span>brokerage services provided; (vi) the broker’s or dealer’s capital; (vii) the quality of research and research services provided; </span><span>(viii) the reasonableness of the commission, dealer spread or its equivalent for the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA’s </span><span>knowledge of any actual or apparent operational problems of a broker or dealer. Brokers may also be selected because of </span><span>their ability to handle special or difficult executions, such as may be involved in large block trades, thinly traded securities, or </span><span>other circumstances.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act (</span><span>“</span><span>Section 28(e)</span><span>”</span><span>) permits a U.S. investment adviser, under certain circumstances, to cause an </span><span>account to pay a broker or dealer a commission for effecting a transaction in securities that exceeds the amount another </span><span>broker or dealer would have charged for effecting the same transaction in recognition of the value of brokerage and research </span><span>services provided by that broker or dealer. This includes commissions paid on riskless principal transactions in securities </span><span>under certain conditions.</span></div> <div><span>From time to time, a Fund may purchase new issues of securities in a fixed price offering. In these situations, the broker may </span><span>be a member of the selling group that will, in addition to selling securities, provide BFA with research services. FINRA has </span><span>adopted rules expressly permitting these types of arrangements under certain circumstances. Generally, the broker will </span><span>provide research </span><span>“</span><span>credits</span><span>”</span><span> in these situations at a rate that is higher than that available for typical secondary market </span><span>transactions. These arrangements may not fall within the safe harbor of Section 28(e).</span></div> <div><span>OTC issues, including most fixed-income securities such as corporate debt and U.S. Government securities, are normally </span><span>traded on a </span><span>“</span><span>net</span><span>”</span><span> basis without a stated commission, through dealers acting for their own account and not as brokers. The </span><span>Funds will primarily engage in transactions with these dealers or deal directly with the issuer unless a better price or </span><span>execution could be obtained by using a broker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect to both foreign and domestic securities </span><span>will generally include a </span><span>“</span><span>spread,</span><span>”</span><span> which is the difference between the prices at which the dealer is willing to purchase and sell </span><span>the specific security at the time, and includes the dealer’s normal profit.</span></div> <div><span>Under the 1940 Act, persons affiliated with a Fund and persons who are affiliated with such affiliated persons are prohibited </span><span>from dealing with the Fund as principal in the purchase and sale of securities unless a permissive order allowing such </span><span>transactions is obtained from the SEC. Since transactions in the OTC market usually involve transactions with the dealers </span><span>acting as principal for their own accounts, the Funds will not deal with affiliated persons and affiliated persons of such </span><span>affiliated persons in connection with such transactions. The Funds will not purchase securities during the existence of any </span><span>underwriting or selling group relating to such securities of which BFA, BRIL or any affiliated person (as defined in the 1940 </span><span>Act) thereof is a member except pursuant to procedures adopted by the Board in accordance with Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 </span><span>Act.</span></div> <div><span>Purchases of money market instruments by the Funds are made from dealers, underwriters and issuers. The Funds do not </span><span>currently expect to incur any brokerage commission expense on such transactions because money market instruments are </span><span>generally traded on a </span><span>“</span><span>net</span><span>”</span><span> basis with dealers acting as principal for their own accounts without a stated commission. The </span><span>price of the security, however, usually includes a profit to the dealer.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BFA may, from time to time, effect trades on behalf of and for the account of the Funds with brokers or dealers that are </span><span>affiliated with BFA, in conformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under these provisions, </span><span>any commissions paid to affiliated brokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by </span><span>other brokers or dealers in comparable transactions.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Securities purchased in underwritten offerings include a fixed amount of compensation to the underwriter, generally referred </span><span>to as the underwriter’s concession or discount. When securities are purchased or sold directly from or to an issuer, no </span><span>commissions or discounts are paid.</span></div> <div><span>Investment decisions for the Funds and for other investment accounts managed by BFA and the other Affiliates are made </span><span>independently of each other in light of differing conditions. A variety of factors will be considered in making investment </span><span>allocations. These factors include: (i) investment objectives or strategies for particular accounts, including sector, industry, </span><span>country or region and capitalization weightings; (ii) tax considerations of an account; (iii) risk or investment concentration </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>59</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

BFA and the other Affiliates may deal, trade and invest for their own respective accounts in the types of securities </span><span>in which the Funds may invest.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Initial public offerings (</span><span>“</span><span>IPOs</span><span>”</span><span>) of securities may be over-subscribed and subsequently trade at a premium in the secondary </span><span>market. When BFA is given an opportunity to invest in such an initial offering or </span><span>“</span><span>new</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>hot</span><span>”</span><span> issue, the supply of securities </span><span>available for client accounts is often less than the amount of securities the accounts would otherwise take. In order to </span><span>allocate these investments fairly and equitably among client accounts over time, each portfolio manager or a member of his </span><span>or her respective investment team will indicate to BFA’s trading desk their level of interest in a particular offering with respect </span><span>to eligible clients’ accounts for which that team is responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities will be identified as eligible for </span><span>particular client accounts that are managed by portfolio teams who have indicated interest in the offering based on market </span><span>capitalization of the issuer of the security and the investment mandate of the client account and in the case of international </span><span>equity securities, the country where the offering is taking place and the investment mandate of the client account. Generally, </span><span>shares received during the IPO will be allocated among participating client accounts within each investment mandate on a </span><span>pro rata</span><span> basis. This </span><span>pro rata</span><span> allocation may result in a Fund receiving less of a particular security than if pro-rating had not </span><span>occurred. All allocations of securities will be subject, where relevant, to share minimums established for accounts and </span><span>compliance constraints. In situations where supply is too limited to be allocated among all accounts for which the </span><span>investment is eligible, portfolio managers may rotate such investment opportunities among one or more accounts so long as </span><span>the rotation system provides for fair access for all client accounts over time. Other allocation methodologies that are </span><span>considered by BFA to be fair and equitable to clients may be used as well.</span></div> <div><span>Because different accounts may have differing investment objectives and policies, BFA may buy and sell the same securities </span><span>at the same time for different clients based on the particular investment objective, guidelines and strategies of those </span><span>accounts. For example, BFA may decide that it may be entirely appropriate for a growth fund to sell a security at the same </span><span>time a value fund is buying that security. To the extent that transactions on behalf of more than one client of BFA or the other </span><span>Affiliates during the same period increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, </span><span>there may be an adverse effect on price. For example, sales of a security by BlackRock on behalf of one or more of its clients </span><span>may decrease the market price of such security, adversely impacting other BlackRock clients that still hold the security. If </span><span>purchases or sales of securities arise for consideration at or about the same time that would involve the Funds or other </span><span>clients or funds for which BFA or another Affiliate act as investment manager, transactions in such securities will be made, </span><span>insofar as feasible, for the respective funds and clients in a manner deemed equitable to all.</span></div> <div><span>In certain instances, BFA may find it efficient for purposes of seeking to obtain best execution, to aggregate or </span><span>“</span><span>bunch</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>certain contemporaneous purchases or sale orders of its advisory accounts and advisory accounts of affiliates. In general, all </span><span>contemporaneous trades for client accounts under management by the same portfolio manager or investment team will be </span><span>bunched in a single order if the trader believes the bunched trade would provide each client with an opportunity to achieve a </span><span>more favorable execution at a potentially lower execution cost. The costs associated with a bunched order will be shared </span><span>pro </span><span>rata</span><span> among the clients in the bunched order. Generally, if an order for a particular portfolio manager or management team is </span><span>filled at several different prices through multiple trades, all accounts participating in the order will receive the average price </span><span>(except in the case of certain international markets where average pricing is not permitted). While in some cases this practice </span><span>could have a detrimental effect upon the price or value of the security as far as the Funds are concerned, in other cases it </span><span>could be beneficial to the Funds. Transactions effected by BFA or the other Affiliates on behalf of more than one of its clients </span><span>during the same period may increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, </span><span>causing an adverse effect on price. The trader will give the bunched order to the broker-dealer that the trader has identified </span><span>as being able to provide the best execution of the order. Orders for purchase or sale of securities will be placed within a </span><span>reasonable amount of time of the order receipt and bunched orders will be kept bunched only long enough to execute the </span><span>order.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>60</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Together, the Deposit Securities and the Cash Component constitute the </span><span>“</span><span>Fund Deposit,</span><span>”</span><span> which will be applicable (subject to possible amendment or correction) to creation requests received in </span><span>proper form. The Fund Deposit represents the minimum initial and subsequent investment amount for a Creation Unit of a </span><span>Fund. Such Fund Deposit is applicable, subject to any adjustments as described below, to purchases of Creation Units of </span><span>shares of a given Fund until such time as the next-announced Fund Deposit is made available.</span></div> <div><span>The </span><span>“</span><span>Cash Component</span><span>”</span><span> is an amount equal to the difference between the NAV of the shares (per Creation Unit) and the </span><span>“</span><span>Deposit Amount,</span><span>”</span><span> which is an amount equal to the market value of the Deposit Securities, and serves to compensate for any </span><span>differences between the NAV per Creation Unit and the Deposit Amount. Payment of any stamp duty or other similar fees and </span><span>expenses payable upon transfer of beneficial ownership of the Deposit Securities are the sole responsibility of the Authorized </span><span>Participant purchasing the Creation Unit. The Funds generally offer Creation Units partially for cash, but may, in certain </span><span>circumstances, offer Creation Units solely for cash or solely in-kind. Please see the </span><span>Cash Purchase Method</span><span> section below and </span><span>the following discussion summarizing the Deposit Security method for further information on purchasing Creation Units of </span><span>the Funds.</span></div> <div><span>The identity and number or par value of the Deposit Securities change pursuant to changes in the composition of a Fund's </span><span>portfolio and as rebalancing adjustments and corporate action events are reflected from time to time by BFA with a view to </span><span>the investment objective of the Fund. The composition of the Deposit Securities may also change in response to adjustments </span><span>to the weighting or composition of the component securities constituting the relevant Underlying Index.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund Deposit may also be modified to minimize the Cash Component by redistributing the cash to the Deposit Securities </span><span>portion of the Fund Deposit through </span><span>“</span><span>systematic rounding.</span><span>”</span><span> The rounding methodology </span><span>“</span><span>rounds up</span><span>”</span><span> position sizes of </span><span>securities in the Deposit Securities (which in turn reduces the cash portion). However, the methodology limits the maximum </span><span>allowed percentage change in weight and share quantity of any given security in the Fund Deposit.</span></div> <div><span>Fund Deposits may also be modified to position a fund towards a forward index rebalance to reflect revisions that account for </span><span>index additions, deletions, and re-weights.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The Trust may, in its sole discretion, substitute a </span><span>“</span><span>cash in lieu</span><span>”</span><span> amount to be added to the Cash Component to replace any </span><span>Deposit Security in certain circumstances, including: (i) when instruments are not available in sufficient quantity for delivery; </span><span>(ii) when instruments are not eligible for transfer through DTC or the clearing process (as discussed below); (iii) when </span><span>instruments that the Authorized Participant (or an investor on whose behalf the Authorized Participant is acting) are not able </span><span>to be traded due to a trading restriction; (iv) when delivery of the Deposit Security by the Authorized Participant (or by an </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>64</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

In the case of a </span><span>partial or full cash purchase, the Authorized Participant must pay the cash equivalent of the Deposit Securities it would </span><span>otherwise be required to provide through an in-kind purchase, plus the same Cash Component required to be paid by an in-kind</span><span> purchaser.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Procedures for Creation of Creation Units.</span><span>  </span><span>To be eligible to place orders with the Distributor and to create a Creation Unit of </span><span>the Funds, an entity must be: (i) a </span><span>“</span><span>Participating Party,</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>i.e</span><span>., a broker-dealer or other participant in the clearing process </span><span>through the Continuous Net Settlement System of the NSCC (the </span><span>“</span><span>Clearing Process</span><span>”</span><span>), a clearing agency that is registered </span><span>with the SEC, or (ii) a DTC Participant, and must have executed an agreement with the Distributor, with respect to creations </span><span>and redemptions of Creation Units (</span><span>“</span><span>Authorized Participant Agreement</span><span>”</span><span>) (discussed below). A member or participant of a </span><span>clearing agency registered with the SEC which has a written agreement with the Funds or one of their service providers that </span><span>allows such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units is referred to as an </span><span>“</span><span>Authorized Participant.</span><span>”</span><span> All shares of the Funds, however created, will be entered on the records of DTC in the name of Cede </span><span>&amp; Co. for the account of a DTC Participant.</span></div> <div><span>Role of the Authorized Participant.</span><span>  </span><span>Creation Units may be purchased only by or through a member or participant of a </span><span>clearing agency registered with the SEC, which has a written agreement with the Funds or one of their service providers that </span><span>allows such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units. Such Authorized </span><span>Participant will agree, pursuant to the terms of such Authorized Participant Agreement and on behalf of itself or any investor </span><span>on whose behalf it will act, to certain conditions, including that such Authorized Participant will make available in advance of </span><span>each purchase of shares an amount of cash sufficient to pay the Cash Component, once the NAV of a Creation Unit is next </span><span>determined after receipt of the purchase order in proper form, together with the transaction fees described below. An </span><span>Authorized Participant, acting on behalf of an investor, may require the investor to enter into an agreement with such </span><span>Authorized Participant with respect to certain matters, including payment of the Cash Component. Investors who are not </span><span>Authorized Participants must make appropriate arrangements with an Authorized Participant. Investors should be aware that </span><span>their particular broker may not be a DTC Participant or may not have executed an Authorized Participant Agreement and that </span><span>orders to purchase Creation Units may have to be placed by the investor's broker through an Authorized Participant. As a </span><span>result, purchase orders placed through an Authorized Participant may result in additional charges to such investor. The Trust </span><span>does not expect to enter into an Authorized Participant Agreement with more than a small number of DTC Participants. A list </span><span>of current Authorized Participants may be obtained from the Distributor. The Distributor has adopted guidelines regarding </span><span>Authorized Participants’ transactions in Creation Units that are made available to all Authorized Participants. These guidelines </span><span>set forth the processes and standards for Authorized Participants to transact with the Distributor and its agents in connection </span><span>with creation and redemption transactions. In addition, the Distributor may be appointed as the proxy of the Authorized </span><span>Participant and may be granted a power of attorney under its Authorized Participant Agreement.</span></div> <div><span>Placement of Creation Orders.</span><span>  </span><span>Fund Deposits must be delivered through the Federal Reserve System (for cash and U.S. </span><span>government securities), through DTC (for corporate and municipal securities) or through a central depository account, such </span><span>as with Euroclear or DTC, maintained by State Street or a sub-custodian (a </span><span>“</span><span>Central Depository Account</span><span>”</span><span>). Any portion of a </span><span>Fund Deposit that may not be delivered through the Federal Reserve System or DTC must be delivered through a Central </span><span>Depository Account. The Fund Deposit transfers made through DTC must be ordered by the DTC Participant in a timely </span><span>fashion so as to ensure the delivery of the requisite number of Deposit Securities through DTC to the accounts of the Funds </span><span>generally before 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. Fund Deposit transfers made through the Federal Reserve </span><span>System must be deposited by the participant institution in a timely fashion so as to ensure the delivery of the requisite </span><span>number or amount of Deposit Securities or cash through the Federal Reserve System to the account of the Funds generally </span><span>before 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. Fund Deposit transfers made through a Central Depository Account </span><span>must be completed pursuant to the requirements established by the Custodian or sub-custodian for such Central Depository </span><span>Account generally before 2:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. The </span><span>“</span><span>Settlement Date</span><span>”</span><span> for all funds is generally the </span><span>second business day after the Transmittal Date. All questions as to the number of Deposit Securities to be delivered, and the </span><span>validity, form and eligibility (including time of receipt) for the deposit of any tendered securities, will be determined by the </span><span>Trust, whose determination shall be final and binding. The amount of cash equal to the Cash Component must be transferred </span><span>directly to State Street through the Federal Reserve Bank wire transfer system in a timely manner so as to be received by State </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>65</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

If the Cash Component and the Deposit Securities are </span><span>not received by 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date, the creation order may be canceled. Upon written notice to </span><span>the Distributor, such canceled order may be resubmitted the following Business Day using the Fund Deposit as newly </span><span>constituted to reflect the then current NAV of the Funds. The delivery of Creation Units so created generally will occur no </span><span>later than the second Business Day following the day on which the purchase order is deemed received by the Distributor, </span><span>provided that the relevant Fund Deposit has been received by the Funds prior to such time.</span></div> <div><span>Purchase Orders.</span><span>  </span><span> To initiate an order for a Creation Unit, an Authorized Participant must submit to the Distributor or its </span><span>agent an irrevocable order to purchase shares of a Fund, in proper form,</span><span> </span><span>generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any </span><span>Business Day to receive that day’s NAV. The Distributor or its agent will notify BFA and the custodian of such order. The </span><span>custodian will then provide such information to any appropriate sub-custodian. Procedures and requirements governing the </span><span>delivery of the Fund Deposit are set forth in the procedures handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time </span><span>to time. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements for a creation request to be </span><span>made through an Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current Authorized Participants </span><span>upon request. Those placing orders to purchase Creation Units through an Authorized Participant should allow sufficient time </span><span>to permit proper submission of the purchase order to the Distributor or its agent by the Cutoff Time (as defined below) on </span><span>such Business Day.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The Authorized Participant must also make available on or before the contractual settlement date, by means satisfactory to </span><span>the Funds, immediately available or same day funds estimated by the Funds to be sufficient to pay the Cash Component next </span><span>determined after acceptance of the purchase order, together with the applicable purchase transaction fees. Those placing </span><span>orders should ascertain the applicable deadline for cash transfers by contacting the operations department of the broker or </span><span>depositary institution effectuating the transfer of the Cash Component. This deadline is likely to be significantly earlier than </span><span>the Cutoff Time of the Funds. Investors should be aware that an Authorized Participant may require orders for purchases of </span><span>shares placed with it to be in the particular form required by the individual Authorized Participant.</span></div> <div><span>The Authorized Participant is responsible for any and all expenses and costs incurred by a Fund, including any applicable cash </span><span>amounts, in connection with any purchase order.</span></div> <div><span>Timing of Submission of Purchase Orders.</span><span>  </span><span>An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable order to purchase shares </span><span>of a Fund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day in order to receive that day's NAV. Creation Orders </span><span>must be transmitted by an Authorized Participant in the form required by the Funds to the Distributor or its agent pursuant to </span><span>procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Economic or market disruptions or changes, or telephone or </span><span>other communication failure, may impede the ability to reach the Distributor or its agent or an Authorized Participant. Each </span><span>Fund's deadline specified above for the submission of purchase orders is referred to as that Fund's </span><span>“</span><span>Cutoff Time.</span><span>”</span><span> The </span><span>Distributor or its agent, in their discretion, may permit the submission of such orders and requests by or through an </span><span>Authorized Participant at any time (including on days on which the Listing Exchange is not open for business) via </span><span>communication through the facilities of the Distributor's or its agent's proprietary website maintained for this purpose. </span><span>Purchase orders and redemption requests, if accepted by the Trust, will be processed based on the NAV next determined </span><span>after such acceptance in accordance with a Fund's Cutoff Times as provided in the Authorized Participant Agreement and </span><span>disclosed in this SAI.</span></div> <div><span>Acceptance of Orders for Creation Units.</span><span>  </span><span> Subject to the conditions that (i) an irrevocable purchase order has been </span><span>submitted by the Authorized Participant (either on its own or another investor's behalf) and (ii) arrangements satisfactory to </span><span>the Funds are in place for payment of the Cash Component and any other cash amounts which may be due, the Funds will </span><span>accept the order, subject to each Fund's right (and the right of the Distributor and BFA) to reject any order until acceptance, </span><span>as set forth below.</span></div> <div><span>Once a Fund has accepted an order, upon the next determination of the NAV of the shares, the Fund will confirm the </span><span>issuance of a Creation Unit, against receipt of payment, at such NAV. The Distributor or its agent will then transmit a </span><span>confirmation of acceptance to the Authorized Participant that placed the order.</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund reserves the right to reject or revoke a creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor or its agent provided that </span><span>a rejection or revocation of a creation order does not violate Rule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act. For example, a </span><span>Fund may reject or revoke a creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor or its agent if (i) the order is not in proper form; </span><span>(ii) the investor(s), upon obtaining the shares ordered, would own 80% or more of the currently outstanding shares of the </span><span>Fund; (iii) the Deposit Securities delivered do not conform to the identity and number of shares specified, as described above; </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>66</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The Distributor or its </span><span>agent shall notify a prospective purchaser of a Creation Unit and/or the Authorized Participant acting on behalf of such </span><span>purchaser of its rejection of such order. The Funds, State Street, the sub-custodian and the Distributor or its agent are under </span><span>no duty, however, to give notification of any defects or irregularities in the delivery of Fund Deposits nor shall any of them </span><span>incur any liability for failure to give such notification.</span></div> <div><span>Issuance of a Creation Unit.</span><span>  </span><span> Except as provided herein, a Creation Unit will not be issued until the transfer of good title to </span><span>the applicable Fund of the Deposit Securities and the payment of the Cash Component have been completed. When the sub-custodian</span><span> has confirmed to the custodian that the securities included in the Fund Deposit (or the cash value thereof) have </span><span>been delivered to the account of the relevant sub-custodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor or its agent and BFA shall be </span><span>notified of such delivery and the applicable Fund will issue and cause the delivery of the Creation Unit. Creation Units are </span><span>generally issued on a </span><span>“</span><span>T+2 basis</span><span>”</span><span> (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, two Business Days after trade date). Each Fund reserves the right to settle Creation </span><span>Unit transactions on a basis other than T+2, including a shorter settlement period, if necessary or appropriate under the </span><span>circumstances and compliant with applicable law. For example, each Fund reserves the right to settle Creation Unit </span><span>transactions on a basis other than T+2, in order to accommodate non-U.S. market holiday schedules, to account for different </span><span>treatment among non-U.S. and U.S. markets of dividend record dates and ex-dividend dates (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the last day the holder of a </span><span>security can sell the security and still receive dividends payable on the security) and in certain other circumstances.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>To the extent contemplated by an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Distributor, each Fund will issue Creation Units </span><span>to such Authorized Participant, notwithstanding the fact that the corresponding Fund Deposits have not been received in </span><span>part or in whole, in reliance on the undertaking of the Authorized Participant to deliver the missing Deposit Securities as soon </span><span>as possible, which undertaking shall be secured by such Authorized Participant's delivery and maintenance of collateral as set </span><span>forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants. The Trust may use such collateral at any time to buy Deposit Securities for </span><span>the Funds. Such collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the contractual </span><span>settlement date. Information concerning the Funds' current procedures for collateralization of missing Deposit Securities is </span><span>available from the Distributor or its agent. The Authorized Participant Agreement will permit the Funds to buy the missing </span><span>Deposit Securities at any time and will subject the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the cost to the </span><span>Funds of purchasing such securities and the collateral including, without limitation, liability for related brokerage, borrowings </span><span>and other charges.</span></div> <div><span>In certain cases, Authorized Participants may create and redeem Creation Units on the same trade date and in these </span><span>instances, the Funds reserve the right to settle these transactions on a net basis or require a representation from the </span><span>Authorized Participants that the creation and redemption transactions are for separate beneficial owners. All questions as to </span><span>the number of shares of each security in the Deposit Securities and the validity, form, eligibility and acceptance for deposit of </span><span>any securities to be delivered shall be determined by each Fund and the Fund's determination shall be final and binding.</span></div> <div><span>Costs Associated with Creation Transactions.</span></div> <div><span>A standard creation transaction fee is imposed to offset the transfer and other transaction costs associated with the issuance </span><span>of Creation Units. The standard creation transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized </span><span>Participant creates a Creation Unit, and is the same, regardless of the number of Creation Units purchased by the Authorized </span><span>Participant on the applicable Business Day. If a purchase consists solely or partially of cash, the Authorized Participant may </span><span>also be required to cover (up to the maximum amount shown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, </span><span>price movement and other costs and expenses related to the execution of trades resulting from such transaction (which may, </span><span>in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Authorized Participants will also bear the costs </span><span>of transferring the Deposit Securities to the Funds. Certain fees/costs associated with creation transactions may be waived in </span><span>certain circumstances. Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to acquire Fund shares may </span><span>be charged a fee for such services.</span></div> <div><span>The following table sets forth each Fund's standard creation transaction fees and maximum additional charge (as described </span><span>above):</span></div> <div><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>67</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The Funds will not redeem shares in amounts less than Creation Units. There can be no assurance, however, </span><span>that there will be sufficient liquidity in the secondary market at any time to permit assembly of a Creation Unit.

Please see the </span><span>Cash Redemption Method</span><span> </span><span>section below and the following discussion summarizing the in-kind method for further information on redeeming Creation </span><span>Units of the Funds.</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund publishes the designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be </span><span>substituted) that will be applicable to redemption requests received in proper form (as defined below) on that day (</span><span>“</span><span>Fund </span><span>Securities</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>Redemption Basket</span><span>”</span><span>), and an amount of cash (the </span><span>“</span><span>Cash Amount,</span><span>”</span><span> as described below) in order to effect </span><span>redemptions of Creation Units of a Fund. Such Fund Securities and Cash Amount will remain in effect until such time as the </span><span>next announced composition of the Fund Securities and Cash Amount is made available. The Fund Securities and Cash </span><span>Amount are subject to possible amendment or correction. Fund Securities received on redemption may not be identical to </span><span>Deposit Securities that are applicable to creations of Creation Units. Procedures and requirements governing redemption </span><span>transactions are set forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time to time.</span></div> <div><span>Unless cash redemptions are available or specified for a Fund, the redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit generally consist </span><span>of Fund Securities, plus the Cash Amount, which is an amount equal to the difference between the NAV of the shares being </span><span>redeemed, as next determined after the receipt of a redemption request in proper form, and the value of Fund Securities, less </span><span>a redemption transaction fee (as described below).</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The Trust may, in its sole discretion, substitute a </span><span>“</span><span>cash in lieu</span><span>”</span><span> amount to replace any Fund Security in certain circumstances, </span><span>including: (i) when the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant (or to an investor on whose behalf the </span><span>Authorized Participant is acting) would be restricted under applicable securities or other local laws or due to a trading </span><span>restriction; (ii) when the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in the disposition of the Fund </span><span>Security by the Authorized Participant due to restrictions under applicable securities or other local laws; (iii) when the delivery </span><span>of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in unfavorable tax treatment; (iv) when a Fund Security cannot </span><span>be settled or otherwise delivered in time to facilitate an in-kind redemption; or (v) in certain other situations. The amount of </span><span>cash paid out in such cases will be equivalent to the value of the substituted security listed as a Fund Security. In the event </span><span>that the Fund Securities have a value greater than the NAV of the shares, a compensating cash payment equal to the </span><span>difference is required to be made by or through an Authorized Participant by the redeeming shareholder. Each Fund generally </span><span>redeems Creation Units partially for cash. Each Fund may, in its sole discretion, provide such redeeming Authorized </span><span>Participant a portfolio of securities that differs from the exact composition of the Fund Securities, but does not differ in NAV. </span><span>The Redemption Basket may also be modified to minimize the Cash Component by redistributing the cash to the Fund </span><span>Securities portion of the Redemption Basket through systematically rounding. The rounding methodology allows position </span><span>sizes of securities in the Fund Securities to be </span><span>“</span><span>rounded up,</span><span>”</span><span> while limiting the maximum allowed percentage change in </span><span>weight and share quantity of any given security in the Redemption Basket.

An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable </span><span>request to redeem shares of the Fund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day in order to receive that </span><span>day's NAV. On days when the Listing Exchange closes earlier than normal, a Fund may require orders to redeem Creation </span><span>Units to be placed earlier that day. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements for </span><span>a redemption request to be made through an Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current </span><span>Authorized Participants upon request.</span></div> <div><span>The Authorized Participant must transmit the request for redemption in the form required by the Funds to the Distributor or </span><span>its agent in accordance with procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Investors should be aware that </span><span>their particular broker may not have executed an Authorized Participant Agreement and that, therefore, requests to redeem </span><span>Creation Units may have to be placed by the investor's broker through an Authorized Participant who has executed an </span><span>Authorized Participant Agreement. At any time, only a limited number of broker-dealers will have an Authorized Participant </span><span>Agreement in effect. Investors making a redemption request should be aware that such request must be in the form specified </span><span>by such Authorized Participant. Investors making a request to redeem Creation Units should allow sufficient time to permit </span><span>proper submission of the request by an Authorized Participant and transfer of the shares to the Funds' transfer agent; such </span><span>investors should allow for the additional time that may be required to effect redemptions through their banks, brokers or </span><span>other financial intermediaries if such intermediaries are not Authorized Participants.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>A redemption request is considered to be in </span><span>“</span><span>proper form</span><span>”</span><span> if: (i) an Authorized Participant has transferred or caused to be </span><span>transferred to the Funds' transfer agent the Creation Unit redeemed through the book-entry system of DTC so as to be </span><span>effective by the Listing Exchange closing time on any Business Day on which the redemption request is submitted; (ii) a </span><span>request in form satisfactory to the applicable Fund is received by the Distributor or its agent from the Authorized Participant </span><span>on behalf of itself or another redeeming investor within the time periods specified above; and (iii) all other procedures set </span><span>forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement are properly followed.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>69</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The tender of an investor's shares for redemption and the distribution of the securities </span><span>and/or cash included in the redemption payment made in respect of Creation Units redeemed will be made through DTC and </span><span>the relevant Authorized Participant to the Beneficial Owner thereof as recorded on the book-entry system of DTC or the DTC </span><span>Participant through which such investor holds, as the case may be, or by such other means specified by the Authorized </span><span>Participant submitting the redemption request.</span></div> <div><span>A redeeming Authorized Participant, whether on its own account or acting on behalf of a Beneficial Owner, must maintain </span><span>appropriate security arrangements with a qualified broker-dealer, bank or other custody providers in each jurisdiction in </span><span>which any of the portfolio securities are customarily traded, to which account such portfolio securities will be delivered.</span></div> <div><span>Deliveries of redemption proceeds by a Fund are generally made within two Business Days (</span><span>i.e</span><span>., </span><span>“</span><span>T+2</span><span>”</span><span>). Each Fund reserves </span><span>the right to settle redemption transactions on a basis other than T+2, including a shorter settlement period, if necessary or </span><span>appropriate under the circumstances and compliant with applicable law. For example, each Fund reserves the right to settle </span><span>redemption transactions on a basis other than T+2 to accommodate non-U.S. market holiday schedules, to account for </span><span>different treatment among non-U.S. and U.S. markets of dividend record dates and dividend ex-dates (</span><span>i.e</span><span>., the last date the </span><span>holder of a security can sell the security and still receive dividends payable on the security sold) and in certain other </span><span>circumstances consistent with applicable law. </span></div> <div><span>Although the Trust does not ordinarily permit cash redemptions of Creation Units (except that, as noted above, Creation </span><span>Units of each Fund generally will be redeemed partially for cash), in the event that cash redemptions are permitted or </span><span>required by the Trust, proceeds will be paid to the Authorized Participant redeeming shares as soon as practicable after the </span><span>date of redemption (within seven calendar days thereafter). If a Fund includes a foreign investment in its basket, and if a local </span><span>market holiday, or series of consecutive holidays, or the extended delivery cycles for transferring foreign investments to </span><span>redeeming Authorized Participants prevents timely delivery of the foreign investment in response to a redemption request, a </span><span>Fund may delay delivery of the foreign investment more than seven days if a Fund delivers the foreign investment as soon as </span><span>practicable, but in no event later than 15 days.</span></div> <div><span>To the extent contemplated by an Authorized Participant's agreement with the Distributor or its agent, in the event an </span><span>Authorized Participant has submitted a redemption request in proper form but is unable to transfer all or part of the Creation </span><span>Unit to be redeemed to a Fund, at or prior to the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the Business Day after the date </span><span>of submission of such redemption request, the Distributor or its agent will accept the redemption request in reliance on the </span><span>undertaking by the Authorized Participant to deliver the missing shares as soon as possible. Such undertaking shall be </span><span>secured by the Authorized Participant's delivery and maintenance of collateral as set forth in the handbook for Authorized </span><span>Participants. Such collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the Business Day </span><span>after the date of submission of such redemption request and shall be held by State Street and marked-to-market daily. The </span><span>fees of State Street and any sub-custodians in respect of the delivery, maintenance and redelivery of the collateral shall be </span><span>payable by the Authorized Participant. The Authorized Participant Agreement permits the Funds to acquire shares of the </span><span>Funds at any time and subjects the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the aggregate of the cost to </span><span>the Funds of purchasing such shares, plus the value of the Cash Amount, and the value of the collateral together with liability </span><span>for related brokerage and other charges.</span></div> <div><span>Because the portfolio securities of a Fund may trade on exchange(s) on days that the Listing Exchange is closed or are </span><span>otherwise not Business Days for such Fund, shareholders may not be able to redeem their shares of such Fund or purchase </span><span>or sell shares of such Fund on the Listing Exchange on days when the NAV of such a Fund could be significantly affected by </span><span>events in the relevant non-U.S. markets.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The right of redemption may be suspended or the date of payment postponed with respect to any Fund: (i) for any period </span><span>during which the Listing Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday closings); (ii) for any period during </span><span>which trading on the Listing Exchange is suspended or restricted; (iii) for any period during which an emergency exists as a </span><span>result of which disposal of the shares of the Fund's portfolio securities or determination of its NAV is not reasonably </span><span>practicable; or (iv) in such other circumstance as is permitted by the SEC.</span></div> <div><span>Custom Baskets.</span><span>  </span><span>Creation and Redemption baskets may differ and each Fund may accept </span><span>“</span><span>custom baskets.</span><span>”</span><span> A custom </span><span>basket may include any of the following: (i) a basket that is composed of a non-representative selection of a Fund's portfolio </span><span>holdings; (ii) a representative basket that is different from the initial basket used in transactions on the same business day; or </span><span>(iii) a basket that contains bespoke cash substitutions for a single Authorized Participant.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>procedures that govern the construction and acceptance of baskets, including heightened requirements for certain types of </span><span>custom baskets. Such policies and procedures provide the parameters for the construction and acceptance of custom </span><span>baskets that are in the best interests of a Fund and its shareholders, establish processes for revisions to, or deviations from, </span><span>such parameters, and specify the titles and roles of the employees of BFA who are required to review each custom basket for </span><span>compliance with those parameters. In addition, when constructing custom baskets for redemptions, the tax efficiency of a </span><span>Fund may be taken into account. The policies and procedures distinguish among different types of custom baskets that may </span><span>be used for each Fund and impose different requirements for different types of custom baskets in order to seek to mitigate </span><span>against potential risks of conflicts and/or overreaching by an Authorized Participant. BlackRock has established a governance </span><span>process to oversee basket compliance for the Funds, as set forth in each Fund's policies and procedures.</span></div> <div><span>Taxation on Creations and Redemptions of Creation Units.</span><span>  </span><span> An Authorized Participant generally will recognize either gain or </span><span>loss upon the exchange of Deposit Securities for Creation Units. This gain or loss is calculated by taking the market value of </span><span>the Creation Units purchased over the Authorized Participant’s aggregate basis in the Deposit Securities exchanged therefor. </span><span>However, the IRS may apply the wash sales rules to determine that any loss realized upon the exchange of Deposit Securities </span><span>for Creation Units is not currently deductible. Authorized Participants should consult their own tax advisors.</span></div> <div><span>Current U.S. federal income tax laws dictate that capital gain or loss realized from the redemption of Creation Units will </span><span>generally create long-term capital gain or loss if the Authorized Participant holds the Creation Units for more than one year, </span><span>or short-term capital gain or loss if the Creation Units were held for one year or less, if the Creation Units are held as capital </span><span>assets.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>71</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

This summary does not address all of the potential U.S. federal income tax consequences </span><span>that may be applicable to a Fund or to all categories of investors, some of which may be subject to special tax rules. Current </span><span>and prospective shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the specific federal, state, local and </span><span>non-U.S. tax consequences of investing in a Fund. The summary is based on the laws and judicial and administrative </span><span>interpretations thereof in effect on the date of this SAI, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. </span><span>References to the Funds will also generally apply to the Underlying Funds as well.</span></div> <div><span>Regulated Investment Company Qualifications. </span><span> </span><span>Each Fund intends to qualify for and to elect treatment as a separate RIC </span><span>under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify for treatment as a RIC, each Fund must annually distribute at </span><span>least 90% of its investment company taxable income (which includes dividends, interest and net short-term capital gains) </span><span>and meet several other requirements. Among such other requirements are the following: (i) at least 90% of each Fund’s </span><span>annual gross income must be derived from dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans, gains from the sale </span><span>or other disposition of stock or securities or non-U.S. currencies, other income (including, but not limited to, gains from </span><span>options, futures or forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies, </span><span>and net income derived from interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, partnerships that are traded on an </span><span>established securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than a partnership that derives at least 90% of its </span><span>income from interest, dividends, capital gains and other traditionally permitted RIC income); and (ii) at the close of each </span><span>quarter of each Fund’s taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the market value of each Fund’s total assets must be represented by </span><span>cash and cash items, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs and other securities, with such other securities </span><span>limited for purposes of this calculation in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of the </span><span>Fund’s assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (b) not more than 25% of the </span><span>value of the Fund’s total assets may be invested in the securities of any one issuer, of two or more issuers of which 20% or </span><span>more of the voting stock is held by the Fund and that are engaged in the same or similar trades or businesses or related </span><span>trades or businesses (other than the securities of other RICs) or the securities of one or more qualified publicly-traded </span><span>partnerships.</span></div> <div><span>A Fund may be able to cure a failure to derive at least 90% of its income from the sources specified above or a failure to </span><span>diversify its holdings in the manner described above by paying a tax and/or by disposing of certain assets. If, in any taxable </span><span>year, a Fund fails one of these tests and does not timely cure the failure, that Fund will be taxed in the same manner as an </span><span>ordinary corporation and distributions to its shareholders will not be deductible by that Fund in computing its taxable </span><span>income.</span></div> <div><span>Although in general the passive loss rules of the Internal Revenue Code do not apply to RICs, such rules do apply to a RIC </span><span>with respect to items attributable to an interest in a qualified publicly-traded partnership. A Fund’s investments in </span><span>partnerships, including in qualified publicly-traded partnerships, may result in the Fund being subject to state, local, or non-U.S.</span><span> income, franchise or withholding tax liabilities.</span></div> <div><span>Taxation of RICs. </span><span> </span><span>As a RIC, a Fund will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of its taxable investment </span><span>income and capital gains that it distributes to its shareholders, provided that it satisfies a minimum distribution requirement. </span><span>To satisfy the minimum distribution requirement, a Fund must distribute to its shareholders at least the sum of (i) 90% of its </span><span>“</span><span>investment company taxable income</span><span>”</span><span> (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, income other than its net realized long-term capital gain over its net realized </span><span>short-term capital loss), plus or minus certain adjustments, and (ii) 90% of its net tax-exempt income for the taxable year. A </span><span>Fund will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates on any taxable income or gains that it does not distribute to its </span><span>shareholders. If a Fund fails to qualify for any taxable year as a RIC or fails to meet the distribution requirement, all of its </span><span>taxable income will be subject to tax at regular corporate income tax rates without any deduction for distributions to </span><span>shareholders, and such distributions generally will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends to the extent of the </span><span>Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits. In such event, distributions to individuals should be eligible to be </span><span>treated as qualified dividend income and distributions to corporate shareholders generally should be eligible for the </span><span>dividends-received deduction. Although each Fund intends to distribute substantially all of its net investment income and its </span><span>capital gains for each taxable year, a Fund may decide to retain a portion of its income or gains if the Fund determines that </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>72</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>doing so is in the interest of its shareholders. Each Fund will be subject to U.S. federal income taxation to the extent any such </span><span>income or gains are not distributed. Moreover, if a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC in any year, it must pay out its earnings and </span><span>profits accumulated in that year in order to qualify again as a RIC. If a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than </span><span>two taxable years, the Fund may be required to recognize any net built-in gains with respect to certain of its assets (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the </span><span>excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to </span><span>such assets if the Fund had been liquidated) if it qualifies as a RIC in a subsequent year.</span></div> <div><span>Short-term capital gain earned by the Underlying Fund will be ordinary income when distributed to the Fund and will not be </span><span>offset by the Fund’s capital losses. Upon the sale or other disposition by the Fund of shares of the Underlying Fund, the Fund </span><span>will realize a capital gain or loss which will be long-term or short-term, generally depending on the Fund’s holding period for </span><span>the shares; provided, however, that the </span><span>“</span><span>straddle</span><span>”</span><span> rules are generally expected to apply to the Fund's holdings of the </span><span>Underlying Fund (together with its sale of call options thereon) in a manner that would usually be expected to eliminate the </span><span>Fund's ability to recognize long-term capital gain from a sale or other disposition of such shares. Losses realized upon any </span><span>such sale or other disposition may be subject to deferral, perhaps indefinitely, as a result of the application of the </span><span>“</span><span>straddle</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>or </span><span>“</span><span>wash sale</span><span>”</span><span> rules.</span></div> <div><span>Net Capital Loss Carryforwards. </span><span> </span><span>Net capital loss carryforwards may be applied against any net realized capital gains in each </span><span>succeeding year, until they have been reduced to zero.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>In the event that a Fund were to experience an ownership change as defined under the Internal Revenue Code, the loss </span><span>carryforwards and other favorable tax attributes of a Fund</span><span> </span><span>and the Underlying Funds, if any, may be subject to limitation.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The Funds did not have tax basis net capital loss carryforwards as of October 31, 2022, the tax year-end for the Funds.</span></div> <div><span>Excise Tax. </span><span> </span><span>A Fund will be subject to a 4% excise tax on certain undistributed income if it does not distribute to its </span><span>shareholders in each calendar year at least 98% of its ordinary income for the calendar year plus at least 98.2% of its capital </span><span>gain net income for the 12 months ended October 31 of such year. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital </span><span>gain net income retained by a Fund that is subject to corporate income tax will be considered to have been distributed by </span><span>year-end. In addition, the minimum amounts that must be distributed in any year to avoid the excise tax will be increased or </span><span>decreased to reflect any underdistribution or overdistribution, as the case may be, from the previous year. Each Fund intends </span><span>to declare and distribute dividends and distributions in the amounts and at the times necessary to avoid the application of </span><span>this 4% excise tax.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Taxation of U.S. Shareholders. </span><span> </span><span>Dividends and other distributions by a Fund are generally treated under the Internal Revenue </span><span>Code as received by the shareholders at the time the dividend or distribution is made. However, any dividend or capital gain </span><span>distribution declared by a Fund in October, November or December of any calendar year and payable to shareholders of </span><span>record on a specified date in such a month shall be deemed to have been received by each shareholder on December 31 of </span><span>such calendar year and to have been paid by the Fund not later than such December 31, provided such dividend is actually </span><span>paid by the Fund during January of the following calendar year.</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund intends to distribute annually to its shareholders substantially all of its net tax-exempt income, investment </span><span>company taxable income and any net realized long-term capital gains in excess of net realized short-term capital losses </span><span>(including any capital loss carryovers). However, if a Fund retains for investment an amount equal to all or a portion of its net </span><span>long-term capital gains in excess of its net short-term capital losses (including any capital loss carryovers), it will be subject </span><span>to a corporate tax (at a flat rate of 21%) on the amount retained. In that event, the Fund will report such retained amounts as </span><span>undistributed capital gains in a notice to its shareholders who (a) will be required to include in income for U.S. federal income </span><span>tax purposes, as long-term capital gains, their proportionate shares of the undistributed amount, (b) will be entitled to credit </span><span>their proportionate shares of the tax paid by the Fund on the undistributed amount against their U.S. federal income tax </span><span>liabilities, if any, and to claim refunds to the extent their credits exceed their liabilities, if any, and (c) will be entitled to </span><span>increase their tax basis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in their shares by an amount equal to the excess of the amount </span><span>in clause (a) over the amount in clause (b). Organizations or persons not subject to U.S. federal income tax on such capital </span><span>gains will be entitled to a refund of their </span><span>pro rata</span><span> share of such taxes paid by the Fund upon filing appropriate returns or </span><span>claims for refund with the IRS.</span></div> <div><span>Distributions of net realized long-term capital gains, if any, that a Fund reports as capital gain dividends are taxable as long-term</span><span> capital gains, whether paid in cash or in shares and regardless of how long a shareholder has held shares of the Fund. </span><span>All other dividends of a Fund (including dividends from short-term capital gains) from its current and accumulated earnings </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>73</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>and profits (</span><span>“</span><span>regular dividends</span><span>”</span><span>) are generally subject to tax as ordinary income. Long-term capital gains are eligible for </span><span>taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds </span><span>certain threshold amounts.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>If an individual receives a regular dividend qualifying for the long-term capital gain rates and such dividend constitutes an </span><span>“</span><span>extraordinary dividend,</span><span>”</span><span> and the individual subsequently recognizes a loss on the sale or exchange of stock in respect of </span><span>which the extraordinary dividend was paid, then the loss will be long-term capital loss to the extent of such extraordinary </span><span>dividend. An </span><span>“</span><span>extraordinary dividend</span><span>”</span><span> on common stock for this purpose is generally a dividend (i) in an amount greater than </span><span>or equal to 10% of the taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-dividend </span><span>dates within an 85-day period, or (ii) in an amount greater than 20% of the taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share </span><span>of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates within a 365-day period.</span></div> <div><span>Distributions in excess of a Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits will, as to each shareholder, be treated as a </span><span>tax-free return of capital to the extent of a shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund, and as a capital gain thereafter (if the </span><span>shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets). Distributions in excess of a Fund’s minimum distribution </span><span>requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute </span><span>nontaxable returns of capital. Shareholders receiving dividends or distributions in the form of additional shares should be </span><span>treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as receiving a distribution in an amount equal to the amount of money that the </span><span>shareholders receiving cash dividends or distributions will receive and should have a cost basis in the shares received equal to </span><span>such amount. No deduction would be allowed to an investor for interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase </span><span>or carry shares of the Fund to the extent the interest deduction would relate to exempt-interest dividends received.</span></div> <div><span>A 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on net investment income, including, but not limited to, interest, </span><span>dividends, and net gain from investments, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and </span><span>filing jointly), and of estates and trusts.</span></div> <div><span>Investors considering buying shares just prior to a dividend or capital gain distribution should be aware that, although the </span><span>price of shares purchased at that time may reflect the amount of the forthcoming distribution, such dividend or distribution </span><span>may nevertheless be taxable to them. If a Fund is the holder of record of any security on the record date for any dividends </span><span>payable with respect to such security, such dividends will be included in the Fund’s gross income not as of the date received </span><span>but as of the later of (i) the date such security became ex-dividend with respect to such dividends (</span><span>i.e</span><span>., the date on which a </span><span>buyer of the security would not be entitled to receive the declared, but unpaid, dividends); or (ii) the date the Fund acquired </span><span>such security. Accordingly, in order to satisfy its income distribution requirements, a Fund may be required to pay dividends </span><span>based on anticipated earnings, and shareholders may receive dividends in an earlier year than would otherwise be the case.</span></div> <div><span>In certain situations, a Fund may, for a taxable year, defer all or a portion of its net capital loss (or if there is no net capital </span><span>loss, then any net long-term or short-term capital loss) realized after October and its late-year ordinary loss (defined as the </span><span>sum of the excess of post-October foreign currency and passive foreign investment company (</span><span>“</span><span>PFIC</span><span>”</span><span>) losses over post-October</span><span> foreign currency and PFIC gains, plus the excess of post-December ordinary losses over post-December ordinary </span><span>income) until the next taxable year in computing its investment company taxable income and net capital gain, which will </span><span>defer the recognition of such realized losses. Such deferrals and other rules regarding gains and losses realized after October </span><span>(or December) may affect the tax character of shareholder distributions.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Sales of Shares.</span><span>  </span><span>Upon the sale or exchange of shares of a Fund, a shareholder will realize a taxable gain or loss equal to the </span><span>difference between the amount realized and the shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund. A redemption of shares by a Fund </span><span>will be treated as a sale for this purpose. Such gain or loss will be treated as capital gain or loss if the shares are capital assets </span><span>in the shareholder’s hands and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the shares are held for more than one year and short-term</span><span> capital gain or loss if the shares are held for one year or less. Any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed </span><span>to the extent the shares disposed of are replaced, including replacement through the reinvesting of dividends or capital gains </span><span>distributions, or by an option, or contract to acquire substantially identical shares, within a 61-day period beginning 30 days </span><span>before and ending 30 days after the disposition of the shares. In such a case, the basis of the shares acquired will be </span><span>increased to reflect the disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a shareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by the shareholder </span><span>for six months or less will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any </span><span>distributions or deemed distributions of long-term capital gains received by the shareholder with respect to such share.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>If a shareholder incurs a sales charge in acquiring shares of a Fund, disposes of those shares within 90 days and then, on or </span><span>before January 31 of the following calendar year, acquires shares in a mutual fund for which the otherwise applicable sales </span><span>charge is reduced by reason of a reinvestment right (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, an exchange privilege), the original sales charge will not be taken </span><span>into account in computing gain/loss on the original shares to the extent the subsequent sales charge is reduced. Instead, the </span><span>disregarded portion of the original sales charge will be added to the tax basis of the newly acquired shares. Furthermore, the </span><span>same rule also applies to a disposition of the newly acquired shares made within 90 days of the second acquisition. This </span><span>provision prevents a shareholder from immediately deducting the sales charge by shifting his or her investment within a </span><span>family of mutual funds.</span></div> <div><span>Backup Withholding. </span><span> </span><span>In certain cases, a Fund will be required to withhold at a 24% rate and remit to the U.S. Treasury such </span><span>amounts withheld from any distributions paid to a shareholder who: (i) has failed to provide a correct taxpayer identification </span><span>number; (ii) is subject to backup withholding by the IRS; (iii) has failed to certify to a Fund that such shareholder is not </span><span>subject to backup withholding; or (iv) has not certified that such shareholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien). </span><span>Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amount withheld may be credited against a shareholder's U.S. federal </span><span>income tax liability.</span></div> <div><span>Sections 351 and 362. </span><span> </span><span>The Trust, on behalf of each Fund, has the right to reject an order for a purchase of shares of the </span><span>Fund if the purchaser (or group of purchasers) would, upon obtaining the shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the </span><span>outstanding shares of the Fund and if, pursuant to Sections 351 and 362 of the Internal Revenue Code, that Fund would have </span><span>a basis in the securities different from the market value of such securities on the date of deposit. If a Fund’s basis in such </span><span>securities on the date of deposit was less than market value on such date, the Fund, upon disposition of the securities, would </span><span>recognize more taxable gain or less taxable loss than if its basis in the securities had been equal to market value. It is not </span><span>anticipated that the Trust will exercise the right of rejection except in a case where the Trust determines that accepting the </span><span>order could result in material adverse tax consequences to a Fund or its shareholders. The Trust also has the right to require </span><span>information necessary to determine beneficial share ownership for purposes of the 80% determination.</span></div> <div><span>Taxation of Certain Derivatives.</span><span>  </span><span>A Fund’s transactions in zero coupon securities, non-U.S. currencies, forward contracts, </span><span>options and futures contracts (including options and futures contracts on non-U.S. currencies), to the extent permitted, will </span><span>be subject to special provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (including provisions relating to </span><span>“</span><span>hedging transactions</span><span>”</span><span> and </span><span>“</span><span>straddles</span><span>”</span><span>) that, among other consequences, may affect the character of gains and losses realized by the Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, may </span><span>affect whether gains or losses are ordinary or capital), accelerate recognition of income to the Fund and defer Fund losses. </span><span>These rules could therefore affect the character, amount and timing of distributions to shareholders. These provisions also </span><span>(a) will require the Fund to mark-to-market certain types of the positions in its portfolio (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, treat them as if they were closed </span><span>out at the end of each year) and (b) may cause the Fund to recognize income without receiving cash with which to pay </span><span>dividends or make distributions in amounts necessary to satisfy the distribution requirements for avoiding income and excise </span><span>taxes. The Fund will monitor its transactions, will make the appropriate tax elections and will make the appropriate entries in </span><span>its books and records when it acquires any zero coupon security, non-U.S. currency, forward contract, option, futures </span><span>contract or hedged investment in order to mitigate the effect of these rules and prevent disqualification of the Fund as a RIC. </span></div> <div><span>A Fund’s investments in so-called </span><span>“</span><span>section 1256 contracts,</span><span>”</span><span> such as regulated futures contracts, most non-U.S. currency </span><span>forward contracts traded in the interbank market and options on most security indexes, are subject to special tax rules. All </span><span>section 1256 contracts held by the Fund at the end of its taxable year are required to be marked to their market value, and </span><span>any unrealized gain or loss on those positions will be included in the Fund’s income as if each position had been sold for its </span><span>fair market value at the end of the taxable year. The resulting gain or loss will be combined with any gain or loss realized by </span><span>the Fund from positions in section 1256 contracts closed during the taxable year. Provided such positions were held as </span><span>capital assets and were not part of a </span><span>“</span><span>hedging transaction</span><span>”</span><span> nor part of a </span><span>“</span><span>straddle,</span><span>”</span><span> 60% of the resulting net gain or loss will </span><span>be treated as long-term capital gain or loss, and 40% of such net gain or loss will be treated as short-term capital gain or </span><span>loss, regardless of the period of time the positions were actually held by the Fund. </span></div> <div><span>As a result of entering into swap contracts, a Fund may make or receive periodic net payments. A Fund may also make or </span><span>receive a payment when a swap is terminated prior to maturity through an assignment of the swap or other closing </span><span>transaction. Periodic net payments will generally constitute ordinary income or deductions, while termination of a swap will </span><span>generally result in capital gain or loss (which will be a long-term capital gain or loss if the Fund has been a party to the swap </span><span>for more than one year). The cost of any payments made by the Fund on a swap transaction will be netted </span><span>pro rata</span><span> against </span><span>both tax exempt and taxable gross income. With respect to certain types of swaps, a Fund may be required to currently </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>75</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>recognize income or loss with respect to future payments on such swaps or may elect under certain circumstances to mark </span><span>such swaps to market annually for tax purposes as ordinary income or loss.</span></div> <div><span>Market Discount. </span><span> </span><span>Any market discount recognized on a bond is taxable as ordinary income. A market discount bond is a </span><span>bond acquired in the secondary market at a price below redemption value or adjusted issue price if issued with original issue </span><span>discount (</span><span>“</span><span>OID</span><span>”</span><span>). To the extent a Fund does not include the market discount in income as it accrues, gain on the Fund’s </span><span>disposition of such an obligation will be treated as ordinary income rather than capital gain to the extent of the accrued </span><span>market discount.</span></div> <div><span>Non-U.S. Investments.</span><span>  </span><span>Income (including, in some cases, capital gains) received by the Fund from investments in non-U.S. </span><span>securities may be subject to withholding and other taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain </span><span>countries and the U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes in some cases. If more than 50% of the Fund’s total assets at the </span><span>close of its taxable year consists of securities of non-U.S. corporations, the Fund may elect for U.S. income tax purposes to </span><span>treat non-U.S. income taxes paid by it as paid by its shareholders. The Fund may qualify for and make this election in some, </span><span>but not necessarily all, of its taxable years. If the Fund were to make an election, shareholders of the Fund would be required </span><span>to take into account an amount equal to their </span><span>pro rata</span><span> portions of such non-U.S. taxes in computing their taxable income and </span><span>then treat an amount equal to those non-U.S. taxes as a U.S. federal income tax deduction or as a foreign tax credit against </span><span>their U.S. federal income taxes. Shortly after any year for which it makes such an election, the Fund will report to its </span><span>shareholders the amount per share of such non-U.S. income tax that must be included in each shareholder’s gross income </span><span>and the amount which will be available for the deduction or credit. No deduction for non-U.S. taxes may be claimed by a </span><span>shareholder who does not itemize deductions. Certain limitations will be imposed on the extent to which the credit (but not </span><span>the deduction) for non-U.S. taxes may be claimed. </span></div> <div><span>Under Section 988 of the Internal Revenue Code, gains or losses attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the </span><span>time the Fund accrues income or receivables or expenses or other liabilities denominated in a non-U.S. currency and the time </span><span>the Fund actually collects such income or pays such liabilities are generally treated as ordinary income or ordinary loss. In </span><span>general, gains (and losses) realized on debt instruments will be treated as Section 988 gain (or loss) to the extent attributable </span><span>to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which the instruments are denominated. Similarly, </span><span>gain or losses on non-U.S. currency, non-U.S. currency forward contracts, certain non-U.S. currency options or futures </span><span>contracts and the disposition of debt securities denominated in non-U.S. currency, to the extent attributable to fluctuations in </span><span>exchange rates between the acquisition and disposition dates, are also treated as ordinary income or loss unless the Fund </span><span>were to elect otherwise.</span></div> <div><span>The Underlying Fund, if invested in non-U.S. securities, may be subject to non-U.S. income taxes and non U.S. financial </span><span>transactions taxes. Each Underlying Fund that is permitted to do so may elect to </span><span>“</span><span>pass through</span><span>”</span><span> to its investors, including the </span><span>Fund, the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid by the Underlying Fund. The Fund itself will be eligible to elect to </span><span>“</span><span>pass </span><span>through</span><span>”</span><span> such amounts to its stockholders and may do so, depending upon circumstances.</span></div> <div><span>Original Issue Discount. </span><span> </span><span>OID on tax-exempt bonds is recognized over the term of the bond and is tax-exempt to the holder </span><span>of the bond. Special U.S. federal income tax rules apply to inflation-indexed bonds. Generally, all stated interest on such </span><span>bonds is taken into income by a Fund under its regular method of accounting for interest income. The amount of a positive </span><span>inflation adjustment, which results in an increase in the inflation-adjusted principal amount of the bond, is treated as OID. </span><span>The OID is included in a Fund’s gross income ratably during the period ending with the maturity of the bond, under the </span><span>general OID inclusion rules. The amount of a Fund’s OID in a taxable year with respect to a bond will increase a Fund’s </span><span>taxable income for such year without a corresponding receipt of cash, until the bond matures. As a result, a Fund may need </span><span>to use other sources of cash to satisfy its distributions for such year. The amount of negative inflation adjustment, which </span><span>results in a decrease in the inflation-adjusted principal amount of the bond, reduces the amount of interest (including stated, </span><span>interest, OID, and market discount, if any) otherwise includible in a Fund’s income with respect to the bond for the taxable </span><span>year.</span></div> <div><span>Reporting.</span><span>  </span><span>If a shareholder recognizes a loss with respect to a Fund’s shares of $2 million or more for an individual </span><span>shareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate shareholder, the shareholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement </span><span>on IRS Form 8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases exempted from this reporting requirement, </span><span>but under current guidance, shareholders of a RIC are not exempted. The fact that a loss is reportable under these </span><span>regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer’s treatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders </span><span>should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual circumstances.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>76</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Other Taxes. </span><span> </span><span>Dividends, distributions and redemption proceeds may also be subject to additional state, local and non-U.S. </span><span>taxes depending on each shareholder’s particular situation.</span></div> <div><span>Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders. </span><span> </span><span>Dividends paid by a Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are generally subject to withholding </span><span>tax at a 30% rate or a reduced rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty to the extent derived from investment income </span><span>and short-term capital gains. Dividends paid by a Fund from net tax-exempt income or long-term capital gains are generally </span><span>not subject to such withholding tax. In order to obtain a reduced rate of withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder will be required </span><span>to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying its entitlement to benefits under a treaty. The withholding </span><span>tax does not apply to regular dividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who provides an IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that the </span><span>dividends are effectively connected with the non-U.S. shareholder’s conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. Instead, </span><span>the effectively connected dividends will be subject to regular U.S. income tax as if the non-U.S. shareholder were a U.S. </span><span>shareholder. A non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively connected dividends may also be subject to additional </span><span>“</span><span>branch </span><span>profits tax</span><span>”</span><span> imposed at a rate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S. shareholder who fails to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN, </span><span>IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable form may be subject to backup withholding at the appropriate rate.</span></div> <div><span>Properly-reported dividends are generally exempt from U.S. federal withholding tax where they (i) are paid in respect of a </span><span>Fund’s </span><span>“</span><span>qualified net interest income</span><span>”</span><span> (generally, a Fund’s U.S. source interest income, other than certain contingent interest </span><span>and interest from obligations of a corporation or partnership in which a Fund is at least a 10% shareholder or partner, </span><span>reduced by expenses that are allocable to such income); or (ii) are paid in respect of a Fund’s </span><span>“</span><span>qualified short-term capital </span><span>gains</span><span>”</span><span> (generally, the excess of a Fund’s net short-term capital gain over a Fund’s long-term capital loss for such taxable </span><span>year). However, depending on its circumstances, a Fund may report all, some or none of its potentially eligible dividends as </span><span>such qualified net interest income or as qualified short-term capital gains and/or treat such dividends, in whole or in part, as </span><span>ineligible for this exemption from withholding. In order to qualify for this exemption from withholding, a non-U.S. </span><span>shareholder will need to comply with applicable certification requirements relating to its non-U.S. status (including, in </span><span>general, furnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or substitute Form). In the case of shares held through an </span><span>intermediary, the intermediary may withhold even if a Fund reports the payment as qualified net interest income or qualified </span><span>short-term capital gain. Non-U.S. shareholders should contact their intermediaries with respect to the application of these </span><span>rules to their accounts.</span></div> <div><span>Special rules may apply to a foreign shareholder receiving a Fund distribution if at least 50% of the Fund's assets consist of </span><span>interests in U.S. real property interests, including certain REITs and U.S. real property holding corporations (as defined in the </span><span>Internal Revenue Code and Treasury regulations). Fund distributions that are attributable to gain from the disposition of a </span><span>U.S. real property interest will be taxable as ordinary dividends and subject to withholding at a 30% or lower treaty rate if the </span><span>foreign shareholder held no more than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of </span><span>the distribution. If the foreign shareholder held at least 5% of the Fund's shares, the distribution would be treated as income </span><span>effectively connected with a trade or business within the U.S. and the foreign shareholder would be subject to withholding </span><span>tax at a rate of 21% and would generally be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return.</span></div> <div><span>Similar consequences would generally apply to a foreign shareholder's gain on the sale of Fund shares unless the Fund is </span><span>domestically controlled (meaning that more than 50% of the value of the Fund's shares is held by U.S. shareholders) or the </span><span>foreign shareholder owns no more than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of </span><span>sale. Finally, a domestically controlled Fund may be required to recognize a portion of its gain on the in-kind distribution of </span><span>certain U.S. real property interests. Shareholders that are nonresident aliens or foreign entities are urged to consult their own </span><span>tax advisors concerning the particular tax consequences to them of an investment in the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>The rules laid out in the previous paragraph, other than the withholding rules, will apply notwithstanding the Fund’s </span><span>participation in a wash sale transaction or its payment of a substitute dividend.</span></div> <div><span>Shareholders that are nonresident aliens or foreign entities are urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning the </span><span>particular tax consequences to them of an investment in a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items paid to: (i) </span><span>foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS </span><span>information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify </span><span>certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will </span><span>need to: (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information including the names, </span><span>addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders; comply with due diligence </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>77</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Introduction to BlackRock</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock’s purpose is to help more and more people experience financial well-being. We manage assets on behalf of </span><span>institutional and individual clients, across a full spectrum of investment strategies, asset classes, and regions. Our client base </span><span>includes pension plans, endowments, foundations, charities, official institutions, insurers, and other financial institutions, as </span><span>well as individuals around the world. As part of our fiduciary duty to our clients, we consider it one of our responsibilities to </span><span>promote sound corporate governance, as an informed, engaged shareholder on their behalf. At BlackRock, this is the </span><span>responsibility of the Investment Stewardship team.</span></div> <div><span>Philosophy on investment stewardship</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Companies are responsible for ensuring they have appropriate governance structures to serve the interests of shareholders </span><span>and other key stakeholders. We believe that there are certain fundamental rights attached to shareholding. Companies and </span><span>their boards should be accountable to shareholders and structured with appropriate checks and balances to ensure that they </span><span>operate in shareholders’ best interests to create sustainable value. Shareholders should have the right to vote to elect, </span><span>remove, and nominate directors, approve the appointment of the auditor, and amend the corporate charter or by-laws. </span><span>Shareholders should be able to vote on key board decisions that are material to the protection of their investment, including </span><span>but not limited to, changes to the purpose of the business, dilution levels and pre-emptive rights, and the distribution of </span><span>income and capital structure. In order to make informed decisions, shareholders need sufficient and timely information. In </span><span>addition, shareholder voting rights should be proportionate to their economic ownership—the principle of </span><span>“</span><span>one share, one </span><span>vote</span><span>”</span><span> helps achieve this balance.</span></div> <div><span>Consistent with these shareholder rights, BlackRock has a responsibility to monitor and provide feedback to companies in our </span><span>role as stewards of our clients’ investments. Investment stewardship is how we use our voice as an investor to promote </span><span>sound corporate governance and business practices to help maximize long-term shareholder value for our clients, the vast </span><span>majority of whom are investing for long-term goals such as retirement. BlackRock Investment Stewardship (BIS) does this </span><span>through engagement with management teams and/or board members on material business issues and, for those clients </span><span>who have given us authority, through voting proxies in their best long-term financial interests.</span><span>1</span><span> We also contribute to </span><span>consultations on public policy and private sector initiatives on industry standards, consistent with our clients’ interests as </span><span>long-term shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock looks to companies to provide timely, accurate, and comprehensive disclosure on all material governance and </span><span>business matters. This transparency allows shareholders to appropriately understand and assess how relevant risks and </span><span>opportunities are being effectively identified and managed. Where company reporting and disclosure is inadequate or where </span><span>the governance approach taken may be inconsistent with durable, long-term value creation for shareholders, we will engage </span><span>with a company and/or vote in a manner that advances long-term shareholders’ interests.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock views engagement as an important activity; engagement provides us with the opportunity to improve our </span><span>understanding of the business and of the risks and opportunities that are material to the companies in which our clients </span><span>invest. Engagement may also inform our voting decisions. As long-term investors on behalf of clients, we seek to have regular </span><span>and continuing dialogue with executives and board directors to advance sound governance and durable business practices </span><span>aligned with long-term value creation, as well as to understand the effectiveness of the company’s management and </span><span>oversight of material issues. Engagement is an important mechanism for providing feedback on company practices and </span><span>disclosures, particularly where we believe they could be enhanced to support a company’s ability to deliver financial </span><span>performance. Similarly, it provides us with an opportunity to hear directly from company boards and management on how </span><span>they believe their actions are aligned with durable, long-term value creation.</span></div> <div><span>We generally vote in support of management and boards that exhibit an approach to decision-making that is consistent with </span><span>creating durable, long-term value for shareholders. If we have concerns about a company’s approach, we may choose to </span><span>explain our expectations to the company’s board and management. Following that engagement, we may signal through our </span><span>voting that we have outstanding concerns, generally by voting against the re-election of directors we view as having </span><span>responsibility for an issue. We apply our regional proxy voting guidelines to achieve the outcome that is most aligned with </span><span>our clients’ long-term financial interests.</span></div> <div><span>Key Themes</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> <div><span>Through BlackRock Voting Choice we have, since January 2022, made proxy voting easier and more accessible for investors in separate accounts and </span><span>certain pooled vehicles. As a result, the shares attributed to BlackRock in company share registers may be voted differently depending on whether our </span><span>clients have authorized BIS to vote on their behalf, have authorized BIS to vote in accordance with a third party policy, or have elected to vote shares in </span><span>accordance with their own policy. We are not able to disclose which clients have opted to exercise greater control over their voting, nor are we able to </span><span>disclose which proxy voting policies they have selected.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>We recognize that accepted standards and norms of corporate governance can differ between markets. However, in our </span><span>experience, there are certain fundamental elements of governance practice that are intrinsic globally to a company’s ability to </span><span>create long-term value for shareholders. These global themes are set out in this overarching set of principles (the Principles), </span><span>which are anchored in transparency and accountability. At a minimum, it is our view that companies should observe the </span><span>accepted corporate governance standards in their domestic market and ask that, if they do not, they explain how their </span><span>approach better supports durable, long-term value creation.</span></div> <div><span>These Principles cover seven key themes:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Boards and directors</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Auditors and audit-related issues</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Capital structure, mergers, asset sales, and other special transactions</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Compensation and benefits</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Material sustainability-related risks and opportunities</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Other corporate governance matters and shareholder protections</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Shareholder proposals</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>Our regional and market-specific </span><span>voting guidelines</span><span> explain how these Principles inform our voting decisions in relation to </span><span>specific ballot items for shareholder meetings.</span></div> <div><span>Boards and directors</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Our primary focus is on the performance of the board of directors to promote sound corporate governance. The performance </span><span>of the board is critical to the economic success of the company and the protection of shareholders’ interests. As part of their </span><span>responsibilities, board members owe fiduciary duties to shareholders in overseeing the strategic direction and operation of </span><span>the company. For this reason, BIS sees engaging with and the election of directors as one of our most important and </span><span>impactful responsibilities.</span></div> <div><span>We support boards whose approach is consistent with creating durable, long-term value. This includes the effective </span><span>corporate governance and management of material sustainability-related risks and opportunities,</span><span>2</span><span> as well as the </span><span>consideration of the company’s key constituents including their employees, clients, suppliers, and the communities within </span><span>which they operate. The board should establish and maintain a framework of robust and effective governance mechanisms </span><span>to support its oversight of the company’s strategic aims. We look to the board to articulate the effectiveness of these </span><span>mechanisms in overseeing the management of business risks and opportunities and the fulfillment of the company’s </span><span>purpose. Disclosure of all material issues that affect the company’s long-term strategy and ability to create value is essential </span><span>for shareholders to be able to appropriately understand and assess how risks are effectively identified, managed and </span><span>mitigated.</span></div> <div><span>Where a company has not adequately disclosed and demonstrated that they have fulfilled these responsibilities, we will </span><span>consider voting against the re-election of directors whom we consider to have particular responsibility for the issue. We </span><span>assess director performance on a case-by-case basis and in light of each company’s circumstances, taking into consideration </span><span>our assessment of their governance, business practices that support durable, long-term value creation, and performance. In </span><span>serving the interests of shareholders, the responsibility of the board of directors includes, but is not limited to, the following:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Establishing an appropriate corporate governance structure</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Supporting and overseeing management in setting long-term strategic goals and applicable measures of value-creation </span><span>and milestones that will demonstrate progress, and taking steps to address anticipated or actual obstacles to success</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Providing oversight on the identification and management of material governance and sustainability-related risks</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> <div><span>By material sustainability-related risks and opportunities, we mean the drivers of risk and value creation in a company’s business model that have an </span><span>environmental or social dependency or impact. Examples of environmental issues include, but are not limited to, water use, land use, waste </span><span>management and climate risk. Examples of social issues include, but are not limited to, human capital management, impacts on the communities in </span><span>which a company operates, customer loyalty and relationships with regulators. It is our view that well-managed companies will effectively evaluate </span><span>and manage material sustainability-related risks and opportunities relevant to their businesses. Governance is the core means by which boards can </span><span>oversee the creation of durable, long-term value. Appropriate risk oversight of business-relevant and material sustainability-related considerations is a </span><span>component of a sound governance framework.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

Set out below are ways in which boards and directors can demonstrate a commitment to acting in the </span><span>best long-term economic interests of all shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>We will seek to engage with the appropriate directors where we have concerns about the performance of the company, </span><span>board, or individual directors and may signal outstanding concerns in our voting. While we consider these principles to be </span><span>globally relevant, when assessing a board’s composition and governance processes, we consider local market norms and </span><span>regulations.</span></div> <div><span>Regular accountability</span></div> <div><span>It is our view that directors should stand for re-election on a regular basis, ideally annually. In our experience, annual re-elections</span><span> allow shareholders to reaffirm their support for board members or hold them accountable for their decisions in a </span><span>timely manner. When board members are not re-elected annually, in our experience, it is good practice for boards to have a </span><span>rotation policy to ensure that, through a board cycle, all directors have had their appointment re-confirmed, with a </span><span>proportion of directors being put forward for re-election at each annual general meeting.</span></div> <div><span>Effective board composition</span></div> <div><span>Regular director elections also give boards the opportunity to adjust their composition in an orderly way to reflect the </span><span>evolution of the company’s strategy and the market environment. In our view, it is beneficial for new directors to be brought </span><span>onto the board periodically to refresh the group’s thinking and in a manner that supports both continuity and appropriate </span><span>succession planning. We consider the average overall tenure of the board, where we are seeking a balance between the </span><span>knowledge and experience of longer-serving members and the fresh perspectives of newer members. We encourage </span><span>companies to keep under regular review the effectiveness of their board (including its size), and assess directors nominated </span><span>for election or re-election in the context of the composition of the board as a whole. This assessment should consider a </span><span>number of factors, including the potential need to address gaps in skills, experience, independence, and diversity.</span></div> <div><span>In our view, there should be a sufficient number of independent directors, free from conflicts of interest or undue influence </span><span>from connected parties, to ensure objectivity in the decision-making of the board and its ability to oversee management. </span><span>Common impediments to independence may include but are not limited to:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Current or recent employment at the company or subsidiary</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Being, or representing, a shareholder with a substantial shareholding in the company</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Interlocking directorships</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Having any other interest, business or other relationship which could, or could reasonably be perceived to, materially </span><span>interfere with a director’s ability to act in the best interests of the company and their shareholders</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>In our experience, boards are most effective at overseeing and advising management when there is a senior independent </span><span>board leader. This director may chair the board, or, where the chair is also the CEO (or is otherwise not independent), be </span><span>designated as a lead independent director. The role of this director is to enhance the effectiveness of the independent </span><span>members of the board through shaping the agenda, ensuring adequate information is provided to the board, and </span><span>encouraging independent director participation in board deliberations. The lead independent director or another appropriate </span><span>director should be available to shareholders in those situations where an independent director is best placed to explain and </span><span>contextualize a company’s approach.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> <div><span>Enterprise risk management is a process, effected by the entity’s board of directors, management, and other personnel, applied in strategy setting and </span><span>across the enterprise, designed to identify potential events that may affect the entity, and manage risk to be within the risk appetite, to provide </span><span>reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives.

<p> </p>
<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>When nominating new directors to the board, we look to companies to provide sufficient information on the individual </span><span>candidates so that shareholders can assess the suitability of each individual nominee and the overall board composition. </span><span>These disclosures should give an understanding of how the collective experience and expertise of the board aligns with the </span><span>company’s long-term strategy and business model. Highly qualified, engaged directors with professional characteristics </span><span>relevant to a company’s business enhance the ability of the board to add value and be the voice of shareholders in board </span><span>discussions. In our view, a strong board provides a competitive advantage to a company, providing valuable oversight and </span><span>contributing to the most important management decisions that support long-term financial performance.</span></div> <div><span>It is in this context that we are interested in diversity in the board room. We see it as a means to promoting diversity of </span><span>thought and avoiding </span><span>“</span><span>group think</span><span>”</span><span> in the board’s exercise of its responsibilities to advise and oversee management. It allows </span><span>boards to have deeper discussions and make more resilient decisions. We ask boards to disclose how diversity is considered </span><span>in board composition, including professional characteristics, such as a director’s industry experience, specialist areas of </span><span>expertise and geographic location; as well as demographic characteristics such as gender, race/ethnicity and age.</span></div> <div><span>We look to understand a board’s diversity in the context of a company’s domicile, market capitalization, business model and </span><span>strategy. Increasingly, we see leading boards adding members whose experience deepens the board’s understanding of the </span><span>company’s customers, employees and communities. Self-identified board demographic diversity can usefully be disclosed in </span><span>aggregate, consistent with local law. We believe boards should aspire to meaningful diversity of membership, at least </span><span>consistent with local regulatory requirements and best practices, while recognizing that building a strong, diverse board can </span><span>take time.</span></div> <div><span>This position is based on our view that diversity of perspective and thought – in the board room, in the management team </span><span>and throughout the company – leads to better long term economic outcomes for companies. Academic research already </span><span>reveals correlations between specific dimensions of diversity and effects on decision-making processes and outcomes.</span><span>4</span><span> In </span><span>our experience, greater diversity in the board room contributes to more robust discussions and more innovative and resilient </span><span>decisions. Over time, greater diversity in the board room can also promote greater diversity and resilience in the leadership </span><span>team, and the workforce more broadly. That diversity can enable companies to develop businesses that more closely reflect </span><span>and resonate with the customers and communities they serve.</span></div> <div><span>There are matters for which the board has responsibility that may involve a conflict of interest for executives or for affiliated </span><span>directors. It is our view that objective oversight of such matters is best achieved when the board forms committees </span><span>comprised entirely of independent directors. In many markets, these committees of the board specialize in audit, director </span><span>nominations, and compensation matters. An ad hoc committee might also be formed to decide on a special transaction, </span><span>particularly one involving a related party, or to investigate a significant adverse event.</span></div> <div><span>Sufficient capacity</span></div> <div><span>As the role and expectations of a director are increasingly demanding, directors must be able to commit an appropriate </span><span>amount of time to board and committee matters. It is important that directors have the capacity to meet all of their </span><span>responsibilities - including when there are unforeseen events – and therefore, they should not take on an excessive number of </span><span>roles that would impair their ability to fulfill their duties.</span></div> <div><span>Auditors and audit-related issues</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock recognizes the critical importance of financial statements, which should provide a true and fair picture of a </span><span>company’s financial condition. Accordingly, the assumptions made by management and reviewed by the auditor in preparing </span><span>the financial statements should be reasonable and justified.</span></div> <div><span>The accuracy of financial statements, inclusive of financial and non-financial information as required or permitted under </span><span>market-specific accounting rules, is of paramount importance to BlackRock. Investors increasingly recognize that a broader </span><span>range of risks and opportunities have the potential to materially impact financial performance. Over time, we anticipate </span><span>investors and other users of company reporting will increasingly seek to understand and scrutinize the assumptions </span><span>underlying financial statements, particularly those that pertain to the impact of the transition to a low carbon economy on a </span><span>company’s business model and asset mix. We recognize that this is an area of evolving practice and we look to international </span><span>standards setters, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International Auditing and Assurance </span><span>Standards Board (IAASB) to provide additional guidance to companies.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> <div><span>For a discussion on the different impacts of diversity see: McKinsey, </span><span>“</span><span>Diversity Wins: How Inclusion Matters</span><span>”</span><span>, May 2022; Harvard Business Review, </span><span>Diverse Teams Feel Less Comfortable – and That’s Why They Perform Better, September 2016; </span><span>“</span><span>Do Diverse Directors Influence DEI Outcomes</span><span>”</span><span>, </span><span>September 2022.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-7</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>In this context, audit committees, or equivalent, play a vital role in a company’s financial reporting system by providing </span><span>independent oversight of the accounts, material financial and, where appropriate to the jurisdiction, non-financial </span><span>information, internal control frameworks, and in the absence of a dedicated risk committee, Enterprise Risk Management </span><span>systems. In our view, effective audit committee oversight strengthens the quality and reliability of a company’s financial </span><span>statements and provides an important level of reassurance to shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>We hold members of the audit committee or equivalent responsible for overseeing the management of the audit function. </span><span>Audit committees or equivalent should have clearly articulated charters that set out their responsibilities and have a rotation </span><span>plan in place that allows for a periodic refreshment of the committee membership to introduce fresh perspectives to audit </span><span>oversight. We recognize that audit committees will rely on management, internal audit and the independent auditor in </span><span>fulfilling their responsibilities but look to committee members to demonstrate they have relevant expertise to monitor and </span><span>oversee those functions.</span></div> <div><span>We take particular note of unexplained changes in reporting methodology, cases involving significant financial restatements, </span><span>or ad hoc notifications of material financial weakness. In this respect, audit committees should provide timely disclosure on </span><span>the remediation of Key and Critical Audit Matters identified either by the external auditor or internal audit function.</span></div> <div><span>The integrity of financial statements depends on the auditor being free of any impediments to being an effective check on </span><span>management. To that end, it is important that auditors are, and are seen to be, independent. Where an audit firm provides </span><span>services to the company in addition to the audit, the fees earned should be disclosed and explained. Audit committees </span><span>should have in place a procedure for assessing annually the independence of the auditor and the quality of the external audit </span><span>process.</span></div> <div><span>Comprehensive disclosure provides investors with a sense of the company’s long-term operational risk management </span><span>practices and, more broadly, the quality of the board’s oversight. The audit committee or equivalent, or a dedicated risk </span><span>committee, should periodically review the company’s risk assessment and risk management policies and the significant risks </span><span>and exposures identified by management, the internal auditors or the independent accountants, and management’s steps to </span><span>address them. In the absence of robust disclosures, we may reasonably conclude that companies are not adequately </span><span>managing risk.</span></div> <div><span>Capital structure, mergers, asset sales, and other special transactions</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The capital structure of a company is critical to shareholders as it impacts the value of their investment and the priority of </span><span>their interest in the company relative to that of other equity or debt investors. Pre-emptive rights are a key protection for </span><span>shareholders against the dilution of their interests.</span></div> <div><span>Effective voting rights are basic rights of share ownership. It is our view that one vote for one share as a guiding principle </span><span>supports effective corporate governance. Shareholders, as the residual claimants, have the strongest interest in protecting </span><span>company value, and voting rights should match economic exposure.</span></div> <div><span>In principle, we disagree with the creation of a share class with equivalent economic exposure and preferential, differentiated </span><span>voting rights. In our view, this structure violates the fundamental corporate governance principle of proportionality and </span><span>results in a concentration of power in the hands of a few shareholders, thus disenfranchising other shareholders and </span><span>amplifying any potential conflicts of interest. However, we recognize that in certain markets, at least for a period of time, </span><span>companies may have a valid argument for listing dual classes of shares with differentiated voting rights. In our view, such </span><span>companies should review these share class structures on a regular basis or as company circumstances change.</span></div> <div><span>Additionally, they should seek shareholder approval of their capital structure on a periodic basis via a management proposal </span><span>at the company’s shareholder meeting. The proposal should give unaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to affirm the </span><span>current structure or establish mechanisms to end or phase out controlling structures at the appropriate time, while </span><span>minimizing costs to shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>In assessing mergers, asset sales, or other special transactions, BlackRock’s primary consideration is the long-term economic </span><span>interests of our clients as shareholders. Boards proposing a transaction need to clearly explain the economic and strategic </span><span>rationale behind it. We will review a proposed transaction to determine the degree to which it can enhance long-term </span><span>shareholder value. We would prefer that proposed transactions have the unanimous support of the board and have been </span><span>negotiated at arm’s length. We may seek reassurance from the board that executives’ and/or board members’ financial </span><span>interests in a given transaction have not adversely affected their ability to place shareholders’ interests before their own. </span><span>Where the transaction involves related parties, the recommendation to support should come from the independent directors, </span><span>a best practice in most markets, and ideally, the terms should have been assessed through an independent appraisal process. </span><span>In addition, it is good practice that it be approved by a separate vote of the non-conflicted parties.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>As a matter of sound governance practice, shareholders should have a right to dispose of company shares in the open </span><span>market without unnecessary restriction. In our view, corporate mechanisms designed to limit shareholders’ ability to sell their </span><span>shares are contrary to basic property rights. Such mechanisms can serve to protect and entrench interests other than those </span><span>of the shareholders. In our experience, shareholders are broadly capable of making decisions in their own best interests. We </span><span>encourage any so-called </span><span>“</span><span>shareholder rights plans</span><span>”</span><span> proposed by a board to be subject to shareholder approval upon </span><span>introduction and periodically thereafter.</span></div> <div><span>Compensation and benefits</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>In most markets, one of the most important roles for a company’s board of directors is to put in place a compensation </span><span>structure that incentivizes and rewards executives appropriately. There should be a clear link between variable pay and </span><span>operational and financial performance. Performance metrics should be stretching and aligned with a company’s strategy and </span><span>business model. BIS does not have a position on the use of sustainability-related criteria, but in our view, where companies </span><span>choose to include them, they should be as rigorous as other financial or operational targets. Long-term incentive plans </span><span>should vest over timeframes aligned with the delivery of long-term shareholder value. Compensation committees should </span><span>guard against contractual arrangements that would entitle executives to material compensation for early termination of their </span><span>employment. Finally, pension contributions and other deferred compensation arrangements should be reasonable in light of </span><span>market practice.</span></div> <div><span>We are not supportive of one-off or special bonuses unrelated to company or individual performance. Where discretion has </span><span>been used by the compensation committee or its equivalent, we expect disclosure relating to how and why the discretion </span><span>was used, and how the adjusted outcome is aligned with the interests of shareholders. We acknowledge that the use of peer </span><span>group evaluation by compensation committees can help ensure competitive pay; however, we are concerned when the </span><span>rationale for increases in total compensation at a company is solely based on peer benchmarking rather than a rigorous </span><span>measure of outperformance. We encourage companies to clearly explain how compensation outcomes have rewarded </span><span>outperformance against peer firms.</span></div> <div><span>We believe consideration should be given to building claw back provisions into incentive plans such that executives would be </span><span>required to forgo rewards when they are not justified by actual performance and/or when compensation was based on faulty </span><span>financial reporting or deceptive business practices. We also favor recoupment from any senior executive whose behavior </span><span>caused material financial harm to shareholders, material reputational risk to the company, or resulted in a criminal </span><span>investigation, even if such actions did not ultimately result in a material restatement of past results.</span></div> <div><span>Non-executive directors should be compensated in a manner that is commensurate with the time and effort expended in </span><span>fulfilling their professional responsibilities. Additionally, these compensation arrangements should not risk compromising </span><span>directors’ independence or aligning their interests too closely with those of the management, whom they are charged with </span><span>overseeing.</span></div> <div><span>We use third party research, in addition to our own analysis, to evaluate existing and proposed compensation structures. We </span><span>may vote against members of the compensation committee or equivalent board members for poor compensation practices </span><span>or structures.</span></div> <div><span>Material sustainability-related risks and opportunities</span></div> <div><span>It is our view that well-managed companies will effectively evaluate and manage material sustainability-related risks and </span><span>opportunities relevant to their businesses. Appropriate oversight of sustainability considerations is a core component of </span><span>having an effective governance framework, which supports durable, long-term value creation.</span></div> <div><span>Robust disclosure is essential for investors to effectively evaluate companies’ strategy and business practices related to </span><span>material sustainability-related risks and opportunities. Given the increased understanding of material sustainability-related </span><span>risks and opportunities and the need for better information to assess them, BlackRock advocates for continued improvement </span><span>in companies’ reporting, where necessary, and will express any concerns through our voting where a company’s actions or </span><span>disclosures are inadequate.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock encourages companies to use the framework developed by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial </span><span>Disclosures (TCFD) to disclose their approach to ensuring they have a sustainable business model and to supplement that </span><span>disclosure with industry-specific metrics such as those identified by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), </span><span>now part of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) under the International Financial Reporting Standards </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-9</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

SASB’s industry-specific </span><span>guidance (as identified in its materiality map) is beneficial in helping companies identify key performance indicators (KPIs) </span><span>across various dimensions of sustainability that are considered to be financially material and decision-useful within their </span><span>industry. In particular, we encourage companies to consider reporting on nature-related factors, given the growing materiality </span><span>of these issues for many businesses.</span><span>6</span><span> We recognize that some companies may report using different standards, which may </span><span>be required by regulation, or one of a number of voluntary standards. In such cases, we ask that companies highlight the </span><span>metrics that are industry- or company-specific.</span></div> <div><span>Climate and other sustainability-related disclosures often require companies to collect and aggregate data from various </span><span>internal and external sources. We recognize that the practical realities of data-collection and reporting may not line up with </span><span>financial reporting cycles and companies may require additional time after their fiscal year-end to accurately collect, analyze </span><span>and report this data to investors. To give investors time to assess the data, we encourage companies to produce climate and </span><span>other sustainability-related disclosures sufficiently in advance of their annual meeting.</span></div> <div><span>Companies may also adopt or refer to guidance on sustainable and responsible business conduct issued by supranational </span><span>organizations such as the United Nations or the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Further, industry </span><span>initiatives on managing specific operational risks may provide useful guidance to companies on best practices and </span><span>disclosures. Companies should disclose any relevant global climate and other sustainability-related standards adopted, the </span><span>industry initiatives in which they participate, any peer group benchmarking undertaken, and any assurance processes to help </span><span>investors understand their approach to sustainable and responsible business practices.</span></div> <div><span>Climate risk</span></div> <div><span>It is our view that climate change has become a key factor in many companies’ long-term prospects. As such, as long-term </span><span>investors we are interested in understanding how companies may be impacted by material climate-related risks and </span><span>opportunities – just as we seek to understand other business-relevant risks and opportunities – and how these factors are </span><span>considered within strategy in a manner consistent with the company’s business model and sector. Specifically, we look for </span><span>companies to disclose strategies they have in place that mitigate and are resilient to any material risks to their long-term </span><span>business model associated with a range of climate-related scenarios, including a scenario in which global warming is limited </span><span>to well below 2°C, considering global ambitions to achieve a limit of 1.5°C.</span><span>7</span><span> It is, of course, up to each company to define </span><span>their own strategy: that is not the role of BlackRock or other investors.</span></div> <div><span>BIS recognizes that climate change can be challenging for many companies, as they seek to drive long-term value by </span><span>mitigating risks and capturing opportunities. A growing number of companies, financial institutions, as well as governments, </span><span>have committed to advancing decarbonization in line with the Paris Agreement. There is growing consensus that companies </span><span>can benefit from the more favorable macro-economic environment under an orderly, timely and equitable global energy </span><span>transition.</span><span>8</span><span> Yet the path ahead is deeply uncertain and uneven, with different parts of the economy moving at different </span><span>speeds.</span><span>9</span><span> Many companies are asking what their role should be in contributing to an orderly and equitable transition – in </span><span>ensuring a reliable energy supply and energy security, and in protecting the most vulnerable from energy price shocks and </span><span>economic dislocation. In this context, we encourage companies to include in their disclosure a business plan for how they </span><span>intend to deliver long-term financial performance through a transition to global net zero carbon emissions, consistent with </span><span>their business model and sector.</span></div> <div><span>We look to companies to disclose short-, medium- and long-term targets, ideally science-based targets where these are </span><span>available for their sector, for Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reductions and to demonstrate how their </span><span>targets are consistent with the long-term economic interests of their shareholders.

We also recognize that continued investment in traditional energy sources, including oil and </span><span>gas, is required to maintain an orderly and equitable transition — and that divestiture of carbon-intensive assets is unlikely to </span><span>contribute to global emissions reductions. We encourage companies to disclose how their capital allocation to various energy </span><span>sources is consistent with their strategy.</span></div> <div><span>At this stage, we view Scope 3 emissions differently from Scopes 1 and 2, given methodological complexity, regulatory </span><span>uncertainty, concerns about double-counting, and lack of direct control by companies. While we welcome any disclosures </span><span>and commitments companies choose to make regarding Scope 3 emissions, we recognize these are provided on a good-faith </span><span>basis as methodology develops. Our publicly available commentary provides more information on our approach to climate </span><span>risk.</span></div> <div><span>Key stakeholder interests</span></div> <div><span>In order to advance long-term shareholders’ interests, companies should consider the interests of the various parties on </span><span>whom they depend for their success over time. It is for each company to determine their key stakeholders based on what is </span><span>material to their business and long-term financial performance. Most commonly, key stakeholders include employees, </span><span>business partners (such as suppliers and distributors), clients and consumers, regulators, and the communities in which they </span><span>operate.</span></div> <div><span>Considering the interests of key stakeholders recognizes the collective nature of long-term value creation and the extent to </span><span>which each company’s prospects for growth are tied to its ability to foster strong sustainable relationships with and support </span><span>from those stakeholders. Companies should articulate how they address adverse impacts that could arise from their business </span><span>practices and affect critical business relationships with their stakeholders. We encourage companies to implement, to the </span><span>extent appropriate, monitoring processes (often referred to as due diligence) to identify and mitigate potential adverse </span><span>impacts and grievance mechanisms to remediate any actual adverse material impacts. In our view, maintaining trust within </span><span>these relationships can contribute to a company’s long-term success.</span></div> <div><span>As a long-term shareholder on behalf of our clients, we find it helpful when companies disclose how they have identified </span><span>their key stakeholders and considered their interests in business decision-making. We are also interested to understand the </span><span>role of the board, which is well positioned to ensure that the approach taken is informed by and aligns with the company’s </span><span>strategy and purpose.</span></div> <div><span>Other corporate governance matters and shareholder protections</span></div> <div><span>It is our view that shareholders have a right to material and timely information on the financial performance and viability of </span><span>the companies in which they invest. In addition, companies should publish information on the governance structures in place </span><span>and the rights of shareholders to influence these structures. The reporting and disclosure provided by companies help </span><span>shareholders assess whether their economic interests have been protected and the quality of the board’s oversight of </span><span>management. We believe shareholders should have the right to vote on key corporate governance matters, including </span><span>changes to governance mechanisms, to submit proposals to the shareholders’ meeting, and to call special meetings of </span><span>shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>Corporate Form</span></div> <div><span>In our view, it is the responsibility of the board to determine the corporate form that is most appropriate given the company’s </span><span>purpose and business model.</span><span>10</span><span> Companies proposing to change their corporate form to a public benefit corporation or </span><span>similar entity should put it to a shareholder vote if not already required to do so under applicable law. Supporting </span><span>documentation from companies or shareholder proponents proposing to alter the corporate form should clearly articulate </span><span>how the interests of shareholders and different stakeholders would be impacted as well as the accountability and voting </span><span>mechanisms that would be available to shareholders. As a fiduciary on behalf of clients, we generally support management </span><span>proposals if our analysis indicates that shareholders’ interests are adequately protected. Relevant shareholder proposals are </span><span>evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</span></div> <div><span>Shareholder proposals</span></div> <div><span>In most markets in which BlackRock invests on behalf of clients, shareholders have the right to submit proposals to be voted </span><span>on by shareholders at a company’s annual or extraordinary meeting, as long as eligibility and procedural requirements are </span><span>met. The matters that we see put forward by shareholders address a wide range of topics, including governance reforms, </span><span>capital management, and improvements in the management or disclosure of sustainability-related risks.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> <div><span>Corporate form refers to the legal structure by which a business is organized.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

As noted above, we can vote, on behalf of clients who authorize us to do so, on proposals put forth by </span><span>others.</span></div> <div><span>When assessing shareholder proposals, we evaluate each proposal on its merit, with a singular focus on its implications for </span><span>long-term value creation. We consider the business and economic relevance of the issue raised, as well as its materiality and </span><span>the urgency with which we believe it should be addressed. We take into consideration the legal effect of the proposal, as </span><span>shareholder proposals may be advisory or legally binding depending on the jurisdiction. We would not support proposals that </span><span>we believe would result in over-reaching into the basic business decisions of the company.</span></div> <div><span>Where a proposal is focused on a material governance or sustainability-related risk that we agree needs to be addressed and </span><span>the intended outcome is consistent with long-term value creation, we will look to the board and management to </span><span>demonstrate that the company has met the intent of the request made in the shareholder proposal. Where our analysis </span><span>and/or engagement indicate an opportunity for improvement in the company’s approach to the issue, we may support </span><span>shareholder proposals that are reasonable and not unduly prescriptive or constraining on management. Alternatively, or in </span><span>addition, we may vote against the re-election of one or more directors if, in our assessment, the board has not responded </span><span>sufficiently or with an appropriate sense of urgency. While we may not agree with all aspects of a shareholder proponent’s </span><span>views or all facets of the proponent’s supporting statement, we may still support proposals that address material governance </span><span>or sustainability-related risks where we believe it would be helpful for shareholders to have more detailed information on how </span><span>those risks are identified, monitored, and managed to support a company’s ability to deliver long-term financial returns. We </span><span>may also support a proposal if management is on track, but we believe that voting in favor might accelerate progress.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock’s oversight of its investment stewardship activities</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Oversight</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock maintains three regional advisory committees (Stewardship Advisory Committees) for a) the Americas; b) Europe, </span><span>the Middle East and Africa (EMEA); and c) Asia-Pacific, generally consisting of senior BlackRock investment professionals </span><span>and/or senior employees with practical boardroom experience.

The Guidelines are reviewed annually and are amended consistent with changes in the local market practice, </span><span>as developments in corporate governance occur, or as otherwise deemed advisable by the applicable Stewardship Advisory </span><span>Committees. BIS analysts may, in the exercise of their professional judgment, conclude that the Guidelines do not cover the </span><span>specific matter upon which a proxy vote is required or that an exception to the Guidelines would be in the best long-term </span><span>economic interests of BlackRock’s clients.</span></div> <div><span>In the uncommon circumstance of there being a vote with respect to fixed income securities or the securities of privately </span><span>held issuers, the decision generally will be made by a Fund’s portfolio managers and/or BIS based on their assessment of the </span><span>particular transactions or other matters at issue.</span></div> <div><span>In certain markets, proxy voting involves logistical issues which can affect BlackRock’s ability to vote such proxies, as well as </span><span>the desirability of voting such proxies. These issues include, but are not limited to: i) untimely notice of shareholder meetings; </span><span>ii) restrictions on a foreigner’s ability to exercise votes; iii) requirements to vote proxies in person; iv) </span><span>“</span><span>share-blocking</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>(requirements that investors who exercise their voting rights surrender the right to dispose of their holdings for some </span><span>specified period in proximity to the shareholder meeting); v) potential difficulties in translating the proxy; vi) regulatory </span><span>constraints; and vii) requirements to provide local agents with unrestricted powers of attorney to facilitate voting </span><span>instructions. We are not supportive of impediments to the exercise of voting rights such as share-blocking or overly </span><span>burdensome administrative requirements.</span></div> <div><span>As a consequence, BlackRock votes proxies in these situations on a </span><span>“</span><span>best-efforts</span><span>”</span><span> basis. In addition, BIS may determine that it </span><span>is generally in the best interests of BlackRock’s clients not to vote proxies (or not to vote our full allocation) if the costs </span><span>(including but not limited to opportunity costs associated with share-blocking constraints) associated with exercising a vote </span><span>are expected to outweigh the benefit the client would derive by voting on the proposal.</span></div> <div><span>Portfolio managers have full discretion to vote the shares in the Funds they manage based on their analysis of the economic </span><span>impact of a particular ballot item on their investors. Portfolio managers may, from time to time, reach differing views on how </span><span>best to maximize economic value with respect to a particular investment. Therefore, portfolio managers may, and sometimes </span><span>do, vote shares in the Funds under their management differently from BIS or from one another.

Clients or business partners are not given special treatment or differentiated access to BIS. BIS prioritizes </span><span>engagements based on factors including, but not limited to, our need for additional information to make a voting </span><span>decision or our view on the likelihood that an engagement could lead to positive outcome(s) over time for the economic </span><span>value of the company. Within the normal course of business, BIS may engage directly with BlackRock clients, business </span><span>partners and/or third parties, and/or with employees with sales, vendor management, or business partnership roles, in </span><span>discussions regarding our approach to stewardship, general corporate governance matters, client reporting needs, </span><span>and/or to otherwise ensure that proxy-related client service levels are met</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Determined to engage, in certain instances, an independent third party voting service provider to make proxy voting </span><span>recommendations as a further safeguard to avoid potential conflicts of interest, to satisfy regulatory compliance </span><span>requirements, or as may be otherwise required by applicable law. In such circumstances, the voting service provider </span><span>provides BlackRock with recommendations, in accordance with the Guidelines, as to how to vote such proxies. </span><span>BlackRock uses an independent voting service provider to make proxy voting recommendations for shares of BlackRock, </span><span>Inc. and companies affiliated with BlackRock, Inc. BlackRock may also use an independent voting service provider to </span><span>make proxy voting recommendations for:</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>public companies that include BlackRock employees on their boards of directors</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>public companies of which a BlackRock, Inc. board member serves as a senior executive or a member of </span><span>the board of directors</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>public companies that are the subject of certain transactions involving BlackRock Funds</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>public companies that are joint venture partners with BlackRock, and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>public companies when legal or regulatory requirements compel BlackRock to use an independent voting </span><span>service provider</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>In selecting a voting service provider, we assess several characteristics, including but not limited to: independence, an ability </span><span>to analyze proxy issues and make recommendations in the best economic interest of our clients in accordance with the </span><span>Guidelines, reputation for reliability and integrity, and operational capacity to accurately deliver the assigned </span><span>recommendations in a timely manner. We may engage more than one voting service provider, in part to mitigate potential or </span><span>perceived conflicts of interest at a single voting service provider. The Global Committee appoints and reviews the </span><span>performance of the voting service providers, generally on an annual basis.</span></div> <div><span>Securities lending</span></div> <div><span>When so authorized, BlackRock acts as a securities lending agent on behalf of Funds. Securities lending is a well-regulated </span><span>practice that contributes to capital market efficiency. It also enables funds to generate additional returns for a fund, while </span><span>allowing fund providers to keep fund expenses lower.</span></div> <div><span>With regard to the relationship between securities lending and proxy voting, BlackRock’s approach is informed by our </span><span>fiduciary responsibility to act in our clients’ best interests. In most cases, BlackRock anticipates that the potential long-term </span><span>value to the Fund of voting shares would be less than the potential revenue the loan may provide the Fund. However, in </span><span>certain instances, BlackRock may determine, in its independent business judgment as a fiduciary, that the value of voting </span><span>outweighs the securities lending revenue loss to clients and would therefore recall shares to be voted in those instances.</span></div> <div><span>The decision to recall securities on loan as part of BlackRock’s securities lending program in order to vote is based on an </span><span>evaluation of various factors that include, but are not limited to, assessing potential securities lending revenue alongside the </span><span>potential long-term value to clients of voting those securities (based on the information available at the time of recall </span><span>consideration).</span><span>12</span><span> BIS works with colleagues in the Securities Lending and Risk and Quantitative Analysis teams to evaluate </span><span>the costs and benefits to clients of recalling shares on loan.</span></div> <div><span>Periodically, BlackRock reviews our process for determining whether to recall securities on loan in order to vote and may </span><span>modify it as necessary.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>12</span></div> <div><span>Recalling securities on loan can be impacted by the timing of record dates. In the United States, for example, the record date of a shareholder meeting </span><span>typically falls before the proxy statements are released. Accordingly, it is not practicable to evaluate a proxy statement, determine that a vote has a </span><span>material impact on a fund and recall any shares on loan in advance of the record date for the annual meeting. As a result, managers must weigh </span><span>independent business judgement as a fiduciary, the benefit to a fund’s shareholders of recalling loaned shares in advance of an estimated record date </span><span>without knowing whether there will be a vote on matters which have a material impact on the fund (thereby forgoing potential securities lending </span><span>revenue for the fund’s shareholders) or leaving shares on loan to potentially earn revenue for the fund (thereby forgoing the opportunity to vote).</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Voting guidelines</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The issue-specific Guidelines published for each region/country in which we vote are intended to summarize BlackRock’s </span><span>general philosophy and approach to issues that may commonly arise in the proxy voting context in each market where we </span><span>invest. The Guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. BIS applies the Guidelines on a case-by-case basis, in the context of </span><span>the individual circumstances of each company and the specific issue under review. As such, the Guidelines do not indicate </span><span>how BIS will vote in every instance. Rather, they reflect our view about corporate governance issues generally, and provide </span><span>insight into how we typically approach issues that commonly arise on corporate ballots.</span></div> <div><span>Reporting and vote transparency</span></div> <div><span>We are committed to transparency in the stewardship work we do on behalf of clients. We inform clients about our </span><span>engagement and voting policies and activities through direct communication and through disclosure on our website. Each </span><span>year we publish an annual report that provides a global overview of our investment stewardship engagement and voting </span><span>activities and a voting spotlight that summarizes our voting over a proxy year.</span><span>13</span><span> Additionally, we make public our market-specific</span><span> voting guidelines for the benefit of clients and companies with whom we engage. We also publish commentaries to </span><span>share our perspective on market developments and emerging key themes.</span></div> <div><span>At a more granular level, we publish quarterly our vote record for each company that held a shareholder meeting during the </span><span>period, showing how we voted on each proposal and explaining any votes against management proposals or on shareholder </span><span>proposals. For shareholder meetings where a vote might be high profile or of significant interest to clients, we may publish a </span><span>vote bulletin after the meeting, disclosing and explaining our vote on key proposals. We also publish a quarterly list of all </span><span>companies with which we engaged and the key topics addressed in the engagement meeting.</span></div> <div><span>In this way, we help inform our clients about the work we do on their behalf in promoting the governance and business </span><span>models that support durable, long-term value creation.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>13</span></div> <div><span>The proxy year runs from July 1 to June 30 of the proceeding calendar year.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-15</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

These Guidelines are not intended to limit the </span><span>analysis of individual issues at specific companies or provide a guide to how BIS will engage and/or vote in every instance. </span><span>They are to be applied with discretion, taking into consideration the range of issues and facts specific to the company, as well </span><span>as individual ballot items at shareholder meetings.</span></div> <div><span>Voting guidelines</span></div> <div><span>These guidelines are divided into eight key themes, which group together the issues that frequently appear on the agenda of </span><span>shareholder meetings:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Boards and directors</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Auditors and audit-related issues</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Capital structure</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Mergers, acquisitions, asset sales, and other special transactions</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Executive compensation</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Material sustainability-related risks and opportunities</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>General corporate governance matters</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Shareholder protections</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>Boards and directors</span></div> <div><span>An effective and well-functioning board is critical to the economic success of the company and the protection of </span><span>shareholders’ interests, inducting the establishment of appropriate governance structures that facilitate oversight of </span><span>management and the company’s strategic initiatives. As part of their responsibilities, board members owe fiduciary duties to </span><span>shareholders in overseeing the strategic direction, operations, and risk management of the company. For this reason, BIS sees </span><span>engagement with and the election of directors as one of our most critical responsibilities.</span></div> <div><span>Disclosure of material issues that affect the company’s long-term strategy and value creation, including, when relevant, </span><span>material sustainability-related factors, is essential for shareholders to appropriately understand and assess how effectively </span><span>the board is identifying, managing, and mitigating risks.</span></div> <div><span>Where a company has not adequately demonstrated, through actions and/or disclosures, how material issues are </span><span>appropriately identified, managed, and overseen, we will consider voting against the re-election of those directors </span><span>responsible for the oversight of such issues, as indicated below.</span></div> <div><span>Independence</span></div> <div><span>It is our view that a majority of the directors on the board should be independent to ensure objectivity in the decision-making </span><span>of the board and its ability to oversee management. In addition, all members of audit, compensation, and </span><span>nominating/governance committees should be independent. Our view of independence may vary from listing standards.</span></div> <div><span>Common impediments to independence may include:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Employment as a senior executive by the company or a subsidiary within the past five years</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>An equity ownership in the company in excess of 20%</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Having any other interest, business, or relationship (professional or personal) which could, or could reasonably be </span><span>perceived to, materially interfere with the director’s ability to act in the best interests of the company and its </span><span>shareholders. We may vote against directors who we do not consider to be independent, including at controlled </span><span>companies, when we believe oversight could be enhanced with greater independent director representation.

In particular, where a director maintains a Chair role of a publicly listed company in European markets, we </span><span>may consider that responsibility as equal to two board commitments, consistent with our EMEA Proxy Voting Guidelines. We </span><span>will take the total number of board commitments across our global policies into account for director elections.</span></div> <div><span>Risk oversight</span></div> <div><span>Companies should have an established process for identifying, monitoring, and managing business and material risks. </span><span>Independent directors should have access to relevant management information and outside advice, as appropriate, to ensure </span><span>they can properly oversee risk. We encourage companies to provide transparency around risk management, mitigation, and </span><span>reporting to the board. We are particularly interested in understanding how risk oversight processes evolve in response to </span><span>changes in corporate strategy and/or shifts in the business and related risk environment. Comprehensive disclosures provide </span><span>investors with a sense of the company’s long-term risk management practices and, more broadly, the quality of the board’s </span><span>oversight. In the absence of robust disclosures, we may reasonably conclude that companies are not adequately managing </span><span>risk.</span></div> <div><span>Board Structure</span></div> <div><span>Classified board of directors/staggered terms</span></div> <div><span>Directors should be re-elected annually; classification of the board generally limits shareholders’ rights to regularly evaluate a </span><span>board’s performance and select directors. While we will typically support proposals requesting board de-classification, we </span><span>may make exceptions, should the board articulate an appropriate strategic rationale for a classified board structure.

However, in </span><span>these instances, boards should periodically review the rationale for a classified structure and consider when annual elections </span><span>might be more appropriate.</span></div> <div><span>Without a voting mechanism to immediately address concerns about a specific director, we may choose to vote against the </span><span>directors up for election at the time (see </span><span>“</span><span>Shareholder rights</span><span>”</span><span> for additional detail).</span></div> <div><span>Independent leadership</span></div> <div><span>There are two commonly accepted structures for independent leadership to balance the CEO role in the boardroom: 1) an </span><span>independent Chair; or 2) a Lead Independent director when the roles of Chair and CEO are combined, or when the Chair is </span><span>otherwise not independent.</span></div> <div><span>In the absence of a significant governance concern, we defer to boards to designate the most appropriate leadership </span><span>structure to ensure adequate balance and independence.</span><span>17</span><span> However, BIS may vote against the most senior non-executive </span><span>member of the board when appropriate independence is lacking in designated leadership roles.</span></div> <div><span>In the event that the board chooses to have a combined Chair/CEO or a non-independent Chair, we support the designation </span><span>of a Lead Independent director, with the ability to: 1) provide formal input into board meeting agendas; 2) call meetings of </span><span>the independent directors; and 3) preside at meetings of independent directors. These roles and responsibilities should be </span><span>disclosed and easily accessible.</span></div> <div><span>The following table illustrates examples</span><span>18</span><span> of responsibilities under each board leadership model:</span><span> </span></div> <div> </div> <div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>CEO and management succession planning</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Companies should have a robust CEO and senior management succession plan in place at the board level that is reviewed </span><span>and updated on a regular basis. Succession planning should cover scenarios over both the long-term, consistent with the </span><span>strategic direction of the company and identified leadership needs over time, as well as the short-term, in the event of an </span><span>unanticipated executive departure. We encourage the company to explain their executive succession planning process, </span><span>including where accountability lies within the boardroom for this task, without prematurely divulging sensitive information </span><span>commonly associated with this exercise.</span></div> <div><span>During a CEO transition, companies may elect for the departing CEO to maintain a role in the boardroom. We ask for </span><span>disclosures to understand the timeframe and responsibilities of this role. In such instances, we typically look for the board to </span><span>have appropriate independent leadership structures in place. (See chart above.)</span></div> <div><span>Director</span><span> </span><span>compensation</span><span> </span><span>and</span><span> </span><span>equity</span><span> programs</span></div> <div><span>Compensation for directors should generally be structured to attract and retain directors, while also aligning their interests </span><span>with those of shareholders. In our view, director compensation packages that are based on the company’s long-term value </span><span>creation and include some form of long-term equity compensation are more likely to meet this goal.</span></div> <div><span>Board composition and effectiveness</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Director</span><span> </span><span>qualifications</span><span> </span><span>and</span><span> </span><span>skills</span></div> <div><span>We encourage boards to periodically review director qualifications and skills to ensure relevant experience and diverse </span><span>perspectives are represented in the boardroom. To this end, performance reviews and skills assessments should be </span><span>conducted by the nominating/governance committee or the Lead Independent Director. This process may include internal </span><span>board evaluations; however, boards may also find it useful to periodically conduct an assessment with a third party. We </span><span>encourage boards to disclose their approach to evaluations, including objectives of the evaluation; if an external party </span><span>conducts the evaluation; the frequency of the evaluations; and, whether that evaluation occurs on an individual director </span><span>basis.</span></div> <div><span>Board</span><span> </span><span>term</span><span> </span><span>limits and</span><span> </span><span>director</span><span> tenure</span></div> <div><span>Where boards find that age limits or term limits are the most efficient and objective mechanism for ensuring periodic board </span><span>refreshment, we generally defer to the board’s determination in setting such limits. BIS will also consider the average board </span><span>tenure to evaluate processes for board renewal. We may oppose boards that appear to have an insufficient mix of short-, </span><span>medium-, and long-tenured directors.</span></div> <div><span>Board</span><span> </span><span>diversity</span></div> <div><span>As noted above, highly qualified, engaged directors with professional characteristics relevant to a company’s business </span><span>enhance the ability of the board to add value and be the voice of shareholders in board discussions. In our view, a strong </span><span>board provides a competitive advantage to a company, providing valuable oversight and contributing to the most important </span><span>management decisions that support long-term financial performance.</span></div> <div><span>It is in this context that we are interested in diversity in the boardroom. We see it as a means to promoting diversity of </span><span>thought and avoiding ‘group think’ in the board’s exercise of its responsibilities to advise and oversee management. It allows </span><span>boards to have deeper discussions and make more resilient decisions. We ask boards to disclose how diversity is considered </span><span>in board composition, including professional characteristics, such as a director’s industry experience, specialist areas of </span><span>expertise and geographic location; as well as demographic characteristics such as gender, race/ ethnicity, and age.</span></div> <div><span>We look to understand a board’s diversity in the context of a company’s domicile, market capitalization, business model, and </span><span>strategy. Increasingly, we see leading boards adding members whose experience deepens the board’s understanding of the </span><span>company’s customers, employees, and communities. Self- identified board demographic diversity can usefully be disclosed in </span><span>aggregate, consistent with local law. We believe boards should aspire to meaningful diversity of membership, at least </span><span>consistent with local regulatory requirements and best practices, while recognizing that building a strong, diverse board can </span><span>take time.</span></div> <div><span>This position is based on our view that diversity of perspective and thought—in the boardroom, in the management team </span><span>and throughout the company—leads to better long-term economic outcomes for companies.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>reveals correlations between specific dimensions of diversity and effects on decision-making processes and outcomes.</span><span>19</span><span> In </span><span>our experience, greater diversity in the boardroom contributes to more robust discussions and more innovative and resilient </span><span>decisions. Over time, greater diversity in the boardroom can also promote greater diversity and resilience in the leadership </span><span>team, and the workforce more broadly. That diversity can enable companies to develop businesses that more closely reflect </span><span>and resonate with the customers and communities they serve.</span></div> <div><span>In the U.S., we believe that boards should aspire to at least 30% diversity of membership,</span><span>20</span><span> and we encourage large </span><span>companies, such as those in the S&amp;P 500, to lead in achieving this standard. In our view, an informative indicator of diversity </span><span>for such companies is having at least two women and a director who identifies as a member of an underrepresented group.</span><span>21</span><span> </span><span>We recognize that it may take time and that companies with smaller market capitalizations and in certain sectors may face </span><span>more challenges in pursuing diversity. Among these smaller companies, we look for the presence of diversity and take into </span><span>consideration the progress that companies are making.</span></div> <div><span>In order to help investors understand overall diversity, we look to boards to disclose:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>How diversity, including demographic factors and professional characteristics, is considered in board composition, given </span><span>the company’s long-term strategy and business model</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>How directors’ professional characteristics, which may include domain expertise such as finance or technology, and </span><span>sector- or market-specific experience, are complementary and link to the company’s long-term strategy</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The process by which candidates for board positions are identified, including whether professional firms or other </span><span>resources outside of incumbent directors’ networks are engaged to identify and/or assess candidates, and whether a </span><span>diverse slate of nominees is considered for all available board nominations</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>To the extent that, based on our assessment of corporate disclosures, a company has not adequately explained their </span><span>approach to diversity in their board composition, we may vote against members of the nominating/governance committee. </span><span>Our publicly available commentary provides more information on our approach to board diversity.</span></div> <div><span>Board</span><span> </span><span>size</span></div> <div><span>We typically defer to the board in setting the appropriate size and believe that directors are generally in the best position to </span><span>assess the optimal board size to ensure effectiveness. However, we may vote against the appropriate committees and/or </span><span>individual directors if, in our view, the board is ineffective in its oversight, either because it is too small to allow for the </span><span>necessary range of skills and experience or too large to function efficiently.</span></div> <div><span>Board responsiveness and shareholder rights</span></div> <div><span>Shareholder rights</span></div> <div><span>Where we determine that a board has not acted in the best interests of the company’s shareholders, or takes action to </span><span>unreasonably limit shareholder rights, we may vote against the appropriate committees and/or individual directors. Common </span><span>circumstances are illustrated below:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The Independent Chair or Lead Independent Director and members of the nominating/governance committee, where a </span><span>board implements or renews a poison pill without shareholder approval</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The Independent Chair or Lead Independent Director and members of the nominating/governance committee, where a </span><span>board amends the charter/articles/bylaws and where the effect may be to entrench directors or to unreasonably reduce </span><span>shareholder rights</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Members of the compensation committee where the company has repriced options without shareholder approval If a </span><span>board maintains a classified structure, it is possible that the director(s) or committee members with whom we have a </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>19</span></div> <div><span>For a discussion on the different impacts of diversity see: McKinsey, </span><span>“</span><span>Diversity Wins: How Inclusion Matters</span><span>”</span><span>, May 2022; Harvard Business Review, </span><span>Diverse Teams Feel Less Comfortable – and That’s Why They Perform Better, September 2016; </span><span>“</span><span>Do Diverse Directors Influence DEI Outcomes</span><span>”</span><span>, </span><span>September 2022</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>20</span></div> <div><span>We take a case-by-case approach and consider the size of the board in our evaluation of overall composition and diversity.

We acknowledge that these factors may also play into the various </span><span>elements of diversity that a board may attract.

In such situations, we may register </span><span>our concern by voting against the most relevant director(s) up for election.</span></div> <div><span>Responsiveness to shareholders</span></div> <div><span>A board should be engaged and responsive to the company’s shareholders, including acknowledging voting outcomes for </span><span>director elections, compensation, shareholder proposals, and other ballot items. Where we determine that a board has not </span><span>substantially addressed shareholder concerns that we deem material to the business, we may vote against the responsible </span><span>committees and/or individual directors. Common circumstances are illustrated below:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The Independent Chair or Lead Independent Director, members of the nominating/governance committee, and/or the </span><span>longest tenured director(s), where we observe a lack of board responsiveness to shareholders, evidence of board </span><span>entrenchment, and/or failure to plan for adequate board member succession</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The chair of the nominating/governance committee, or where no chair exists, the nominating/governance committee </span><span>member with the longest tenure, where board member(s) at the most recent election of directors have received against </span><span>votes from more than 25% of shares voted, and the board has not taken appropriate action to respond to shareholder </span><span>concerns. This may not apply in cases where BIS did not support the initial vote against such board member(s)</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The Independent Chair or Lead Independent Director and/or members of the nominating/governance committee, </span><span>where a board fails to consider shareholder proposals that (1) receive substantial support, and (2) in our view, have a </span><span>material impact on the business, shareholder rights, or the potential for long-term value creation</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>Majority vote requirements</span></div> <div><span>Directors should generally be elected by a majority of the shares voted. We will normally support proposals seeking to </span><span>introduce bylaws requiring a majority vote standard for director elections. Majority vote standards generally assist in ensuring </span><span>that directors who are not broadly supported by shareholders are not elected to serve as their representatives. As a best </span><span>practice, companies with either a majority vote standard or a plurality vote standard should adopt a resignation policy for </span><span>directors who do not receive support from at least a majority of votes cast. Where the company already has a sufficiently </span><span>robust majority voting process in place, we may not support a shareholder proposal seeking an alternative mechanism.</span></div> <div><span>We note that majority voting may not be appropriate in all circumstances, for example, in the context of a contested election, </span><span>or for majority-controlled companies or those with concentrated ownership structures.</span></div> <div><span>Cumulative voting</span></div> <div><span>As stated above, a majority vote standard is generally in the best long-term interests of shareholders, as it ensures director </span><span>accountability through the requirement to be elected by more than half of the votes cast. As such, we will generally oppose </span><span>proposals requesting the adoption of cumulative voting, which may disproportionately aggregate votes on certain issues or </span><span>director candidates.</span></div> <div><span>Auditors and audit-related issues</span></div> <div><span>BIS recognizes the critical importance of financial statements to provide a complete and accurate portrayal of a company’s </span><span>financial condition. Consistent with our approach to voting on directors, we seek to hold the audit committee of the board </span><span>responsible for overseeing the management of the independent auditor and the internal audit function at a company.</span></div> <div><span>We may vote against the audit committee members where the board has failed to facilitate quality, independent auditing. We </span><span>look to public disclosures for insight into the scope of the audit committee responsibilities, including an overview of audit </span><span>committee processes, issues on the audit committee agenda, and key decisions taken by the audit committee. We take </span><span>particular note of cases involving significant financial restatements or material weakness disclosures, and we look for timely </span><span>disclosure and remediation of accounting irregularities.</span></div> <div><span>The integrity of financial statements depends on the auditor effectively fulfilling its role. To that end, we favor an independent </span><span>auditor. In addition, to the extent that an auditor fails to reasonably identify and address issues that eventually lead to a </span><span>significant financial restatement, or the audit firm has violated standards of practice, we may also vote against ratification.</span></div> <div><span>From time to time, shareholder proposals may be presented to promote auditor independence or the rotation of audit firms. </span><span>We may support these proposals when they are consistent with our views as described above.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-23</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Capital structure proposals</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Equal voting rights</span></div> <div><span>In our view, shareholders should be entitled to voting rights in proportion to their economic interests. In addition, companies </span><span>that have implemented dual or multiple class share structures should review these structures on a regular basis, or as </span><span>company circumstances change. Companies with multiple share classes should receive shareholder approval of their capital </span><span>structure on a periodic basis via a management proposal on the company’s proxy. The proposal should give unaffiliated </span><span>shareholders the opportunity to affirm the current structure or establish mechanisms to end or phase out controlling </span><span>structures at the appropriate time, while minimizing costs to shareholders. Where companies are unwilling to voluntarily </span><span>implement </span><span>“</span><span>one share, one vote</span><span>”</span><span> within a specified timeframe, or are unresponsive to shareholder feedback for change over </span><span>time, we generally support shareholder proposals to recapitalize stock into a single voting class.</span></div> <div><span>Blank check preferred stock</span></div> <div><span>We frequently oppose proposals requesting authorization of a class of preferred stock with unspecified voting, conversion, </span><span>dividend distribution, and other rights (</span><span>“</span><span>blank check</span><span>”</span><span> preferred stock) because they may serve as a transfer of authority from </span><span>shareholders to the board and as a possible entrenchment device. We generally view the board’s discretion to establish </span><span>voting rights on a when-issued basis as a potential anti-takeover device, as it affords the board the ability to place a block of </span><span>stock with an investor sympathetic to management, thereby foiling a takeover bid without a shareholder vote.</span></div> <div><span>Nonetheless, we may support the proposal where the company:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Appears to have a legitimate financing motive for requesting blank check authority</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Has committed publicly that blank check preferred shares will not be used for anti-takeover purposes</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Has a history of using blank check preferred stock for financings</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Has blank check preferred stock previously outstanding such that an increase would not necessarily provide further anti-</span><span>takeover protection but may provide greater financing flexibility</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>Increase in authorized common shares</span></div> <div><span>BIS will evaluate requests to increase authorized shares on a case-by-case basis, in conjunction with industry-specific norms </span><span>and potential dilution, as well as a company’s history with respect to the use of its common shares.</span></div> <div><span>Increase or issuance of preferred stock</span></div> <div><span>We generally support proposals to increase or issue preferred stock in cases where the company specifies the voting, </span><span>dividend, conversion, and other rights of such stock and where the terms of the preferred stock appear reasonable.</span></div> <div><span>Stock splits</span></div> <div><span>We generally support stock splits that are not likely to negatively affect the ability to trade shares or the economic value of a </span><span>share. We generally support reverse stock splits that are designed to avoid delisting or to facilitate trading in the stock, where </span><span>the reverse split will not have a negative impact on share value (e.g., one class is reduced while others remain at pre-split </span><span>levels). In the event of a proposal for a reverse split that would not proportionately reduce the company’s authorized stock, </span><span>we apply the same analysis we would use for a proposal to increase authorized stock.</span></div> <div><span>Mergers, acquisitions, transactions, and other special situations</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Mergers, acquisitions, and transactions</span></div> <div><span>In assessing mergers, acquisitions, or other transactions – including business combinations involving Special Purpose </span><span>Acquisition Companies (</span><span>“</span><span>SPACs</span><span>”</span><span>) – BIS’ primary consideration is the long-term economic interests of our clients as </span><span>shareholders. Boards should clearly explain the economic and strategic rationale for any proposed transactions or material </span><span>changes to the business. We will review a proposed transaction to determine the degree to which it has the potential to </span><span>enhance long-term shareholder value. While mergers, acquisitions, asset sales, business combinations, and other special </span><span>transaction proposals vary widely in scope and substance, we closely examine certain salient features in our analyses, such </span><span>as:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The degree to which the proposed transaction represents a premium to the company’s trading price.

We evaluate a number of factors, </span><span>which may include: the qualifications and past performance of the dissident and management candidates; the validity of the </span><span>concerns identified by the dissident; the viability of both the dissident’s and management’s plans; the ownership stake and </span><span>holding period of the dissident; the likelihood that the dissident’s strategy will produce the desired change; and whether the </span><span>dissident represents the best option for enhancing long-term shareholder value.</span></div> <div><span>We will evaluate the actions that the company has taken to limit shareholders’ ability to exercise the right to nominate </span><span>dissident director candidates, including those actions taken absent the immediate threat of a contested situation. BIS may </span><span>take voting action against directors (up to and including the full board) where those actions are viewed as egregiously </span><span>infringing on shareholder rights.</span></div> <div><span>We will consider a variety of possible voting outcomes in contested situations, including the ability to support a mix of </span><span>management and dissident nominees.</span></div> <div><span>Poison pill plans</span></div> <div><span>Where a poison pill is put to a shareholder vote by management, our policy is to examine these plans individually. Although </span><span>we have historically opposed most plans, we may support plans that include a reasonable </span><span>“</span><span>qualifying offer clause.</span><span>”</span><span> Such </span><span>clauses typically require shareholder ratification of the pill and stipulate a sunset provision whereby the pill expires unless it is </span><span>renewed. These clauses also tend to specify that an all-cash bid for all shares that includes a fairness opinion and evidence of </span><span>financing does not trigger the pill, but forces either a special meeting at which the offer is put to a shareholder vote or </span><span>requires the board to seek the written consent of shareholders, where shareholders could rescind the pill at their discretion. </span><span>We may also support a pill where it is the only effective method for protecting tax or other economic benefits that may be </span><span>associated with limiting the ownership changes of individual shareholders. Lastly, we look for shareholder approval of poison </span><span>pill plans within one year of adoption of implementation.</span></div> <div><span>Reimbursement of expenses for successful shareholder campaigns</span></div> <div><span>We generally do not support shareholder proposals seeking the reimbursement of proxy contest expenses, even in situations </span><span>where we support the shareholder campaign. Introducing the possibility of such reimbursement may incentivize disruptive </span><span>and unnecessary shareholder campaigns.</span></div> <div><span>Executive compensation</span></div> <div><span>A company’s board of directors should put in place a compensation structure that balances incentivizing, rewarding, and </span><span>retaining executives appropriately across a wide range of business outcomes. This structure should be aligned with </span><span>shareholder interests, particularly the generation of sustainable, long-term value.</span></div> <div><span>The compensation committee should carefully consider the specific circumstances of the company and the key individuals </span><span>the board is focused on incentivizing. We encourage companies to ensure that their compensation plans incorporate </span><span>appropriate and rigorous performance metrics, consistent with corporate strategy and market practice.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>research, in addition to our own analysis, to evaluate existing and proposed compensation structures. We hold members of </span><span>the compensation committee, or equivalent board members, accountable for poor compensation practices and/or </span><span>structures.</span></div> <div><span>There should be a clear link between variable pay and company performance that drives sustained value creation for our </span><span>clients as shareholders. Where compensation structures provide for a front-loaded</span><span>23</span><span> award, we look for appropriate </span><span>structures (including vesting and/or holding periods) that motivate sustained performance for shareholders over a number </span><span>of years. We generally do not favor programs focused on awards that require performance levels to be met and maintained </span><span>for a relatively short time period for payouts to be earned, unless there are extended vesting and/or holding requirements.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Compensation structures should generally drive outcomes that align the pay of the executives with performance of the </span><span>company and the value received by shareholders. When evaluating performance, we examine both executive teams’ efforts, </span><span>as well as outcomes realized by shareholders. Payouts to executives should reflect both the executive’s contributions to the </span><span>company’s ongoing success, as well as exogenous factors that impacted shareholder value. Where discretion has been used </span><span>by the compensation committee, we look for disclosures relating to how and why the discretion was used and how the </span><span>adjusted outcome is aligned with the interests of shareholders. While we believe special awards</span><span>24</span><span> should be used sparingly, </span><span>we acknowledge that there may be instances when such awards are appropriate. When evaluating these awards, we consider </span><span>a variety of factors, including the magnitude and structure of the award, the scope of award recipients, the alignment of the </span><span>grant with shareholder value, and the company’s historical use of such awards, in addition to other company-specific </span><span>circumstances.</span></div> <div><span>We acknowledge that the use of peer group evaluation by compensation committees can help calibrate competitive pay; </span><span>however, we are concerned when the rationale for increases in total compensation is solely based on peer benchmarking.</span></div> <div><span>We support incentive plans that foster the sustainable achievement of results – both financial and non-financial – consistent </span><span>with the company’s strategic initiatives. Compensation committees should guard against contractual arrangements that </span><span>would entitle executives to material compensation for early termination of their contract. Finally, pension contributions and </span><span>other deferred compensation arrangements should be reasonable in light of market practices. Our publicly available </span><span>commentary provides more information on our approach to executive compensation.</span></div> <div><span>Where executive compensation appears excessive relative to the performance of the company and/or compensation paid by </span><span>peers, or where an equity compensation plan is not aligned with shareholders’ interests, we may vote against members of </span><span>the compensation committee.</span></div> <div><span>“</span><span>Say on Pay</span><span>”</span><span> advisory resolutions</span></div> <div><span>In cases where there is a </span><span>“</span><span>Say on Pay</span><span>”</span><span> vote, BIS will respond to the proposal as informed by our evaluation of compensation </span><span>practices at that particular company and in a manner that appropriately addresses the specific question posed to </span><span>shareholders. Where we conclude that a company has failed to align pay with performance, we will vote against the </span><span>management compensation proposal and relevant compensation committee members.</span></div> <div><span>Frequency of </span><span>“</span><span>Say on Pay</span><span>”</span><span> advisory resolutions</span></div> <div><span>BIS will generally support annual advisory votes on executive compensation. It is our view that shareholders should have the </span><span>opportunity to express feedback on annual incentive programs and changes to long-term compensation before multiple </span><span>cycles are issued. Where a company has failed to implement a </span><span>“</span><span>Say on Pay</span><span>”</span><span> advisory vote within the frequency period that </span><span>received the most support from shareholders or a </span><span>“</span><span>Say on Pay</span><span>”</span><span> resolution is omitted without explanation, BIS may vote </span><span>against members of the compensation committee.</span></div> <div><span>Clawback proposals</span></div> <div><span>We generally favor prompt recoupment from any senior executive whose compensation was based on faulty financial </span><span>reporting or deceptive business practices. We also favor prompt recoupment from any senior executive whose behavior </span><span>caused material financial harm to shareholders, material reputational risk to the company, or resulted in a criminal </span><span>proceeding, even if such actions did not ultimately result in a material restatement of past results. This includes, but is not </span><span>limited to, settlement agreements arising from such behavior and paid for directly by the company. We typically support </span><span>shareholder proposals on these matters unless the company already has a robust clawback policy that sufficiently addresses </span><span>our concerns.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>23</span></div> <div><span>Front-loaded awards are generally those that accelerate the grant of multiple years’ worth of compensation in a single year.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>24</span></div> <div><span>“</span><span>Special awards</span><span>”</span><span> refers to awards granted outside the company’s typical compensation program.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-26</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

The most common </span><span>form of ESPP qualifies for favorable tax treatment under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. We will typically support </span><span>qualified ESPP proposals.</span></div> <div><span>Equity compensation plans</span></div> <div><span>BIS supports equity plans that align the economic interests of directors, managers, and other employees with those of </span><span>shareholders. Boards should establish policies prohibiting the use of equity awards in a manner that could disrupt the </span><span>intended alignment with shareholder interests, such as the excessive pledging or heading of stock. We may support </span><span>shareholder proposals requesting the establishment of such policies.</span></div> <div><span>Our evaluation of equity compensation plans is based on a company’s executive pay and performance relative to peers and </span><span>whether the plan plays a significant role in a pay-for-performance disconnect. We generally oppose plans that contain </span><span>“</span><span>evergreen</span><span>”</span><span> provisions, which allow for automatic annual increases of shares available for grant without requiring further </span><span>shareholder approval; we note that the aggregate impacts of such increases are difficult to predict and may lead to significant </span><span>dilution. We also generally oppose plans that allow for repricing without shareholder approval. We may oppose plans that </span><span>provide for the acceleration of vesting of equity awards even in situations where an actual change of control may not occur. </span><span>We encourage companies to structure their change of control provisions to require the termination of the covered employee </span><span>before acceleration or special payments are triggered (commonly referred to as </span><span>“</span><span>double trigger</span><span>”</span><span> change of control </span><span>provisions).</span></div> <div><span>Golden parachutes</span></div> <div><span>We generally view golden parachutes as encouragement to management to consider transactions that might be beneficial to </span><span>shareholders. However, a large potential payout under a golden parachute arrangement also presents the risk of motivating a </span><span>management team to support a sub-optimal sale price for a company.</span></div> <div><span>When determining whether to support or oppose an advisory vote on a golden parachute plan, BIS may consider several </span><span>factors, including:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Whether we determine that the triggering event is in the best interests of shareholders</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Whether management attempted to maximize shareholder value in the triggering event</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The percentage of total premium or transaction value that will be transferred to the management team, rather than </span><span>shareholders, as a result of the golden parachute payment</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Whether excessively large excise tax gross-up payments are part of the pay-out</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Whether the pay package that serves as the basis for calculating the golden parachute payment was reasonable in light </span><span>of performance and peers</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Whether the golden parachute payment will have the effect of rewarding a management team that has failed to </span><span>effectively manage the company It may be difficult to anticipate the results of a plan until after it has been triggered; as a </span><span>result, BIS may vote against a golden parachute proposal even if the golden parachute plan under review was approved </span><span>by shareholders when it was implemented.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>We may support shareholder proposals requesting that implementation of such arrangements require shareholder approval.</span></div> <div><span>Option exchanges</span></div> <div><span>There may be legitimate instances where underwater options create an overhang on a company’s capital structure and a </span><span>repricing or option exchange may be warranted. We will evaluate these instances on a case-by-case basis. BIS may support a </span><span>request to reprice or exchange underwater options under the following circumstances:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The company has experienced significant stock price decline as a result of macroeconomic trends, not individual </span><span>company performance</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Directors and executive officers are excluded; the exchange is value neutral or value creative to shareholders; tax, </span><span>accounting, and other technical considerations have been fully contemplated</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>There is clear evidence that absent repricing, employee incentives, retention, and/or recruiting may be impacted BIS may </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-27</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

At the </span><span>board level, appropriate governance structures and responsibilities allow for effective oversight of the strategic </span><span>implementation of material sustainability issues.</span></div> <div><span>When assessing how to vote – including on the election of directors and relevant shareholder proposals – robust disclosures </span><span>are essential for investors to understand, where appropriate, how companies are integrating material sustainability risks and </span><span>opportunities across their business and strategic, long-term planning. Where a company has failed to appropriately provide </span><span>robust disclosures and evidence of effective business practices, BIS may express concerns through our engagement and </span><span>voting. As part of this consideration, we encourage companies to produce sustainability-related disclosures sufficiently in </span><span>advance of their annual meeting so that the disclosures can be considered in relevant vote decisions.</span></div> <div><span>We encourage disclosures aligned with the reporting framework developed by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial </span><span>Disclosures (TCFD), supported by industry-specific metrics, such as those identified by the Sustainability Accounting </span><span>Standards Board (SASB), now part of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) under the International Financial </span><span>Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation.</span><span>26</span><span> While the TCFD framework was developed to support climate-related risk </span><span>disclosures, the four pillars of the TCFD – governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets – are a useful way </span><span>for companies to disclose how they identify, assess, manage, and oversee a variety of sustainability-related risks and </span><span>opportunities. SASB’s</span><span>27</span><span> industry-specific metrics are beneficial in helping companies identify key performance indicators </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>KPIs</span><span>”</span><span>) across various dimensions of sustainability that are considered to be financially material. We recognize that some </span><span>companies may report using different standards, which may be required by regulation, or one of a number of private </span><span>standards. In such cases, we ask that companies highlight the metrics that are industry- or company-specific.</span></div> <div><span>We look to companies to:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Disclose the identification, assessment, management, and oversight of material sustainability- related risks and </span><span>opportunities in accordance with the four pillars of TCFD</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Publish material, investor-relevant, industry-specific metrics and rigorous targets, aligned with SASB (ISSB) or </span><span>comparable sustainability reporting standards</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>Companies should also disclose any material supranational standards adopted, the industry initiatives in which they </span><span>participate, any peer group benchmarking undertaken, and any assurance processes to help investors understand their </span><span>approach to sustainable and responsible business conduct.</span></div> <div><span>Climate risk</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>25</span></div> <div><span>By material sustainability-related risks and opportunities, we mean the drivers of risk and value creation in a company’s business model that have an </span><span>environmental or social dependency or impact.

Examples of social issues include, but are not limited to, human capital management, impacts on the communities in </span><span>which a company operates, customer loyalty, and relationships with regulators. It is our view that well-run companies will effectively evaluate and </span><span>manage material sustainability-related risks and opportunities relevant to their businesses.

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>It is our view that climate change has become a key factor in many companies’ long-term prospects. As such, as long-term </span><span>investors, we are interested in understanding how companies may be impacted by material climate-related risks and </span><span>opportunities—just as we seek to understand other business-relevant risks and opportunities—and how these factors are </span><span>considered within their strategy in a manner that is consistent with the company’s business model and sector. Specifically, </span><span>we look for companies to disclose strategies that they have in place that mitigate and are resilient to any material risks to </span><span>their long-term business model associated with a range of climate-related scenarios, including a scenario in which global </span><span>warming is limited to well below 2°C, and considering global ambitions to achieve a limit of 1.5°C.</span><span>28</span><span> It is, of course, up to </span><span>each company to define their own strategy: that is not the role of BlackRock or other investors.</span></div> <div><span>BIS recognizes that climate change can be challenging for many companies, as they seek to drive long-term value by </span><span>mitigating risks and capturing opportunities. A growing number of companies, financial institutions, as well as governments, </span><span>have committed to advancing decarbonization in line with the Paris Agreement. There is growing consensus that companies </span><span>can benefit from the more favorable macro-economic environment under an orderly, timely, and equitable global energy </span><span>transition.</span><span>29</span><span> Yet, the path ahead is deeply uncertain and uneven, with different parts of the economy moving at different </span><span>speeds.</span><span>30</span><span> Many companies are asking what their role should be in contributing to an orderly and equitable transition—in </span><span>ensuring a reliable energy supply and energy security and in protecting the most vulnerable from energy price shocks and </span><span>economic dislocation. In this context, we encourage companies to include in their disclosures a business plan for how they </span><span>intend to deliver long-term financial performance through a transition to global net zero carbon emissions, consistent with </span><span>their business model and sector.</span></div> <div><span>We look to companies to disclose short-, medium-, and long-term targets, ideally science-based targets where these are </span><span>available for their sector, for Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reductions and to demonstrate how their </span><span>targets are consistent with the long-term economic interests of their shareholders. Many companies have an opportunity to </span><span>use and contribute to the development of low carbon energy sources and technologies that will be essential to decarbonizing </span><span>the global economy over time. We also recognize that continued investment in traditional energy sources, including oil and </span><span>gas, is required to maintain an orderly and equitable transition—and that divestiture of carbon-intensive assets is unlikely to </span><span>contribute to global emissions reductions. We encourage companies to disclose how their capital allocation to various energy </span><span>sources is consistent with their strategy.</span></div> <div><span>At this stage, we view Scope 3 emissions differently from Scopes 1 and 2, given methodological complexity, regulatory </span><span>uncertainty, concerns about double-counting, and lack of direct control by companies. While we welcome any disclosures </span><span>and commitments companies choose to make regarding Scope 3 emissions, we recognize that these are provided on a good-faith</span><span> basis as methodology develops. Our publicly available commentary provides more information on our approach to </span><span>climate risk and the global energy transition.</span></div> <div><span>Natural capital</span></div> <div><span>The management of nature-related factors is increasingly a core component of some companies’ ability to generate </span><span>sustainable, long-term financial returns for shareholders, particularly where a company’s strategy is heavily reliant on the </span><span>availably of natural capital, or whose supply chains are exposed to locations with nature-related risks. We look for such </span><span>companies to disclose</span><span>31</span><span> how they consider their reliance and use of natural capital, including appropriate risk oversight and </span><span>relevant metrics and targets, to understand how these factors are integrated into strategy. We will evaluate these disclosures </span><span>to inform our view of how a company is managing material nature-related risks and opportunities, as well as in our </span><span>assessment of relevant shareholder proposals. Our publicly available commentary provides more information on our </span><span>approach to natural capital.</span></div> <div><span>Key stakeholder interests</span></div> <div><span>In order to deliver long-term value for shareholders, companies should also consider the interests of their key stakeholders. </span><span>While stakeholder groups may vary across industries, they are likely to include employees; business partners (such as </span><span>suppliers and distributors); clients and consumers; government and regulators; and the constituents of the communities in </span><span>which a company operates. Companies that build strong relationships with their key stakeholders are more likely to meet </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>28</span></div> <div><span>The global aspiration to achieve a net-zero global economy by 2050 is reflective of aggregated efforts; governments representing over 90% of GDP </span><span>have committed to move to net-zero over the coming decades. In determining how to vote on behalf of clients who have authorized us to do so, we </span><span>look to companies only to address issues within their control and do not anticipate that they will address matters that are the domain of public policy.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>29</span></div> <div><span>For example, BlackRock’s Capital Markets Assumptions anticipate 25 points of cumulative economic gains over a 20-year period in an orderly </span><span>transition as compared to the alternative.

Where we determine that company is not appropriately considering their key stakeholder </span><span>interests in a way that poses material financial risk to the company and its shareholders, we may vote against relevant </span><span>directors or support shareholder proposals related to these topics. Our publicly available commentary provides more </span><span>information on our approach.</span></div> <div><span>Conversely, we note that some shareholder proposals seek to address topics that are clearly within the purview of certain </span><span>stakeholders. For example, we recognize that topics around taxation and tax reporting are within the domain of local, state, </span><span>and federal authorities. BIS will generally not support these proposals.</span></div> <div><span>Human capital management</span></div> <div><span>A company’s approach to human capital management (</span><span>“</span><span>HCM</span><span>”</span><span>) is a critical factor in fostering an inclusive, diverse, and </span><span>engaged workforce, which contributes to business continuity, innovation, and long-term value creation. Consequently, we </span><span>ask companies to demonstrate a robust approach to HCM and provide shareholders with disclosures to understand how </span><span>their approach aligns with their stated strategy and business model.</span></div> <div><span>Clear and consistent disclosures on these matters are critical for investors to make an informed assessment of a company’s </span><span>HCM practices. Companies should disclose the steps they are taking to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion; job categories </span><span>and workforce demographics; and their responses to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s EEO-1 Survey. </span><span>Where we believe a company’s disclosures or practices fall short relative to the market or peers, or we are unable to ascertain </span><span>the board and management’s effectiveness in overseeing related risks and opportunities, we may vote against members of </span><span>the appropriate committee or support relevant shareholder proposals. Our publicly available commentary provides more </span><span>information on our approach to HCM.</span></div> <div><span>Corporate political activities</span></div> <div><span>Companies may engage in certain political activities, within legal and regulatory limits, in order to support public policy </span><span>matters material to the companies’ long-term strategies. These activities can also create risks, including: the potential for </span><span>allegations of corruption; certain reputational risks; and risks that arise from the complex legal, regulatory, and compliance </span><span>considerations associated with corporate political spending and lobbying activity. Companies that engage in political </span><span>activities should develop and maintain robust processes to guide these activities and mitigate risks, including board </span><span>oversight.</span></div> <div><span>When depend on companies to provide accessible and clear disclosures so that investors can easily understand how their </span><span>political activities support their long-term strategy, including on stated public policy priorities. When presented with </span><span>shareholder proposals requesting increased disclosure on corporate political activities, BIS will evaluate publicly available </span><span>information to consider how a company’s lobbying and political activities may impact the company. We will also evaluate </span><span>whether there is general consistency between a company’s stated positions on policy matters material to their strategy and </span><span>the material positions taken by significant industry groups of which they are a member. We may decide to support a </span><span>shareholder proposal requesting additional disclosures if we identify a material inconsistency or feel that further transparency </span><span>may clarify how the company’s political activities support its long-term strategy. Our publicly available commentary provides </span><span>more information on our approach to corporate political activities.</span></div> <div><span>General corporate governance matters</span></div> <div><span>IPO governance</span></div> <div><span>Boards should disclose how the corporate governance structures adopted upon a company’s initial public offering (</span><span>“</span><span>IPO</span><span>”</span><span>) are </span><span>in shareholders’ best long-term interests. We also ask boards to conduct a regular review of corporate governance and </span><span>control structures, such that boards might evolve foundational corporate governance structures as company circumstances </span><span>change, without undue costs and disruption to shareholders. In our letter on unequal voting structures, we articulate our </span><span>view that </span><span>“</span><span>one vote for one share</span><span>”</span><span> is the preferred structure for publicly-traded companies. We also recognize the potential </span><span>benefits of dual class shares to newly public companies as they establish themselves; however, these structures should have </span><span>a specific and limited duration. We will generally engage new companies on topics such as classified boards and </span><span>supermajority vote provisions to amend bylaws, as we think that such arrangements may not be in the best interests of </span><span>shareholders over the long-term.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-30</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

These disclosures should also include the </span><span>accountability and voting mechanisms that would be available to shareholders. We generally support management proposals </span><span>to convert to a PBC if our analysis indicates that shareholders’ interests are adequately protected.

In all instances, we will evaluate the changes to shareholder protections under the new charter/articles/bylaws to </span><span>assess whether the move increases or decreases shareholder protections.

In doing so, we typically consider the governance standards of the company’s </span><span>primary listing, the market standards by which the company governs themselves, and the market context of each specific </span><span>proposal on the agenda. If the relevant standards are silent on the issue under consideration, we will use our professional </span><span>judgment as to what voting outcome would best protect the long-term economic interests of investors.

We may vote against certain directors where changes to </span><span>governing documents are not put to a shareholder vote within a reasonable period of time, particularly if those changes have </span><span>the potential to impact shareholder rights (see </span><span>“</span><span>Director elections</span><span>”</span><span>). In cases where a board’s unilateral adoption of changes </span><span>to the charter/articles/bylaws promotes cost and operational efficiency benefits for the company and its shareholders, we </span><span>may support such action if it does not have a negative effect on shareholder rights or the company’s corporate governance </span><span>structure.</span></div> <div><span>When voting on a management or shareholder proposal to make changes to the charter/articles/bylaws, we will consider in </span><span>part the company’s and/or proponent’s publicly stated rationale for the changes; the company’s governance profile and </span><span>history; relevant jurisdictional laws; and situational or contextual circumstances which may have motivated the proposed </span><span>changes, among other factors.

Proxy access mechanisms should provide shareholders with a reasonable opportunity to use this right </span><span>without stipulating overly restrictive or onerous parameters for use, and also provide assurances that the mechanism will not </span><span>be subject to abuse by short-term investors, investors without a substantial investment in the company, or investors seeking </span><span>to take control of the board.</span></div> <div><span>In general, we support market-standardized proxy access proposals, which allow a shareholder (or group of up to 20 </span><span>shareholders) holding three percent of a company’s outstanding shares for at least three years the right to nominate the </span><span>greater of up to two directors or 20% of the board. Where a standardized proxy access provision exists, we will generally </span><span>oppose shareholder proposals requesting outlier thresholds.</span></div> <div><span>Right to act by written consent</span></div> <div><span>In exceptional circumstances and with sufficiently broad support, shareholders should have the opportunity to raise issues of </span><span>substantial importance without having to wait for management to schedule a meeting. Accordingly, shareholders should </span><span>have the right to solicit votes by written consent provided that: 1) there are reasonable requirements to initiate the consent </span><span>solicitation process (in order to avoid the waste of corporate resources in addressing narrowly supported interests); and 2) </span><span>shareholders receive a minimum of 50% of outstanding shares to effectuate the action by written consent.</span></div> <div><span>We may oppose shareholder proposals requesting the right to act by written consent in cases where the proposal is </span><span>structured for the benefit of a dominant shareholder to the exclusion of others, or if the proposal is written to discourage the </span><span>board from incorporating appropriate mechanisms to avoid the waste of corporate resources when establishing a right to act </span><span>by written consent. Additionally, we may oppose shareholder proposals requesting the right to act by written consent if the </span><span>company already provides a shareholder right to call a special meeting that offers shareholders a reasonable opportunity to </span><span>raise issues of substantial importance without having to wait for management to schedule a meeting.</span></div> <div><span>Right to call a special meeting</span></div> <div><span>In exceptional circumstances and with sufficiently broad support, shareholders should have the opportunity to raise issues of </span><span>substantial importance without having to wait for management to schedule a meeting. Accordingly, shareholders should </span><span>have the right to call a special meeting in cases where a reasonably high proportion of shareholders (typically a minimum of </span><span>15% but no higher than 25%) are required to agree to such a meeting before it is called. However, we may oppose this right </span><span>in cases where the proposal is structured for the benefit of a dominant shareholder, or where a lower threshold may lead to </span><span>an ineffective use of corporate resources. We generally think that a right to act via written consent is not a sufficient </span><span>alternative to the right to call a special meeting.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>32</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock is subject to certain regulations and laws in the United States that place restrictions and limitations on how BlackRock can interact with the </span><span>companies in which we invest on behalf of our clients, including our ability to submit shareholder proposals or elect directors to the board.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-32</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Appendix B – Description of Fixed-Income Ratings</span></div> <div><span>A rating is generally assigned to a fixed-income security at the time of issuance by a credit rating agency designated as a </span><span>NRSRO by the SEC. While NRSROs may from time to time revise such ratings, they undertake no obligation to do so, and the </span><span>ratings given to securities at issuance do not necessarily represent ratings which would be given to these securities on a </span><span>particular subsequent date.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>NRSROs may rate specific investments (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, bonds), issuers (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, corporations, governments and financial institutions) </span><span>and/or programs (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, commercial paper programs). However, certain types of investments may not be rated by NRSROs, </span><span>such as certain government/sovereign obligations, US agency securities, commercial paper, time deposits at financial </span><span>institutions, and derivative instruments such as credit default swaps. For these types of investments, as well as US Treasury </span><span>securities (some of which are not rated), where a NRSRO has not rated the specific investment but has rated the investment’s </span><span>issuer, program, financial institution or underlying reference asset, BFA may consider the investment to have the same </span><span>NRSRO rating as its issuer, program, financial institution or underlying reference asset, as applicable. In the case of municipal </span><span>securities, where one NRSRO provides multiple ratings for the same security (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, </span><span>“</span><span>underlying,</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>“</span><span>insured</span><span>”</span><span> and/or </span><span>“</span><span>enhanced</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>ratings), BFA may consider the security to have the highest of the multiple ratings.</span></div> <div><span>New issue securities (regardless of type) may not be rated by a NRSRO at the time of their initial offering. Preliminary </span><span>prospectuses or term sheets for new issue securities may include an expected rating for the security (as determined by the </span><span>underwriter and/or issuer) or a NRSRO rating for the issuer of the security. If applicable, when deciding whether to purchase </span><span>a new issue security that has not yet been rated by a NRSRO, BFA may attribute an expected rating to the security based on: </span><span>(i) the expected rating of the security set forth in the preliminary prospectus or term sheet for the security; (ii) the NRSRO’s </span><span>rating for the issuer of the security set forth in the preliminary prospectus or term sheet for the security; or (iii) with respect </span><span>to asset-backed securities, the rating of a prior issuance having a similar structure or the same sponsor.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Where the investment objective of a Fund is to track the performance of an index that includes credit ratings eligibility criteria </span><span>as part of its index methodology, a Fund may purchase any security within the index, such security having been determined </span><span>by the index provider as meeting its credit ratings eligibility criteria. The credit ratings practices of an index provider may </span><span>differ from BlackRock’s practices, as described above. Further, a Fund may invest, directly or indirectly, in securities that are </span><span>not rated by a rating agency or securities with a credit rating that differs from the credit rating specified in its index </span><span>methodology in various circumstances, including where a security is downgraded but not yet removed from an index, </span><span>following the removal of a security from an index prior to its sale by the Fund or as a result of a corporate action or </span><span>restructuring affecting an issuer of a security held by a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Fixed-income securities which are unrated may expose the investor to risks with respect to capacity to pay interest or repay </span><span>principal which are similar to the risks of lower-rated speculative bonds. Evaluation of these securities is dependent on the </span><span>investment adviser’s judgment, analysis and experience in the evaluation of such securities.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Investors should note that the assignment of a rating to a security by an NRSRO may not reflect the effect of recent </span><span>developments on the issuer’s ability to make interest and principal payments or on the likelihood of default.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Securities deemed to be high yield are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s and below BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch.</span></div> <div><span>The descriptions below relate to general long-term and short-term obligations of an issuer.</span></div> <div><span>Moody’s Ratings</span></div> <div><span>Long-Term Obligations</span></div> <div><span>Aaa:</span><span> Obligations rated Aaa are judged to be of the highest quality, subject to the lowest level of credit risk.</span></div> <div><span>Aa:</span><span> Obligations rated Aa are judged to be of high quality and are subject to very low credit risk.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>A:</span><span> Obligations rated A are judged to be upper-medium grade and are subject to low credit risk.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Baa:</span><span> Obligations rated Baa are judged to be medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk and as such may possess </span><span>certain speculative characteristics.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>B-1</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

This capacity may, nevertheless, be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic conditions than is </span><span>the case for higher ratings.</span></div> <div><span>BBB:</span><span> Good credit quality. BBB ratings indicate that expectations of credit risk are currently low. The capacity for payment of </span><span>financial commitments is considered adequate but adverse business or economic conditions are more likely to impair this </span><span>capacity.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>B-4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>BB:</span><span> Speculative. BB ratings indicate an elevated vulnerability to credit risk, particularly in the event of adverse changes in </span><span>business or economic conditions over time; however, business or financial alternatives may be available to allow financial </span><span>commitments to be met.</span></div> <div><span>B:</span><span> Highly speculative. B ratings indicate that material credit risk is present.</span></div> <div><span>CCC:</span><span> Substantial credit risk. CCC ratings indicate that substantial credit risk is present.</span></div> <div><span>CC:</span><span> Very high levels of credit risk. CC ratings indicate very high levels of credit risk.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>C:</span><span> Exceptionally high levels of credit risk. C indicates exceptionally high levels of credit risk.</span></div> <div><span>Defaulted obligations typically are not assigned RD or D ratings, but are instead rated in the B to C rating categories, </span><span>depending upon their recovery prospects and other relevant characteristics. This approach better aligns obligations that have </span><span>comparable overall expected loss but varying vulnerability to default and loss.</span></div> <div><span>Note: The modifiers </span><span>“</span><span>+</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>-</span><span>”</span><span> may be appended to a rating to denote relative status within major rating categories. Such </span><span>suffixes are not added to the AAA obligation rating category, or to corporate finance obligation ratings in the categories </span><span>below CCC.</span></div> <div><span>The subscript 'emr' is appended to a rating to denote embedded market risk which is beyond the scope of the rating. The </span><span>designation is intended to make clear that the rating solely addresses the counterparty risk of the issuing bank. It is not meant </span><span>to indicate any limitation in the analysis of the counterparty risk, which in all other respects follows published Fitch criteria for </span><span>analyzing the issuing financial institution. Fitch does not rate these instruments where the principal is to any degree subject to </span><span>market risk.</span></div> <div><span>Short-Term Obligations (Corporate and Public Finance)</span></div> <div><span>A short-term issuer or obligation rating is based in all cases on the short-term vulnerability to default of the rated entity or </span><span>security stream and relates to the capacity to meet financial obligations in accordance with the documentation governing the </span><span>relevant obligation. Short-Term Ratings are assigned to obligations whose initial maturity is viewed as </span><span>“</span><span>short-term</span><span>”</span><span> based on </span><span>market convention. Typically, this means up to 13 months for corporate, sovereign, and structured obligations, and up to 36 </span><span>months for obligations in U.S. public finance markets.</span></div> <div><span>F1:</span><span> Highest short-term credit quality. Indicates the strongest intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments; </span><span>may have an added </span><span>“</span><span>+</span><span>”</span><span> to denote any exceptionally strong credit feature.</span></div> <div><span>F2:</span><span> Good short-term credit quality. Good intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments.</span></div> <div><span>F3:</span><span> Fair short-term credit quality. The intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments is adequate.</span></div> <div><span>B:</span><span> Speculative short-term credit quality. Minimal capacity for timely payment of financial commitments, plus heightened </span><span>vulnerability to near term adverse changes in financial and economic conditions.</span></div> <div><span>C:</span><span> High short-term default risk. Default is a real possibility.</span></div> <div><span>RD:</span><span> Restricted default. Indicates an entity that has defaulted on one or more of its financial commitments, although it </span><span>continues to meet other financial obligations. Typically applicable to entity ratings only.</span></div> <div><span>D:</span><span> Default. Indicates a broad-based default event for an entity, or the default of a short-term obligation.</span></div> <div><span>IS-SAI-10BY-1023</span></div> <div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>B-5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> </body></html>
