Fund is managed by BlackRock Fund Advisors (</font><font>“</font><font>BFA</font><font>”</font><font>), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc., and </font><font>generally seeks to track the investment results of the specific benchmark index identified in the applicable Prospectus for that </font><font>Fund (each, an </font><font>“</font><font>Underlying Index</font><font>”</font><font>).</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Each Fund offers and issues shares at their net asset value per share (</font><font>“</font><font>NAV</font><font>”</font><font>) only in aggregations of a specified number
of </font><font>shares (each, a </font><font>“</font><font>Creation
Unit</font><font>”</font><font>), generally in exchange for a designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions </font><font>(including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) included in its Underlying Index (the
</font><font>“</font><font>Deposit </font><font>Securities</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>Creation Basket</font><font>”</font><font>), together with the deposit of a
specified cash payment (the </font><font>“</font><font>Cash Component</font><font>”</font><font>). Shares of </font><font>the Funds are listed for trading on
national securities exchanges such as Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (</font><font>“</font><font>Cboe BZX</font><font>”</font><font>), The Nasdaq </font><font>Stock Market LLC (</font><font>“</font><font>Nasdaq</font><font>”</font><font>) or NYSE Arca, Inc. (</font><font>“</font><font>NYSE Arca</font><font>”</font><font>) (each a </font><font>“</font><font>Listing Exchange</font><font>”</font><font>). Shares of each Fund are
traded </font><font>in the secondary market and elsewhere at market prices that may be at, above or below the Fund's NAV. Shares are </font><font>redeemable only in Creation Units by Authorized Participants (as defined in the </font><font>Creation and Redemption of
Creation Units-Role</font><font> of the Authorized Participant</font><font> section of this SAI) and, generally, in
exchange for portfolio securities and a Cash Amount </font><font>(as defined in the </font><font>Redemption of Creation
Units</font><font> section of this SAI). Creation Units typically are a specified number of shares, </font><font>generally ranging from
10,000 to 100,000 shares or multiples thereof.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Trust reserves the
right to permit or require that creations and redemptions of shares are effected fully or partially in cash </font><font>and reserves the right to permit or require the substitution of Deposit
Securities in lieu of cash. Shares may be issued in </font><font>advance of receipt of Deposit Securities, subject to various conditions, including a requirement that the Authorized </font><font>Participant maintain with the Trust collateral as set forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants. The Trust may use
</font><font>such collateral at any time to purchase Deposit Securities. See the </font><font>Creation and Redemption
of Creation Units</font><font> section of this </font><font>SAI. Transaction fees and other costs associated with creations or
redemptions that include a cash portion may be higher </font><font>than the transaction fees and other costs associated with in-kind creations or redemptions. In all cases, conditions with
</font><font>respect to creations and redemptions of shares and fees will be limited in accordance with the requirements of SEC rules and </font><font>regulations applicable to management investment companies offering redeemable securities.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Exchange Listing and Trading</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>A discussion of exchange listing and trading matters associated with an investment in each
Fund is contained in the </font><font>Shareholder Information</font><font> section of each Fund's Prospectus. The
discussion below supplements, and should be read in </font><font>conjunction with, that section of the applicable Prospectus.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Shares of each Fund are listed for trading, and trade throughout the day, on the applicable
Listing Exchange and in other </font><font>secondary markets. Shares of certain Funds may also be listed on certain non-U.S. exchanges. There can be no assurance </font><font>that the requirements of the Listing Exchange necessary to maintain the listing of shares of any Fund will continue to be met.
</font><font>The Listing Exchange may, but is not required to, remove the shares of a Fund from listing if, among other things: (i) a Fund is </font><font>no longer eligible to operate in reliance on Rule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act; (ii) any of the other listing
</font><font>requirements are not continuously maintained; or (iii) any event shall occur or condition shall exist that, in the opinion of the </font><font>Listing Exchange, makes further dealings on the Listing Exchange inadvisable. The Listing Exchange will also remove shares
</font><font>of a Fund from listing and trading upon termination of such Fund.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>As in the case of other publicly-traded securities, when you buy or sell shares of a Fund
through a broker, you may incur a </font><font>brokerage commission determined by that broker, as well as other charges.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>The Trust reserves the right to adjust the share
price of the Funds in the future to maintain convenient trading ranges for </font><font>investors. Any adjustments would be accomplished through stock splits or reverse stock splits, which
would have no effect </font><font>on the net assets of the Funds or an investor's equity interest in the Funds.</font><font> </font></div> <div>
<div><font>Investment Strategies and Risks</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Each Fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing primarily in both fixed-income
securities that compose its relevant </font><font>Underlying Index and in investments that provide substantially similar exposure to securities in the Underlying Index. The </font><font>Underlying Indexes for the iShares High Yield Systematic Bond ETF and iShares Investment Grade Systematic Bond ETF are </font><font>based
on a proprietary methodology created and sponsored by BlackRock Index Services, LLC (the </font><font>“</font><font>Index
Provider</font><font>”</font><font>). The </font><font>Index Provider is an
affiliated person of the iShares High Yield Systematic Bond ETF and iShares Investment Grade Systematic </font><font>Bond ETF and of BFA. Each Fund operates as an index fund and is not actively
managed. Adverse performance of a security </font><font>in a Fund’s portfolio will ordinarily not result in the elimination of the security from the Fund’s portfolio.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Each Fund engages in representative sampling, which is investing in a sample of securities selected by BFA to have a </font><font>collective investment profile similar to that of the Fund's Underlying Index. Securities selected have aggregate investment
</font><font>characteristics (based on market value and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as yield, credit rating, </font><font>maturity and duration) and liquidity measures similar to those of the Fund’s Underlying Index. A fund that uses
</font><font>representative sampling generally does not hold all of the securities that are in its underlying index.</font></div> </div>

<div><font>Asset-Backed Securities Risk.</font><font>  </font><font>Asset-backed securities (</font><font>“</font><font>ABS</font><font>”</font><font>) represent interests in </font><font>“</font><font>pools</font><font>”</font><font> of assets, including consumer </font><font>loans or receivables held in trust. ABS are
</font><font>“</font><font>pass-through</font><font>”</font><font> securities, meaning that principal and interest payments, net of </font><font>expenses, made by the borrower on the underlying assets
are passed through to a Fund. ABS, like traditional fixed-income </font><font>securities, are subject to credit, interest rate, call, prepayment, extension, valuation and illiquidity risk.
Because of call, </font><font>prepayment, and extension risk, however, ABS react differently to changes in interest rates than other bonds. Small </font><font>movements in interest rates (both increases and decreases) may quickly and significantly reduce the value of certain ABS. </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><a name="xx_a947e660-0edd-4807-973e-765f2e4dfa58_5"></a> <div> <div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The price paid by a Fund for its ABS, the yield a
Fund expects to receive from such securities and the average life of such </font><font>securities are based on a number of factors, including the anticipated rate of prepayment of the
underlying assets. During </font><font>periods of difficulty in the credit markets, ABS may decline in value and become less liquid, more volatile, and more difficult </font><font>to value.</font><font> </font></div> <div>
<div><font>The nature of the assets and the servicing of those assets may subject ABS to additional risks in comparison to mortgage-backed</font><font> securities. For instance, certain ABS generally do not have the benefit of a security interest in collateral that is
</font><font>comparable in quality to mortgage-backed assets. The value of the collateral may also be insufficient to cover the principal </font><font>amount of the obligation. Other ABS, such as those backed by credit card receivables, do not have the benefit of a security
</font><font>interest in collateral at all. Moreover, the values of ABS may be substantially dependent on the servicing of the underlying </font><font>asset pools, and are therefore subject to risks associated with the negligence or malfeasance by their servicers and to the
</font><font>credit risk of their servicers.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>ABS are often not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government and are subject to risk of default on the
</font><font>underlying asset, particularly during periods of economic downturn.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Bonds.</font><font>  </font><font> Each Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in U.S. dollar-denominated bonds. A bond is an interest-bearing
</font><font>security issued by a U.S. or non-U.S. company or governmental unit. The issuer of a bond has a contractual obligation to pay </font><font>interest at a stated rate on specific dates and to repay principal (the bond’s face value) periodically or on a specified maturity </font><font>date. Bonds generally are used by issuers to borrow money from investors.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>An issuer may have the right to redeem or
</font><font>“</font><font>call</font><font>”</font><font> a bond before maturity, in which case the Fund may have to reinvest the </font><font>proceeds at lower market rates.</font><font> </font><font>Similarly, a fund may have to reinvest interest income or payments received when bonds </font><font>mature, sometimes at lower market rates. Most bonds bear interest income at a </font><font>“</font><font>coupon</font><font>”</font><font> rate that is fixed for the life of the
</font><font>bond. The value of a fixed-rate bond usually rises when market interest rates fall, and falls when market interest rates rise. </font><font>Accordingly, a fixed-rate bond’s yield (income as a percent of the bond’s current value) may differ from its coupon rate as its </font><font>value rises or falls. When an investor purchases a fixed-rate bond at a price that is greater than its face value, the investor is </font><font>purchasing the bond at a premium. Conversely, when an investor purchases a fixed-rate bond at a price that is less than its
</font><font>face value, the investor is purchasing the bond at a discount. Fixed-rate bonds that are purchased at a discount pay less </font><font>current income than securities with comparable yields that are purchased at face value, with the result that prices for such
</font><font>fixed-rate securities can be more volatile than prices for such securities that are purchased at face value. Other types of </font><font>bonds bear interest at an interest rate that is adjusted periodically. Interest rates on </font><font>“</font><font>floating rate</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>variable rate</font><font>”</font><font> bonds </font><font>may be higher or lower than current market rates for fixed-rate bonds of comparable quality with similar final
maturities. </font><font>Because of their adjustable interest rates, the value of </font><font>“</font><font>floating rate</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>variable rate</font><font>”</font><font> bonds fluctuates much less in </font><font>response to market interest rate movements than the value of fixed-rate bonds, but their
value may decline if their interest </font><font>rates do not rise as much, or as quickly, as interest rates in general. Each Fund may treat some of these bonds as having a </font><font>shorter maturity for purposes of calculating the weighted average maturity of its investment portfolio. Generally, prices of
</font><font>higher quality issues tend to fluctuate less with changes in market interest rates than prices of lower quality issues and prices </font><font>of longer maturity issues tend to fluctuate more than prices of shorter maturity issues. Bonds may be senior or subordinated
</font><font>obligations. Senior obligations generally have the first claim on an issuer’s earnings and assets and, in the event of </font><font>liquidation, are paid before subordinated obligations. Bonds may be unsecured (backed only by the issuer’s general
</font><font>creditworthiness) or secured (backed by specified collateral).</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Borrowing. </font><font> </font><font>Each Fund may borrow for temporary or emergency purposes, including to meet payments due from
</font><font>redemptions or to facilitate the settlement of securities or other transactions. The iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF and </font><font>iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF, along with certain other iShares funds, have entered into a syndicated line of credit with the </font><font>Bank of New York Mellon (</font><font>“</font><font>BNY</font><font>”</font><font>), which serves as administrative agent for itself and the other banks. The syndicated line of </font><font>credit may be used for temporary or emergency purposes, including redemption, settlement of trades and rebalancing of
</font><font>portfolio holdings.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Interest rates related to the syndicated line of credit are based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (</font><font>“</font><font>SOFR</font><font>”</font><font>) published </font><font>by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plus a spread. Pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement, if SOFR were to cease
</font><font>being published or representative, it would be replaced by a rate based on an alternate benchmark selected by BNY.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The purchase of securities while borrowings are outstanding may have the effect of leveraging
a Fund. The incurrence of </font><font>leverage increases a Fund’s exposure to risk, and borrowed funds are subject to interest costs that will reduce net income. </font><font>Purchasing securities while borrowings are outstanding creates special risks, such as the potential for greater volatility in the </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>NAV of Fund shares and in the yield on a
Fund’s portfolio. In addition, the interest expenses from borrowings may exceed the </font><font>income generated by a Fund’s portfolio and, therefore, the amount available (if any)
for distribution to shareholders as </font><font>dividends may be reduced. BFA may determine to maintain outstanding borrowings if it expects that the benefits to a Fund’s </font><font>shareholders will outweigh the current reduced return.</font><font> </font></div>
<div> <div><font>Certain types of borrowings by a Fund must be made from a bank or may result in a Fund being
subject to covenants in </font><font>credit agreements relating to asset coverage, portfolio composition requirements and other matters. It is not anticipated that </font><font>observance of such covenants would impede BFA’s management of a Fund’s portfolio in accordance with a Fund’s
</font><font>investment objectives and policies. However, a breach of any such covenants not cured within the specified cure period may </font><font>result in acceleration of outstanding indebtedness and require a Fund to dispose of portfolio investments at a time when it
</font><font>may be disadvantageous to do so.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Brady Bonds.
</font><font> </font><font>Certain of the Funds may invest in Brady bonds. Brady bonds are securities created
through the exchange of </font><font>existing commercial bank loans to public and private entities in certain emerging markets for new bonds in connection with </font><font>debt restructurings. Brady bonds have been issued since 1989. In light of the history of defaults of countries issuing Brady
</font><font>bonds on their commercial bank loans, investments in Brady bonds may be viewed as speculative and subject to the same </font><font>risks as emerging market securities. Brady bonds may be fully or partially collateralized or uncollateralized, are issued in U.S. </font><font>dollars and are actively traded in over-the-counter (</font><font>“</font><font>OTC</font><font>”</font><font>) secondary markets. Incomplete
collateralization of interest or </font><font>principal payment obligations results in increased credit risk. U.S. dollar-denominated collateralized Brady bonds, which may </font><font>be either fixed-rate or floating rate bonds, are generally collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities Risk.
</font><font> </font><font>The commercial mortgage-backed securities (</font><font>“</font><font>CMBS</font><font>”</font><font>) in which a Fund </font><font>invests may be issued by entities, such as banks, mortgage lenders or other institutions. These entities
are not backed by the </font><font>full faith and credit of the U.S. government, and there can be no assurance that the U.S. government would provide financial </font><font>support to its agencies or instrumentalities where it is not obligated to do so. </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>CMBS depend on cash flows generated by underlying commercial real-estate loans, receivables or other assets, and can be </font><font>significantly affected by changes in interest rates, the availability of information concerning the underlying assets and their </font><font>structure, and the creditworthiness of the originators of the underlying assets. </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Due to the nature of the loans they represent, CMBS are subject to a greater degree of prepayment and extension risk than </font><font>many other forms of fixed-income securities. Small movements in interest rates (both increases and decreases) may quickly
</font><font>and significantly reduce the value of certain CMBS. Certain CMBS are issued in several classes with different levels of yield </font><font>and credit protection. A Fund’s investments in CMBS with several classes may be in the lower classes that have greater risks </font><font>than the higher classes, including greater interest rate, credit, prepayment and extension risks. </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>In addition, the value of CMBS may be adversely affected by regulatory or tax changes. CMBS issued by non-government </font><font>entities may offer higher yields than those issued by government entities, but also may be subject to greater volatility than
</font><font>government issues. In the recent past, the market for CMBS has experienced volatility and reduced liquidity. </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Corporate Bonds.</font><font>  </font><font>Each Fund (other than the iShares ESG Advanced Total USD Bond Market ETF, Treasury Bond Funds and
</font><font>the Municipal Bond Funds) may invest in investment-grade and/or high yield corporate bonds. High yield corporate bonds </font><font>may be deemed speculative and more volatile than higher rated securities of similar maturity. The investment return of
</font><font>corporate bonds reflects interest earned on the security and changes in the market value of the security. The market value of </font><font>a corporate bond may be affected by changes in the market rate of interest, the credit rating of the issuer, the issuer’s </font><font>performance and perceptions of the issuer in the marketplace. There is a risk that the issuers of the securities may not be
</font><font>able to meet their obligations on interest or principal payments at the time called for by an instrument.</font></div> </div>

</font><font>companies) if, with respect to 75% of its total assets, (a) more than 5% of the fund’s total assets would be invested in </font><font>securities of that issuer or (b) the fund would hold more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of that issuer. With
</font><font>respect to the remaining 25% of its total assets, the fund may invest more than 5% of its assets in one issuer. Under the 1940 </font><font>Act, a fund cannot change its classification from diversified to non-diversified without shareholder approval.</font></div> </div>

<div><font> </font><font>A </font><font>“</font><font>non-diversified</font><font>”</font><font> fund is a fund that is not limited by the 1940 Act with regard to the percentage of its assets that may be </font><font>invested in the
securities of a single issuer. The securities of a particular issuer (or securities of issuers in particular industries) </font><font>may constitute a significant percentage of the underlying
index of such a fund and, consequently, the fund’s investment </font><font>portfolio. This may adversely affect a fund’s performance or subject the fund’s shares to greater
price volatility than that </font><font>experienced by more diversified investment companies.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Each Fund (whether diversified or non-diversified)
intends to maintain the required level of diversification and otherwise </font><font>conduct its operations so as to qualify as a regulated investment company (</font><font>“</font><font>RIC</font><font>”</font><font>) for purposes of the U.S. Internal Revenue </font><font>Code of 1986, as amended (the </font><font>“</font><font>Internal Revenue Code</font><font>”</font><font>), and to relieve the Fund of any liability for U.S. federal income tax to </font><font>the extent that its earnings are distributed to

<div> <div><font>Futures, Options on Futures and Securities Options.</font><font>  </font><font>Futures contracts, options on futures and securities options may be </font><font>used by a Fund to simulate investment in its Underlying Index, to facilitate trading or to reduce transaction costs. Each Fund
</font><font>may enter into futures contracts and options on futures that are traded on a U.S. or non-U.S. futures exchange. Each Fund </font><font>will not use futures, options on futures or securities options for speculative purposes. Each Fund intends to use futures and
</font><font>options on futures in accordance with Rule 4.5 of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the </font><font>“</font><font>CFTC</font><font>”</font><font>) promulgated </font><font>under the Commodity Exchange Act (</font><font>“</font><font>CEA</font><font>”</font><font>). BFA, with respect to certain Funds, has claimed an exclusion from the definition </font><font>of the term </font><font>“</font><font>commodity pool operator</font><font>”</font><font> in accordance with Rule 4.5 so that BFA, with respect to such Funds, is not subject to </font><font>registration or regulation as a commodity pool operator under the CEA. See the </font><font>Regulation Regarding
Derivatives </font><font>section of </font><font>this SAI for more information.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Futures contracts provide for the future sale by one party and purchase by another party of a
specified amount of a specific </font><font>instrument or index at a specified future time and at a specified price. Stock index contracts are based on investments that </font><font>reflect the market value of common stock of the firms included in the investments. Each Fund may enter into futures
</font><font>contracts to purchase securities indexes when BFA anticipates purchasing the underlying securities and believes prices will </font><font>rise before the purchase will be made. Upon entering into a futures contract, a Fund will be required to deposit with the
</font><font>broker an amount of cash or cash equivalents known as </font><font>“</font><font>initial margin,</font><font>”</font><font> which is similar to a
performance bond or good faith </font><font>deposit on the contract and is returned to the Fund upon termination of the futures contract if all contractual obligations </font><font>have been satisfied. Subsequent payments, known as
</font><font>“</font><font>variation margin,</font><font>”</font><font> will be made to and from the broker daily as the </font><font>price of the instrument or index underlying the futures contract
fluctuates, making the long and short positions in the futures </font><font>contract more or less valuable, a process known as
</font><font>“</font><font>marking-to-market.</font><font>”</font><font> At any time prior to the expiration of a futures </font><font>contract, each Fund may elect to close the position by taking an opposite
position, which will operate to terminate the Fund’s </font><font>existing position in the contract. An option on a futures contract, as contrasted with a direct investment in such a
contract, </font><font>gives the purchaser the right, but no obligation, in return for the premium paid, to assume a position in the underlying </font><font>futures contract at a specified exercise price at any time prior to the expiration date of the option. Upon exercise of an option, </font><font>the delivery of the futures position by the writer of the option to the holder of the option will be accompanied by delivery of </font><font>the accumulated balance in the writer’s futures margin account that represents the amount by which the market price of the </font><font>futures contract exceeds (in the case of a call) or is less than (in the case of a put) the exercise price of the option on the </font><font>futures contract.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The potential for loss related to the purchase of an option on a futures contract is limited to the premium paid for the option </font><font>plus transaction costs. Because the value of the option is fixed at the point of sale, there are no daily cash payments by the
</font><font>purchaser to reflect changes in the value of the underlying contract; however, the value of the option changes daily and that </font><font>change would be reflected in the NAV of each Fund. The potential for loss related to writing call options is unlimited. The
</font><font>potential for loss related to writing put options is limited to the agreed-upon price per share, also known as the </font><font>“</font><font>strike price,</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>less the premium received from writing the put. Certain of the Funds may purchase and write put and call
options on futures </font><font>contracts that are traded on an exchange as a hedge against changes in value of their portfolio securities or in anticipation of </font><font>the purchase of securities, and may enter into closing transactions with respect to such options to terminate existing
</font><font>positions. There is no guarantee that such closing transactions can be effected.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Securities options may be used by a Fund to obtain access to securities in its Underlying Index or to dispose of securities in </font><font>its Underlying Index at favorable prices, to invest cash in a securities index that offers similar exposure to that provided by its </font><font>Underlying Index or otherwise to achieve the Fund’s objective of tracking its Underlying
Index.</font><font> </font><font>A call option gives a holder the </font><font>right to purchase a specific security at a specified price (</font><font>“</font><font>exercise price</font><font>”</font><font>) within a specified period of
time. A put option gives </font><font>a holder the right to sell a specific security at an exercise price within a specified period of time. The initial purchaser of a call </font><font>option pays the </font><font>“</font><font>writer</font><font>”</font><font> a premium, which is paid at the time of purchase and is retained by the writer whether or not such </font><font>option is exercised. Each Fund may purchase put options to hedge its portfolio against the risk of a decline in the market
</font><font>value of securities held and may purchase call options to hedge against an increase in the price of securities it is committed </font><font>to purchase. Each Fund may write put and call options along with a long position in options to increase its ability to hedge
</font><font>against a change in the market value of the securities it holds or is committed to purchase. Each Fund may purchase or sell </font></div> </div> </div> <div>

securities exchange or in the OTC market through a transaction with a dealer. Options </font><font>on a securities index are typically settled on a net basis based on the appreciation or
depreciation of the index level over the </font><font>strike price. Options on single name securities may be cash- or physically-settled, depending upon the market in which they </font><font>are traded. Options may be structured so as to be exercisable only on certain dates or on a daily basis. Options may also be
</font><font>structured to have conditions to exercise (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, </font><font>“</font><font>Knock-in Events</font><font>”</font><font>) or conditions that trigger termination (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, </font><font>“</font><font>Knock-out </font><font>Events</font><font>”</font><font>).</font><font> </font></div> <div>
<div><font>High Yield Securities.</font><font>  </font><font>Certain Funds may invest in non-investment grade securities. Non-investment grade or </font><font>“</font><font>high yield</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>fixed-income or convertible securities are commonly known to investors as </font><font>“</font><font>junk bonds</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>high yield bonds.</font><font>”</font><font> These are </font><font>generally debt securities that are rated below investment grade by one or more of the major rating agencies or
are unrated </font><font>securities that BFA believes are of comparable quality. While generally providing greater income and opportunity for gain, </font><font>non-investment grade debt securities may be subject to greater risks than securities that have higher credit ratings, including </font><font>a high risk of default, and their yields will fluctuate over time. High yield securities will generally be in the lower rating
</font><font>categories of recognized rating agencies (rated below Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (</font><font>“</font><font>Moody's</font><font>”</font><font>) or below BBB- by </font><font>Standard &amp;
Poor's</font><font>®</font><font> Global Ratings, a subsidiary of S&amp;P Global (</font><font>“</font><font>S&amp;P Global Ratings</font><font>”</font><font>) or Fitch Ratings, Inc. (</font><font>“</font><font>Fitch</font><font>”</font><font>)) or be </font><font>unrated. The credit rating of a high
yield security does not necessarily address its market value risk, and ratings may from </font><font>time to time change, positively or negatively, to reflect developments regarding the
issuer’s financial condition. High yield </font><font>securities are considered to be speculative with respect to the capacity of the issuer to timely repay principal and pay interest
</font><font>in accordance with the terms of the obligation and may have more credit risk than higher rated securities.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The major risks of high yield bond investments include the following:</font></div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>High yield bonds may be issued by less creditworthy issuers. These securities are vulnerable to
adverse changes in </font><font>the issuer’s industry or to general economic conditions. Issuers of high yield bonds may be unable to meet their </font><font>interest or principal payment obligations because of an economic downturn, specific issuer developments or the
</font><font>unavailability of additional financing.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>The issuers of high yield bonds may have a larger amount of outstanding debt relative to their
assets than issuers of </font><font>investment grade bonds. If the issuer experiences financial stress, it may be unable to meet its debt obligations. The </font><font>issuer’s ability to pay its debt obligations also may be lessened by specific issuer developments, or the unavailability
</font><font>of additional financing. Issuers of high yield securities are often in the growth stage of their development and/or </font><font>involved in a reorganization or takeover.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>High yield bonds are frequently ranked junior to claims by other creditors. If the issuer
cannot meet its obligations, </font><font>the senior obligations are generally paid off before the junior obligations, which will potentially limit a Fund’s ability </font><font>to fully recover principal, to receive interest payments when senior securities are in default or to receive </font><font>restructuring
benefits paid to holders of more senior classes of debt. Thus, investors in high yield securities </font><font>frequently have a lower degree of protection with respect to principal and
interest payments than do investors in </font><font>higher rated securities.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>High yield bonds frequently have redemption features that permit an issuer to repurchase the
security from a Fund </font><font>before it matures. If an issuer redeems the high yield bonds, a Fund may have to invest the proceeds in bonds with </font><font>lower yields and may lose income.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> </div>
</div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Prices of high yield bonds are subject to extreme fluctuations. Negative economic developments
may have a greater </font><font>impact on the prices of high yield bonds than on those of other higher rated fixed-income securities.</font></div> </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Under certain
economic and/or market conditions, a Fund may have difficulty disposing of certain high yield </font><font>securities due to the limited number of investors in that sector of the market. There
are fewer dealers in the high </font><font>yield bond market, and there may be significant differences in the prices quoted for high yield bonds by dealers, and </font><font>such quotations may not be the actual prices available for a purchase or sale. Judgment may play a greater role in </font><font>the
prices and values generated for such securities than in the case of securities trading in a more liquid market.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>The secondary markets for high yield securities are not as liquid as the secondary markets for
higher rated </font><font>securities. The secondary markets for high yield securities are concentrated in relatively few market makers and, </font><font>participants in the markets are mostly institutional investors, including insurance companies, banks, other financial
</font><font>institutions and mutual funds. In addition, the trading volume for high yield securities is generally lower than that </font><font>for higher rated securities and the secondary markets could contract under adverse market or economic conditions </font><font>independent
of any specific adverse changes in the condition of a particular issuer. Under certain economic and/or </font><font>market conditions, a Fund may have difficulty disposing of certain high yield
securities due to the limited number of </font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>investors in that sector of the
market. An illiquid secondary market may adversely affect the market price of the high </font><font>yield security, which may result in increased difficulty selling the particular issue and
obtaining accurate market </font><font>quotations on the issue when valuing a Fund's assets. Market quotations on high yield securities are available only </font><font>from a limited number of dealers, and such quotations may not be the actual prices available for a purchase or sale. </font><font>When
the secondary market for high yield securities becomes more illiquid, or in the absence of readily available </font><font>market quotations for such securities, the relative lack of reliable
objective data makes it more difficult to value such </font><font>securities, and judgment plays a more important role in determining such valuations.</font></div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>A Fund may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate
new terms with a </font><font>defaulting issuer.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>The high yield bond markets may react strongly to adverse news about an issuer or the economy,
or to the </font><font>perception or expectation of adverse news, whether or not it is based on fundamental analysis. Additionally, prices </font><font>for high yield securities may be affected by legislative and regulatory developments. These developments could </font><font>adversely
affect a Fund’s NAV and investment practices, the secondary market for high yield securities, the financial </font><font>condition of issuers of these securities and the value and
liquidity of outstanding high yield securities, especially in a </font><font>thinly traded market. For example, federal legislation requiring the divestiture by federally insured savings and
loan </font><font>associations of their investments in high yield bonds and limiting the deductibility of interest by certain corporate </font><font>issuers of high yield bonds adversely affected the market in the past.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Lending Portfolio Securities.</font><font>  </font><font>Each Fund may lend portfolio securities to certain borrowers that BFA determines to be </font><font>creditworthy, including borrowers affiliated with BFA. The borrowers provide collateral that is maintained in an amount at
</font><font>least equal to the current market value of the securities loaned. No securities loan shall be made on behalf of a Fund if, as a </font><font>result, the aggregate value of all securities loans of the particular Fund exceeds one-third of the value of such Fund's total
</font><font>assets (including the value of the collateral received). A Fund may terminate a loan at any time and obtain the return of the </font><font>securities loaned. Each Fund receives, by way of substitute payment, the value of any interest or cash or non-cash
</font><font>distributions paid on the loaned securities that it would have otherwise received if the securities were not on loan.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>With respect to loans that are collateralized by cash, the borrower may be entitled to receive a fee based on the amount of </font><font>cash collateral. The Funds are compensated by any positive difference between the amount earned on the reinvestment of </font><font>cash
collateral and the fee paid to the borrower. In the case of collateral other than cash, a Fund is compensated by a fee paid </font><font>by the borrower equal to a percentage of the market
value of the loaned securities. Any cash collateral received by the Fund </font><font>for such loans, and uninvested cash, may be reinvested in certain short-term instruments either directly on
behalf of each </font><font>Fund or through one or more joint accounts or money market funds, including those affiliated with BFA; such investments </font><font>are subject to investment risk.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Each Fund conducts its securities lending pursuant to an exemptive order from the SEC
permitting it to lend portfolio </font><font>securities to borrowers affiliated with the Fund and to retain an affiliate of the Fund to act as securities lending agent. To the </font><font>extent that a Fund engages in securities lending, BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (</font><font>“</font><font>BTC</font><font>”</font><font>) acts as securities </font><font>lending agent for the Fund, subject to the overall supervision of BFA. BTC administers the lending program in accordance
</font><font>with guidelines approved by the Trust's Board of Trustees (the </font><font>“</font><font>Board,</font><font>”</font><font> the trustees of which are the </font><font>“</font><font>Trustees</font><font>”</font><font>). JPMorgan </font><font>Chase Bank, N.A. (</font><font>“</font><font>JPMorgan</font><font>”</font><font>) serves as custodian for the Funds in
connection with certain securities lending activities.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Securities lending
involves exposure to certain risks, including operational risk (i.e., the risk of losses resulting from problems </font><font>in the settlement and accounting process), </font><font>“</font><font>gap</font><font>”</font><font> risk (i.e., the risk of a mismatch between the return on cash collateral </font><font>reinvestments and the fees a Fund has agreed to
pay a borrower), foreign exchange risk (i.e., the risk of a shortfall at default </font><font>when a cash collateral investment is denominated in a currency other than the currency of the
assets being loaned due to </font><font>movements in foreign exchange rates), and credit, legal, counterparty and market risks (including the risk that market events </font><font>could lead the Fund to recall loaned securities or to lend less or not at all, which could lead to reduced securities lending
</font><font>revenue). If a securities lending counterparty were to default, a Fund would be subject to the risk of a possible delay in </font><font>receiving collateral or in recovering the loaned securities, or to a possible loss of rights in the collateral. In the event a
</font><font>borrower does not return a Fund’s securities as agreed, the Fund’s ability to participate in a corporate action event may be </font><font>impacted, or the Fund may experience losses if the proceeds received from liquidating the collateral do not at least equal the
</font><font>value of the loaned security at the time the collateral is liquidated, plus the transaction costs incurred in purchasing </font><font>replacement securities. This latter event could trigger adverse tax consequences for a Fund. A Fund could lose money if its
</font><font>short-term investment of the collateral declines in value over the period of the loan. Substitute payments received by a Fund </font><font>representing dividends paid on securities loaned out by the Fund will not be considered qualified dividend income. BTC will </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>take into account the tax effects on shareholders
caused by this difference in connection with a Fund’s securities lending </font><font>program. Substitute payments received on tax-exempt securities loaned out will not be tax-exempt
income. There could also </font><font>be changes in the status of issuers under applicable laws and regulations, including tax regulations, that may impact the </font><font>regulatory or tax treatment of loaned securities and could, for example, result in a delay in the payment of dividend
</font><font>equivalent payments owed to a Fund (as permitted by applicable law).</font></div> <div> <div><font>Regulations adopted by global prudential regulators require certain bank-regulated counterparties and certain of their
</font><font>affiliates to include in certain financial contracts, including many securities lending agreements, terms that delay or restrict </font><font>the rights of counterparties, such as the Fund, to terminate such agreements, foreclose upon collateral, exercise other default </font><font>rights or restrict transfers of credit support in the event that the counterparty and/or its affiliates are subject to certain types </font><font>of resolution or insolvency proceedings. It is possible that these requirements, as well as potential additional government
</font><font>regulation and other developments in the market, could adversely affect the Fund’s ability to terminate existing securities </font><font>lending agreements or to realize amounts to be received under such agreements.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Liquidity Risk Management.</font><font>  </font><font>Rule 22e-4 under the Investment Company Act (the
</font><font>“</font><font>Liquidity Rule</font><font>”</font><font>) requires open-end funds, </font><font>including exchange-traded funds (</font><font>“</font><font>ETFs</font><font>”</font><font>) such as the Funds, to establish a liquidity risk management program (the </font><font>“</font><font>Liquidity Program</font><font>”</font><font>) and enhance disclosures
regarding fund liquidity. As required by the Liquidity Rule, the Funds have </font><font>implemented a Liquidity Program, and the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees of the
Trust, has </font><font>appointed BFA as the administrator of the Liquidity Program. Under the Liquidity Program, BFA assesses, manages, and </font><font>periodically reviews each Fund’s liquidity risk and classifies each investment held by a Fund as a </font><font>“</font><font>highly liquid investment,</font><font>”</font><font>
</font><font>“</font><font>moderately liquid
investment,</font><font>”</font><font>
</font><font>“</font><font>less liquid
investment</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>illiquid investment.</font><font>”</font><font> The Liquidity Rule defines
</font><font>“</font><font>liquidity risk</font><font>”</font><font> as </font><font>the risk that a Fund could not meet requests to redeem shares issued by a Fund without significant dilution of the
remaining </font><font>investors’ interest in a Fund. The liquidity of a Fund's portfolio investments is determined based on relevant market, trading </font><font>and investment-specific considerations under the Liquidity Program. There are exclusions from certain portions of the
</font><font>liquidity risk management program requirements for </font><font>“</font><font>in-kind</font><font>”</font><font> ETFs, as defined in the Liquidity Rule.
To the extent that an </font><font>investment is deemed to be an illiquid investment or a less liquid investment, a Fund can expect to be exposed to greater </font><font>liquidity risk.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Municipal Insurance. </font><font> </font><font>A municipal security may be covered by insurance that guarantees the bond’s scheduled payment of </font><font>interest and
repayment of principal. This type of insurance may be obtained by either (i) the issuer at the time the bond is </font><font>issued (primary market insurance), or (ii) another party after the
bond has been issued (secondary market insurance).</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Both primary and
secondary market insurance guarantee timely and scheduled repayment of all principal and payment of all </font><font>interest on a municipal security in the event of default by the issuer, and
cover a municipal security to its maturity, enhancing </font><font>its credit quality and value.</font><font>
</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Municipal security insurance does not insure against market fluctuations
or fluctuations in each of the Municipal Bond </font><font>Funds' share price. In addition, a municipal security insurance policy will not cover: (i) repayment of a municipal security </font><font>before maturity (redemption), (ii) nonpayment of principal or interest caused by negligence or bankruptcy of the paying
</font><font>agent, or (iii) prepayment or payment of an acceleration premium (except for a mandatory sinking fund redemption) or any </font><font>other provision of a bond indenture that advances the maturity of the bond. A mandatory sinking fund redemption may be a
</font><font>provision of a municipal security issue whereby part of the municipal security issue may be retired before maturity.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Because a significant portion of the municipal securities issued and outstanding are insured by a small number of insurance </font><font>companies, an event involving one or more of these insurance companies could have a significant adverse effect on the value
</font><font>of the securities insured by that insurance company and on the municipal markets as a whole.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Certain significant providers of insurance for municipal securities have recently incurred significant losses as a result of </font><font>exposure to sub-prime mortgages and other lower credit quality investments that have experienced recent defaults or
</font><font>otherwise suffered extreme credit deterioration. As a result, such losses have reduced the insurers’ capital and called into </font><font>question their continued ability to perform their obligations under such insurance if they are called upon to do so in the
</font><font>future. While an insured municipal security will typically be deemed to have the rating of its insurer, if the insurer of a </font><font>municipal security suffers a downgrade in its credit rating or if the market discounts the value of the insurance provided by
</font><font>the insurer, the value of the municipal security would be more, if not entirely, dependent on the rating of the municipal </font><font>security independent of insurance.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>Municipal Securities. </font><font> </font><font>Certain of the Funds invest in securities issued in the U.S. market by U.S. states and territories,
</font><font>municipalities and other political subdivisions, agencies, authorities and instrumentalities of states and multi-state agencies </font><font>or authorities (</font><font>“</font><font>municipal securities</font><font>”</font><font>), the interest payments of which are not subject to U.S. federal income tax. The </font><font>municipal securities which such Funds may purchase include general obligation bonds and limited obligation bonds (or
</font><font>“</font><font>Revenue Bonds</font><font>”</font><font>), including industrial development bonds issued pursuant to former U.S. federal tax law.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>General obligation bonds are obligations involving the credit of an issuer possessing taxing power and are payable from such </font><font>issuer’s general revenues and not from any particular source. Revenue Bonds are payable only from the revenues derived
</font><font>from a particular facility or class of facilities or, in some cases, from the proceeds of a special excise or other specific revenue </font><font>source. Revenue Bonds that are issued to finance a particular project often depend on revenues from that project to make
</font><font>principal and interest payments. Adverse conditions and developments affecting a particular project can result in lower </font><font>revenues to the issuer of the municipal securities. Additionally, the market values of Revenue Bonds may decline in times of
</font><font>higher inflation to the extent that revenues are fixed income streams. In other instances, the prices that certain Revenue Bond </font><font>issuers are able to charge users of their assets may be linked to inflation, whether by government regulation, contractual
</font><font>arrangement or other factors. In this case, changes in the rate of inflation may affect the issuer’s revenues. Additionally, rising </font><font>interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for issuers of both general obligation bonds and Revenue Bonds, which
</font><font>could negatively impact their ability to meet payment obligations.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The market for municipal bonds may be less liquid than for taxable bonds. This means that it may be harder to buy and sell </font><font>municipal securities, especially on short notice, than non-municipal securities. In addition, the municipal securities market is </font><font>generally characterized as a buy and hold investment strategy. As a result, the accessibility of municipal securities in the
</font><font>market is generally greater closer to the original date of issue of the securities and lessens as the securities move further </font><font>away from such issuance date.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Some longer-term municipal securities give the investor the right to </font><font>“</font><font>put</font><font>”</font><font> or sell the security at par (face value)
within a </font><font>specified number of days following the investor’s request - usually one to seven days. This demand feature enhances a </font><font>security’s liquidity by shortening its effective maturity and enables it to trade at a price equal to or very close to par. If a </font><font>demand feature terminates prior to being exercised, a Fund would hold the longer-term security, which could experience
</font><font>substantially more volatility.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Municipal securities are subject to credit and market risk. Generally, prices of higher quality issues tend to fluctuate more
</font><font>with changes in market interest rates than prices of lower quality issues and prices of longer maturity issues tend to fluctuate </font><font>more than prices of shorter maturity issues.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Prices and yields on municipal securities are dependent on a variety of factors, including general money-market conditions,
</font><font>the financial condition of the issuer, general conditions of the municipal security market, the size of a particular offering, the </font><font>maturity of the obligation and the rating of the issue. A number of these factors, including the ratings of particular issues, are </font><font>subject to change from time to time. Information about the financial condition of an issuer of municipal securities may not
</font><font>be as extensive as that which is made available by corporations whose securities are publicly-traded. As a result, municipal </font><font>securities may be more difficult to value than securities of public corporations.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Obligations of issuers of municipal securities are subject to insolvency concerns and, unlike obligations of corporate issuers, </font><font>may not be subject to resolution in the event of insolvency or default through a bankruptcy proceeding. The U.S. Congress or
</font><font>state legislatures may seek to extend the time for payment of principal or interest, or both, or to impose other constraints </font><font>upon enforcement of such obligations. In addition, municipal securities are subject to the risk that their tax treatment could
</font><font>be changed, thereby affecting the value of outstanding municipal securities. There is also the possibility that as a result of </font><font>litigation or other conditions, such as passing of a referendum, the power or ability of issuers to meet their obligations for the </font><font>payment of interest and principal on their municipal securities may be materially affected or their obligations may be found
</font><font>to be invalid or unenforceable. Such litigation or conditions may from time to time have the effect of introducing </font><font>uncertainties in the market for municipal securities or certain segments thereof, or of materially affecting the credit risk with </font><font>respect to particular bonds. Adverse economic, business, legal or political developments might affect all or a substantial
</font><font>portion of a Fund’s municipal securities in the same manner.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Additionally, certain municipal securities are issued by entities dependent on revenue from a particular sector and thus are </font><font>subject to the specific risks associated with that sector. These sectors are described in more detail below.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Health
Care-Related Municipal Securities. </font><font>Changes to state or federal policy tied to health care services </font><font>could
adversely affect the value of municipal securities backed by revenue from public hospitals and other health care </font><font>facilities. Regulatory changes that govern cost reimbursements to
health care providers under government-funded programs </font><font>such as Medicare and Medicaid, including policies that award exclusive contracts to certain hospitals, may adversely affect
</font><font>the revenue streams backing certain municipal securities. Additionally, the expansion of healthcare facilities by some issuers </font><font>may be subject to </font><font>“</font><font>determinations of need</font><font>”</font><font> by various regulators or other authorities. This process not only generally </font><font>increases the time and expenses such expansions entail, but also makes expansion plans uncertain, thus potentially limiting
</font><font>the revenue and growth of healthcare facility operators. Moreover, local, state and federal governmental bodies are under </font><font>increasing pressure to reduce medical spending and control healthcare costs, which could both adversely affect regulatory
</font><font>processes and public funding available for healthcare services and facilities. The value of healthcare-related municipal </font><font>securities could also be affected by a variety of other factors that impact the underlying healthcare facilities including
</font><font>demand for services, the ability of the health care facility to provide the services required, competition with other facilities, </font><font>and expenses (such as malpractice insurance premiums).</font></div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Infrastructure-Related Municipal Securities.</font><font> Entities that issue municipal securities
related to infrastructure
</font><font>(</font><font>“</font><font>infrastructure issuers</font><font>”</font><font>) may be subject to a variety of factors that could adversely affect their capacity to make principal </font><font>and interest payments, such as high interest costs in connection with capital construction programs, high degrees of
</font><font>leverage, costs associated with governmental, environmental and other regulations, the effects of economic slowdowns, </font><font>increased competition from other providers of services, uncertainties concerning costs, the level of government spending on
</font><font>infrastructure projects, and other factors. Such issuers may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, changes in </font><font>exchange rates, import controls, depletion of resources, technological developments, and labor relations. Infrastructure
</font><font>issuers can be significantly affected by government spending policies.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Leverage Risk.</font><font> Infrastructure issuers can be highly indebted, which
increases investment risk and other risks normally </font><font>associated with debt financing, which could adversely affect such an issuer’s operations and the market value of related
</font><font>municipal securities in periods of rising interest rates.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Operations Risk.</font><font> The failure of an infrastructure issuer to carry
adequate insurance or to operate its assets appropriately </font><font>could lead to significant losses. Infrastructure may be adversely affected by environmental clean-up costs and
catastrophic </font><font>events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Regulatory Risk.</font><font> Infrastructure projects may be subject to significant
regulation by various governmental authorities and </font><font>also may be affected by regulation of rates charged to customers, service interruption due to environmental, operational or
</font><font>other events, the imposition of special tariffs and changes in tax laws, regulatory policies and accounting standards.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Strategic Asset Risk.</font><font> Infrastructure issuers may control significant strategic assets (e.g., major pipelines or highways), </font><font>which are assets that
have a national or regional profile, and may have monopolistic characteristics. Given their national or </font><font>regional profile or irreplaceable nature, strategic assets could generate
additional risk not common in other industry </font><font>sectors and they may be targeted for terrorist acts or adverse political actions.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>User Risk.</font><font> Infrastructure issuers can be dependent upon a narrow user base. If these users do not patronize infrastructure </font><font>projects as
expected, significant revenues could be lost and may not be replaceable, in which case infrastructure issuers </font><font>may fail to pay their obligations.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Municipal Securities Issued By School
Districts.</font><font> School districts rely, in part, on funding appropriations </font><font>from, among others, the federal government
and state governments. As a result, municipal securities issued by school </font><font>districts may be adversely affected by political and economic changes at the state or federal levels, such
as decreased tax or </font><font>other revenues, spending reductions or changes in appropriations. Investors in these securities, similar to investors in </font><font>municipal securities generally, face heightened risk of loss upon insolvency of the school district issuers because there is
</font><font>often no ready source of funding to pay the bonds other than the local tax base, which a bankruptcy court or administrator </font><font>does not control.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Transportation Infrastructure-Related Municipal Securities.</font><font> The transportation
infrastructure industry may </font><font>be adversely affected by economic changes, increases in fuel and other operating costs, labor relations, insurance costs, and, </font><font>in many jurisdictions, the effects of regulatory changes or other government decisions. Municipal securities that are issued to </font><font>finance a particular transportation project (e.g., toll roads) often depend on revenues from that project to make principal and </font><font>interest payments.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in
Utility-Related Municipal Securities.</font><font> Certain municipal securities are issued by public bodies, including </font><font>state
and municipal utility authorities, to, among other things, finance the operation or expansion of utility entities. Various </font><font>future economic and other conditions may adversely affect
utility entities, including inflation, increases in financing </font><font>requirements, increases in raw material costs and other operating costs, changes in demand for services and the
effects of </font><font>environmental and other governmental regulations. Certain utilities are subject to specific risks. For example, gas utilities are </font><font>subject to risks of supply conditions and increased competition from other providers of utility services. In addition, gas
</font><font>utilities are affected by gas prices, which may be magnified to the extent that a gas utility enters into long-term contracts for </font><font>the purchase or sale of gas at a fixed price, since such prices may change significantly and to the disadvantage of the gas
</font><font>utility.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>The types of municipal securities in which the Funds may invest include, but are not limited, to the following:</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Industrial Development Bonds</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Industrial development bonds generally are also Revenue Bonds and thus are not payable from
the issuer’s general revenues. </font><font>The credit and quality of industrial development bonds are usually related to the credit of the corporate user of the facilities. </font><font>Payment of interest on and repayment of principal of such bonds is the responsibility of the corporate user (and/or any
</font><font>guarantor).</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Private Activity Bonds</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Certain of the Funds may invest in private activity bonds, which are bonds issued by or on behalf of public authorities to
</font><font>obtain funds to provide privately operated housing facilities, airport, mass transit or port facilities, sewage disposal, solid </font><font>waste disposal or hazardous waste treatment or disposal facilities and certain local facilities for water supply, gas or
</font><font>electricity. Other types of private activity bonds, the proceeds of which are used for the construction, equipment, repair or </font><font>improvement of privately operated industrial or commercial facilities, may constitute municipal securities, although the
</font><font>current U.S. federal tax laws place substantial limitations on the size of such issues.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Municipal Lease Obligations</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The Funds may invest in municipal lease obligations, including certificates of participation (</font><font>“</font><font>COPs</font><font>”</font><font>) issued by government </font><font>authorities or entities to finance the acquisition or construction of equipment, land and/or
facilities. The COPs represent </font><font>participations in a lease, an installment purchase contract, or a conditional sales contract relating to equipment, land or </font><font>facilities. As a result of their structure, COPs are generally not subject to constitutional debt limitations or other statutory </font><font>requirements that may apply to other municipal securities. Municipal governments may not be obligated to make lease or
</font><font>installment purchase payments in connection with COPs, and, in such circumstances, the COP will be secured only by the </font><font>leased property. If the issuer of a COP does not fulfill its payment obligation, it may be difficult to sell the property and the </font><font>proceeds of a sale may not cover the Fund’s loss. Municipal lease obligations may be less liquid than conventional municipal </font><font>bonds, but otherwise have the same general risk characteristics as other municipal securities.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Tender Option Bonds</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Tender option bonds are synthetic floating rate or variable rate securities issued when long-term bonds are purchased in the
</font><font>primary or secondary market and then deposited into a trust. Custodial receipts are then issued to investors in these </font><font>securities evidencing ownership interests in the trust. The remarketing agent for the trust sets a floating or variable rate on </font><font>typically a weekly basis. The sponsor of a highly leveraged tender option bond trust generally will retain a liquidity provider to </font><font>purchase the short-term floating rate interests at their original purchase price upon the occurrence of certain specified
</font><font>events. However, the liquidity provider may not be required to purchase the floating rate interests upon the occurrence of </font><font>certain other events, for example, the downgrading of the municipal bonds owned by the tender option bond trust below
</font><font>investment-grade or certain events that indicate the issuer of the bonds may be entering bankruptcy. The general effect of </font><font>these provisions is to pass to the holders of the floating rate interests the most severe credit risks associated with the
</font><font>municipal bonds owned by the tender option bond trust and to leave with the liquidity provider the interest rate risk (subject </font><font>to a cap) and certain other risks associated with the municipal bonds. Tender option bonds may be considered derivatives,
</font><font>and may expose the Funds to the same risks as investments in derivatives, as well as risks associated with leverage, especially </font><font>the risk of increased volatility. To the extent the Funds invest in tender option bonds, they also are exposed to credit risk
</font><font>associated with the liquidity provider retained by the sponsor of a tender bond option trust.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Variable Rate Demand
Obligations</font></div> <div> <div><font>Variable rate demand obligations (</font><font>“</font><font>VRDOs</font><font>”</font><font>) are tax-exempt obligations that contain a floating or variable interest rate </font><font>adjustment formula and a right of demand on
the part of the holder thereof to receive payment of the unpaid principal </font><font>balance plus accrued interest upon a short notice period not to exceed seven days. There is the
possibility that because of </font><font>default or insolvency the demand feature of VRDOs may not be honored. The interest rates are adjustable at intervals </font><font>(ranging from daily to up to one year) to some prevailing market rate for similar investments, such adjustment formula being
</font><font>calculated to maintain the market rate of the VRDOs at approximately the par value of the VRDOs on the adjustment date. </font><font>The adjustments typically are based upon the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association Index or some other
</font><font>appropriate interest rate adjustment index.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Because of the interest rate adjustment formula, VRDOs are not comparable to fixed-rate securities. During periods of
</font><font>declining interest rates, a Fund’s yield on a VRDO will decrease and its shareholders will forego the opportunity for capital </font><font>appreciation. During periods of rising interest rates, however, a Fund’s yield on a VRDO will increase and its shareholders will </font><font>have a reduced risk of capital depreciation.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Municipal Notes</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Municipal notes (also known as municipal commercial paper) are shorter-term municipal debt obligations. They may provide
</font><font>interim financing in anticipation of tax collection, receipt of grants, bond sales or revenue receipts. If there is a shortfall in the </font><font>anticipated proceeds, repayment on a municipal note may be delayed or the note may not be fully repaid, and the Funds may
</font><font>lose money.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Municipal commercial paper is generally unsecured and issued to meet short-term financing needs. The lack of security
</font><font>presents some risk of loss to the Funds since, in the event of an issuer’s bankruptcy, unsecured creditors are repaid only out </font><font>of the assets, if any, that remain after secured creditors are repaid.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Non-U.S. Securities. </font><font> </font><font>Certain obligations or securities of non-U.S. issuers may be deemed to be located in a particular country </font><font>if: (i) the
principal trading market for the security is in such country, (ii) the issuer is organized under the laws of such </font><font>country, (iii) the issuer derives at least 50% of its revenues or
profits from such country or has at least 50% of its assets </font><font>situated in such country or, (iv) the issuer is the government of the particular country.</font></div> </div>

</font><font>of issuance, or offered pursuant to Rule 144A under the 1933 Act with or without registration rights

the 1933 Act (</font><font>“</font><font>Restricted
Securities</font><font>”</font><font>). Rule </font><font>144A Bonds and
Restricted Securities are not publicly-traded and are subject to a variety of restrictions, which limit a </font><font>purchaser's ability to acquire or resell such securities. Accordingly, the
liquidity of the market for specific Rule 144A Bonds </font><font>and Restricted Securities may vary. Delay or difficulty in selling such securities may result in a loss to a Fund.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Ratings. </font><font> </font><font>An
investment-grade rating generally means the security or issuer is rated investment-grade by one or more of </font><font>Moody’s, S&amp;P Global Ratings, Fitch, or another credit rating
agency designated as a nationally recognized statistical rating </font><font>organization (</font><font>“</font><font>NRSRO</font><font>”</font><font>) by the SEC, or is unrated but considered
to be of equivalent quality by BFA. Generally, bonds rated </font><font>Baa3 or above by Moody’s or BBB- or above by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch are considered </font><font>“</font><font>investment-grade</font><font>”</font><font> securities, </font><font>bonds rated Baa are considered medium grade obligations subject to moderate credit risk and may possess certain
</font><font>speculative characteristics, while bonds rated BBB are regarded as having adequate capacity to meet financial commitments.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Subsequent to purchase by a Fund, a rated security may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below an investment-grade</font><font> rating. Bonds rated below Baa3 by Moody’s or below BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings or Fitch are considered below
</font><font>investment-grade quality and are obligations of issuers that are generally considered predominantly speculative with respect </font><font>to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal according to the terms of the obligation and, therefore, carry </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

of issuer default and bankruptcy and increased market price volatility. Such </font><font>lower-rated securities are commonly referred to as </font><font>“</font><font>junk bonds</font><font>”</font><font> and are subject to a substantial degree of credit risk.

category of Moody's, S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch and BFA's </font><font>treatment of investments that are not rated by any of the rating agencies.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>Regulation Regarding Derivatives.</font><font>  </font><font>The CFTC subjects advisers to registered investment companies to regulation by the </font><font>CFTC if a fund that is advised by the adviser either (i) invests, directly or indirectly, more than a prescribed level of its
</font><font>liquidation value in CFTC-regulated futures, options and swaps</font><font> </font><font>(</font><font>“</font><font>CFTC Derivatives</font><font>”</font><font>) or (ii) markets itself as providing </font><font>investment
exposure to such instruments. The CFTC also subjects advisers to registered investment companies to regulation </font><font>by the CFTC if the registered investment company invests in one or
more commodity pools. To the extent a Fund uses CFTC </font><font>Derivatives, it intends to do so below such prescribed levels and intends not to market itself as a </font><font>“</font><font>commodity pool</font><font>”</font><font> or a </font><font>vehicle for trading such instruments.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>BFA has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term </font><font>“</font><font>commodity pool operator</font><font>”</font><font> under the CEA pursuant
to Rule 4.5 </font><font>under the CEA with respect to each of the Funds. BFA is not, therefore, subject to registration or regulation as a </font><font>“</font><font>commodity </font><font>pool operator</font><font>”</font><font> under the CEA with respect to the Funds.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Derivative contracts, including, without limitation, swaps, currency forwards, and
non-deliverable forwards, are subject to </font><font>regulation under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (</font><font>“</font><font>Dodd-Frank Act</font><font>”</font><font>) in the U.S. and under </font><font>comparable regimes in Europe, Asia and other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Swaps, non-deliverable forwards
and certain other </font><font>derivatives traded in the OTC market are subject to variation margin and initial margin requirements. Implementation of the </font><font>margining and other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding clearing, mandatory trading, reporting and documentation </font><font>of
swaps and other derivatives have impacted and may continue to impact the costs to a Fund of trading these instruments </font><font>and, as a result, may affect returns to investors in a
Fund.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Rule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act permits a Fund to enter
into Derivatives Transactions (as defined below) and </font><font>certain other transactions notwithstanding the restrictions on the issuance of </font><font>“</font><font>senior securities</font><font>”</font><font> under Section 18 of the </font><font>Investment Company Act. Section 18 of the Investment Company Act, among other things, prohibits
open-end funds, </font><font>including the Funds, from issuing or selling any </font><font>“</font><font>senior security,</font><font>”</font><font> other than borrowing from a
bank (subject to a requirement </font><font>to maintain 300% </font><font>“</font><font>asset coverage</font><font>”</font><font>). </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Under Rule 18f-4,
</font><font>“</font><font>Derivatives
Transactions</font><font>”</font><font> include the following: (1) any swap, security-based swap (including a contract </font><font>for differences), futures contract, forward contract, option (excluding purchased options), any combination of the foregoing,
</font><font>or any similar instrument, under which a Fund is or may be required to make any payment or delivery of cash or other assets </font><font>during the life of the instrument or at maturity or early termination, whether as margin or settlement payment or otherwise;
</font><font>(2) any short sale borrowing; (3) reverse repurchase agreements and similar financing transactions (e.g., recourse and non-recourse</font><font> tender option bonds, and borrowed bonds), if a Fund elects to treat these transactions as Derivatives Transactions </font><font>under
Rule 18f-4; and (4) when-issued or forward-settling securities (e.g., firm and standby commitments, including to-be-announced</font><font> (</font><font>“</font><font>TBA</font><font>”</font><font>) commitments, and dollar rolls) and non-standard settlement cycle securities, unless the Fund intends to </font><font>physically settle
the transaction and the transaction will settle within 35 days of its trade date (the </font><font>“</font><font>Delayed-Settlement
</font><font>Securities Provision</font><font>”</font><font>).</font></div>
</div> <div> <div><font>Unless a Fund is relying on the Limited Derivatives User Exception (as defined below),
the Fund must comply with Rule 18f-4 </font><font>with respect to its Derivatives Transactions. Rule 18f-4, among other things, requires a Fund to adopt and implement a </font><font>comprehensive written derivatives risk management program (</font><font>“</font><font>DRMP</font><font>”</font><font>) and comply with a relative or absolute
limit on Fund </font><font>leverage risk calculated based on value-at-risk (</font><font>“</font><font>VaR</font><font>”</font><font>). The DRMP is administered by a </font><font>“</font><font>derivatives risk manager,</font><font>”</font><font> who is </font><font>appointed by the Board, including a majority of Independent Directors/Trustees, and periodically reviews the DRMP
and </font><font>reports to the Board.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Rule 18f-4 provides an exception from the DRMP, VaR limit and certain other requirements if a Fund's </font><font>“</font><font>derivatives exposure</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>(as defined in Rule 18f-4) is limited to 10% of its net assets (as calculated in accordance with Rule 18f-4) and the Fund
</font><font>adopts and implements written policies and procedures reasonably designed to manage its derivatives risks (the

</font><font>“</font><font>underlying funds</font><font>”</font><font> (and </font><font>such underlying funds themselves may invest in underlying funds) not advised by BFA (the term </font><font>“</font><font>underlying fund</font><font>”</font><font> for </font><font>purposes of the no-action letter referenced below may include, but is not limited to, certain securitized vehicles,

investment companies that may </font><font>invest in CFTC Derivatives or in any of the foregoing), and therefore may be viewed by the CFTC as commodity pools. BFA </font><font>may not have transparency into the holdings of these underlying funds because they are not advised by BFA. To address this
</font><font>issue of lack of transparency, the CFTC staff issued a no-action letter on November 29, 2012 permitting the adviser of a fund </font><font>that invests in such underlying funds and that would otherwise have filed a claim of exclusion pursuant to CFTC Rule 4.5 to
</font><font>delay registration as a </font><font>“</font><font>commodity
pool operator</font><font>”</font><font> until six months from the date on which the CFTC issues additional </font><font>guidance on the treatment of CFTC Derivatives held by underlying funds. BFA, the adviser of the No-Action Letter Funds, has
</font><font>filed a claim with the CFTC for the Funds to rely on this no-action relief. Accordingly, BFA is not currently subject to </font><font>registration or regulation as a </font><font>“</font><font>commodity pool
operator</font><font>”</font><font> under the CEA in respect of the Funds.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>Repurchase Agreements.</font><font>  </font><font>A repurchase agreement is an instrument under which the purchaser (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, a Fund) acquires a </font><font>security and
the seller agrees, at the time of the sale, to repurchase the security at a mutually agreed-upon time and price, </font><font>thereby determining the yield during the purchaser’s holding
period. Repurchase agreements may be construed to be </font><font>collateralized loans by the purchaser to the seller secured by the securities transferred to the purchaser. If a repurchase
</font><font>agreement is construed to be a collateralized loan, the underlying securities will not be considered to be owned by a Fund but </font><font>only to constitute collateral for the seller’s obligation to pay the repurchase price, and, in the event of a default by the seller, </font><font>the Fund may suffer time delays and incur costs or losses in connection with the disposition of the collateral.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>In any repurchase transaction, the collateral for a repurchase agreement may include: (i)
cash items; (ii) obligations issued by </font><font>the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities; or (iii) obligations that, at the time the repurchase agreement is </font><font>entered into, are determined to (A) have exceptionally strong capacity to meet their financial obligations and (B) are
</font><font>sufficiently liquid such that they can be sold at approximately their carrying value in the ordinary course of business within </font><font>seven days.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Repurchase agreements pose certain risks for a Fund that utilizes them. Such risks are not unique to the Funds, but are </font><font>inherent in repurchase agreements. The Funds seek to minimize such risks, but because of the inherent legal uncertainties
</font><font>involved in repurchase agreements, such risks cannot be eliminated. Lower quality collateral and collateral with a longer </font><font>maturity may be subject to greater price fluctuations than higher quality collateral and collateral with a shorter maturity. If </font><font>the repurchase agreement counterparty were to default, lower quality collateral may be more difficult to liquidate than higher
</font><font>quality collateral. Should the counterparty default and the amount of collateral not be sufficient to cover the counterparty’s </font><font>repurchase obligation, a Fund would likely retain the status of an unsecured creditor of the counterparty
(</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the position a
</font><font>Fund would normally be in if it were to hold, pursuant to its investment policies, other unsecured debt securities of the </font><font>defaulting counterparty) with respect to the amount of the shortfall. As an unsecured creditor, a Fund would be at risk of
</font><font>losing some or all of the principal and income involved in the transaction.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Reverse Repurchase Agreements.</font><font>  </font><font>Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities with an agreement to </font><font>repurchase the securities at an
agreed-upon price, date and interest payment and have the characteristics of borrowing. </font><font>Generally, the effect of such transactions is that a Fund can recover all or most of the
cash invested in the portfolio securities </font><font>involved during the term of the reverse repurchase agreement, while in many cases the Fund is able to keep some of the </font><font>interest income associated with those securities. Such transactions are advantageous only if a Fund has an opportunity to
</font><font>earn a rate of interest on the cash derived from these transactions that is greater than the interest cost of obtaining the same </font><font>amount of cash. Opportunities to realize earnings from the use of the proceeds equal to or greater than the interest required
</font><font>to be paid may not always be available, and a Fund intends to use the reverse repurchase technique only when BFA believes it </font><font>will be advantageous to the Fund. The use of reverse repurchase agreements may exaggerate any increase or decrease in the
</font><font>value of a Fund’s assets. The use of reverse repurchase agreements is a form of leverage, and the proceeds obtained by a </font><font>Fund through reverse repurchase agreements may be invested in additional securities.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Rule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act permits a Fund to enter into reverse repurchase agreements and similar </font><font>financing transactions (</font><font>e.g.,</font><font>
recourse and non-recourse tender option bonds, borrowed bonds) notwithstanding the </font><font>limitation on the issuance of senior securities in Section 18 of the Investment Company Act,
provided that a Fund either (i) </font><font>complies with the 300% asset coverage ratio with respect to such transactions and any other borrowings in the aggregate, or </font><font>(ii) treats such transactions as Derivatives Transactions under Rule 18f-4. (See </font><font>“</font><font>Regulation Regarding
Derivatives</font><font>”</font><font> above.)</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Securities of Investment
Companies. </font><font> </font><font>Each Fund may invest in the securities of other investment companies
(including </font><font>money market funds) to the extent permitted by law, regulation, exemptive order or SEC staff guidance. Under the 1940 Act, </font><font>a fund’s investment in investment companies is limited to, subject to certain exceptions, (i) 3% of the total outstanding </font><font>voting stock of any one investment company, (ii) 5% of the fund’s total assets with respect to any one investment company, </font><font>and (iii) 10% of the fund’s total assets with respect to investment companies in the aggregate. To the extent allowed by law </font><font>or regulation, the Funds intend from time to time to invest their assets in securities of investment companies, including, but
</font><font>not limited to, money market funds, including those advised by BFA or otherwise affiliated with BFA, in excess of the limits </font><font>discussed above. Other investment companies in which a Fund invests can be expected to incur fees and expenses for
</font><font>operations, such as investment advisory and administration fees, which would be in addition to those incurred by a Fund. </font><font>Pursuant to guidance issued by the SEC staff, fees and expenses of money market funds used for cash collateral received in
</font><font>connection with loans of securities are not treated as acquired fund fees and expenses, which reflect a Fund's </font><font>pro rata </font><font>share </font><font>of the fees and
expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies</font><font> </font><font>(as disclosed in the
Prospectus, as applicable). </font><font> </font><font>The iShares National Muni Bond ETF may invest in shares of
other iShares funds that provide substantially similar exposure </font><font>to the securities in its Underlying Index. BFA will not charge advisory fees on that portion of the iShares National
Muni Bond </font><font>ETF’s assets invested in shares of other iShares funds. The iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF may invest in shares of </font><font>other registered investment companies advised by BFA, or its affiliates that provide substantially similar exposure to the
</font><font>securities in its Underlying Index. BFA will not charge advisory fees on that portion of the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond </font><font>ETF's assets invested in shares of other registered investment companies advised by BFA, or its affiliates.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>Short-Term Instruments and Temporary Investments.</font><font>
 </font><font> Each Fund may invest in short-term instruments, including variable </font><font>rate demand notes, short-term
municipal securities, short-term municipal money market funds and money market </font><font>instruments, on an ongoing basis to provide liquidity or for other reasons. Money market instruments
are generally short-term</font><font> investments that may include, but are not limited to: (i) shares of money market funds (including those advised by BFA </font><font>or otherwise affiliated with BFA); (ii) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or
</font><font>instrumentalities (including government-sponsored enterprises); (iii) negotiable certificates of deposit, bankers’ acceptances, </font><font>fixed-time deposits and other obligations of U.S. and non-U.S. banks (including non-U.S. branches) and similar institutions;
</font><font>(iv) commercial paper rated, at the date of purchase, </font><font>“</font><font>Prime-1</font><font>”</font><font> by Moody's, </font><font>“</font><font>F-1</font><font>”</font><font> by Fitch or </font><font>“</font><font>A-1</font><font>”</font><font> by S&amp;P Global Ratings, or </font><font>if unrated, of
comparable quality as determined by BFA; (v) non-convertible corporate debt securities (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>,
bonds and </font><font>debentures) with remaining maturities at the date of purchase of not more than 397 days and that have been determined to </font><font>present minimal credit risks, in accordance with the requirements set forth in Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act; (vi) repurchase
</font><font>agreements; and (vii) short-term U.S. dollar-denominated obligations of non-U.S. banks (including U.S. branches) that, in the </font><font>opinion of BFA, are of comparable quality to obligations of U.S. banks that may be purchased by a Fund. Any of these
</font><font>instruments may be purchased on a current or forward-settled basis. Time deposits are non-negotiable deposits maintained </font><font>in banking institutions for specified periods of time at stated interest rates. Bankers’ acceptances are time drafts drawn on </font><font>commercial banks by borrowers, usually in connection with international transactions.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Sovereign and Quasi-Sovereign Obligations.
</font><font> </font><font>Certain of the Funds may invest in sovereign and quasi-sovereign obligations. </font><font>An investment in sovereign debt obligations involves special risks not present in corporate debt obligations. Sovereign debt
</font><font>includes securities issued or guaranteed by a foreign sovereign government. Quasi-sovereign debt includes securities issued </font><font>or guaranteed by an entity affiliated with or backed by a sovereign government. Quasi-sovereign debt obligations are typically
</font><font>less liquid and less standardized than sovereign debt obligations. The issuer of the sovereign debt that controls the </font><font>repayment of the debt may be unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due, and a Fund may have limited
</font><font>recourse in the event of a default. Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial condition or credit rating of a non-U.S. </font><font>government may cause the value of a sovereign debt to decline. During periods of economic uncertainty, the market prices of
</font><font>sovereign debt obligations may be more volatile than prices of U.S. debt obligations, which may affect a Fund's NAV. In the </font><font>past, certain emerging market countries have encountered difficulties in servicing their debt obligations, withheld payments
</font><font>of principal and interest and declared moratoria on the payment of principal and interest on their sovereign debts. Several </font><font>sovereign issuers have experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about rising government debt levels,
</font><font>including Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. In the past, sovereign issuers have also defaulted on their debt obligations, </font><font>including Russia, Argentina, Indonesia and Uruguay.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>A sovereign debtor's willingness or ability to repay principal and pay interest in a timely
manner may be affected by, among </font><font>other factors, its cash flow situation, the extent of its non-U.S. currency reserves, the availability of sufficient foreign </font><font>exchange, the relative size of the debt service burden, the sovereign debtor's policy toward principal international lenders and </font><font>local political constraints. Sovereign debtors may also be dependent on expected disbursements from foreign governments,
</font><font>multilateral agencies and other entities to reduce principal and interest arrears on their debt. The failure of a sovereign debtor </font></div> </div> </div>

<div> <div><font>to implement economic reforms, achieve specified
levels of economic performance or repay principal or interest when due </font><font>may result in the cancellation of third-party commitments to lend funds to the sovereign debtor, which may
further impair </font><font>such debtor's ability or willingness to service its debts. Quasi-sovereign debt obligations are typically less liquid and less </font><font>standardized than government debt.</font><font> </font></div>
<div> <div><font>Swap Agreements.</font><font>  </font><font>Swap agreements are contracts between parties in which one party agrees to make periodic payments
to </font><font>the other party based on a pre-determined underlying investment or notional amount. In return, the other party agrees to </font><font>make periodic payments to the first party based on the return (or a differential in rate of return) earned or realized on the
</font><font>underlying investment or notional amount. Swap agreements will usually be performed on a net basis, with a Fund receiving </font><font>or paying only the net amount of the two payments. The net amount of the excess, if any, of a Fund’s obligations over its </font><font>entitlements with respect to each swap is accrued on a daily basis.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Certain of the Funds may enter into swap agreements, including currency swaps, interest rate swaps and index swaps. The </font><font>use
of swaps is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with </font><font>ordinary portfolio security transactions. These
transactions generally do not involve the delivery of securities or other </font><font>underlying assets.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>U.S. Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities Risk.</font><font>
 </font><font>Certain of the Funds invest in securities backed by pools of mortgages </font><font>issued or guaranteed by the U.S.
government or one of its agencies or sponsored entities, including Government National </font><font>Mortgage Association
(</font><font>“</font><font>Ginnie Mae</font><font>”</font><font>), Federal National Mortgage Association (</font><font>“</font><font>Fannie
Mae</font><font>”</font><font>), and the Federal Home Loan
</font><font>Mortgage Corporation (</font><font>“</font><font>Freddie
Mac</font><font>”</font><font>). The market for mortgage-backed securities (</font><font>“</font><font>MBS</font><font>”</font><font>) has been adversely affected by </font><font>the value of those MBS held and/or issued by these agencies and sponsored entities. If a
U.S. government agency or </font><font>sponsored entity issues securities in which certain of the Funds invest and such issuer is unable to meet its obligations or </font><font>ceases to exist, and no plan is made for the repayment of securities, the performance of certain of the Funds will be adversely </font><font>impacted.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Ginnie Mae</font><font>. Established in 1968, Ginnie Mae is a wholly owned U.S. government corporation within the U.S.
Department of </font><font>Housing and Urban Development. Ginnie Mae is authorized to guarantee, with the backing of the full faith and credit of the </font><font>U.S. government, the timely payment of principal and interest on securities issued by the institutions approved by Ginnie Mae
</font><font>(such as savings and loan institutions, commercial banks and mortgage banks), and backed by pools of mortgages insured </font><font>by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Ginnie Mae securities also
</font><font>are supported by the authority of Ginnie Mae to borrow funds from the U.S. Treasury Department to make payments under </font><font>its guarantee. Any actual or potential disruption to Ginnie Mae, or the financial condition or credit of the U.S. government,
</font><font>could cause the value of Ginnie Mae securities to decline. In 2011, S&amp;P Global Ratings downgraded U.S. Treasury securities </font><font>from AAA rating to AA+ rating. A further downgrade of the ratings of U.S. government debt obligations, which are often used
</font><font>as a benchmark for other borrowing arrangements, could result in higher interest rates for individual and corporate </font><font>borrowers, cause disruptions in the international bond markets and have a substantial negative effect on the U.S. economy. A
</font><font>downgrade of U.S. Treasury securities from another ratings agency or a further downgrade below AA+ rating by S&amp;P Global </font><font>Ratings may cause the value of Ginnie Mae securities to decline.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac</font><font>. Fannie Mae was established as a federal agency in 1938 and in 1968 was
chartered by </font><font>Congress as a private shareholder-owned company. Securities issued by Fannie Mae are guaranteed as to timely payment of </font><font>principal and interest by Fannie Mae. The securities are not backed by or entitled to the full faith and credit of the U.S.
</font><font>government, but are supported by the right of Fannie Mae to borrow from the U.S. Treasury Department.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Freddie Mac is a stockholder-owned corporation chartered by Congress in 1970. Securities
issued by Freddie Mac entitle the </font><font>holder to timely payment of interests, which is guaranteed by Freddie Mac. Freddie Mac also guarantees either ultimate </font><font>collection or timely payment of all principal payments. While Freddie Mac generally does not guarantee timely payment of
</font><font>principal, Freddie Mac may remit the amount due on account of its guarantee of ultimate payment of principal at any time </font><font>after default on an underlying mortgage, but in no event later than one year after it becomes payable. The securities are not
</font><font>backed by or entitled to the full faith and credit of the U.S. government or by any Federal Home Loan Banks, but are </font><font>supported by the right of Freddie Mac to borrow from the U.S. Treasury Department.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>In 2008, the Federal Housing Finance Agency placed each of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into government conservatorship </font><font>in an effort to provide stability in the financial markets and put the government-sponsored entities in sound and solvent
</font><font>condition. In addition, the U.S. Treasury Department agreed to provide Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac up to $100 billion of </font><font>capital each on an as needed basis to ensure that they continue to provide liquidity to the housing and mortgage markets.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Mortgage-Backed
Securities</font><font>. MBS issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or one of its agencies or sponsored entities, </font><font>such
as Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac, represent interests in pools of mortgages in which payments of both </font><font>principal and interest on the securities are generally made monthly,
in effect </font><font>“</font><font>passing
through</font><font>”</font><font> the payments made by
</font><font>borrowers on the mortgage loans that underlie the securities (net of any fees paid to the issuer or guarantor of the </font><font>securities). MBS differ from other forms of debt securities, which normally provide for periodic payment of interest in fixed
</font><font>amounts with principal payments at maturity or specified call dates, while a MBS payments provide a combination of interest </font><font>and principal throughout the a bond’s term. As further described below, MBS may be structured as pass-through securities
</font><font>or collateralized mortgage obligations (</font><font>“</font><font>CMOs</font><font>”</font><font>).</font></div>
<div> <div><font>MBS are subject to the general risks associated with investing in real estate securities;
that is, they may lose value if the value </font><font>of the underlying real estate to which a pool of mortgages relates declines. In addition, investments in MBS involve certain </font><font>specific risks. These risks include the failure of a party to meet its commitments under the related operative documents,
</font><font>adverse interest rate changes and the effects of prepayments on mortgage cash flows. The value of MBS, like that of </font><font>traditional fixed-income securities, typically increases when interest rates fall and decreases when interest rates rise.
</font><font>However, MBS differ from traditional fixed-income securities because of their potential for prepayment without penalty. The </font><font>price paid by a Fund for its MBS, the yield a Fund expects to receive from such securities and the weighted average life of the </font><font>securities are based on a number of factors, including the anticipated rate of prepayment of the underlying mortgages. In a
</font><font>period of declining interest rates, borrowers may prepay the underlying mortgages more quickly than anticipated, thereby </font><font>reducing the yield to maturity and the average life of the MBS. Moreover, when a Fund reinvests the proceeds of a </font><font>prepayment
in these circumstances, it will likely receive a rate of interest that is lower than the rate on the security that was </font><font>prepaid.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>To the extent that a Fund purchases MBS at a premium, mortgage foreclosures and principal
prepayments may result in a </font><font>loss to the extent of the premium paid. If a Fund buys such securities at a discount, both scheduled payments of principal </font><font>and unscheduled prepayments will increase current and total returns and will accelerate the recognition of income, which,
</font><font>when distributed to shareholders, will be taxable as ordinary income. In a period of rising interest rates, prepayments of the </font><font>underlying mortgages may occur at a slower than expected rate, creating maturity extension risk. This particular risk may
</font><font>effectively change a security that was considered short- or intermediate-term at the time of purchase into a long-term </font><font>security. Since the value of long-term securities generally fluctuates more widely in response to changes in interest rates than </font><font>that of shorter-term securities, maturity extension risk could increase the inherent volatility of a Fund. Under certain interest </font><font>rate and prepayment scenarios, a Fund may fail to recoup fully its investment in MBS notwithstanding any direct or indirect
</font><font>U.S. governmental or agency guarantee.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Mortgage Pass-Through Securities</font><font>. Some MBS, such as U.S. agency mortgage pass-through securities,
represent a right to </font><font>receive principal and interest payments collected on a pool of mortgages, which are passed through to security holders. In </font><font>the basic mortgage pass-through structure, mortgages with similar issuer, term and coupon characteristics are collected and
</font><font>aggregated into a </font><font>“</font><font>pool</font><font>”</font><font> consisting of multiple mortgage loans. The pool is assigned a CUSIP number and undivided </font><font>interests in the pool are traded and sold as pass-through securities. The holder of the security is entitled to a pro rata share of </font><font>principal and interest payments (including unscheduled prepayments) from the pool of mortgage loans.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>An investment in a specific pool of mortgage pass-through securities requires an analysis of the specific prepayment risk of </font><font>mortgages within the covered pool (since mortgagors typically have the option to prepay their loans). The level of
</font><font>prepayments on a pool of MBS is difficult to predict and can impact the subsequent cash flows, value and yield of the </font><font>mortgage pool. In addition, when trading specific mortgage pools, precise execution, delivery and settlement arrangements
</font><font>must be negotiated for each transaction.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>To-Be-Announced Securities</font><font>. A Fund may seek to gain exposure to U.S. agency mortgage pass-through
securities by </font><font>investing in TBA securities. </font><font>“</font><font>TBAs</font><font>”</font><font> refer to a commonly used mechanism for the
forward settlement of U.S. agency MBS, and </font><font>not to a separate type of MBS. Most transactions in fixed-rate MBS occur through the use of TBA transactions. TBA </font><font>transactions generally are conducted in accordance with widely-accepted guidelines which establish commonly observed </font><font>terms
and conditions for execution, settlement, and delivery. In a TBA transaction, the buyer and seller decide on general </font><font>trade parameters, such as the issuing agency, settlement date,
par amount, and price. The actual mortgage pools delivered </font><font>generally are determined two days prior to settlement date. Certain of the Funds may regularly enter into TBA agreements
</font><font>and </font><font>“</font><font>roll over</font><font>”</font><font> such agreements prior to the settlement date stipulated in such agreements. This type of TBA transaction is </font><font>sometimes known as a </font><font>“</font><font>TBA roll.</font><font>”</font><font> In a TBA roll, such Funds generally will sell the obligation to purchase the pools stipulated </font><font>in the TBA agreement prior to the stipulated settlement date and will enter into a new TBA agreement for future delivery of </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>pools of MBS. In addition, certain of the Funds
may enter into TBA agreements and settle such transactions on the stipulated </font><font>settlement date by accepting actual receipt or delivery of the pools of MBS stipulated in the TBA
agreement.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Certain of the Funds may invest cash pending settlement of TBA
transactions in money market instruments, repurchase </font><font>agreements, or other high quality, liquid short-term instruments, including money market funds advised by BFA. Each such
</font><font>Fund will pay its </font><font>pro
rata</font><font> share of fees and expenses of any money market fund that it may invest in, in addition to such
</font><font>Fund’s own fees and expenses.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Collateralized Mortgage Obligations</font><font>. U.S. agency MBS may also be structured in the form of CMOs. CMOs are
created by </font><font>dividing the principal and interest payments collected on a pool of mortgages into several revenue streams (</font><font>“</font><font>tranches</font><font>”</font><font>) with </font><font>different priority rights to portions of the underlying mortgage payments. Certain CMO tranches may represent a right
to </font><font>receive interest only, principal only, or an amount that remains after floating-rate tranches are paid (an
</font><font>“</font><font>inverse floater</font><font>”</font><font>). </font><font>These securities are frequently referred to as
</font><font>“</font><font>mortgage derivatives</font><font>”</font><font> and may be extremely sensitive to changes in interest </font><font>rates. Interest rates on inverse floaters, for example, vary
inversely with a short-term floating rate (which may be reset </font><font>periodically). Interest rates on inverse floaters will decrease when short-term rates increase and will increase when
short-term</font><font> rates decrease. These securities have the effect of providing a degree of investment leverage. In response to changes in </font><font>market interest rates or other market conditions, the value of an inverse floater may increase or decrease at a multiple of the </font><font>increase or decrease in the value of the underlying securities. If a Fund invests in CMO tranches issued by U.S. government
</font><font>agencies or sponsored entities and interest rates move in a manner not anticipated by BFA, it is possible that such a Fund </font><font>could lose all or substantially all of its investment. Certain CMOs in which certain of the Funds may invest may also provide a </font><font>degree of investment leverage, which could cause such a Fund to lose all or substantially all of its investment.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>U.S. Government Obligations. </font><font> </font><font>Certain of the Funds may invest in various types of U.S. government obligations. U.S. </font><font>government obligations are a type of bond and include securities issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S.
</font><font>government, its agencies or instrumentalities. Payment of principal and interest on U.S. government obligations (i) may be </font><font>backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. or (ii) may be backed solely by the issuing or guaranteeing agency or
</font><font>instrumentality itself (as with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Federal Home Loan Bank notes). In the latter case, each Fund </font><font>must look principally to the agency or instrumentality issuing or guaranteeing the obligation for ultimate repayment, which
</font><font>agency or instrumentality may be privately owned. There can be no assurance that the U.S. government would provide </font><font>financial support to its agencies or instrumentalities where it is not obligated to do so. As a general matter, the value of debt </font><font>instruments, including U.S. government obligations, declines when market interest rates increase and rises when market
</font><font>interest rates decrease. Certain types of U.S. government obligations are subject to fluctuations in yield or value due to their </font><font>structure or contract terms.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Some government agencies, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, purchase and guarantee residential mortgages and form </font><font>MBS
that they issue to the market. These agencies also hold their own MBS as well as those of other institutions with funding </font><font>from the agency debentures they issue. Recent events in
the markets for MBS have adversely affected the value of those MBS </font><font>held and/or issued by these agencies.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>U.S.-Registered and Restricted Securities of Non-U.S. Issuers.</font><font> </font><font> </font><font>The Funds
(other than the iShares Agency Bond ETF, iShares </font><font>MBS ETF, Municipal Bond Funds and Treasury Bond Funds) may invest in U.S.-registered, U.S. dollar-denominated bonds of </font><font>non-U.S. governments, agencies, supranational entities and corporate issuers.

iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares Intermediate Government/Credit Bond ETF, iShares </font><font>Investment Grade Systematic Bond ETF and iShares USD Systematic Bond ETF may
invest in Restricted Securities issued by </font><font>non-U.S. issuers. Investing in U.S.-registered, U.S. dollar-denominated bonds or Restricted Securities issued by non-U.S. </font><font>issuers involves some risks and considerations not typically associated with investing in U.S. issuers. These include
</font><font>differences in accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards; the possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation; </font><font>adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations; political instability, which could affect U.S. investments in
</font><font>foreign countries; and potential restrictions of the flow of international capital. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject to less </font><font>governmental regulation than U.S. issuers. In addition, the risk that the issuer may fail to meet its obligations on these </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>securities may be affected by fluctuations in
non-U.S. currency exchange rates between the issuer's local currency and the </font><font>U.S. dollar. Moreover, individual non-U.S. economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S.
economy in such </font><font>respects as growth of gross domestic product (</font><font>“</font><font>GDP</font><font>”</font><font>), rate of inflation, capital reinvestment,
resource self-sufficiency and </font><font>balance of payment positions.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Future Developments.</font><font> </font><font> </font><font>The Board may, in the future, authorize each Fund to invest in securities contracts and investments
</font><font>other than those listed in this SAI and in the applicable Prospectus, provided they are consistent with each Fund's investment </font><font>objective and do not violate any investment restrictions or policies.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>General Considerations and Risks</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>A discussion of some of the principal risks associated with an investment in a Fund is contained in each Fund's Prospectus.
</font><font>An investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding that the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities may </font><font>fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the issuers of the portfolio securities, the value of bonds in </font><font>general, and other factors that affect the market. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any </font><font>particular risk factor.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Borrowing Risk.
</font><font> </font><font>Borrowing may exaggerate changes in the NAV of Fund shares and in the return on a
Fund’s portfolio. </font><font>Borrowing will cause a Fund to incur interest expense and other fees. The costs of borrowing may reduce a Fund’s return. </font><font>Borrowing may cause a Fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Call Risk. </font><font> </font><font>During periods of falling interest rates, an issuer of a callable bond held by certain Funds may
</font><font>“</font><font>call</font><font>”</font><font> or repay the </font><font>security before its stated maturity, and a Fund may have to reinvest the proceeds in securities with lower
yields, which would </font><font>result in a decline in the Fund's income, or in securities with greater risks or with other less favorable features.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Custody Risk.
</font><font> </font><font>Custody risk refers to the risks inherent in the process of clearing and settling
trades and to the holding of </font><font>securities, cash and other assets by local banks, agents and depositories. Low trading volumes and volatile prices in less </font><font>developed markets make trades harder to complete and settle, and governments or trade groups may compel local agents to </font><font>hold
securities in designated depositories that may not be subject to independent evaluation. Local agents are held only to </font><font>the standards of care of their local markets, and thus may be
subject to limited or no government oversight. Communications </font><font>between the U.S. and emerging market countries may be unreliable, increasing the risk of delayed settlements or losses
of </font><font>security certificates. In general, the less developed a country’s securities market is, the greater the likelihood of custody </font><font>problems. Practices in relation to the settlement of securities transactions in emerging markets involve higher risks than
</font><font>those in developed markets, in part because of the use of brokers and counterparties that are often less well capitalized, and </font><font>custody and registration of assets in some countries may be unreliable. The possibility of fraud, negligence or undue
</font><font>influence being exerted by the issuer or refusal to recognize ownership exists in some emerging markets, and, along with </font><font>other factors, could result in ownership registration being lost. In addition, the laws of certain countries may put limits on a </font><font>Fund’s ability to recover its assets if a foreign bank or depository or issuer of a security or an agent of any of the foregoing </font><font>goes bankrupt. A Fund would absorb any loss resulting from such custody problems and may have no successful claim for
</font><font>compensation.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Extension Risk.
</font><font> </font><font>During periods of rising interest rates, certain debt obligations may be paid off
substantially more slowly </font><font>than originally anticipated and the value of those securities may fall sharply, resulting in a decline in a Fund’s income and </font><font>potentially in the value of a Fund’s investments.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Illiquid Investments Risk.</font><font>  </font><font>Each Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, immediately after the acquisition, the Fund </font><font>would have invested more
than 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that a </font><font>Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market
conditions in seven calendar days or less without </font><font>significantly changing the market value of the investment. The liquidity of an investment will be determined based on </font><font>relevant market, trading and investment specific considerations as set out in the Liquidity Program as required by the
</font><font>Liquidity Rule. Illiquid investments may trade at a discount to comparable, more liquid investments and a Fund may not be </font><font>able to dispose of illiquid investments in a timely fashion or at their expected prices. If illiquid investments exceed 15% of a </font><font>Fund’s net assets, the Liquidity Rule and the Liquidity Program will require that certain remedial actions be taken.</font><font> </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>Issuer Insolvency Risk.</font><font>  </font><font>Each Fund's potential exposure to financially or operationally troubled issuers involves a high
degree </font><font>of credit and market risk, which may be heightened during an economic downturn or recession. Should an issuer of </font><font>securities held by a Fund become involved in a bankruptcy proceeding, reorganization or financial restructuring, a wide
</font><font>variety of considerations make an evaluation of the outcome of a Fund’s exposure to the issuer uncertain.</font><font> </font></div> <div>
<div><font>During the period of a bankruptcy proceeding, reorganization or financial restructuring, it is unlikely that each Fund will </font><font>receive any interest payments on the securities of the issuer. Each Fund will be subject to significant uncertainty as to
</font><font>whether the reorganization or restructuring will be completed, and each Fund may bear certain extraordinary expenses to </font><font>protect and recover its investment. Each Fund will also be subject to significant uncertainty as to when and in what manner
</font><font>and for what value the obligations evidenced by the securities of the issuer held by a Fund will eventually be satisfied. Even if </font><font>a plan of reorganization or restructuring is adopted with respect to the securities of the issuer held by each Fund, there can
</font><font>be no assurance that the securities or other assets received by a Fund in connection with such plan of reorganization or </font><font>restructuring will not have a lower value or income potential than may have been anticipated or no value. A Fund may be
</font><font>unable to enforce its claims or rights in any collateral or may have its claims or security interest in any collateral challenged, </font><font>disallowed or subordinated to the claims or security interests of other creditors. In addition, amendments to the U.S.
</font><font>Bankruptcy Code or other relevant laws could alter the expected outcome or introduce greater uncertainty regarding the </font><font>outcome of each Fund's securities holdings in the issuer. In a bankruptcy proceeding, a reorganization or restructuring, the
</font><font>securities of the issuer held by a Fund could be re-characterized, or each Fund may receive different securities or other assets, </font><font>including equity securities. These types of equity securities include, but are not limited to: common stock; preferred stock
</font><font>(including convertible preferred stock); bonds, notes and debentures convertible into common or preferred stock; stock </font><font>purchase warrants and rights; equity interests in trusts; and depositary receipts. Equity securities are subject to changes in
</font><font>value, and their value may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. Holders of equity securities are subject to more </font><font>risk than holders of debt securities because the status of equity holders is subordinate to debtholders in an issuer's capital
</font><font>structure. The value of equity securities received by each Fund could decline if the financial condition of the issuer </font><font>deteriorates or if overall market and economic conditions, or conditions within the issuer’s region or industry, deteriorate. </font><font>Equity securities received by a Fund through a bankruptcy proceeding, reorganization or restructuring of an issuer would not
</font><font>be component securities of a Fund’s Underlying Index, which could subject a Fund to additional tracking error risk.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>To the extent that a Fund receives other assets in connection with a bankruptcy proceeding,
reorganization or financial </font><font>restructuring, a Fund may also be subject to additional risks associated with the assets received. One example of assets that </font><font>a Fund could receive is an interest in one or more loans made to the issuer as part of a workout agreed to by a consortium of
</font><font>lienholders and creditors of the issuer. A Fund may receive such interests in loans to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Securities or other assets received in a reorganization or restructuring typically entail a
higher degree of risk than investments </font><font>in securities of issuers that have not undergone a reorganization or restructuring and may be subject to heavy selling or </font><font>downward pricing pressure after completion of the reorganization or restructuring. The post-reorganization/restructuring
</font><font>assets and securities may also be illiquid and difficult to sell or value. If a Fund participates in negotiations with respect to a </font><font>plan of reorganization or restructuring with respect to securities of the issuer held by a Fund, each Fund also may be
</font><font>restricted from disposing such securities for a period of time. If a Fund becomes involved in such proceedings, each Fund </font><font>may have more active participation in the affairs of the issuer than that assumed generally by an investor.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>LIBOR Replacement Risk. </font><font> </font><font>A Fund may be exposed to financial instruments that are tied to the London Interbank Offered </font><font>Rate (</font><font>“</font><font>LIBOR</font><font>”</font><font>) to determine payment obligations, financing terms, hedging strategies or investment value. The United </font><font>Kingdom’s
Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that a majority of USD LIBOR settings will no </font><font>longer be published after June 30, 2023. All other LIBOR settings and
certain other interbank offered rates ceased to be </font><font>published after December 31, 2021. The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (</font><font>“</font><font>SOFR</font><font>”</font><font>), which is a broad measure of the cost of </font><font>borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities in the
repurchase agreement market, has been used </font><font>increasingly on a voluntary basis in new instruments and transactions. Under U.S. regulations that implement a statutory </font><font>fallback mechanism to replace LIBOR, benchmark rates based on SOFR will replace LIBOR in different categories of financial
</font><font>contracts after June 30, 2023.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Neither the effect of the LIBOR transition process nor its ultimate success can yet be known. While some existing
LIBOR-based</font><font> instruments may contemplate a scenario where LIBOR is no longer available by providing for an alternative rate-setting </font><font>methodology, there may be significant uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of any such alternative methodologies to
</font><font>replicate LIBOR. Not all existing LIBOR-based instruments may have alternative rate-setting provisions and there remains </font><font>uncertainty regarding the willingness and ability of issuers to add alternative rate-setting provisions in certain existing </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>instruments. Parties to contracts, securities, or
other instruments using LIBOR may disagree on transition rates or the </font><font>application of transition regulation, potentially resulting in uncertainty of performance and the possibility
of litigation. A Fund </font><font>may have instruments linked to other interbank offered rates that may also cease to be published in the future.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>Money Market Instruments Risk. </font><font> </font><font>A Fund may hold money market instruments. The value of money market instruments </font><font>may be affected by changes in interest rates or in the credit ratings of the investments, among other things. If a significant
</font><font>amount of a Fund's assets is invested in money market instruments, it may be more difficult for the Fund to achieve its </font><font>investment objective. An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance
</font><font>Corporation or any other government agency. It is possible to lose money by investing in a money market fund. Money </font><font>market funds other than U.S. government money market funds and retail money market funds </font><font>“</font><font>float</font><font>”</font><font> their NAV instead of </font><font>using a stable $1.00 per share price.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Municipal Market Disruption Risk. </font><font> </font><font>The value of municipal securities may be affected by uncertainties in the municipal </font><font>market related to legislation or
litigation involving the taxation of municipal securities or the rights of municipal securities </font><font>holders in the event of a bankruptcy. Proposals to restrict or eliminate the U.S.
federal income tax exemption for interest on </font><font>municipal securities are introduced before the U.S. Congress from time to time. Proposals also may be introduced before </font><font>state legislatures that would affect the state tax treatment of a municipal fund’s distributions. If such proposals were enacted, </font><font>the availability of municipal securities and the value of a Municipal Bond Fund’s holdings would be affected, and the Trustees </font><font>would reevaluate the Fund’s investment objective and policies. Municipal bankruptcies are relatively rare, and certain
</font><font>provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code governing such bankruptcies are unclear and remain untested. Further, the
</font><font>application of state law to municipal issuers could produce varying results among the states or among municipal securities </font><font>issuers within a state. These legal uncertainties could affect the municipal securities market generally, certain specific
</font><font>segments of the market, or the relative credit quality of particular securities. Any of these effects could have a significant </font><font>impact on the prices of some or all of the municipal securities held by a Municipal Bond Fund.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Operational Risk.</font><font>  </font><font>BFA and a Fund's other service providers may experience disruptions or operating errors such as </font><font>processing errors or human
errors, inadequate or failed internal or external processes, or systems or technology failures, that </font><font>could negatively impact the Funds. While service providers are required to have
appropriate operational risk management </font><font>policies and procedures, their methods of operational risk management may differ from a Fund’s in the setting of priorities, </font><font>the personnel and resources available or the effectiveness of relevant controls. BFA, through its monitoring and oversight of
</font><font>service providers, seeks to ensure that service providers take appropriate precautions to avoid and mitigate risks that could </font><font>lead to disruptions and operating errors. However, it is not possible for BFA or the other Fund service providers to identify all </font><font>of the operational risks that may affect a Fund or to develop processes and controls to completely eliminate or mitigate their
</font><font>occurrence or effects.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Prepayment Risk.
</font><font> </font><font>During periods of falling interest rates, issuers of certain debt obligations may repay
principal prior to the </font><font>security’s maturity, which may cause a Fund to have to reinvest in securities with lower yields or higher risk of default, </font><font>resulting in a decline in the Fund’s income or return potential. Also, if a security subject to prepayment had been purchased </font><font>at a premium, the value of the premium would be lost in the event of prepayment.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Repurchase Agreement Risk. </font><font> </font><font>A repurchase agreement is an instrument under which the purchaser (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, a Fund) acquires a </font><font>security and the seller agrees, at the time of the sale, to repurchase the security at a mutually
agreed upon time and price. </font><font>Repurchase agreements may be construed to be collateralized loans by the purchaser to the seller secured by the securities </font><font>transferred to the purchaser. If a repurchase agreement is construed to be a collateralized loan, the underlying securities will </font><font>not be considered to be owned by a Fund but only to constitute collateral for the seller’s obligation to pay the repurchase </font><font>price. If the seller defaults on its obligation under the agreement, a Fund may suffer delays and incur costs or lose money in
</font><font>exercising its rights under the agreement. If the seller fails to repurchase the security and the market value of the security </font><font>declines, a Fund may lose money.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Risk of Derivatives. </font><font> </font><font>A derivative is a financial contract, the value of which depends on, or is derived from, the value
of an </font><font>underlying asset, such as a security, a commodity (such as gold or silver), a currency or an index (a measure of value or rates, </font><font>such as the S&amp;P 500 or the prime lending rate). Each Fund may invest in variable rate demand notes and obligations, and
</font><font>tender option bonds, which may be considered derivatives. Compared to securities, derivatives can be more sensitive to </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>
<div> <div><font>24</font></div>
</div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>
<p> </p>

<div> <div><a name="xx_a947e660-0edd-4807-973e-765f2e4dfa58_25"></a> <div> <div> </div>
<div> <div><font>changes in interest rates or to sudden
fluctuations in market prices and thus a Fund's losses may be greater if it invests in </font><font>derivatives than if it invests only in conventional securities. Derivatives are also subject
to counterparty risk, which is the risk </font><font>that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligations. Derivatives generally involve the incurrence of
</font><font>leverage.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>When a derivative is used as a hedge against a position that a Fund holds or is committed to purchase, any loss generated by </font><font>the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can
</font><font>reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains, and in some cases, hedging can cause losses that are not </font><font>offset by gains, and the Fund will recognize losses on both the investment and the hedge. Hedges are sometimes subject to
</font><font>imperfect matching between the derivative and the underlying security, and there can be no assurance that a Fund’s hedging </font><font>transactions, which entail additional transaction costs, will be effective.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Futures and Options on Futures Transactions.</font><font>  </font><font>There are several risks accompanying the utilization of futures </font><font>contracts and options on futures contracts. A position in
futures contracts and options on futures contracts may be closed </font><font>only on the exchange on which the contract was made (or a linked exchange). While each Fund plans to utilize
futures </font><font>contracts only if an active market exists for such contracts, there is no guarantee that a liquid market will exist for the </font><font>contract at a specified time. Furthermore, because, by definition, futures contracts project price levels in the future and not </font><font>current levels of valuation, market circumstances may result in a discrepancy between the price of the bond index future and
</font><font>the movement in the relevant Underlying Index. In the event of adverse price movements, a Fund would continue to be </font><font>required to make daily cash payments to maintain its required margin. In such situations, if a Fund has insufficient cash, it
</font><font>may have to sell portfolio securities to meet daily margin requirements at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. In </font><font>addition, a Fund may be required to deliver the instruments underlying the futures contracts it has sold.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The risk of loss in trading futures contracts or uncovered call options in some strategies (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, selling uncovered bond index
</font><font>futures contracts) is potentially unlimited. Each Fund does not plan to use futures and options contracts in this way. The risk </font><font>of a futures position may still be large as traditionally measured due to the low margin deposits required. In many cases, a
</font><font>relatively small price movement in a futures contract may result in immediate and substantial loss or gain to the investor </font><font>relative to the size of a required margin deposit. Each Fund, however, intends to utilize futures and options contracts in a
</font><font>manner designed to limit its risk exposure to levels comparable to a direct investment in the types of bonds in which it </font><font>invests.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Utilization of futures and options on futures by a Fund involves the risk of imperfect or even negative correlation to its </font><font>Underlying Index if the index underlying the futures contract differs from the Underlying Index. There is also the risk of loss </font><font>by a Fund of margin deposits in the event of bankruptcy of a broker with whom a Fund has an open position in the futures
</font><font>contract or option. The purchase of put or call options will be based upon predictions by BFA as to anticipated trends, which </font><font>predictions could prove to be incorrect.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Because the futures market generally imposes less burdensome margin requirements than the
securities market, an </font><font>increased amount of participation by speculators in the futures market could result in price fluctuations. Certain financial </font><font>futures exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures contract prices during a single trading day. The daily
</font><font>limit establishes the maximum amount by which the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the
</font><font>previous day's settlement price at the end of a trading session. Once the daily limit has been reached in a particular type of </font><font>contract, no trades may be made on that day at a price beyond that limit. It is possible that futures contract prices could
</font><font>move to the daily limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading, thereby preventing prompt liquidation of </font><font>futures positions and subjecting each Fund to substantial losses. In the event of adverse price movements, each Fund would
</font><font>be required to make daily cash payments of variation margin.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Non-U.S. Agency Debt Securities. </font><font> </font><font>Uncollateralized bonds issued by agencies, subdivisions or </font><font>instrumentalities of foreign governments are generally backed
only by the creditworthiness and reputation of the entities </font><font>issuing the bonds and may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the foreign government. Moreover, a foreign
</font><font>government that explicitly provides its full faith and credit to a particular entity may be, due to changed circumstances, </font><font>unable or unwilling to actually provide that support. If a non-U.S. agency is unable to meet its obligations, the performance of </font><font>a Fund will be adversely impacted. A non-U.S. agency’s operations and financial condition are influenced by the foreign
</font><font>government’s economic and other policies. Changes to the financial condition or credit rating of a foreign government may </font><font>cause the value of debt issued by that particular foreign government’s agencies, subdivisions or instrumentalities to decline. </font><font>During periods of economic uncertainty, the trading of non-U.S. agency bonds may be less liquid while market prices may be </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>more volatile than prices of U.S. agency bonds.
Additional risks associated with non-U.S. agency investing include differences </font><font>in accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards, adverse changes in investment or exchange
control regulations, </font><font>political instability, which could affect U.S. investments in foreign countries and cause restrictions on the flow of international </font><font>capital.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>Risk of Investing in Non-U.S. Debt Securities.
</font><font> </font><font>Non-U.S. debt securities are traded on foreign exchanges and OTC in the </font><font>respective countries covered by a Fund. The risks of investing in non-U.S. debt securities typically include market fluctuations </font><font>caused by such factors as economic and political developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in bond
</font><font>prices. Investing in a fund whose portfolio contains securities of non-U.S. issuers involves certain risks and considerations not </font><font>typically associated with investing in the securities of U.S. issuers. These risks include securities markets that may lack
</font><font>sufficient liquidity or may be less efficient; generally greater price volatility; less publicly available information about issuers; </font><font>the imposition of withholding or other taxes; the imposition of restrictions on the expatriation of funds or other assets of a
</font><font>Fund; higher transaction and custody costs; delays and risks attendant in settlement procedures; difficulties in enforcing </font><font>contractual obligations; lower liquidity and significantly smaller market capitalization of most non-U.S. securities markets;
</font><font>different accounting and disclosure standards; lower levels of regulation of the securities markets; more substantial </font><font>government interference with the economy; higher rates of inflation; greater social, economic, and political uncertainty; the
</font><font>risk of nationalization or expropriation of assets; and different bankruptcy and insolvency regimes which may stay or prevent </font><font>recovery in the event of an issuer’s default. </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Swap Agreements.</font><font>  </font><font>The risk of loss with respect to swaps is generally limited to the net amount of payments that a </font><font>Fund is contractually
obligated to make. Swap agreements are subject to the risk that the swap counterparty will default on </font><font>its obligations. If such a default occurs, a Fund will have contractual
remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the </font><font>transaction. However, such remedies may be subject to bankruptcy and insolvency laws, which could affect such Fund’s
</font><font>rights as a creditor
(</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, a Fund may not receive the net amount of payments that it is contractually entitled to
receive).</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>A Fund is required to post and collect variation margin and
initial margin (comprised of specified liquid securities subject to </font><font>haircuts) in connection with trading of OTC swaps. These requirements may raise the costs for a Fund’s
investment in swaps.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Securities Lending Risk. </font><font> </font><font>A Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that a Fund may lose
</font><font>money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. A Fund could </font><font>also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of </font><font>any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for a Fund.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Special Considerations Regarding Investments in California Municipal Securities</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Following is a brief summary of some of the factors that may affect the financial condition of the State of California (referred </font><font>to herein as the </font><font>“</font><font>State</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>California</font><font>”</font><font>) and its political subdivisions. The
summary is neither a complete nor a </font><font>comprehensive description of these factors nor an analysis of financial conditions and may not be indicative of the financial </font><font>condition of issuers of obligations or any particular projects financed with the proceeds of such obligations. Many factors not </font><font>included in the summary, such as the ongoing and evolving economic and health-related impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic </font><font>on
the State, local and national economies, the uncertain impact of federal and State financial assistance available to address </font><font>the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in federal
policies related to trade, health care and immigration, social and </font><font>environmental policies and conditions, the national and international markets for products produced in
California, </font><font>developments in municipal bankruptcies and significant unfunded pension and other post-employment benefit liabilities, </font><font>could have an adverse impact on the financial condition of the State and its political subdivisions. The Fund is unable to
</font><font>predict whether or to what extent such factors or other factors may affect the issuers of the municipal securities, the market </font><font>value or marketability of the municipal securities or the ability of the respective issuers of the municipal securities acquired by </font><font>the Fund to pay interest on or principal of the municipal securities.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Fund invests a high proportion of its assets in California municipal securities. The payment of interest on and
</font><font>preservation of principal in these securities are dependent upon the continuing ability of California issuers and/or obligors of </font><font>State, municipal and public authority debt obligations to meet their obligations thereunder. In addition to general economic
</font><font>pressures, certain California constitutional amendments, legislative measures, executive orders, administrative regulations </font><font>and voter initiatives could adversely affect a California issuer’s ability to raise revenues to meet its financial obligations.</font></div> </div>

<div> <div><font>2023; the May Revision to the
2023-24 Governor’s Budget, which was released on May 12, 2022; the State Legislative </font><font>Analyst’s Office (</font><font>“</font><font>LAO</font><font>”</font><font>) preliminary review of the May Revision; as well as offering statements relating

The State’s fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on
June 30 of the following year. The annual State </font><font>budget is proposed by the Governor by January 10 of each year for the next fiscal year (the </font><font>“</font><font>Governor’s Budget</font><font>”</font><font>). The </font><font>Governor released his initial budget proposal for fiscal year 2023-24 on January 10, 2023 (the </font><font>“</font><font>2023-24 Governor’s Budget</font><font>”</font><font>). </font><font>State law also requires the Governor to update the Governor’s Budget projections and budgetary proposals by May 14
of </font><font>each year. The Governor released his May Revision to the 2023-24 Governor’s Budget on May 12, 2023 (the
</font><font>“</font><font>May Revision</font><font>”</font><font>). </font><font>The Governor is required to sign the budget by the start of the fiscal year on July 1. The Governor signed the fiscal
year 2022-23</font><font> budget (the </font><font>“</font><font>2022-23
Budget</font><font>”</font><font>) on June 27, 2022. The LAO releases analysis of the Governor’s various budget proposals
</font><font>throughout the year.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The May Revision projected total general fund beginning balance, revenues and transfers of
$233.2 billion for fiscal year </font><font>2023-24 (an approximately 10.5% decrease over estimated results for fiscal year 2022-23), authorized expenditures of $224.1 </font><font>billion for fiscal year 2023-24 (an approximately 5.2% decrease from estimated results for fiscal year 2022-23), and projected
</font><font>that the State will end the 2023-24 fiscal year with total available general fund reserves of $37.2 billion (an approximately </font><font>25.5% decrease from estimated results for fiscal year 2022-23). The May Revision estimated General Fund revenues </font><font>downward by
$9.3 billion compared to the 2023-24 Governor’s Budget.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Reported
combined cash receipts for July 1, 2022 through March 30, 2023 were 3.7% ($4.7 billion) below the 2023-24 </font><font>Governor’s Budget forecast of $126.7 billion. Fiscal year-to-date
shortfalls were due largely to lower personal income tax and </font><font>corporate tax receipts. Due to winter storms and flooding in January, certain payments were delayed and tax filing
deadlines </font><font>for Californians in most counties were extended to May 15. These deadlines were further delayed to October 16, adding </font><font>significant uncertainty to the interpretation of cash results.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>COVID-19 Pandemic</font><font>-</font><font>General Impact</font><font>. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the State, like other state and local government </font><font>authorities, implemented, and
revised from time to time, restrictions on mass gatherings that resulted in widespread closings </font><font>and modifications of the operations of government, businesses, universities and
schools. The State and the State Treasury </font><font>General Fund (the </font><font>“</font><font>General Fund</font><font>”</font><font>), as well as local governments
throughout the State, were initially adversely impacted by </font><font>the health-related and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted large sectors of the State economy
</font><font>and remains a risk to the State’s finances as well as the finances of local governments. Disruptions were mitigated in part by </font><font>large federal funding programs to address the pandemic and its impacts. California has benefitted from approximately $603
</font><font>billion in federal assistance from direct payments to state and local governments and other assistance to individuals and </font><font>organizations. Some of such federal funding to state and local governments has yet to be expended. The 2022-23 Budget
</font><font>projected federal funds to the State will decline $175 billion, or 55%, from $319 billion in 2021-22 to $144 billion in 2022-23. </font><font>This decline is the result of several significant federal programs enacted in response to COVID-19 expiring in 2022-23. Actual
</font><font>and anticipated reimbursements from the federal government for costs associated with the State’s response to recent </font><font>wildfires and the pandemic are projected to total approximately $6.5 billion in the 2023-24 Governor’s Budget forecast,
</font><font>compared to $13.4 billion in the 2022-23 Budget Act.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>While it is impossible to describe in detail the impact on specific local bond issuances, the economic effects of the COVID-19
</font><font>pandemic will continue to affect or impair the credit quality of a variety of local California issuances. Many of the largest cities </font><font>in the State, including notably San Francisco, Los Angeles and Oakland, have experienced some of the highest office vacancy </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>rates in the Country. While the long term
consequences of the pandemic are yet to be known, and will vary among </font><font>jurisdictions, these cities (among others) are projecting reduced local government property and other business
related tax </font><font>revenue due to the reduced value of office properties, resulting in projected budget shortfalls.</font><font> </font></div> <div> <div><font>The
ability of local governments to address any budget shortfalls are constrained by constitutional limitations, included </font><font>limited taxing and borrowing powers and balanced budget
requirements, among other factors. Unfunded pension and other </font><font>post-retirement liabilities also weigh heavily upon many local governments and have been the principal cause of
several well-publicized</font><font> municipal bankruptcy filings.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Revenue Forecasts</font><font>. The long-term General Fund revenue forecast table below shows the State’s forecast for its main General </font><font>Fund revenue
sources as of the May Revision for fiscal years 2021-22 through 2026-27. Total General Fund revenue from </font><font>these sources is projected to decline from $215.3 billion in 2021-22 to
$204.8 billion in 2026-27. The State’s economic </font><font>outlook was modestly downgraded in the May Revision, due largely to actual economic data coming in slightly lower than </font><font>projected and tighter monetary conditions from more cautious lending in the banking sector. At the same time, tax receipts
</font><font>continue to come in substantially lower than projected at the 2023-24 Governor’s Budget. Capital gains realizations are </font><font>assumed to decline from their record-high levels of 11.3% of personal income in 2021 to reach 5% of personal income by </font><font>2026.
The May Revision forecasts that the General Fund faces an estimated budget shortfall of $31.5 billion in the 2023-24 </font><font>fiscal year.

<div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>2</font></div> <div><font>Totals may not add due to rounding.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> </div>
</div> <div> <div><font>The personal income tax is the State’s largest revenue source and is expected to
comprise 56.5% of all General Fund </font><font>revenues and transfers in fiscal year 2023-24. As described herein, the State has a very progressive income tax structure with </font><font>the top one percent of taxpayers generally paying more than 40% of all personal income tax. This reliance on a progressive
</font><font>income tax structure has resulted in more volatility in the State’s revenue base. See </font><font>“</font><font>Recent Financial Results.</font><font>”</font><font>
</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The May Revision revenue forecast is based on a scenario that assumes
continued but slowing economic growth and does </font><font>not assume a recession. Several risk factors could negatively impact the economy and lead to a recession, which could either </font><font>be mild or more severe. A significant financial shock from tightening financial conditions, worsening of the recent banking
</font><font>crisis, persistent supply chain issues, continued elevated inflation, further stock market and asset price declines, and </font><font>geopolitical turmoil are all issues that pose a risk to ongoing economic and revenue growth. The magnitude of the revenue
</font><font>loss from a recession would depend upon the depth and duration of a recession, as well as its relative impact on higher-income</font><font> individuals. A mild recession could lead to General Fund revenue losses of over $20 billion relative to the State’s
</font><font>forecasts for 2023-24.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The LAO estimates there is roughly two-thirds chance State revenues will come in below May
Revision estimates.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Economic Factors</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>California is by far the most populous state in the nation; indeed, California is almost 33%
larger than the second most-populous</font><font> state, according to the most recent population estimates released by the United States Census Bureau. California’s </font><font>population was an estimated 39.0 million as of January 1, 2022, down 0.4% from the previous year. Prior to the COVID-19
</font><font>pandemic, California’s population growth slowed due to declining births correlated with changes in education, marriage, and </font></div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <div> <div><font>28</font></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>work decisions; rising deaths from an aging
population; and reduced net migration due to recent decreases in foreign </font><font>immigration. The pandemic accelerated these trends and drove the State’s population growth negative
in fiscal years 2020-21</font><font> and 2021-22. The combined effects of pandemic restrictions and federal administrative backlogs continue to keep </font><font>migration below pre-pandemic levels. Coupled with domestic out-migration, the slow rebound in international migration has
</font><font>contributed to California’s recent population slow down. These trends are expected to continue as the population and labor </font><font>force adjust to pandemic-induced changes, while the larger domestic movements driven by employment shifts seem to have
</font><font>subsided.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>California’s economy, the largest among the 50 states, has major components in high technology, trade, entertainment, </font><font>manufacturing, tourism, construction and services. The relative proportion of the various components of the California
</font><font>economy closely resembles the make-up of the national economy. California’s economy accounted for nearly 15% of the U.S. </font><font>GDP in calendar year 2021. California remained the fifth largest economy in the world in 2021, with a GDP of $3.4 trillion in
</font><font>current dollars.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The State reported in April 2023 that California’s median price for existing home sales reached a record high of $900,017 in </font><font>May 2023, just over a year after exceeding $800,000 for the first time. However, as interest rate hikes pushed up mortgage
</font><font>rates, the demand for housing in the second half of 2022 began to fall and the median sale price for housing also fell, </font><font>reaching $751,330 in December 2022, a 16.5% decline from May. California residential housing units authorized by building
</font><font>permits (seasonally adjusted) averaged approximately 120,000 through the first 10 months of 2022, the highest level since </font><font>2006. Multi-family units were up by 13.8% in 2021 relative to 2020, and single-family units were up by 11.6%.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Constitutional Limitations on Taxes, Other Charges, Appropriations and
General Fund Revenues</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Over the years, a number of constitutional amendments have been enacted, often through voter initiatives, that have
</font><font>increased the difficulty of raising State taxes or restricted the use of General Fund revenues. Some of the most significant of </font><font>these approved constitutional amendments are described below. Because of the complex nature of these initiatives and the
</font><font>ambiguities and possible inconsistencies in their terms, it is not possible to predict with certainty the impact on California </font><font>debt obligations or on the ability of the State or local governments to pay debt service on such California debt obligations.
</font><font>Further initiatives or legislative changes in laws or the California Constitution may also affect the ability of the State or local </font><font>governments to repay their obligations.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Limitation on Property Taxes. </font><font>Certain California debt obligations may be obligations of
local government issuers that rely in </font><font>whole or in part, directly or indirectly, on ad valorem property taxes as a source of revenue. The taxing powers of California </font><font>local governments are limited by Article XIIIA of the California Constitution (</font><font>“</font><font>Article XIIIA</font><font>”</font><font>), enacted by the voters in 1978
and </font><font>commonly known as </font><font>“</font><font>Proposition
13.</font><font>”</font><font> Briefly, Article XIIIA limits the rate of ad valorem property taxes to 1% of the full cash </font><font>value of real property and generally restricts the reassessment of property to 2% per year, except upon new construction or
</font><font>change of ownership (subject to a number of exemptions). Local government taxing entities, however, may raise ad valorem </font><font>taxes above the 1% limit to pay debt service on voter-approved bonded indebtedness. See </font><font>“</font><font>Obligations of Other Issuers</font><font>”</font><font>
</font><font>herein.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Under Article XIIIA, the basic 1% ad valorem tax levy is applied against the assessed value of property as of the owner’s date </font><font>of acquisition (or as of March 1, 1975, if acquired earlier), subject to certain adjustments. This system has resulted in widely </font><font>varying amounts of tax on similarly situated properties. Several lawsuits were filed challenging the acquisition-based
</font><font>assessment system of Proposition 13, but it was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1992.</font><font>
</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>For further discussion on Proposition 13, see </font><font>“</font><font>Local Governments — Constitutional and Statutory Limitations on Local </font><font>Government</font><font>”</font><font> below. For further discussion on
voter approval requirements under Article XIIIA, see </font><font>“</font><font>— Voter Requirements </font><font>for Taxes and Fees</font><font>”</font><font> below.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Limitations on Other Taxes, Fees and Charges. </font><font>In 1996, the voters of the State approved Proposition 218, called the </font><font>“</font><font>Right </font><font>to Vote on Taxes Act.</font><font>”</font><font> Proposition 218 added Article XIIIC (</font><font>“</font><font>Article
XIIIC</font><font>”</font><font>) and Article XIIID
(</font><font>“</font><font>Article XIIID</font><font>”</font><font>) to the State </font><font>Constitution, each of which contains a number of provisions affecting the ability of local governments to
levy and collect </font><font>both existing and future taxes, assessments, fees and charges.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Article XIIIC requires that all new or increased local taxes be submitted to the voters before they become effective. </font><font>Proposition 26, discussed below under the caption entitled </font><font>“</font><font>— Voter Requirements for Taxes and Fees,</font><font>”</font><font>

<div> <div><font>XIIIC by adding an expansive definition of </font><font>“</font><font>taxes</font><font>”</font><font> to include many regulatory fees currently imposed by the State and its </font><font>municipalities. Taxes for general governmental
purposes require a majority vote and taxes for specific purposes require a </font><font>two-thirds vote.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>Article XIIID contains several provisions making it generally more difficult for local governments to levy and maintain </font><font>“</font><font>assessments</font><font>”</font><font> for municipal services and programs. Article XIIID also contains several provisions affecting </font><font>“</font><font>fees</font><font>”</font><font> and </font><font>“</font><font>charges,</font><font>”</font><font> defined for purposes of Article XIIID to mean
</font><font>“</font><font>any levy other than an ad valorem tax, a special tax, or an </font><font>assessment, imposed by a local government upon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property ownership, including </font><font>a
user fee or charge for a property related service.</font><font>”</font><font> All new and existing property-related fees and
charges must conform to </font><font>requirements prohibiting, among other things, fees and charges that generate revenues exceeding the funds that are </font><font>required to provide the property-related service or are used for unrelated purposes. Article XIIID imposes notice, hearing and
</font><font>protest procedures for levying or increasing property-related fees and charges, and, except for fees or charges for sewer, </font><font>water and refuse collection services (or fees for electrical and gas service, which are not treated as </font><font>“</font><font>property related</font><font>”</font><font> for </font><font>purposes of Article XIIID), no property-related fee or charge may be imposed or increased without majority approval by the
</font><font>property owners subject to the fee or charge or, at the option of the local government, two-thirds voter approval by the </font><font>electorate residing in the affected area.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In addition to the provisions described above, Article XIIIC removes limitations on the initiative power in matters of local
</font><font>taxes, assessments, fees and charges. Consequently, local voters, by future initiative, could repeal, reduce or prohibit the </font><font>future imposition or increase of any local tax, assessment, fee or charge. It is unclear how this right of local initiative may be </font><font>used in cases where taxes or charges have been or will be specifically pledged to secure debt issues.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Limitations on the State’s Ability to Transfer Funds from Local Governments. </font><font>In 2010, voters in the State approved </font><font>Proposition 22, a constitutional initiative. Proposition 22, known as the </font><font>“</font><font>Local Taxpayer, Public Safety, and Transportation
</font><font>Protection Act of 2010,</font><font>”</font><font> eliminated
or reduced the State’s authority to (i) temporarily shift property taxes from cities, </font><font>counties and special districts to schools, (ii) use vehicle license fee revenues to
reimburse local governments for State-mandated</font><font> costs (i.e., the State will have to use other revenues to reimburse local governments), (iii) redirect property tax </font><font>increment from redevelopment agencies (which have since been dissolved, see </font><font>“</font><font>Obligations of Other Issuers — Tax </font><font>Increment and the Dissolution of Redevelopment Agencies</font><font>”</font><font> below) to any other local government, (iv) use State fuel tax </font><font>revenues to pay debt service on State transportation bonds, or (v) borrow or change the distribution of State fuel tax
</font><font>revenues.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Voter Requirements for Taxes and Fees.</font><font> Proposition 26, known as the </font><font>“</font><font>Supermajority Vote to Pass New Taxes and Fees
Act</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>was approved
by State voters in 2010. Proposition 26 amended provisions of Article XIIIA and Article XIIIC governing the </font><font>imposition of taxes. Proposition 26 requires a two-thirds supermajority
vote in the California State Legislature (the </font><font>“</font><font>State </font><font>Legislature</font><font>”</font><font>) prior to the imposition of any
change in State statute that results in any taxpayer paying a higher tax. This </font><font>requirement eliminated the prior practice that allowed, via majority vote, one tax to be increased if
another tax is lowered by </font><font>an equivalent amount. Furthermore, any increase in a fee beyond the amount needed to provide the specific service or </font><font>benefit is deemed a </font><font>“</font><font>tax</font><font>”</font><font> and thus would require two-thirds vote of any governmental units for passage. As noted, </font><font>Proposition 26 requires taxes for general governmental purposes to be approved by a majority vote and taxes for specific
</font><font>purposes to be approved by a two-thirds vote. Proposition 26 applied retroactively to any measures passed on or after </font><font>January 1, 2010.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Appropriations Limits. </font><font>The State and its local governments are subject to an annual
</font><font>“</font><font>appropriations limit</font><font>”</font><font> imposed by </font><font>Article XIIIB of the California Constitution
(</font><font>“</font><font>Article XIIIB</font><font>”</font><font>), enacted by the voters in 1979 and significantly amended by </font><font>Propositions 98 and 111 in 1988 and 1990, respectively.
Article XIIIB prohibits the State or any covered local government from </font><font>spending </font><font>“</font><font>appropriations subject to limitation</font><font>”</font><font> in excess
of the appropriations limit imposed. </font><font>“</font><font>Appropriations subject to </font><font>limitation</font><font>”</font><font> are authorizations to spend </font><font>“</font><font>proceeds of taxes,</font><font>”</font><font> which consist of tax revenues and certain other funds, including </font><font>proceeds from regulatory licenses, user charges or other
fees, to the extent that such proceeds exceed the cost of providing </font><font>the product or service, but </font><font>“</font><font>proceeds of taxes</font><font>”</font><font> exclude most State subventions
to local governments. No limit is imposed on </font><font>appropriations of funds that are not </font><font>“</font><font>proceeds of taxes,</font><font>”</font><font> such as reasonable user
charges or fees and certain other non-tax </font><font>funds, including bond proceeds.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Among the expenditures not included in the Article XIIIB appropriations limit are (i) the debt service cost of bonds issued or </font><font>authorized prior to January 1, 1979, or subsequently authorized by the voters, (ii) appropriations to comply with mandates of
</font><font>courts or the federal government, (iii) appropriations for certain capital outlay projects, (iv) appropriations for tax refunds, (v) </font></div> </div> </div>

<div> <div><font>appropriations by the State of post-1989 increases
in gasoline taxes and vehicle weight fees, (vi) appropriation of certain </font><font>special taxes imposed by initiative (e.g., cigarette and tobacco taxes) and (vii) appropriations made in
certain cases of </font><font>emergency.</font></div> <div> <div><font>The appropriations limit for each year is adjusted annually to reflect changes in cost of living and population and any
</font><font>transfers of service responsibilities between government units. </font><font>“</font><font>Excess</font><font>”</font><font> revenues are measured over a two-year
cycle. Local </font><font>governments must return any excess to taxpayers by rate reductions. The State must refund 50% of any excess to taxpayers, </font><font>with the other 50% paid to schools and community colleges. With more liberal annual adjustment factors since 1988, few </font><font>local
governments have been operating near their spending limits, but this condition may change over time. Local </font><font>governments may by majority voter approval exceed their spending limits
for up to four years.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The State has rarely exceeded its appropriations limit. In recent years, however, State appropriations have trended closer to
</font><font>the limit. Strong revenue growth, coupled with more moderate growth in the appropriations limit, served to reduce the room </font><font>under the limit. Two of the three growth factors, the change in civilian population and the change in K-14 average daily
</font><font>attendance, have dropped to less than 1% and have been negative, respectively, in a number of recent years. The 2023-24 </font><font>Budget estimates that the State will remain under the limit through fiscal year 2023-24.</font><font> </font></div>
</div> <div> <div><font>Dedication of General Fund Revenues to
Schools.</font><font> The single largest portion of the State budget is support for K-14 schools. </font><font>In 1988, the voters of the
State approved Proposition 98, a combined initiative constitutional amendment and statute, which </font><font>(subject to suspension by a two-thirds vote of the State Legislature and the
Governor) guarantees local school districts and </font><font>community college districts a minimum share of General Fund revenues (the </font><font>“</font><font>Proposition 98 Guarantee</font><font>”</font><font>) with the balance </font><font>of school funding provided by a share of local property taxes. Proposition 98 is extremely complex and
results in significant </font><font>fiscal problems when General Fund revenues fall short of the projections on which the original appropriations to schools </font><font>were made. For further discussion regarding Proposition 98, see </font><font>“</font><font>Proposition 98 and K-14 Funding</font><font>”</font><font>
below.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Obligations of the State</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The State has always paid when due the principal of and interest on its general obligation bonds, general obligation </font><font>commercial paper notes, lease revenue obligations and short-term obligations, including revenue anticipation notes and
</font><font>revenue anticipation warrants. The State Constitution prohibits the creation of general obligation indebtedness of the State </font><font>unless a bond measure is approved by a majority of the electorate voting at a general election or a direct primary.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Capital Facilities Financing.</font><font> The State builds and acquires capital facilities primarily through the use of general obligation </font><font>bonds and lease-purchase
borrowing. Under the State Constitution, debt service on outstanding general obligation bonds is </font><font>the second charge to the General Fund after support of the public school system and
public institutions of higher education. </font><font>New general obligation bonds, lease revenue bonds and other General Fund-supported debt are authorized by the voters </font><font>and/or the State Legislature with lease revenue bonds generally authorized by the State Legislature. As of March 1, 2023, the
</font><font>State had approximately $69.7 billion of outstanding general obligation bonds payable principally from the State’s General </font><font>Fund and approximately $27.2 billion of authorized and unissued General Fund-supported general obligation bonds. As of </font><font>March
1, 2023, the State had approximately $8.0 billion in outstanding lease revenue bonds payable from lease payments </font><font>paid from the operating budget of the respective lessees, the
operating budgets of which are primarily, but not exclusively, </font><font>derived from the General Fund. As of July 1, 2022, the State had $5.7 billion of authorized but unissued lease
revenue bonds.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>As of April 2023, debt service on General Fund-supported
general obligation bonds and lease revenue debt was estimated to </font><font>equal approximately 3.66% of General Fund revenues in fiscal year 2022-23 and 3.69% of General Fund revenues in
fiscal </font><font>year 2023-24. This debt service cost is calculated based on the amount of debt service to be paid without adjusting for </font><font>reimbursement from various special funds and subsidy payments from the federal government for taxable </font><font>“</font><font>Build America </font><font>Bonds.</font><font>”</font><font> Including those projected offsets would reduce debt service on General Fund-supported general obligation bonds </font><font>and lease
revenue debt to approximately 2.86% of General Fund revenues in fiscal year 2022-23 and 2.85% in fiscal year </font><font>2023-24. The actual General Fund debt ratio in future fiscal years will
depend on a variety of factors, including actual debt </font><font>issuance (which may include additional issuance approved in the future by the State Legislature and, for general obligation
</font><font>bonds, the voters), actual interest rates, debt service structure, and actual General Fund revenues and transfers.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Future Bond Issuance Plans.</font><font> The amount of outstanding General Fund-supported debt,
primarily general obligation bonds, </font><font>may increase in coming years given the amount of authorized and unissued General Fund-supported bonds the State can </font><font>issue. See </font><font>“</font><font>— Capital Facilities
Financing</font><font>”</font><font> above. Based on estimates from the Department of Finance in April 2023, </font><font>approximately $4.3 billion of new money general obligation bonds (some of which may initially be in the form of commercial </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>paper notes) and approximately $65 million in
lease revenue bonds are expected to be issued through the end of fiscal year </font><font>2022-23. In fiscal year 2023-24, the Department of Finance estimates issuance of approximately $5.9
billion of new money </font><font>general obligation bonds (some of which may initially be in the form of commercial paper notes) and approximately $1.5 </font><font>billion in new money lease revenue bonds. However, the exact amount that may be issued will depend on overall budget
</font><font>constraints, market conditions and other factors including updated information provided to the Department of Finance by </font><font>other departments in the State regarding funding needs and actual spending. The State also issues refunding bonds as </font><font>market
conditions warrant.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Cash Management. </font><font>As part of its cash management program, prior to fiscal year 2015-16, the State has regularly issued </font><font>short-term obligations
to meet cash flow needs. External borrowing were typically done with revenue anticipation notes that </font><font>are payable later in the fiscal year in which they are issued. In April 2023,
the State observed that, based on then current cash </font><font>projections, the State is not expected to issue revenue anticipation notes through fiscal year 2023-24. In the 2022-23 Budget,
</font><font>the State assumed a cash cushion of unused internal borrowable resources of at least $33 billion at the end of each month </font><font>through the end of fiscal year 2022-23.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The State is also authorized under certain circumstances to issue revenue anticipation warrants that are payable in the
</font><font>succeeding fiscal year, as well as registered refunding warrants issued to refund revenue anticipation warrants. The State has </font><font>issued revenue anticipation warrants to bridge short-term cash flow shortages in five years since 1992. From time to time,
</font><font>the State Legislature has deferred various payments due under State statute in order to more closely align the State’s </font><font>revenues with its expenditures. This technique has been used in past budgets in order to reduce the State’s need for external </font><font>borrowing to bridge any cash flow deficit. Further, State law gives the State Controller some flexibility to delay payments to
</font><font>various payees, including State vendors, when the State Controller foresees a relatively short-term cash flow shortage. In </font><font>addition, the State issued IOUs in lieu of cash payments in July and August 2009, the second such issuance since the 1930s.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Obligations of State Agencies</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>A number of State agencies and authorities issue obligations secured or payable from
specified revenue streams. These </font><font>obligations are not payable from the General Fund and carry different ratings than the State’s general obligation bonds. None </font><font>of these revenue bonds are backed by the State’s faith and credit or taxing power. As of December 31, 2022, the various State </font><font>revenue bond financing programs had approximately $44.4 billion in outstanding bonds, and the various State financing
</font><font>authorities had approximately $34.2 billion of outstanding revenue bonds. The Regents of the University of California has </font><font>been one of the largest issuers of revenue bonds in recent years, with approximately $28.3 billion of outstanding revenue
</font><font>bonds secured by certain revenues of the University of California as of December 31, 2022. Other State agencies and </font><font>authorities with significant bond programs include the California State University system, with approximately $8.6 billion of
</font><font>outstanding revenue bonds secured by certain revenues of the California State University; the State Department of Water </font><font>Resources, which had approximately $2.9 billion of outstanding revenue bonds secured by power and water users; the
</font><font>California Health Facilities Financing Authority, which had $15.3 billion in outstanding revenue bonds secured primarily by </font><font>revenues of various health facilities; and the California Education Facilities Authority, which had approximately $4.1 billion of </font><font>outstanding revenue bonds secured primarily by revenues of various educational facilities, as of December 31, 2022.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Recent Financial Results</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Historically, the principal sources of General Fund revenues are personal income tax, sales
and use tax and corporation tax. </font><font>The May Revision projected that personal income tax, sales and use tax and corporation tax will contribute 56.5%, 16.0% </font><font>and 20.1%, respectively, of total General Fund revenues and transfers in fiscal year 2023-24, for a cumulative estimated total
</font><font>of 92.6% of General Fund revenues, with not transfer to the Budget Stabilization Account.</font><font>
</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The State’s personal income tax structure is highly progressive,
with rates ranging from 1% to 12.3%. For example, for the </font><font>2020 tax year, the State reported that the top one percent of income earners paid over 49% of personal income taxes. This
</font><font>percentage has been greater than 40% in every year since 2004, except for 2009. The personal income tax was made even </font><font>more progressive with the passage of Proposition 30 (defined below), which imposed additional taxes on earnings over
</font><font>$250,000, resulting in an income tax rate of 12.3% on earnings over $1 million. In November 2016, the voters in the State </font><font>approved an extension of this portion of Proposition 30 through the end of calendar year 2030.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>A large portion of personal income tax receipts is derived from capital gains realizations and stock option income. These </font><font>revenue sources can be particularly volatile. For example, during the Great Recession (lasting from late-2007 to mid-2009),
</font><font>capital gains tax receipts dropped from nearly $9 billion in fiscal year 2007-08 to just under $3 billion in fiscal year 2009-10, a </font></div> </div> </div>

<div> <div><font>67% decline. California does not have a lower rate
for capital gains. All capital gains are taxed as ordinary income. The 2023-24</font><font> Governor’s Budget projected that capital gains would account for 9.2% of General Fund tax
revenues and transfers in </font><font>fiscal year 2022-23 and 8.3% in fiscal year 2023-2024.</font><font> </font></div>
<div> <div><font>The State is required to maintain the Special Fund for Economic Uncertainties (</font><font>“</font><font>SFEU</font><font>”</font><font>), derived from General Fund revenues, </font><font>as a reserve to meet cash needs of the General Fund, but the SFEU is required to be
replenished as soon as sufficient </font><font>revenues are available. Year-end balances in the SFEU are included for financial reporting purposes in the General Fund </font><font>balance. The May Revision projected a balance in the SFEU of $3.8 billion at the end of fiscal year 2023-24. However, the
</font><font>amount in the SFEU at the end of any particular fiscal year may differ materially from the amount projected at the time the </font><font>related Budget for that fiscal year was adopted.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Proposition 98 and K-14 Funding</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Throughout the 1980s, State spending increased rapidly as the State population and economy
also grew rapidly. Such </font><font>spending included increased spending for many assistance programs to local governments, which were constrained by </font><font>Proposition 13 and other laws. The largest State assistance program is to local public school districts. In 1988, the voters of </font><font>the State approved Proposition 98, a combined initiative constitutional amendment and statute, which provides for the
</font><font>Proposition 98 Guarantee. The Proposition 98 Guarantee is calculated each fiscal year using one of three tests that apply </font><font>under varying fiscal and economic conditions. Test 1 earmarks a minimum portion of State revenue for K-14 education, and
</font><font>Test 2 and Test 3 are based on prior-year Proposition 98 funding adjusted for key factors including changes in student </font><font>enrollment, as measured by K-12 average daily attendance. Test 2 further adjusts for the change in inflation. The test that
</font><font>provides the highest level of funding applies. Test 2 and Test 3 are generally used in times of economic distress although the </font><font>State also has the ability to suspend the Proposition 98 funding mechanism.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The May Revision projected that the Proposition 98 Guarantee for fiscal year 2023-24 will be
$106.8 billion. For further </font><font>information on the limitations on General Fund revenues imposed by Proposition 98, see </font><font>“</font><font>Constitutional Limitations on </font><font>Taxes, Other
Charges, Appropriations and General Fund Revenues — Dedication of General Fund Revenues to Schools</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>above.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>State and Local Pension and Post-Retirement Liabilities</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>State. </font><font>The financial condition of the State and its
localities is also subject to pension and other post-retirement benefit risks.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Pension.</font><font> The pension funds managed by the State’s retirement systems, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System
</font><font>(</font><font>“</font><font>CalPERS</font><font>”</font><font>) and the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (</font><font>“</font><font>CalSTRS</font><font>”</font><font>), each have unfunded liabilities in the tens of </font><font>billions of dollars. These unfunded liabilities will require increased
contributions from the General Fund in future years. The </font><font>2023-24 Governor’s Budget estimated a $4.7 billion General Fund contribution for the statutorily required annual
State </font><font>contribution to CalPERS for State pension costs based on the CalPERS actuarial valuation projected contribution rates as of </font><font>June 30, 2021. This is $151 million higher than the 2022-23 Budget General Fund contribution due to payroll growth and the
</font><font>normal progression of amortization bases, including the 7.4% investment loss in 2021-22. Included in these costs are $747 </font><font>million General Fund for California State University retirement costs. Additionally, the 2023-24 Governor’s Budget includes </font><font>$1.2 billion one-time Proposition 2 debt repayment funding as a supplemental payment toward the state plans’ unfunded
</font><font>liabilities. The May Revision estimates $1.7 billion in one-time Proposition 2 debt repayment funding in 2023-24 and a net </font><font>total decreased of $1.7 billion in 2023-24 contributions to CalPERS relative to the 2023-24 Governor’s Budget.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The 2023-24 Governor’s Budget estimates a $3.9 billion General Fund contribution for
the statutorily required annual State </font><font>contribution to CalSTRS. The roughly $218 million increase from the 2022-23 Budget is due to higher-than-anticipated </font><font>growth in creditable compensation from 2020-21 to 2021-22. In the May Revision, State General Fund contributions to </font><font>CalSTRS
increased by $8.8 million in 2023-24, relative to the 2023-24 Governor’s Budget, due to a revision in reported </font><font>compensation for K-12 and community college teachers. See also
</font><font>“</font><font>The State Budget — Balanced Budget Amendment </font><font>(Proposition 58 and Proposition 2)</font><font>”</font><font>
below.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Great Recession called into question the reliability of
assumed rates of return used to determine actuarial unfunded </font><font>pension liabilities. Since 2011, CalPERS and CalSTRS have incrementally reduced the assumed rate of return used to
calculate </font><font>their respective unfunded liabilities, from 7.75% (for both funds) to 6.8% for CalPERS and 7.0% for CalSTRS as of November </font><font>2021. These assumption changes have resulted in significant increases in unfunded liability and have increased required state
</font><font>and other employer contributions to these pension programs.</font><font> </font></div> </div> </div>

As of </font><font>April 2023, General Fund contributions to OPEB were estimated to be approximately $3.3 billion (or

<div><font>Local. </font><font>Many local governments in the State, many of

solvency, of these local </font><font>governments may be at risk in the future if these liabilities are not appropriately addressed through wage concessions and </font><font>restructuring of benefits. Cities are particularly at risk because one of their primary missions is safety, and safety personnel </font><font>labor and retirement benefit costs are significantly greater than labor and retirement costs of general municipal employees.

<div> <div><font>largely as a result of escalating labor costs and
unfunded pension and other post-retirement liabilities. All three of these cities </font><font>have agreements with CalPERS to administer their pension obligations, and their respective
obligations to CalPERS were a </font><font>significant reason for their insolvency. Other cities (including some that contract with CalPERS) and counties have expressed </font><font>public concerns about their ability to meet their unfunded pension and other post-retirement liabilities, and a willingness to
</font><font>entertain bankruptcy as an option to resolve their fiscal problems. One federal bankruptcy judge stated that obligations to </font><font>CalPERS could be adjusted in federal bankruptcy proceedings; however, the plan of adjustment in those proceedings was
</font><font>confirmed without reducing such obligations to CalPERS. Any definitive ruling that allowed obligations to CalPERS to be </font><font>adjusted downward might encourage other financially stressed municipalities to explore a Chapter 9 bankruptcy. The fiscal
</font><font>stress and cash pressures facing the State’s localities prior to the COVID-19 pandemic may be exacerbated as a result of the </font><font>pandemic for certain local governments depending on the makeup of their economy or revenue sources as well as the overall
</font><font>makeup of their outstanding debt. See
</font><font>“</font><font>Obligations of Other
Issuers.</font><font>”</font></div> <div> <div><font>School districts in the State are required to make contributions to CalSTRS for their teachers and staff. Changes in State law
</font><font>in 2014 increased statutorily required contributions to CalSTRS from the State, school districts, and teachers in order to </font><font>eliminate the current CalSTRS unfunded liability by 2045-46.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>General</font><font>. The State and its localities that participate in pension and other
post-employment benefit programs could face </font><font>increasing contribution rates if related pension or OPEB investment funds experience declining rates of return, plan </font><font>assumptions change or actual experience departs from assumptions. Future increases in pension fund and post-retirement
</font><font>benefit contributions could reduce discretionary funds available for other governmental programs. In addition, the credit </font><font>ratings of the State or locality may be adversely affected if the State or locality does not reduce or manage its unfunded
</font><font>liabilities. See </font><font>“</font><font>Bond

<div><font>State Law Regarding Pensions and Pension Reform.
</font><font>California courts have been largely supportive of the vested or earned </font><font>pension rights of State and local
employees. Thus, pension reform efforts have been focused largely on limitations on future </font><font>benefits for new employees, bringing limited, if any, immediate financial relief. In
September 2012, the Governor signed into </font><font>law a comprehensive pension reform package affecting State and local governments known as the California Public </font><font>Employees’ Pension Reform Act of 2013
(</font><font>“</font><font>PEPRA</font><font>”</font><font>), which became effective January 1, 2013. PEPRA implements lower </font><font>defined-benefit formulas with higher retirement ages for
new State employees hired on or after January 1, 2013, and includes </font><font>provisions to increase employee contributions. Both constitutional initiatives and other State legislation have
been circulated </font><font>or proposed attempting to reform the State’s pension systems on a State and local basis.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The State Budget</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Overview</font><font>. </font><font>The State’s fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30 of the following year. The annual
budget is proposed </font><font>by the Governor by January 10 of each year for the next fiscal year. Under State law, the Governor’s Budget cannot provide for </font><font>projected expenditures in excess of projected revenues for the ensuing fiscal year. State law also requires the Governor to
</font><font>update the Governor’s Budget projections and budgetary proposals in the May Revision by May 14 of each year. The May </font><font>Revision is generally the basis for final negotiations between the Governor and the State Legislature to reach agreement on
</font><font>appropriations and other legislation to fund State government and thus finalize the State Budget for the upcoming fiscal year. </font><font>The budget must be balanced, as required by Proposition 58 (discussed below). The budget must be approved by a majority </font><font>of
each house of the State Legislature. State law requires the Governor to sign the budget by the start of the fiscal year on July </font><font>1. See </font><font>“</font><font>Status of State General Fund; the 2023-24 Governor’s Budget</font><font>”</font><font> below.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Constraints on the Budget Process. </font><font>Recent State
constitutional amendments approved by State voters have affected the </font><font>budget process. Several such amendments are described below.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Balanced Budget Amendment (Proposition 58 and Proposition
2).</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Proposition 58</font><font>.</font><font> In 2004, voters approved Proposition 58, a constitutional amendment called the </font><font>“</font><font>Balanced Budget </font><font>Amendment,</font><font>”</font><font> which requires the State to enact a balanced budget and establish a special reserve and restricts future </font><font>borrowing to cover fiscal year-end deficits. As a result of the provisions requiring the enactment of a balanced budget and
</font><font>restricting borrowing, the State would in some cases have to take more immediate actions to correct budgetary shortfalls. </font><font>Proposition 58 requires the State Legislature to pass a balanced budget and provides for mid-year adjustments in the event
</font><font>that the budget falls out of balance and the Governor calls a special legislative session to address the shortfall. The balanced </font><font>budget determination is made by subtracting expenditures from all available resources, including prior-year balances.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Under Proposition 58, if the Governor determines
that the State is facing substantial revenue shortfalls or spending increases, </font><font>the Governor is authorized to declare a fiscal emergency. The Governor would then be required to
propose legislation to </font><font>address the emergency and call the State Legislature into special session for that purpose. If the State Legislature fails to pass </font><font>and send to the Governor legislation to address the fiscal emergency within 45 days, the State Legislature would be
</font><font>prohibited from acting on any other bills or adjourning in joint recess until such legislation is passed. No fiscal emergency has </font><font>been declared as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.</font><font> </font></div>
<div> <div><font>The BSA is a special reserve account funded by annual transfers of specified amounts from the
General Fund, unless </font><font>suspended or reduced by the Governor or until a specified maximum amount has been deposited. Until the 2014-15 Budget, </font><font>the Governor had suspended the annual transfer of money from the General Fund to the BSA every year since 2007. </font><font>Proposition
2 intended to strengthen the BSA by, among other things, basing deposits on when capital gains revenues rise </font><font>above 8%, creating a Proposition 98 reserve and doubling the maximum
size of the BSA from 5% to 10% of General Fund </font><font>revenues. Funding for the BSA is estimated by May Revision to be approximately $22.3 billion as of June 30, 2023 and </font><font>approximately $22.3 billion as of June 30, 2024. Certain other provisions of Proposition 58 relating to the BSA were replaced
</font><font>by the provisions of Proposition 2. See </font><font>“</font><font>—Proposition 2</font><font>”</font><font> below.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Proposition 58 also prohibits certain future borrowing to cover fiscal year-end deficits.
This restriction applies to general </font><font>obligation bonds, revenue bonds, and certain other forms of long-term borrowing. The restriction does not apply to certain </font><font>other types of borrowing, such as short-term borrowing to cover cash shortfalls in the General Fund (including revenue
</font><font>anticipation notes or revenue anticipation warrants currently used by the State), or inter-fund borrowings. See
</font><font>“</font><font>Cash </font><font>Management</font><font>”</font><font> above.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Proposition 2</font><font>. In addition to the provisions
described above, other provisions of Proposition 58 relating to the BSA were </font><font>replaced by the provisions of Proposition 2 (</font><font>“</font><font>Proposition 2</font><font>”</font><font>). Proposition 2 requires that 1.5% of annual General Fund </font><font>revenues be deposited each year into the BSA until the BSA
balance reaches an amount equal to 10% of General Fund </font><font>revenues. Proposition 2 also requires that half of the revenues that otherwise would have been deposited into the BSA </font><font>through fiscal year 2030-31 be used for supplemental payments to pay down long-term liabilities. After fiscal year 2030-31,
</font><font>the revenues that otherwise would have been deposited into the BSA may be used for either supplemental debt payments or </font><font>savings. Proposition 2 further requires that withdrawal of funds from the BSA be only for a disaster or if spending remains at
</font><font>or below the highest level of spending from the prior three years. Proposition 2 limits the maximum amount that could be </font><font>withdrawn in the first year of a recession to half of the BSA’s balance. It also requires the State to provide a multiyear budget </font><font>forecast to help better manage the State’s longer-term finances and to create a Proposition 98 reserve, whereby spikes in </font><font>funding are to be saved for future years to smooth school spending and minimize future cuts.</font><font> </font></div>
</div> <div> <div><font>State-Local Fiscal Relations</font><font>. The enactment of Proposition 1A in November 2004 (</font><font>“</font><font>Proposition 1A of 2004</font><font>”</font><font>) and Proposition </font><font>22, or the </font><font>“</font><font>Local Taxpayer, Public Safety, and
Transportation Protection Act of 2010</font><font>”</font><font>, in November 2010 (</font><font>“</font><font>Proposition 22</font><font>”</font><font>), </font><font>significantly changed the fiscal relationship between the State and local governments by severely limiting the
State’s access </font><font>to local funding sources.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Specifically, Proposition 1A of 2004 amended the State Constitution to, among other things, reduce the State’s access to
</font><font>property tax, sales tax and vehicle license fee revenues raised by local governments. Proposition 1A of 2004 also prohibits the </font><font>State from mandating activities on cities, counties or special districts without providing funding to comply with the
</font><font>mandates. If the State does not provide funding for the mandated activity, the requirement to abide by the mandate is </font><font>suspended.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In
addition, Proposition 22 prohibits the State Legislature from, among other things, (i) taking or reallocating money raised </font><font>by local governments for local purposes, (ii) making
changes in the allocation of property taxes among local governments </font><font>designed to aid State finances, (iii) using State fuel tax revenues to pay debt service on State transportation
bonds, (iv) </font><font>borrowing or changing the distribution of State fuel tax revenues, and (v) using vehicle licensing fee revenues to reimburse </font><font>local governments for State-mandated costs. The inability of the State to borrow or redirect funds from these sources, as it
</font><font>did during the Great Recession in fiscal years 2008-09 and 2009-10, will reduce the State’s flexibility in reaching budget </font><font>solutions in the future. On the other hand, both Proposition 1A of 2004 and Proposition 22 made the allocation of revenues
</font><font>to local jurisdictions more predictable.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Proposition 30 and Proposition 55</font><font>. In 2012, voters approved </font><font>“</font><font>The Schools and Local Public Safety Protection Act of 2012</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>(</font><font>“</font><font>Proposition 30</font><font>”</font><font>), which provided temporary increases in personal income tax rates for high-income taxpayers and a </font><font>temporary increase in the
State’s sales tax rate. The sales tax portion of Proposition 30 expired on December 31, 2016. In </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>November 2016, voters approved Proposition 55
(</font><font>“</font><font>Proposition 55</font><font>”</font><font>), which extended the personal income tax portion of </font><font>Proposition 30 until December 31, 2030. The 2022-23 Budget projected
the revenue from these additional tax brackets to be </font><font>$13.8 billion in fiscal year 2020-21, $14.9 billion in fiscal year 2021-22, and $14.3 billion in fiscal year
2022-23.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Health Care Services. </font><font>Medi-Cal, California’s Medicaid program, is a health care entitlement program for qualified low-income </font><font>individuals and
families who receive public assistance or otherwise lack health care coverage and is one of the State’s largest </font><font>expenditures. Medi-Cal is projected to cover approximately
15.2 million Californians in 2022-23 and 14.4 million in 2023-24—</font><font>more than one-third of the state’s population.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The 2022-23 Budget proposed to expand Medi-Cal coverage to income eligible adults aged 26
through 49, regardless of </font><font>immigration status, no sooner than January 1, 2024. Medi-Cal currently covers undocumented persons under the age of 26.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>In the May Revision, the Medi-Cal budget includes $135.4 billion ($30.9 billion General Fund)
in 2022-23 and $151.2 billion </font><font>($37.6 billion General Fund) in 2023-24. The General Fund components represent, respectively, approximately 13.1% of </font><font>estimated total 2022-23 General Fund expenditures and 16.8% of estimated total 2023-24 General Fund expenditures.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The overall Medi-Cal budget may significantly change over time, including within a single fiscal year, due to its size, financial </font><font>complexity, federal requirements, and the fact that Medi-Cal operates on a cash, rather than an accrual, basis of accounting,
</font><font>which means that the timing of transactions can significantly disrupt fiscal year budgetary estimates. In addition, the federal </font><font>administration and leaders in Congress continue to consider and propose numerous changes to health and human services
</font><font>programs. Many of the proposals could have far-reaching impacts on health care in California and significant impacts to </font><font>Medicaid (Medi-Cal in California).</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The net impact of health care costs on the General Fund continues to depend on a variety of factors, including federal
</font><font>legislation or interpretations of existing federal law or regulations, levels of individual and employer participation, changes in </font><font>insurance premiums, and the approval or enactment of solutions by the State to address health care costs.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Status of State General Fund; the May Revision of the 2023-24 Governor’s Budget</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The May Revision projected total general fund beginning balance, revenues and transfers of
$233.2 billion for fiscal year </font><font>2023-24, authorized expenditures of $224.1 billion for fiscal year 2023-24, and projected that the State will end the 2023-24 </font><font>fiscal year with total available general fund reserves of $37.2 billion, including $3.8 billion in the SFEU, $22.3 billion in the BSA, </font><font>$450 million in the Safety Net Reserve Fund and $10.7 billion in the Public School System Stabilization Account. As noted
</font><font>below, he LAO estimates there is roughly two-thirds chance revenues will come in below May Revision estimates.</font></div> </div>

<div><font>LAO Overview of the May Revision.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The LAO estimates there is roughly two-thirds chance revenues will come in below May Revision
estimates. The LAO </font><font>recommends adopting a lower revenue estimate, to avoid the need for more budget solutions next year. The LAO also </font><font>recommends eliminating new, discretionary spending proposals in the May Revision and reducing more one-time spending </font><font>instead
of using reserves and special fund loans, as contemplated by the May Revision.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Pending Litigation</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>There are currently numerous legal proceedings pending against the State that, if determined
adversely against the State, </font><font>could affect the State’s expenditures and, in some cases, its revenues and cash flow. Information regarding some of the more </font><font>significant litigation pending against the State would ordinarily be included in various public documents issued by the State,
</font><font>such as the official statements prepared in connection with the issuance of general obligation bonds of California.

<div> <div><font>Periodic reports on revenues and/or expenditures during the fiscal year are issued by the
Administration, the State </font><font>Controller’s Office and the LAO. The Department of Finance issues a monthly bulletin, which reports the most recent revenue </font><font>receipts as reported by State departments, comparing those receipts to budget projections. The State Controller issues a
</font><font>monthly report on General Fund cash receipts and disbursements. These reports are normally released on the 10th day of </font><font>every calendar month for the period ended on the last day of the prior month. The Administration also formally updates its
</font><font>budget projections three times during each fiscal year — in January, May and at the time of budget enactment. Currently, </font><font>many of these bulletins and reports are available on the State’s investor relations website
(</font><font>www.buycaliforniabonds.com</font><font>) or </font><font>on websites maintained by the applicable agencies and by contacting the agencies at their offices in Sacramento, California.
</font><font>Investors are cautioned that interim financial information is not necessarily indicative of results for a fiscal year.</font></div> </div>

<div> <div><font>None of the information on the above websites is
incorporated herein by reference.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Local Governments</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>General.</font><font> The primary units of local government in California are the 58 counties, which
range in population from less than </font><font>1,200 in Alpine County to over 10 million in Los Angeles County.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Counties are responsible for the provision of many basic services, including indigent health
care, welfare, jails, and public </font><font>safety in unincorporated areas. As of April 2023, there were 482 incorporated cities in California and thousands of special </font><font>districts formed to provide various services. Commencing with the 2011-12 Budget, the State implemented a realignment </font><font>plan
to shift certain State program costs to counties and provided a comparable amount of funds to support these new </font><font>county commitments. Under the realignment plan, ongoing funds for
such programs are required to be provided to counties </font><font>for court security, corrections and public safety, mental health services, substance abuse treatment, child welfare programs,
</font><font>adult protective services, and CalWORKs. However, State transfers (approximately $10 billion in fiscal year 2022-23) do not </font><font>cover all the costs of such programs. Consequently, local governments, particularly counties, have borne an increased part of
</font><font>the financial burden of providing program services, including the risks of cost overruns, revenue declines and insufficient </font><font>revenue growth.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>To the extent the State is constrained by its obligation to schools under Proposition 98 or other fiscal considerations, the </font><font>absolute level (or the rate of growth) of State assistance to local governments may be affected. Any such reductions in State
</font><font>aid could compound the serious fiscal constraints already experienced by many local governments, particularly counties and </font><font>schools. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the level of funding that the State is required to provide to schools under
</font><font>Proposition 98 was temporarily reduced but now exceeds pre-COVID-19 funding levels. See </font><font>“</font><font>Proposition 98 and K-14 </font><font>Funding.</font><font>”</font><font> Schools have also faced increased costs related to physical plant and staffing costs associated with social </font><font>distancing
protocols. School districts generally maintain some level of operating reserves; however, for certain school districts </font><font>this may not be sufficient to address any drop in revenue
available to schools due to reductions in the Proposition 98 </font><font>Guarantee, other revenue losses and increased costs associated with responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. See </font><font>“</font><font>Proposition </font><font>98 and K-14 Funding</font><font>”</font><font> above.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>While it is impossible to describe in detail the impact on specific local bond issuances, the economic effects of the COVID-19 </font><font>pandemic will continue to affect or impair the credit quality of a variety of local California issuances. Many of the largest cities </font><font>in the State, including notably San Francisco, Los Angeles and Oakland, have experienced some of the highest office vacancy
</font><font>rates in the Country. While the long term consequences of the pandemic are yet to be known, and will vary among
</font><font>jurisdictions, these cities (among others) are projecting reduced local government property and other business related tax </font><font>revenue due to the reduced value of office properties, resulting in projected budget shortfalls.</font><font>
</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>However, local governments that are experiencing declining revenues and
increased expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic </font><font>or other local factors are limited in their ability to levy and raise property taxes and other forms of taxes, fees or assessments,
</font><font>due to State constitutional as well as (in some cases) local initiatives. Local governments are also constrained by balanced </font><font>budget requirements and prohibitions on long-term borrowing for operating costs. As a consequence of these factors, local
</font><font>governments may increasingly be forced to cut local services to address budget shortfalls or to take even more drastic </font><font>actions, such as a bankruptcy filing.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Many local governments are also facing substantial increases in pension liabilities and health care costs for retirees. Any
</font><font>declines in the U.S. and global stock markets could have a material impact on the investments in the State pension trusts, </font><font>which could materially increase the unfunded actuarial accrued liability for CalPERS and CalSTRS, which, in turn, could result
</font><font>in material changes to required contribution rates for local governments in future fiscal years. In the case of school districts, </font><font>contributions to CalSTRS are determined by the State Legislature, and the State had previously enacted legislation to increase
</font><font>required contributions to pay rising pension costs. However, to the extent such required contributions exceed available </font><font>funding, local government finances will continue to be adversely affected. For more information regarding pension liabilities,
</font><font>see </font><font>“</font><font>State and Local Pension and
Post-Retirement Liabilities</font><font>”</font><font> above.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Constitutional and Statutory Limitations on Local
Government.</font><font> The fiscal condition of local governments was changed </font><font>when Proposition 13, which added Article
XIIIA to the State Constitution, was approved by California voters in 1978. </font><font>Proposition 13 reduced and limited the future growth of property taxes and limited the ability of local
governments to impose </font><font>“</font><font>special
taxes</font><font>”</font><font> (i.e., those devoted to a specific purpose) without two-thirds voter approval. Although
Proposition 13 limited </font><font>property tax growth rates, it also has had a smoothing effect on property tax revenues, ensuring greater stability in annual </font></div> </div> </div>

<div> <div><font>revenues than existed before Proposition 13
passed. For further information on Proposition 13, see </font><font>“</font><font>Constitutional </font><font>Limitations on Taxes, Other Charges, Appropriations and General Fund Revenues — Limitation on Property
Taxes</font><font>”</font><font> above.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>Proposition 218, a constitutional amendment enacted by initiative in 1996, further limited the ability of local governments to </font><font>raise taxes, fees, and other exactions. See
</font><font>“</font><font>Constitutional Limitations on Taxes, Other Charges, Appropriations and General </font><font>Fund Revenues — Limitations on Other Taxes, Fees and Charges</font><font>”</font><font> above. Proposition 62, a statutory initiative adopted by the </font><font>voters in 1986, includes limitations on the ability of local
governments to raise taxes that are similar to those included in the </font><font>later constitutional amendments of Proposition 218.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>In the aftermath of Proposition 13, the State provided aid to local governments from the
General Fund to make up some of </font><font>the loss of property tax moneys, including assuming principal responsibility for funding K-12 schools and community </font><font>colleges. During the recession of the early 1990s, the State Legislature reduced the post-Proposition 13 aid to local
</font><font>government entities other than K-12 schools and community colleges by requiring cities and counties to transfer some of </font><font>their property tax revenues to school districts. However, the State Legislature also provided additional funding sources, such
</font><font>as sales taxes, and reduced certain mandates for local services funded by cities and counties.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Beginning in 2000, and in part caused by the </font><font>“</font><font>internet bubble,</font><font>”</font><font> the State was faced with
increasing financial stress and </font><font>began to divert local revenue resources, including sales tax, vehicle license fees and redevelopment moneys, to the State </font><font>coffers. The 2004-05 Budget, related legislation and the enactment of Proposition 1A of 2004 and Proposition 22 </font><font>dramatically
changed the State-local fiscal relationship. Proposition 1A of 2004 amended the State Constitution to, among </font><font>other things, reduce the State Legislature’s authority over local
government revenue sources by placing restrictions on the </font><font>State’s access to local governments’ property, sales, and vehicle license fee revenues as of November 3, 2004.
Proposition 22, </font><font>which supersedes Proposition 1A of 2004, completely prohibits any future borrowing by the State from local government </font><font>funds and generally prohibits the State Legislature from making changes in local government funding sources. For further
</font><font>discussion regarding Proposition 22 and Proposition 1A of 2004, see </font><font>“</font><font>The State Budget — Balanced Budget Amendment </font><font>(Proposition 58 and Proposition 2) — State-Local Fiscal
Relations</font><font>”</font><font> above.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Obligations of Other Issuers</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Other Issuers of California Debt Obligations.</font><font> There are a number of State agencies, instrumentalities and political </font><font>subdivisions of the State that issue municipal
obligations, some of which may be conduit revenue obligations payable from </font><font>payments from private borrowers. These entities are subject to various economic risks and uncertainties,
and the credit </font><font>quality of the securities issued by them may vary considerably from the credit quality of obligations backed by the full faith </font><font>and credit of the State. See </font><font>“</font><font>Local Governments
— General</font><font>”</font><font> above. For example, assessment bonds may be adversely </font><font>affected by a general decline in real estate values or a slowdown in real estate sales activity.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>California Long-Term Lease Obligations.</font><font> Based on a
series of court decisions, certain long-term lease obligations, though </font><font>typically payable from the General Fund or a municipality, are not considered </font><font>“</font><font>indebtedness</font><font>”</font><font> requiring voter approval. Such </font><font>leases, however, are subject to </font><font>“</font><font>abatement</font><font>”</font><font> in the event the facility being leased is unavailable for beneficial use and </font><font>occupancy by the municipality during the term
of the lease. Abatement is not a default, and there may be no remedies </font><font>available to the holders of the certificates evidencing the lease obligation in the event abatement occurs.
The most common </font><font>cases of abatement are failure to complete construction of the facility before the end of the period during which lease </font><font>payments have been capitalized and uninsured casualty losses to the facility (e.g., due to earthquake). In the event abatement
</font><font>occurs with respect to a lease obligation, lease payments may be interrupted (if all available insurance proceeds and reserves </font><font>are exhausted) and the certificates may not be paid when due. Further, lease obligations may represent executory contracts
</font><font>that could be rejected in a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 9 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. In recent
</font><font>bankruptcy proceedings involving the City of Stockton, the confirmed plan of adjustment included the discharge of lease </font><font>obligations at significant discounts from their face value.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Statutory Lien Securing General Obligation Bonds. </font><font>Certain local governments, particularly
school districts, issue general </font><font>obligation bonds secured by ad valorem property taxes. Effective January 1, 2016, provisions were added to the California </font><font>Education Code and the California Government Code to provide that general obligation bonds issued and sold by local
</font><font>governments in California are secured by a statutory lien on the ad valorem property taxes levied and collected to pay the </font><font>principal and interest on such general obligation bonds. A statutory lien provides bondholders with a security interest in ad
</font><font>valorem property taxes intended to survive a bankruptcy of the local government. It is unclear whether these provisions apply </font><font>to bonds issued prior to the effective date.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>Other Factors</font></div>
<div> <div><font>Inflation and Recession.</font><font> Inflation in the State is historically above the nation’s inflation levels due to the State’s faster </font><font>increases
in energy prices and continued housing pressures. After slowing from 3% in 2019 to 1.7% in 2020, California </font><font>inflation accelerated to 4.2% in 2021, and averaged around 7.5% in 2022.
Elevated inflation in 2021 was driven by pent-up </font><font>demand after suppression of economic activity at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic; for example prices of gasoline, air </font><font>travel, and hotels skyrocketed and supply chain disruptions and various shortages have driven up the prices of durable
</font><font>goods. In 2022, inflation became more broad-based, spreading to food, shelter and other components, and the year over year </font><font>California consumer price index peaked at 8.3% in June before slowing to 7.3% by October. Sustained high inflation can lead
</font><font>to price instability if businesses and consumers expect price increases to continue.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Current global instabilities including within the U.S.’s largest trading partner, China, may disrupt the global economy already </font><font>impacted by high inflation rates. In addition, recent instability within the banking sector, which has affected some California-based</font><font> banks, may also negatively impact the state, national and global economies and increase the risk of a recession. The </font><font>May
Revision revenue forecast is based on a scenario that assumes continued but slowing economic growth and does not </font><font>assume a recession. Several risk factors could negatively impact
the economy and lead to a recession, which could either be </font><font>mild or more severe. A significant financial shock from tightening financial conditions, worsening of the recent banking
crisis, </font><font>persistent supply chain issues, continued elevated inflation, further stock market and asset price declines, and geopolitical </font><font>turmoil are all issues that pose a risk to ongoing economic and revenue growth. The magnitude of the revenue loss from a
</font><font>recession would depend upon the depth and duration of a recession, as well as its relative impact on higher-income </font><font>individuals. A mild recession could lead to General Fund revenue losses of over $20 billion relative to the May Revision
</font><font>forecast in 2023-24.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>COVID-19 Pandemic and Social and Economic Impacts. </font><font>The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect global health and may </font><font>continue to lead to governmental responses which negatively
impact the economy. There can be no assurances that there </font><font>will not be a resurgence of COVID-19 cases and deaths, that existing or new COVID-19 variants will not increase the public
</font><font>health crisis or that unavailability and/or lack of public acceptance of vaccines will not exacerbate or prolong the adverse </font><font>impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is also no assurance that any additional federal aid will be forthcoming for the
</font><font>State or its local governments.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The long term consequences of the pandemic are yet to be known. For instance, if there are broad, long standing changes to
</font><font>where people chose to live and work, the pandemic could, over time, change the key economic drivers of a community. As an </font><font>example, some employers may continue to provide additional flexibility for their employees remote work policies instituted
</font><font>during the COVID 19 emergency. These unknowns create an unprecedented degree of uncertainty about the economic
</font><font>outlook of local governments. These changes also could affect the value of commercial property and over time lead to </font><font>deceleration in local government property tax revenue growth. Many of the largest cities in the State, including notably San
</font><font>Francisco, Los Angeles and Oakland, have experienced some of the highest office vacancy rates in the Country.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Among other reasons, these vacancy rates reflect a reliance upon jobs in the technology industry (which are the most </font><font>vulnerable to remote working), as well as the impact of homelessness and crime upon the attractiveness of certain </font><font>commercial
areas. Higher vacancy rates are resulting in dramatically lower commercial property values, which in turn are </font><font>projected to result in lower property taxes and other business tax
revenue. These tax reductions, as well as increased costs to </font><font>address homelessness and crime could strain municipal budgets, potentially putting pressure on their credit
quality.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Global Relations and Trade.</font><font> Given globalization and the interconnectedness of physical
and financial world markets, </font><font>disruptions in large markets due to economic slowdowns in other countries or regions, geopolitical tensions and </font><font>deteriorating international trade relations, or the global impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic (such as travel restrictions), may
</font><font>have significant negative impacts on the nation’s economy, including on the State. There is significant uncertainty around </font><font>how the Russian invasion of Ukraine will evolve, as well as the conflict’s potential economic impacts to the U.S. and to
</font><font>California.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The COVID-19 pandemic created global supply chain disruptions that negatively impacted domestic markets and reduced </font><font>trade
volumes for the nation and the State. However, more recent information shows increased exports. The State’s exports </font><font>of goods totaled $174.9 billion in 2021, or 12.2% higher
than in 2020 and totaled $185.6 billion in 2022, or 12.2% higher than </font><font>in 2021. This follows a decline of 10.3% in 2020 and a decline of 2.5% in 2019. Continued uncertainty
surrounding the </font><font>stability of global supply chains and the unknown duration of the COVID-19 pandemic present ongoing risks to the U.S. and </font><font>California trade levels and economies.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>Material changes in federal trade policy,
including new or revised tariffs on the State’s trading partners, could directly and </font><font>indirectly impact the State’s economy. The 2019 U.S. tariffs of up to 25% on $250
billion worth of Chinese products, </font><font>equivalent to half of the nation’s imports from China, remain in place as of April 2023. These tariffs triggered Chinese </font><font>retaliatory tariffs of 25% on over $50 billion worth of U.S. exports. Because the State is a transport hub, and China is the
</font><font>State’s largest trading partner by total trade value of goods (based on 2021 annual average data), an ongoing trade war could </font><font>have negative effects on the State’s economy.</font><font> </font></div>
<div> <div><font>Potential trade barriers exacerbate the supply chain issues triggered by large-scale
worldwide shutdowns during the COVID-19</font><font> pandemic. For example, potential trade disruptions associated with uncertainty surrounding China’s zero-tolerance </font><font>COVID-19 policy, which was in effect until December 2022, and threatened invasion of Taiwan, the world’s largest supplier of </font><font>semiconductors, could increase the costs of imports purchased from abroad leading to higher consumer prices and to </font><font>decreased
business revenues. These effects could potentially impact wages and employment in the short run and could </font><font>trigger a change in the business model of companies that until now have
made significant investment decisions based on a </font><font>system of free global trade.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Health Care Costs. </font><font>Medi-Cal is one of the
State’s largest expenditures. The State also provides health benefits to its own </font><font>employees and retirees. General Fund spending on health care costs is thus heavily dependent
upon the rate of health care </font><font>cost inflation. If this inflation rises faster than expected, annual General Fund spending could quickly rise by hundreds of </font><font>millions of dollars. See </font><font>“</font><font>The State Budget
– Health Care Services.</font><font>”</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Housing Constraints.</font><font> The State continues to face a critical housing shortage despite California residential housing units </font><font>authorized by building
permits (seasonally adjusted) averaging approximately 120,000 units through the first ten months of </font><font>2022, the highest levels since 2006. However, as of April 2023, the State
projected that residential permit growth will slow in </font><font>2023 and 2024. Exceptionally strong housing demand driven by high-income earners in 2021 through early 2022 contributed
</font><font>to record high home prices. The California median sales price of existing single-family homes exceeded $900,000 for the first </font><font>time in May 2022 and reached a record high of $900,170, just over a year after exceeding $800,000 for the first time.
</font><font>However, as interest rate hikes pushed up mortgage rates, the demand for housing in the second half of 2022 began to fall </font><font>and the median sale price for housing also fell, reaching $751,330 in December 2022, a 16.5% decline from May. Low-income
</font><font>Californians may face increasing affordability issues which may affect their decisions about where to live and work. Given the </font><font>State’s structural housing supply constraints and shortage, low-income populations will be especially vulnerable to housing </font><font>cost increases both in the rental and ownership markets. Furthermore, certain businesses may determine to leave California
</font><font>to the extent location decisions are significantly influenced by the ability of their employees and customers to live nearby. In </font><font>addition, in certain urban areas in particular, the homeless population has grown in recent years, in some part due to a
</font><font>significant lack of affordable housing. Homeless services programs may become a larger draw on local government funds </font><font>and may otherwise impact economic activity.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Climate Change.</font><font> The State historically has been susceptible to wildfires and hydrologic variability. In April 2023, the State </font><font>disclosed
that as greenhouse gas emissions continue to accumulate, climate change will intensify and increase the frequency </font><font>of extreme weather events, such as coastal storm surges, drought,
wildfires, floods and heat waves, and raise sea levels along </font><font>the coast of the State. Over the past several years, the State has already experienced the impacts of climate change
through </font><font>multiple drought periods, flooding and unprecedented wildfires. As a result of drought conditions, water deliveries to the </font><font>agricultural sector declined in 2021 and 2022, with direct economic impacts from crop revenue losses. The State is once
</font><font>again facing drought conditions as all of the State’s 58 counties entered a drought state of emergency in October 2021. In </font><font>early 2023, the State experienced significant precipitation events leading to severe flooding in various locations through the
</font><font>State. While significant, the increased precipitation does not necessarily indicate the State is out of a period of drought. In </font><font>2020, over 4 million acres burned in California, more than twice the previous record of approximately 2 million acres in 2018.
</font><font>Destruction of housing increases the demand for construction resources from rebuilding, and worsens the State’s housing </font><font>imbalances. The future fiscal impact of climate change on the State budget is difficult to predict, but it could be significant. </font><font>However, the State is in the process of implementing various resilience measures to reduce the impacts of climate change,
</font><font>including significant investments in wildfire prevention and water infrastructure projects and workforce development. The </font><font>ability of the State to take actions to mitigate any future fiscal impact of climate change on the State budget is limited and
</font><font>there can be no assurances that the current or any future resilience measures will be effective in materially mitigating the </font><font>impact of climate change on the State.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Energy Risks.</font><font> The State disclosed in April 2023 that another result of unprecedented climate-induced weather events, </font><font>including drought,
extreme heat events and wildfires, is stress on the State’s electrical system. The future fiscal impact of </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>stresses to the energy grid caused by climate is
difficult for the State to predict, but could be significant. In recent years, </font><font>California has taken numerous steps to increase resiliency to be better prepared to meet the
State’s electricity demands. The </font><font>State is now taking additional immediate actions by expanding demand response programs and creating additional </font><font>incentives to move large energy users to back-up power generation to address reliability concerns and implementing
longer-term</font><font> actions, such as suspending certain permitting requirements to allow greater energy production.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>Cybersecurity Risks.</font><font> The State, like many other large public and private entities, relies on a large and complex technology </font><font>environment to
conduct its operations. The State’s reliance on this environment has increased due to higher rates of telework </font><font>as mandated by public health measures. As a recipient and
provider of personal, private or sensitive information, the State is </font><font>subject to multiple cyber threats including, but not limited to, hacking, viruses, malware and other attacks on
computer and </font><font>other sensitive digital networks and systems.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Entities or individuals may attempt to gain unauthorized access to the State’s digital
systems for the purposes of </font><font>misappropriating assets or information or causing operational disruption and damage. In 2017 the State established a </font><font>statewide security operations center to protect against malicious activity targeting critical technology infrastructure. Local
</font><font>governments in the State have experienced similar threats and taken similar measures; however, no assurances can be given </font><font>that the efforts to manage cyber threats and attacks will be successful or that any such attack will not materially impact the
</font><font>operations or finances of the State or its local governments.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Earthquake Risk.</font><font> Substantially all of California is within an active geologic region
subject to major seismic activity. Northern </font><font>California in 1989 and Southern California in 1994 experienced major earthquakes causing billions of dollars in damages. The </font><font>federal government provided more than $13 billion in aid for both earthquakes, and neither event has had any long-term
</font><font>negative economic impact. Any obligation of a local government in the State could be affected by an interruption of revenues </font><font>because of damaged facilities or, consequently, income tax deductions for casualty losses or property tax assessment
</font><font>reductions. Compensatory financial assistance could be constrained by the inability of (i) an issuer to have obtained </font><font>earthquake insurance coverage; (ii) an insurer to perform on its contracts of insurance in the event of widespread losses; or
</font><font>(iii) the federal or State government to appropriate sufficient funds within their respective budget limitations.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Special Considerations Regarding Investments in New York Municipal Securities</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The following information is a brief summary of factors affecting the economy of New York City (the </font><font>“</font><font>City</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>New York </font><font>City</font><font>”</font><font>) or New York State (the </font><font>“</font><font>State</font><font>”</font><font>, </font><font>“</font><font>New York</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>NYS</font><font>”</font><font>) and does not purport to be a complete
description of such </font><font>factors. Other factors will affect issuers.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The summary is based primarily upon the most recent publicly available offering statements relating to debt offerings of </font><font>state and local issuers and other financial and demographic information, as of April 10, 2023 with respect to the City and </font><font>March 8, 2023 with respect to the State, and it does not reflect recent developments since the dates of such offering </font><font>statements and other information. Neither the Fund nor its legal counsel has independently verified this information.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The State, some of its agencies, instrumentalities and public authorities and certain of its
municipalities have sometimes </font><font>faced serious financial difficulties that could have an adverse effect on the sources of payment for, or the market value of, the </font><font>New York municipal bonds in which the Fund invests.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>NEW YORK CITY</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>General</font><font>. The City, with an estimated population of approximately 8.5 million as of July 2021, is an
international center of </font><font>business and culture. Its non-manufacturing economy is broadly based, with the banking, securities, insurance, technology, </font><font>information, publishing, fashion, design, retailing, education and health care industries accounting for a significant portion of </font><font>the City’s total employment earnings. Additionally, the City is a leading tourist destination. Manufacturing activity in the City </font><font>is conducted primarily in apparel and printing.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>For each of the 1981 through 2022 fiscal years, the City’s General Fund had an operating surplus, before discretionary and </font><font>other transfers, and achieved balanced operating results as reported in accordance with then-applicable generally accepted
</font><font>accounting principles (</font><font>“</font><font>GAAP</font><font>”</font><font>), after discretionary and other transfers and except for the application of Governmental </font><font>Accounting Standards Board (</font><font>“</font><font>GASB</font><font>”</font><font>) Statement No. 49 (</font><font>“</font><font>GASB 49</font><font>”</font><font>) and without regard to changes in
certain fund </font><font>balances which may be carried forward as described below. City fiscal years end on June 30 and are referred to by the </font><font>calendar year in which they end. The City has been required to close substantial gaps between forecast revenues and forecast </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>expenditures in order to maintain balanced
operating results. There can be no assurance that the City will continue to </font><font>maintain balanced operating results as required by State law without proposed tax or other revenue
increases or reductions </font><font>in City services or entitlement programs, which could adversely affect the City’s economic base.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>As required by the New York State Financial Emergency Act For The City of New York (the
</font><font>“</font><font>Financial Emergency
Act</font><font>”</font><font>) and </font><font>the New York City Charter
(the </font><font>“</font><font>City Charter</font><font>”</font><font>), the City prepares a four-year annual financial plan, which is reviewed and </font><font>revised on a quarterly basis and which
includes the City’s capital, revenue and expense projections and outlines proposed </font><font>gap-closing programs for years with projected budget gaps. The City’s current
financial plan projects budget balance in the </font><font>2023 and 2024 fiscal years in accordance with GAAP, except for the application of GASB 49 and without regard to certain </font><font>fund balances, which may be carried forward as described below). In 2010, the Financial Emergency Act was amended to </font><font>waive
the budgetary impact of GASB 49 by enabling the City to continue to finance with bond proceeds certain pollution </font><font>remediation costs. In addition, the City may, without violating its
budget balance requirements, carry forward to a </font><font>subsequent fiscal year or fiscal years unspent balances from certain funds restricted as to their use, as well as balances in the
</font><font>Health Insurance Stabilization Fund, School Crossing Guards Health Insurance Fund, Management Benefits Fund and
</font><font>Revenue Stabilization Fund. The City’s current financial plan projects budget gaps for the 2025 through 2027 fiscal years. A </font><font>pattern of current year balance and projected future year budget gaps has been consistent through the entire period since
</font><font>1982, during which the City has achieved an excess of revenues over expenditures, before discretionary transfers, for each </font><font>fiscal year. The City is required to submit its financial plans to the New York State Financial Control Board (the
</font><font>“</font><font>Control </font><font>Board</font><font>”</font><font>).</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>For its normal operations, the City depends on aid from the State both to enable the City to balance its budget and to meet its </font><font>cash requirements. There can be no assurance that there will not be delays or reductions in State aid to the City from
</font><font>amounts currently projected; that State budgets for future State fiscal years will be adopted by the April 1 statutory deadline, </font><font>or interim appropriations will be enacted; or that any such reductions or delays will not have adverse effects on the City’s </font><font>cash flow or expenditures. In addition, the City has made various assumptions with respect to federal aid. Future federal
</font><font>actions or inactions could have adverse effects on the City, both directly and indirectly through reductions in State aid to </font><font>localities that will need to be taken in the absence of additional federal aid to the State.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The Mayor is responsible under the City Charter for preparing the City’s annual expense and capital budgets (as adopted, the </font><font>“</font><font>Expense Budget</font><font>”</font><font> and the </font><font>“</font><font>Capital Budget,</font><font>”</font><font> respectively, and collectively, the
</font><font>“</font><font>Budgets</font><font>”</font><font>) and for submitting the Budgets to </font><font>the City Council for its review and adoption. The Expense Budget covers the City’s
annual operating expenditures for </font><font>municipal services, while the Capital Budget covers expenditures for capital projects, as defined in the City Charter. </font><font>Operations under the Expense Budget must reflect the aggregate expenditure limitations contained in financial plans.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The Mayor is also responsible for preparing the City’s financial plan, which relates to
the City and certain entities that receive </font><font>funds from the City. The financial plan is modified quarterly. The projections set forth in the financial plan are based on </font><font>various assumptions and contingencies which are uncertain and which may not materialize. Such assumptions and </font><font>contingencies
include the condition of the international, national, regional and local economies, the provision of State and </font><font>federal aid and other State and federal actions and inactions, such
as the potential consequences of not resolving the federal </font><font>debt ceiling negotiations, the impact on City revenues and expenditures of any future federal or State legislation and
policies </font><font>affecting the City and the cost of pension structures and healthcare.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Implementation of the financial plan is dependent on the City’s ability to market successfully its bonds and notes. </font><font>Implementation of the financial plan is also dependent upon the ability to market the securities of other financing entities
</font><font>including the New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority (the </font><font>“</font><font>Water Authority</font><font>”</font><font>) and the New York City
Transitional </font><font>Finance Authority
(</font><font>“</font><font>TFA</font><font>”</font><font>). The success of projected public sales of City, Water Authority, TFA and other bonds and notes is </font><font>subject to prevailing
market conditions. Future developments in the financial markets generally, as well as future </font><font>developments concerning the City, and public discussion of such developments, may
affect the market for outstanding City </font><font>general obligation bonds and notes.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The City Comptroller and other agencies and public officials, from time to time, issue reports and make public statements </font><font>that, among other things, state that projected revenues and expenditures may be different from those forecast in the City’s </font><font>financial plans.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>City Financial Plan</font><font>. For the 2022 fiscal year, the City’s General Fund had a total surplus of $7.6
billion, before discretionary </font><font>and other transfers, and achieved balanced operating results in accordance with GAAP, except for the application of GASB 49 </font><font>and without regard to certain fund balances permitted to be carried forward as described in </font><font>“</font><font>INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT,</font><font>”</font><font>

<div> <div><font>after discretionary and other transfers. The 2022
fiscal year was the forty-second consecutive year that the City achieved </font><font>balanced operating results when reported in accordance with GAAP, except for the application of GASB 49 and
without </font><font>regard to certain fund balances permitted to be carried forward.</font></div> <div> <div><font>2023-2027 Financial Plan</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>On June 13, 2022, the City submitted to the Control Board the financial plan for the 2023 through 2026 fiscal years (the
</font><font>“</font><font>June </font><font>Financial Plan</font><font>”</font><font>), which was consistent with the City’s capital and expense budgets as adopted for the 2023 fiscal year. On
</font><font>November 15, 2022, the City submitted to the Control Board a modification to the June Financial Plan (as so modified, the </font><font>“</font><font>November Financial Plan</font><font>”</font><font>). On January 12, 2023, the Mayor released the preliminary budget for the 2024 fiscal year and the </font><font>City submitted to the
Control Board a modification to the financial plan for the 2023 through 2027 fiscal years (as so </font><font>modified, the
</font><font>“</font><font>Financial Plan</font><font>”</font><font>).</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Financial
Plan projects revenues and expenses for the 2023 and 2024 fiscal years balanced in accordance with GAAP, </font><font>except as described above, and projects gaps of approximately $3.17
billion, $5.01 billion and $6.47 billion in each of fiscal </font><font>years 2025, 2026 and 2027. The June Financial Plan had projected revenues and expenses for the 2023 fiscal year balanced
in </font><font>accordance with GAAP, except as described above, and had projected gaps of approximately $4.21 billion, $3.71 billion and </font><font>$3.98 billion in fiscal years 2024 through 2026, respectively.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The Financial Plan reflects, since the June Financial Plan, increases in projected net
revenues of $1.69 billion, $799 million, </font><font>$693 million and $583 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2026, respectively. Changes in projected revenues include: (i) </font><font>increases in business tax revenues of $775 million, $579 million, $522 million and $287 million in fiscal years 2023 through
</font><font>2026, respectively; (ii) increases in sales tax revenues of $530 million, $295 million, $445 million and $595 million in fiscal </font><font>years 2023 through 2026, respectively; (iii) decreases in real estate transaction tax revenues of $173 million, $397 million,
</font><font>$438 million and $375 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2026, respectively; and (iv) increases in hotel tax revenues of $121 </font><font>million, $24 million, $16 million and $14 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2026, respectively.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Changes in projected revenues also include (i) net increases in non-tax revenues of $368 million, $235 million, $100 million </font><font>and $17 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2026, respectively; and (ii) increases in revenues included in the Program to
</font><font>Eliminate the Gap (the </font><font>“</font><font>PEG</font><font>”</font><font>) of $66 million, $63 million, $48 million and $45 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2026, </font><font>respectively.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The
Financial Plan also reflects, since the June Financial Plan, net decreases in projected net expenditures of $480 million and </font><font>$1.24 billion in fiscal years 2023 and 2024,
respectively, and net increases in projected net expenditures of $145 million and </font><font>$1.61 billion in fiscal years 2025 and 2026, respectively. Changes in projected expenditures
include: (i) increases in agency </font><font>expenses of $656 million, $177 million, $443 million and $446 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2026, respectively; (ii) </font><font>decreases in agency expenses included in the PEG of $977 million, $1.72 billion, $1.62 billion and $1.59 billion in fiscal years </font><font>2023 through 2026, respectively; (iii) decreases of $75 million, $390 million and $425 million in fiscal years 2023 through
</font><font>2025, respectively, reflecting reimbursements of expenditures with federal aid; (iv) decreases in debt service included in the </font><font>PEG of $84 million, $170 million, $227 million and $257 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2026, respectively; and (v)
</font><font>increases in pension contributions, as described below.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The PEG savings described above are based on four categories of initiatives designed to close
the gap between expenses and </font><font>revenues: (i) efficiency initiatives designed to improve the City’s finances without reducing services; (ii) expense re-estimates </font><font>due to a delay in spending or lower than expected costs; (iii) grant revenue re-estimates and increases in City revenues; and
</font><font>(iv) reductions in debt service costs, primarily as a result of debt refinancing.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The Financial Plan reflects, since the June Financial Plan, provision of $2.17 billion for the prepayment in fiscal year 2023 of </font><font>fiscal year 2024 expenses, resulting in an equivalent expenditure reduction in fiscal year 2024.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The Financial Plan also reflects the estimated impact of fiscal year 2022 investment returns of negative 8.65% (net of </font><font>investment fees). The investment returns – lower than the assumed actuarial rate of 7.00% – increased the City’s required </font><font>pension contributions in the amounts of $861 million, $1.97 billion, and $3.02 billion in fiscal years 2024 through 2026,
</font><font>respectively. Future earnings below the assumed rate will result in contributions in excess of those assumed in the Financial </font><font>Plan.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>The Financial Plan assumes total federal
categorical grants of $12.42 billion, $9.49 billion, $8.15 billion, $7.02 billion and $7.0 </font><font>billion in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>The local law authorizing the City to sell real property tax liens expired on March 1, 2022.
However, the City continues to seek </font><font>reauthorization of such authority. The Financial Plan assumes the re-authorization of such authority in fiscal year 2023 and </font><font>assumes direct revenues to the City from such lien sales of $80 million in each of fiscal years 2023 through 2027. The
</font><font>Financial Plan further assumes that real property tax delinquencies as a percentage of the total property tax levy will equal </font><font>approximately 1.7% in fiscal years 2023 through 2027. There can be no assurance that the authorization to sell real property
</font><font>tax liens will be reinstated or that, as a result, amounts projected in the Financial Plan to be received from such sales will be </font><font>realized. In the event that the lien sale program is not re-authorized, real property tax delinquencies are expected to increase </font><font>beyond the rates assumed in the Financial Plan. Each 1% increase in delinquencies would reduce property tax revenues by
</font><font>approximately $339 million, $344 million, $347 million, $348 million and $348 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, </font><font>respectively.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The City has reached a tentative labor contract settlement with District Council 37 of AFSME (</font><font>“</font><font>DC 37</font><font>”</font><font>) for the 2021-2026 </font><font>round of collective bargaining. The tentative settlement provides for annual wage increases of 3% in
each of the first four </font><font>years of the settlement, commencing retroactively on May 26, 2021, followed by a 3.25% wage increase commencing on </font><font>May 26, 2025. The settlement also includes a $3,000 bonus to be paid at the time of ratification of the agreement. If the DC
</font><font>37 settlement is ratified by the union and the pattern of such settlement is applied to all City employees, the cost to the City </font><font>would be approximately $2.5 billion, $1.8 billion, $3.4 billion, $3.9 billion, and $4.7 billion in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, </font><font>respectively. Such costs are in excess of amounts currently included in the Financial Plan, which reflects funding for annual
</font><font>1.25% wage increases following the expiration of the labor contracts covering the 2017-2021 round of collective bargaining.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>On April 4, 2023, the Director of Management and Budget of the City issued a Program to Eliminate the Gap (</font><font>“</font><font>PEG</font><font>”</font><font>) letter to </font><font>City agencies. Citing developments that are placing a severe strain on the City’s budget, including the
costs of caring for </font><font>asylum seekers, the need to fully fund labor reserves for collective bargaining settlements and cuts and cost shifts in the </font><font>Governor’s Executive Budget, the letter established a 4% savings target in fiscal years 2024-2027 that applies to all City </font><font>agencies except the Department of Education and the City University of New York, which will be subject to a 3% savings
</font><font>target. The PEG letter states that savings initiatives may not include layoffs and should avoid meaningfully impacting services </font><font>where possible.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The City has reached a tentative labor contract settlement with the Police Benevolent Association for the period 2017-2025. </font><font>The first three years of the tentative settlement are consistent with raises other uniformed unions received in the last round
</font><font>of collective bargaining. The subsequent five years of the tentative settlement establish the framework for other uniformed </font><font>unions. If the Police Benevolent Association settlement is ratified by the union and assuming all other uniformed unions settle </font><font>on similar terms, the aggregate cost to the City would be approximately $230 million in excess of the cost the City would
</font><font>incur if the pattern established by the DC 37 settlement, which has now been ratified, were applied to all City employees. All </font><font>such costs are in excess of amounts currently reflected in the Financial Plan.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The City and the Municipal Labor Committee are proceeding with implementation of a Medicare Advantage (</font><font>“</font><font>MA</font><font>”</font><font>) plan for </font><font>City retirees by September 1, 2023. Implementation of the plan is expected to generate an estimated $600 million in annual
</font><font>savings in retiree health benefit costs. Contemporaneously with implementation of the MA plan, the City will revoke the </font><font>current Senior Care plan.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The Financial Plan does not reflect the potential costs to the City of proposals contained in
the Governor’s Executive Budget </font><font>for State fiscal year 2023-2024, which was released on February 1, 2023 (the </font><font>“</font><font>Governor’s Executive Budget</font><font>”</font><font>). The City </font><font>projects that the Governor’s Executive Budget proposals, if enacted, would be a net positive impact on the
City of $168 </font><font>million in fiscal year 2023, followed by a net negative impact on the City of $461 million and $1.34 billion in fiscal years 2024 </font><font>and 2025 respectively, the primary components of which are described below.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The Governor’s Executive Budget includes a proposal for increased City funding to the
MTA of approximately $530 million in </font><font>fiscal year 2024, with expected increases in subsequent fiscal years. The increased funding requirements include (i) </font><font>increasing the City’s share of funding of the MTA’s net paratransit operating deficit from 50% to 100% which is estimated to </font><font>cost the City $266 million in fiscal year 2024 and increasing thereafter (as discussed below, the Financial Plan does not reflect </font><font>previously enacted legislation increasing the City’s share of such deficit from 33% to 50%), (ii) requiring that the City </font><font>increase its annual payments to the MTA for reduced-fare MetroCards for City students in grades kindergarten through </font><font>twelve
(which is estimated to cost the City $105 million per fiscal year) and (iii) requiring that the City pay an amount equal </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>The Governor’s Executive Budget also includes two proposals relating to the number of
charter schools in the City, each of </font><font>which includes no additional State funding. The first such proposal would eliminate the regional cap on the number of </font><font>charter schools in the City, allowing up to 85 additional charter schools to open. The costs to the City of this proposal are
</font><font>expected to increase over time, depending on the total number of schools which open and the timing of their openings. It is </font><font>estimated that this proposal could cost the City $1 billion annually when fully phased in. The second proposal would allow
</font><font>for the re-issuance of charters for charter schools in the City that have closed since July 2015 or will close in the future. Like </font><font>the regional cap changes, the impact on the City would depend on the total number of schools that open and the timing of
</font><font>those openings. It is estimated that the proposal, if enacted, could cost the City up to $300 million per fiscal year when fully </font><font>phased in.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The
Governor’s Executive Budget also proposes instituting automatic minimum wage increases based on inflation, which </font><font>would cost the City approximately $15 million, $35 million,
$55 million, and $75 million in fiscal years 2024, 2025, 2026 and </font><font>2027, respectively. The cost to the City could be much higher depending on inflation rates and other factors.
Additionally, the </font><font>Governor has proposed ceasing to pass along federal eFMAP funding to localities, including the City. Such funding is typically </font><font>used to help localities cover the costs of Medicaid. The cost to the City of such proposal is at a minimum of $125 million in
</font><font>fiscal year 2023 and $343 million in each fiscal year thereafter. The eFMAP proposal is an administrative action which can be </font><font>implemented at the Governor’s discretion, without State legislation.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Governor’s Executive Budget also proposes changes to certain payment and review procedures which will inhibit the
</font><font>ability of health plans, including those paid for by the City, to control costs. The cost to the City is expected to be $111 million </font><font>in fiscal year 2024 and $265 million in fiscal year 2025, rising each year thereafter to result in costs of about $380 million
</font><font>annually by fiscal year 2030.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The State Budget for the State 2023 fiscal year also mandates that adoption, foster care, and
related service providers be </font><font>compensated at 100% of maximum State aid rates. Such mandate reflects the requirements of a recent lawsuit. The </font><font>legislation requires increased City funding for such services of up to $47 million in fiscal year 2023 and $118 million per fiscal </font><font>year starting in fiscal year 2024, which is not reflected in the Financial Plan.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The Financial Plan does not reflect future increases in the charter school per-pupil tuition
rate, which, if not offset by changes </font><font>to State education aid to the City that occur each year during the State budget process, are preliminarily estimated to cost </font><font>the City $81 million in fiscal year 2024, $133 million in fiscal year 2025, $313 million in fiscal year 2026 and $514 million in </font><font>fiscal year 2027. Final figures that would determine the actual costs to the City for each fiscal year will not be finalized until </font><font>the time of the State budget process applicable for such fiscal year.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Financial Plan does not reflect the potential costs from a New York State Court decision issued in July 2022 which
</font><font>increased the statutory rate per hour for court appointed counsel from of $75 per hour to $158 per hour. The City has </font><font>appealed the court’s decision. If the $158 per hour rate remains, such rate would result in increased costs to the City of </font><font>approximately $84 million per year, unless offset by funding from the State. The Governor’s Executive Budget described
</font><font>above proposes to statutorily mandate the increased $158 per hour rate, which would mandate the increased pay regardless </font><font>of the outcome of the litigation. The Governor’s Executive Budget does not include State funding for such increased pay. The </font><font>City continues to seek a change in State law to have such cost increase funded by the State.</font><font> </font></div>
</div> <div> <div><font>On October 7, 2022, the Mayor declared a State of Emergency as a result of the recent
increase in arrival of asylum seekers </font><font>from Central and South America. The arrival of the asylum seekers is placing a strain on the City’s resources. The City expects </font><font>that the crisis will cost $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2023 and $2.8 billion in fiscal year 2024. The full costs to the City of providing </font><font>services to asylum seekers during Financial Plan period is not known at this time. The Financial Plan assumes $1 billion in
</font><font>federal funds for costs related to asylum seekers in fiscal year 2023, which is subject to appropriation by the federal </font><font>government, with no funding reflected in fiscal years 2024 and beyond. The Governor’s Executive Budget proposed
</font><font>reimbursing the City for 29% of the City’s costs related to asylum seekers up to $1 billion in costs over the next two State </font><font>fiscal years. In addition, the federal government has allocated approximately $800 million for costs related to caring for
</font><font>asylum seekers to be allocated nationwide. The City is working to secure as large a portion of such funding as possible.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>The Financial Plan also does not reflect the
impact of a State requirement that the City increase its share of funding of the </font><font>MTA’s net paratransit operating deficit from 33% to 50%. The Financial Plan reflects $175
million in each of fiscal years 2023 </font><font>through 2027 to cover the City’s contributions for paratransit services compared to MTA’s estimates of such costs of $223 </font><font>million, $250 million, $264 million and $278 million in fiscal years 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. The MTA has not
</font><font>yet released an estimate for fiscal year 2027. As described above, the Governor’s Executive Budget proposes to increase the </font><font>City’s share of funding of the MTA’s net paratransit operating deficit from 50% to 100% starting in fiscal year 2024. Such </font><font>increased costs are not reflected in the Financial Plan. The Financial Plan further does not reflect full funding to cover
</font><font>projected increases in the annual operating deficit of the MTA Bus Company, which the City is obligated to fund. The </font><font>Financial Plan reflects $487 million in fiscal year 2023 and $478 million in each of fiscal years 2024 through 2027, compared
</font><font>to MTA’s estimate of such costs of $514 million, $792 million, $805 million and $819 million in fiscal years 2023 through </font><font>2026, respectively. The MTA has not released an estimate for fiscal year 2027.</font></div> <div> <div><font>The Financial Plan does not fully reflect likely future costs for pupil transportation and legally mandated tuition for special </font><font>education students unilaterally placed by their families in private school settings. The City is closely monitoring these costs </font><font>and while a number is not currently known, they are likely to be significant.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Financial Plan does not reflect the impact of a recently enacted State law which mandates certain maximum class sizes </font><font>in
public school kindergarten through twelfth grades, to be phased in over five years. It is estimated compliance will cost </font><font>approximately $1.3 billion per fiscal year when the
requirement is fully phased in. The City is seeking a change to the State </font><font>law to have it apply only to kindergarten through third grade and is also seeking State funding to cover
the cost of </font><font>compliance.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>On January 31, 2019, NYCHA, the City and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
(</font><font>“</font><font>HUD</font><font>”</font><font>) entered into an </font><font>agreement (the </font><font>“</font><font>HUD Agreement</font><font>”</font><font>) relating to lead-based paint and
other health and safety concerns in NYCHA’s properties. </font><font>The HUD Agreement established a framework by which NYCHA will continue to evaluate and progress towards compliance
</font><font>with federal requirements. Pursuant to the HUD Agreement, a federal monitor, with access to NYCHA information and
</font><font>personnel, has been appointed to oversee NYCHA’s compliance with the terms of the agreement and federal regulations. The </font><font>federal monitor has issued and will continue to issue quarterly reports on NYCHA’s compliance with the HUD Agreement.
</font><font>Also pursuant to the HUD Agreement, the City allocated $1.9 billion in capital funding in the Capital Commitment Plan for </font><font>fiscal years 2023-2027, with an additional $1.3 billion in City capital funds reflected in the remaining years of the Ten-Year
</font><font>Capital Strategy for fiscal years 2028 through 2033. NYCHA subsequently announced that it may be out of compliance with a </font><font>number of federal regulations beyond the regulations concerning lead-based paint and other health and safety concerns that
</font><font>were the subject of the HUD Agreement and is working to assess the extent of any such noncompliance. NYCHA’s 2017 </font><font>Physical Needs Assessment estimated its projected capital costs at approximately $32 billion over the next five years. In
</font><font>January 2020, NYCHA’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer stated that such costs were $40 billion. Through the Permanent </font><font>Affordability Commitment Together program, which leverages project-based Section 8 subsidy and partnerships with private </font><font>and
non-profit development partners to make repairs, NYCHA plans to recapitalize approximately 62,000 of its units. As of </font><font>January 30, 2023, NYCHA and development partners completed
renovations on 5,830 apartments, are actively repairing </font><font>another 10,153 apartments, and are in predevelopment for an additional 20,120 apartments. In June 2022, the State enacted
</font><font>legislation creating the New York City Housing Preservation Trust, which will leverage federal funding to borrow money for </font><font>the improvement of an additional approximately 25,000 public housing units. The New York City Housing Preservation Trust </font><font>is
not funded by the City and is not reflected in the Financial Plan.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>NYCHA’s rent collection rate, which has historically been approximately 90%, is currently approximately 65%. As a result, </font><font>NYCHA is projecting a substantial reduction in rent revenues in calendar year 2023. This reduction in NYCHA’s revenues has </font><font>required that NYCHA rely on its reserves to cover expenses, eliminate budgeted vacancies, and reduce nonessential
</font><font>contracting. While this projected shortfall does not directly impact the City’s budget, if NYCHA’s revenues do not recover, the </font><font>City could be asked to increase its funding to NYCHA.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In fiscal years 2022 and 2023, the City appropriated a total of $69 million for a program to support the restructuring of loans </font><font>to the owners of up to 4,000 taxi medallions to terms that are more affordable to the medallion owners. The $69 million
</font><font>appropriation supplemented a previously paid grant from the City of $65 million for the same purpose. The funds will be </font><font>used by the program administrator to cover shortfalls in amounts owed by taxi medallion owners on defaulted restructured
</font><font>loans to the extent such shortfall is not covered by the proceeds from the sale of the related medallions. In addition, the City </font><font>has undertaken, subject to appropriation, to make available additional funding in the future if necessary to cover defaulted
</font><font>loans. The Financial Plan does not include any additional funding for the program. To date, approximately 1,800 loans have </font></div> </div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>been restructured under the program, reducing the
principal on the restructured loans by a total of approximately $350 </font><font>million. Based on the expected maximum restructured loan amount and current market conditions affecting the
sale of </font><font>medallions, the shortfall of each defaulted loan after the application of the sale proceeds of the associated medallion could </font><font>be up to $60,000. Such amount is expected to vary based on future market conditions.</font></div> <div> <div><font>State legislation provides for congestion tolling for vehicles entering a designated congestion zone in Manhattan below 60th
</font><font>Street, the revenues from which will be directed to the MTA for transit improvements. Details of the plan, including pricing, </font><font>have yet to be determined, but it is currently expected that the start date will occur in 2024.</font><font>
</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The New York City Advisory Commission on Property Tax Reform was
established in 2018 to consider changes to the City’s </font><font>property taxation system, without reducing property tax revenues to the City. The commission released its report in
</font><font>December 2021 with recommendations which, among other things, would align the taxable value of certain properties more </font><font>closely with market value. The commission’s recommendations, which have not yet been acted upon, would require State
</font><font>legislation if they were to be implemented.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The City is experiencing an increased level of employee vacancies across its agencies, reflecting a nationwide trend impacting
</font><font>both the private and public sectors. As part of its spending-reduction initiatives, on November 21, 2022, the City announced a </font><font>vacancy reduction target of reducing agency vacancies by fifty percent of the number of unfilled vacancies as of October 31,
</font><font>2022. The vacancy reduction initiative does not apply to health and safety positions, uniform employees, teachers, and </font><font>certain other employees. The implementation of the vacancy reduction initiative has reduced the number of vacancies </font><font>Citywide
by approximately 4,300 employees.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>From time to time, the City
Comptroller, the Control Board staff, the Office of the State Deputy Comptroller for the City of </font><font>New York
(</font><font>“</font><font>OSDC</font><font>”</font><font>), the Independent Budget Office (</font><font>“</font><font>IBO</font><font>”</font><font>) and others issue reports and make public statements regarding </font><font>the City’s financial condition, commenting on, among other matters, the City’s financial plans, projected revenues and </font><font>expenditures and actions by the City to eliminate projected operating deficits. It is reasonable to expect that reports and
</font><font>statements will continue to be issued and may contain different perspectives on the City’s budget and economy and may </font><font>engender public comment.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>COVID-19</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The City has been severely affected by the coronavirus disease, referred to herein as </font><font>“</font><font>COVID-19.</font><font>”</font><font> A state of emergency </font><font>remained in effect for the City through May 31, 2023, and may be extended. A state of emergency declared by the State
</font><font>expired on September 13, 2022. During periods of the COVID-19 pandemic, many businesses in the City were ordered to </font><font>close, public schools moved to remote learning, limitations were imposed on large gatherings, and certain vaccination
</font><font>requirements and mask mandates were put in place.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The reduction in business activity, travel and tourism resulting from the pandemic had a severe impact on the City’s retail, </font><font>cultural, hospitality and entertainment sectors. Hotel occupancy declined drastically, as did arrivals to City airports. As a
</font><font>result of the COVID-19 pandemic, unemployment rates throughout the City increased substantially and currently remain </font><font>above pre-pandemic levels. To date, the City has recovered approximately 90% of jobs lost during the pandemic. Certain real
</font><font>estate sectors have sustained losses as a result of the business distress caused by COVID-19. Higher unemployment as well </font><font>as increased numbers of employees working from home due to the pandemic have stressed the City’s office market. The
</font><font>pandemic has also reduced income for retail stores and hotels. Property tax revenues declined in fiscal year 2022 from the </font><font>pandemic impact but rebounded in fiscal year 2023. Growth is projected to average 0.6 percent from fiscal years 2024 </font><font>through
2027. The pandemic has also resulted in a decline in the City’s estimated population. The United States Census </font><font>Bureau estimates the City’s population to be 8,467,513 as
of July 2021, which shows a decline of 336,677 City residents as </font><font>compared to the 2020 Census.</font><font>
</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Uncertainties remain for commercial office markets as future demand may
depend on decisions of major office tenants </font><font>regarding density, remote work and relocation of operations out of the City. Personal income tax revenue projections could be </font><font>negatively affected by changes in employment and earnings including, but not limited to, (i) changes in residency status
</font><font>resulting from remote work, (ii) permanent relocation outside the City of individuals with high incomes (the highest 1% of </font><font>earners accounted for approximately 43% of total personal income tax revenues in calendar year 2020), or (iii) other
</font><font>employment-related changes. In addition, sales tax revenue projections could be negatively impacted by future reductions in </font><font>economic activity.</font><font> </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>The future course of the pandemic is uncertain and
will be determined by many factors, including vaccination rates, the </font><font>effectiveness of vaccines in preventing infections, hospitalizations and deaths, adherence to public health
mitigation </font><font>measures (including masks and social distancing) and the emergence of new virus variants. There can be no assurance that </font><font>the City will not experience future surges or that rates of cases, hospitalizations and deaths will not increase significantly in </font><font>the future. There can be no assurances as to what further impacts the pandemic may have on the City’s population and
</font><font>economy or that new pandemic-related restrictions will not be imposed in the future. An outbreak of disease or public health </font><font>emergency, including a resurgence of COVID-19, could have an adverse impact on the City’s population and economy and
</font><font>may result in revenues to the City that are lower than projected herein.</font><font> </font></div>
<div> <div><font>Assumptions</font><font>. The Financial Plan is based on numerous assumptions, including the condition of the City’s and the region’s
</font><font>economies and the concomitant receipt of economically sensitive tax revenues in the amounts projected. The Financial Plan </font><font>assumes no economic recession during the years of the Financial Plan. The Financial Plan is subject to various other
</font><font>uncertainties and contingencies relating to, among other factors, the extent, if any, to which wage increases for City </font><font>employees exceed the annual wage costs assumed; realization of projected earnings for pension fund assets and current
</font><font>assumptions with respect to wages for City employees affecting the City’s required pension fund contributions; the </font><font>willingness and ability of the State to provide the aid contemplated by the Financial Plan and to take various other actions to </font><font>assist the City; the ability of New York City Health and Hospitals (</font><font>“</font><font>NYCHH</font><font>”</font><font>) and other such entities to maintain
balanced </font><font>budgets; the willingness of the federal government to provide the amount of federal aid contemplated in the Financial Plan; </font><font>the impact on City revenues and expenditures of federal and State legislation affecting Medicare or other entitlement
</font><font>programs; adoption of the City’s budgets by the City Council in substantially the forms submitted by the Mayor; the ability of </font><font>the City to implement cost reduction initiatives, and the success with which the City controls expenditures; the impact of
</font><font>conditions in the real estate market on real estate tax revenues; the ability of the City and other financing entities to market </font><font>their securities successfully in the public credit markets; the impact of the outbreak of COVID-19; and the extension of the
</font><font>authorization to sell real property tax liens. See </font><font>“</font><font>Certain Reports</font><font>”</font><font> herein.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The projections and assumptions contained in the Financial Plan are subject to revision,
which may be substantial. No </font><font>assurance can be given that these estimates and projections, which include actions the City expects will be taken but are not </font><font>within the City’s control, will be realized.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Revenue Assumptions</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>General Economic Conditions</font><font>. The Financial Plan assumes an increase in economic activity in calendar year 2022 </font><font>compared to calendar year 2021.</font>
<br/></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Real Estate Tax</font><font>. Projections of real estate tax revenues are based on a number of assumptions, including, among others, </font><font>assumptions
relating to the tax rate, the assessed valuation of the City’s taxable real estate, the delinquency rate, debt </font><font>service needs, a reserve for uncollectible taxes, the operating
limit and the impact of the outbreak of COVID-19. Real </font><font>Estate Tax revenue projections for fiscal years 2023 through 2026 reflect certain City tax programs proposed by the </font><font>Mayor and adopted by the New York State legislature. The adoption of such proposals is estimated to reduce real estate </font><font>tax
revenues by $25 million per fiscal year, starting in fiscal year 2023.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Projections of real estate tax revenues include net revenues from the sale
of real property tax liens of $80 million in fiscal </font><font>years 2023 through 2027. Projections of real estate tax revenues include the effects of the STAR Program which will </font><font>reduce the real estate tax revenues by an estimated $144 million, $142 million, $140 million, $138 million and $138 </font><font>million
in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively. Projections of real estate tax revenues reflect the estimated cost of </font><font>extending the current tax reduction for owners of cooperative
and condominium apartments amounting to $668 </font><font>million, $671 million, $677 million, $684 million and $684 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The delinquency rate was 1.2% in fiscal year 2018, 1.2% in fiscal year 2019,
1.8% in fiscal year 2020, 2.0% in fiscal year </font><font>2021 and 1.8% in fiscal year 2022. The Financial Plan projects delinquency rates of 1.8% in fiscal year 2023, 1.6% in </font><font>fiscal year 2024 and 1.7% in each of fiscal years 2025 through 2027.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>On April 24, 2017, a lawsuit was filed challenging the City’s real property tax system and valuation methodology. The </font><font>action alleges that the City’s real property tax system violates the State and federal constitutions as well as the Fair
</font><font>Housing Act. The action further alleges the valuation methodology as mandated by certain provisions of the State Real </font><font>Property Tax Law results in a disparity and inequality in the amount of taxes paid by Black and Hispanic Class 1 property
</font><font>owners and renters. The Appellate Division, First Department granted the City’s motion to dismiss and dismissed all </font><font>claims against the City. In September 2020, the New York Court of Appeals dismissed the plaintiff’s purported appeal as
</font><font>of right of the First Department rulings. On August 9, 2021, the plaintiff filed, in the Appellate Division, a motion for leave </font></div> </div> </div>

<div> <div><font>to appeal and on August 20, 2021,
the City filed a response in opposition thereto. The Appellate Division denied the </font><font>plaintiff’s motion for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals. On December 1, 2021 the
plaintiff served and filed a motion </font><font>seeking leave to appeal directly from the Court of Appeals. The City and State submitted their respective opposition </font><font>papers. On April 28, 2022, the Court of Appeals granted the plaintiff’s motion for leave to appeal. Plaintiff filed an appeal </font><font>brief on July 27, 2022. Response briefs from the City and State were filed on December 12, 2022. The plaintiff’s reply brief </font><font>was filed on March 3, 2023.</font> <br/></div> <div> <div><font>Other Taxes</font><font>. The Financial Plan reflects the following assumptions regarding projected baseline revenues
from Other </font><font>Taxes: (i) with respect to the personal income tax, declines in fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2024 revenues reflecting a </font><font>drop in Wall Street profits from the high levels seen in the prior years, moderate growth from fiscal years 2025 through
</font><font>2027 as Wall Street profits revert back to historical averages; (ii) with respect to the business corporation tax, decline in </font><font>revenues in fiscal years 2023 and fiscal year 2024 reflecting economic headwinds from a weakened outlook for Wall </font><font>Street
profits followed by moderate growth in fiscal years 2025 through 2027; (iii) with respect to the unincorporated </font><font>business income tax, a decline in fiscal year 2023 reflecting a
weaker Wall Street performance, a weaker growth in fiscal </font><font>year 2024 reflecting slower economic growth and a return to moderate growth in fiscal years 2025 through 2027; (iv)
</font><font>with respect to the sales tax, strong growth in fiscal year 2023 from strong consumer spending along with robust
</font><font>growth in the tourism, hospitality and entertainment industries, growth moderates in fiscal years 2024 through 2027; (v) </font><font>with respect to the real property transfer tax, a decline in fiscal year 2023 from a slow-down in residential activity
</font><font>reflecting the impact of rising interest rates and stalled commercial transactions, growth returns from fiscal years 2024 </font><font>to 2027 reflecting steady economic growth; (vi) with respect to the mortgage recording tax, declines in fiscal year 2023 </font><font>and
2024 as the impact from the higher interest rates reverberates through the residential and commercial markets </font><font>before growth returns to the long-term trend in fiscal years 2025
through 2027 reflecting steady economic growth; and </font><font>(vii) with respect to the commercial rent tax, a decline in fiscal year 2023 reflecting high vacancy rates for commercial
</font><font>office space in Manhattan and flat growth from fiscal years 2024 through 2027, as uncertainties remain about office </font><font>space use.</font> <br/></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Miscellaneous Revenues</font><font>. The Financial Plan reflects collections from Miscellaneous Revenues in the amounts
of </font><font>approximately $8.0 billion in fiscal year 2023, $7.5 billion in fiscal year 2024, $7.4 billion in fiscal year 2025 and $7.3 billion </font><font>in each of fiscal years 2026 and 2027.</font> <br/></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Intergovernmental Aid</font><font>. The Financial Plan assumes that all existing federal and State categorical grant
programs will </font><font>continue, unless specific legislation provides for their termination or adjustment, and assumes increases in aid where </font><font>increased costs are projected for existing grant programs.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>As of January 31, 2023, approximately 17.4% of the City’s full-time and full-time equivalent employees (consisting of

</font><font>and from other sources not funded by unrestricted revenues of the City.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>A major component of federal categorical aid to the City is the Community Development program. Pursuant to federal </font><font>legislation, Community Development grants are provided to cities primarily to aid low and moderate income persons by
</font><font>improving housing facilities, parks and other improvements, by providing certain social programs and by promoting
</font><font>economic development. These grants are based on a formula that takes into consideration such factors as population, </font><font>age of housing and poverty.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The City’s receipt of categorical aid is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain statutory conditions and is subject to </font><font>subsequent audits, possible disallowances and possible prior claims by the State or federal governments. The general
</font><font>practice of the State and federal governments has been to deduct the amount of any disallowances against the current </font><font>year’s payment, although in some cases the City remits payment for disallowed amounts to the grantor. Substantial
</font><font>disallowances of aid claims may be asserted during the course of the Financial Plan. The City estimates probable
</font><font>amounts of disallowances of recognized grant revenues and makes the appropriate adjustments to recognized grant
</font><font>revenue for each fiscal year. The amounts of such downward adjustments to revenue for disallowances attributable to </font><font>prior years increased from $124 million in the 1977 fiscal year to $542 million in the 2006 fiscal year. The amounts of </font><font>such
disallowances were $103 million and $114 million in fiscal years 2007 and 2008, respectively. There were no </font><font>adjustments for estimated disallowances in fiscal years 2009 and 2010.
In fiscal year 2011, the downward adjustment for </font><font>disallowances was $113 million and in fiscal year 2012 an upward adjustment of $166 million was made, reflecting a </font><font>reduced estimate of disallowances attributable to prior years as of June 30, 2012. In fiscal years 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016,
</font><font>2020 and 2021, downward adjustments of $59 million, $19 million, $110 million, $1 million, $5 million and $24 million, </font><font>respectively, were made. In fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019, upward adjustments of $558 million, $139 million and $113 </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

In fiscal year 2022 a downward adjustment of $35 million was made. As of June 30, </font><font>2022, the City had an accumulated reserve of $318 million for all disallowances of categorical
aid.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Expenditure Assumptions</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Personal Service Costs</font><font>. The Financial Plan projects that the authorized number of City-funded full-time and
full-time </font><font>equivalent employees will decrease from an estimated level of 268,268 as of June 30, 2023 to an estimated level of </font><font>267,409 by June 30, 2027.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Financial Plan does not reflect the full costs of the recent tentative labor settlement with DC 37. If the DC 37
</font><font>settlement is ratified by the union and the pattern of such settlement is applied to all City employees, the cost to the City </font><font>would be approximately $2.5 billion, $1.8 billion, $3.4 billion, $3.9 billion, and $4.7 billion in fiscal years 2023 through
</font><font>2027, respectively. Such costs are in excess of amounts currently included in the Financial Plan, which reflects funding </font><font>for annual 1.25% wage increases following the expiration of the labor contracts covering the previous 2017-2021 round </font><font>of
collective bargaining. </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Other Than
Personal Services (</font><font>“</font><font>OTPS</font><font>”</font><font>).</font> <br/><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Administrative OTPS and Energy</font><font>. The Financial Plan contains estimates of the City’s administrative
OTPS expenditures </font><font>for general supplies and materials, equipment and selected contractual services, and the impact of agency gap-closing </font><font>actions relating to such expenditures in the 2023 fiscal year. Thereafter, OTPS administrative expenditures are projected </font><font>to
remain the same in fiscal years 2024 through 2027. Energy costs for each of the 2023 through 2027 fiscal years are </font><font>assumed to vary annually, with total energy expenditures
projected at $1.18 billion in fiscal year 2023 and increasing to </font><font>$1.21 billion by fiscal year 2027.</font> <br/></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Public Assistance</font><font>. Of total cash assistance expenditures in the City, the City-funded portion is projected to be $819 </font><font>million in fiscal year
2023, $891 million in each of fiscal years 2024 through 2026, and $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2027.</font> <br/></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Medical Assistance</font><font>. Medical assistance payments projected in the Financial Plan consist of payments to
voluntary </font><font>hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, intermediate care facilities, home care providers, pharmacies, managed care </font><font>organizations, physicians and other medical practitioners. The City-funded portion of medical assistance payments is
</font><font>expected to be $6.45 billion in fiscal year 2023, $6.3 billion in each of fiscal years 2024 through 2026 and $6.4 billion in </font><font>fiscal year 2027. Such payments include the City’s capped share of local Medicaid expenditures as well as Supplemental
</font><font>Medicaid payments to NYCHH.</font> <br/></div> </div> <div> <div><font>New York City Health and Hospitals</font><font>. NYCHH, which provides essential services to over 1.1 million New
Yorkers annually, </font><font>faces near- and long-term financial challenges resulting from, among other things, changes in hospital reimbursement </font><font>under the Affordable Care Act and the statewide transition to managed care. On April 26, 2016, the City released
</font><font>“</font><font>One </font><font>New York: Health Care for Our
Neighborhoods,</font><font>”</font><font> a report outlining the City’s plan to address NYCHH’s financial
shortfall.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In February 2023, NYCHH released a cash-based
financial plan, which projected City-funded expenditures of $1.6 billion </font><font>in fiscal year 2023, $913 million in fiscal year 2024, $910 million in fiscal year 2025 and $874 million in
each of fiscal years </font><font>2026 and 2027, in addition to the forgiveness of debt service for fiscal years 2023 through 2027 and the City’s </font><font>contribution to supplemental Medicaid payments which is consistent with the City’s Financial Plan. NYCHH’s financial </font><font>plan projected total receipts of $10.5 billion, $9.3 billion, $9.4 billion, $9.2 billion and $9.3 billion, and total
</font><font>disbursements of $10.7 billion, $9.84 billion, $9.3 billion, $9.5 billion and $9.6 billion in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, </font><font>respectively.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>NYCHH relies on significant projected revenue from Medicaid, Medicare and other third-party payor programs. Future </font><font>changes
to such programs could have adverse impacts on NYCHH’s financial condition.</font> <br/></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Other</font><font>. The projections set forth in the Financial Plan for OTPS-Other include the City’s
contributions to New York City </font><font>Transit (</font><font>“</font><font>NYCT</font><font>”</font><font>), NYCHA, City University of New York
(</font><font>“</font><font>CUNY</font><font>”</font><font>) and subsidies to libraries and various cultural </font><font>institutions. They also include projections for the cost of future
judgments and claims, which are discussed below under </font><font>“</font><font>Judgments and Claims.</font><font>”</font><font> In the past, the City has provided additional assistance to certain State governmental agencies, </font><font>public authorities or public benefit corporations which receive or may receive monies from the City directly, indirectly or
</font><font>contingently (</font><font>“</font><font>Covered
Organizations</font><font>”</font><font>) that had exhausted their financial resources prior to the end of the fiscal year No
</font><font>assurance can be given that similar additional assistance will not be required in the future.</font> <br/></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>New York City Transit</font><font>. NYCT operates under its own section of the Financial Plan as a Covered Organization. An accrual-based</font><font> financial plan for
NYCT covering its 2023 through 2026 fiscal years was published in February 2023 (the </font><font>“</font><font>2023 </font><font>NYCT Financial Plan</font><font>”</font><font>). The NYCT fiscal year

<div> <div><font>Plan reflects City assistance to
the NYCT operating budget of $464.7 million in 2023, increasing to $508.2 million in </font><font>2026. In addition, the 2023 NYCT Financial Plan projects real estate transfer tax revenue
dedicated for NYCT use of </font><font>$533.1 million in 2023, which is lower than the $777.3 million of such revenue that was received in 2022; that amount </font><font>increases each year to reach $631.7 million by 2026. The 2023 NYCT Financial Plan includes decreased expected farebox
</font><font>revenue based on projected lower ridership. The 2023 NYCT Financial Plan reflects $11.6 billion in revenues and $15.4 </font><font>billion in expenses for 2023, leaving a budget gap of $3.8 billion. After accounting for accrual adjustments and cash
</font><font>carried over from 2022, there are projected operating budget gaps of $0.4 billion in 2023, $2.5 billion in 2024, $4.8 billion </font><font>in 2025 and $7.2 billion in 2026. These figures reflect the receipt of $7 billion in federal aid from the American Rescue
</font><font>Plan Act (ARPA), which is being used to partially offset the outyear deficits.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>In 2009, a Payroll Mobility Tax (</font><font>“</font><font>PMT</font><font>”</font><font>) was enacted into State law to provide $0.34
for every $100 of payroll in the MTA’s </font><font>twelve-county service area. The PMT is currently expected to generate revenues for NYCT in the amount of $947 million </font><font>in 2023, decreasing to $622 million in 2026.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The MTA faces serious budget shortfalls from historic declines in fare and tax revenues due to the COVID-19 pandemic </font><font>and its
effects on the region. Federal aid, fare increases and operational efficiencies will allow the MTA to substantially </font><font>reduce over $3 billion in annual out-year deficits to roughly
$0.6 billion in 2023, $1.2 billion in 2024, $1.2 billion in 2025, </font><font>and $1.6 billion in 2026. The City's payments to the MTA remain dependent on future uncertainties such as
additional </font><font>federal funding, ridership trends, and service adjustments.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The 2015-2019 Capital Program currently includes $33.9 billion for all MTA
agencies, including $16.7 billion to be </font><font>invested in the NYCT core system and $1.7 billion for NYCT network expansion.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The State has agreed to contribute $9.1 billion towards the 2015-2019
Capital Program. The City has agreed to </font><font>contribute $2.656 billion. Of the City’s contribution, $2.056 billion has been reflected in the City’s Capital Commitment
</font><font>Plan, including $164.0 million for the Subway Action Plan. The remaining $600.0 million will come from joint ventures, </font><font>such as development deals, which will not flow through the City budget.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>On September 19, 2019, the MTA released its 2020-2024 Capital Program, which took effect by default in January 2020. </font><font>After amendment, the program includes $55.4 billion for all MTA agencies, including $34.6 billion to be invested in the </font><font>NYCT
core system and $4.6 billion in NYCT network expansion. The entire 2020-2024 Capital Program was placed on </font><font>hold in 2020 but resumed upon the announcement of $6.5 billion in federal
aid in the ARPA in March of 2021. The </font><font>program was amended twice from its original $54.8 billion total, once in December 2021 and once in July 2022.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Legislation adopted in 2019 includes the enactment of congestion tolling for
vehicles entering a designated congestion </font><font>zone in Manhattan below 60th Street, the revenues from which will be directed to the MTA for transit improvements. In </font><font>August 2022 the MTA convened the Traffic Mobility Review Board, which will oversee congestion pricing and determine </font><font>exact
toll rates. The 2023 NYCT Financial Plan anticipates that the MTA will begin receiving revenue from congestion </font><font>tolling in the second quarter of 2024. MTA expects to receive $750
million of revenue in 2024 and $1 billion per year </font><font>thereafter.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>In addition, the State 2020 Budget included legislation authorizing the
imposition of sales tax on certain additional </font><font>internet sales and providing that City sales tax revenues in the amount of $127.5 million in State fiscal year 2020 </font><font>(reflecting the portion of the year in which it is effective) and $170 million in State fiscal year 2021 and thereafter
</font><font>increasing by one percent per year, will be directed to the MTA for transit improvements. Revenues from such additional </font><font>sales tax are currently estimated to be approximately $170 million per year and are in addition to existing sales taxes
</font><font>attributable to certain other internet transactions. Additionally, such legislation provided that State sales tax revenues in </font><font>the amount of $112.5 million in State fiscal year 2020 and $150 million in State fiscal year 2021 and thereafter increasing
</font><font>by one percent per year, will be directed to the MTA for transit improvements. The State 2020 Budget also included </font><font>legislation increasing real estate transfer taxes on properties valued at more than $2 million, which will also be directed
</font><font>to the MTA for transit improvements.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The State 2021 Budget requires the City to contribute $3 billion towards the 2020-2024 Capital Program concurrent with </font><font>the
State’s $3 billion contribution. Neither the City nor the State can use operating funds dedicated to the MTA to </font><font>supplant their capital commitment and must pay on a schedule
determined by the State Budget Director. The City has </font><font>appropriated this $3 billion and this is anticipated to be spent within the Preliminary Ten-Year Capital
Strategy.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The State 2021 Budget included a requirement
that the City increase its funding of the MTA’s net paratransit operating </font><font>deficit from 33% to 50%. The City’s Financial Plan reflects $175 million in each of fiscal
years 2023 through 2027 to </font><font>cover the City’s contributions for paratransit services, compared to MTA’s estimates of $223 million, $250 million, $264 </font><font>million and $278 million in fiscal years 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively.

<div> <div><font>for fiscal year 2027. Spending on
paratransit is significantly impacted by ridership levels, and it is unknown what the </font><font>long-term impacts of COVID-19 will be on usage. The City will continue to monitor the
anticipated paratransit costs for </font><font>future years.</font> <br/><font> </font></div>
<div> <div><font>Department of Education</font><font>. State law requires the City to provide City funds for the Department of Education (</font><font>“</font><font>DOE</font><font>”</font><font>) </font><font>each year in an amount not less than the amount appropriated for the preceding fiscal year, excluding amounts for debt
</font><font>service and pensions for the DOE. Such City funding must be maintained, unless total City funds for the fiscal year are </font><font>estimated to be lower than in the preceding fiscal year, in which case the mandated City funding for the DOE may be </font><font>reduced
by an amount up to the percentage reduction in total City funds.</font> <br/></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Judgments and Claims</font><font>. In the fiscal year ended on June 30, 2022, the City expended $1.2 billion for
judgments and </font><font>claims, compared to $617.9 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. The increase in judgments and claims paid in </font><font>fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 reflect, in part, payments made relating to a class action lawsuit against the
</font><font>Board of Education. The Financial Plan includes provisions for judgments and claims of $1.2 billion, $1.2 billion, $877.2 </font><font>million, $823.2 million and $840.2 million for the 2023 through 2027 fiscal years, respectively. These projections
</font><font>incorporate a substantial amount of claims costs attributed to NYCHH, estimated to be $140 million in each year of the </font><font>Financial Plan, for which NYCHH reimburses the City unless otherwise forgiven by the City, which was the case in fiscal
</font><font>years 2013 and 2016. The City is a party to numerous lawsuits and is the subject of numerous claims and investigations. </font><font>The City has estimated that its potential future liability on account of outstanding claims against it as of June 30, 2022
</font><font>amounted to approximately $7.2 billion. This estimate was made by categorizing the various claims and applying a
</font><font>statistical model, based primarily on actual settlements by type of claim during the preceding ten fiscal years, and by </font><font>supplementing the estimated liability with information supplied by the City’s Corporation Counsel.</font><font>
</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In addition to the above claims, numerous real estate
tax certiorari proceedings involving allegations of inequality of </font><font>assessment, illegality and overvaluation are currently pending against the City. The City’s Financial
Statements for the </font><font>fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 include an estimate that the City’s liability in the certiorari proceedings, as of June 30, </font><font>2022, could amount to approximately $1.34 billion. Provision has been made in the Financial Plan for estimated refunds </font><font>of
$500 million in fiscal year 2023 and $400 million in each of fiscal years 2024 through 2027. </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>General Obligation, Lease and TFA Debt Service</font><font>. Debt service estimates for fiscal years 2023 through 2027
include debt </font><font>service on outstanding general obligation bonds and conduit debt, and the funding requirements associated with </font><font>outstanding TFA Future Tax Secured Bonds, and estimates of debt service costs of, or funding requirements associated </font><font>with,
future general obligation, conduit and TFA Future Tax Secured debt issuances based on projected future market </font><font>conditions. Such debt service estimates also include estimated
payments pursuant to interest rate exchange agreements </font><font>but do not reflect receipts pursuant to such agreements.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>In July 2009, the State amended the New York City Transitional Finance
Authority Act to expand the borrowing capacity </font><font>of the TFA by providing that it may have outstanding $13.5 billion of Future Tax Secured Bonds (excluding Recovery </font><font>Bonds) and may issue additional Future Tax Secured Bonds provided that the amount of such additional bonds, together </font><font>with
the amount of indebtedness contracted by the City, does not exceed the debt limit of the City. The City currently </font><font>expects to continue to finance approximately half of its capital
program through the TFA, exclusive of Department of </font><font>Environmental Protection (</font><font>“</font><font>DEP</font><font>”</font><font>) capital budget items financed by the Water
Authority.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Financial Plan reflects general
obligation debt service of $4.21 billion, $4.43 billion, $4.60 billion, $4.85 billion and </font><font>$5.04 billion in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively, conduit debt service of
$147 million, $118 million, $117 </font><font>million, $116 million and $115 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively, and TFA debt service of $3.30 </font><font>billion, $3.35 billion, $3.63 billion, $4.14 billion and $4.61 billion in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively, in each </font><font>case prior to giving effect to prepayments. Such debt service requirements are projected to be below 15% of projected </font><font>City
tax revenues for each year of the Financial Plan. </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Environmental Matters</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The City has more than 500 miles of coastline, bordering the Atlantic Ocean as well as rivers, bays, and inlets. Two of its five </font><font>Boroughs, Manhattan and Staten Island, are islands and water forms the principal boundary of the remaining three. As a
</font><font>result, the City is directly affected by rising sea levels and exposed to intensifying coastal storms.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Storms</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>On Monday, October 29, 2012, Sandy hit the Mid-Atlantic East Coast. The storm caused

<div> <div><font>On January 29, 2013, President Obama signed
legislation providing for approximately $50.5 billion in storm-related aid for the </font><font>region affected by the storm. Although it is not possible for the City to quantify the full,
long-term impact of the storm on the </font><font>City and its economy, the current estimate of the direct costs to the City, NYCHH and NYCHA is approximately $10.7 billion </font><font>(comprised of approximately $1.8 billion of expense costs and approximately $8.9 billion of capital project costs). Such direct </font><font>costs represent funding for emergency response, debris removal, emergency protective measures, repair of damaged
</font><font>infrastructure and long-term hazard mitigation investments. In addition to such direct costs, the City is delivering Sandy-related</font><font> disaster recovery assistance services, benefiting impacted communities, businesses, homeowners and renters </font><font>(</font><font>“</font><font>Community Costs</font><font>”</font><font>). The City anticipates that funding for Community Costs will be primarily reimbursed with federal funds. </font><font>However, the City
is responsible for $134 million of such Community Costs, which are reflected in the Financial Plan. In </font><font>addition, the City may be responsible for up to approximately $150 million of
additional Community Costs, which are not </font><font>reflected in the Financial Plan.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>The Financial Plan assumes that the direct costs described above will largely be paid from non-City sources, primarily the </font><font>federal government, and that the Community Costs described above will be primarily reimbursed by federal funds. The City
</font><font>expects reimbursements to come from two separate federal sources of funding, FEMA and HUD. The City has secured
</font><font>approximately $10.7 billion in FEMA assistance and other federal emergency response grants (</font><font>“</font><font>FEMA Funding</font><font>”</font><font>). The </font><font>maximum reimbursement rate from FEMA is 90% of total costs. Other federal emergency response grants may have larger </font><font>local
share percentages. The City expects to use $720 million of Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery </font><font>funding allocated by HUD to meet the local share requirements of the
FEMA funding, as well as recovery work not funded by </font><font>FEMA or other federal sources. This allocation would be available to fill gaps in such FEMA funding. As of June 30, 2022, the
</font><font>City, NYCHH and NYCHA have received $4.5 billion in reimbursements from FEMA for the direct costs described above. In </font><font>addition to the FEMA Funding described above, HUD has made available over $4.4 billion for Community Costs, of which
</font><font>approximately $3.8 billion has been received through June 30, 2022. No assurance can be given that the City will be </font><font>reimbursed for all of its costs or that such reimbursements will be received within the time periods assumed in the Financial
</font><font>Plan. There is no assurance, if the City were to experience a similar storm in the future, that non-City sources, including the </font><font>federal government, would pay the costs.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>On September 1, 2021, Hurricane Ida hit the Mid-Atlantic East Coast as a post-tropical cyclone (</font><font>“</font><font>Ida</font><font>”</font><font>), bringing significant </font><font>rainfall and resulting in severe flooding in parts of the City, including inland areas. Rainfall from Ida exceeded the previous </font><font>record for the most single-hour rainfall in the City and for the first time the National Weather Service declared a flash flood </font><font>emergency in the City. Ida resulted in the deaths of 13 people in the City, 11 of which occurred in basement housing units. On
</font><font>September 3, 2021, former Mayor de Blasio announced a climate-driven rain response plan, which includes developing </font><font>improved storm warning systems and the creation of the Extreme Weather Response Taskforce composed of representatives </font><font>from
several different City agencies, including DEP, the Department of Transportation, Emergency Management and the </font><font>Department of Sanitation. On September 27, 2021, the taskforce
released its report, The New Normal: Combating Storm-Related</font><font> Extreme Weather in New York City. The report’s recommendations, among others, include (i) improvements to </font><font>emergency preparedness and response, (ii) protecting occupants of basement apartments and (iii) expediting both short-term</font><font>
and long-term investments in infrastructure, including sewers and prevention of flooding in inland communities. The </font><font>total costs of implementing all of the report’s
recommendations would be substantial and in some cases would require State </font><font>and federal funding. In response to the report, in October 2021, the City added approximately $2 billion
to its capital plan to </font><font>support the report’s recommendations, most of which is in DEP’s capital budget to be funded by the City’s water and sewer </font><font>system through bonds issued by the City’s Water Authority. Such additional funding continues to be reflected in the
</font><font>Preliminary Ten-Year Capital Strategy. The City continues to review the effects of climate change, including increased climate </font><font>drive rain. The extent to which funding to cover recommendations put forth by the report will be available from State or
</font><font>federal sources is not known at this time.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Climate Change</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Since 2007, the City has been engaged in strategic planning for climate change, recognizing the challenges it presents for City </font><font>operations and infrastructure. Among other things, the City created the New York City Panel on Climate Change (the
</font><font>“</font><font>NPCC</font><font>”</font><font>), a body of more than a dozen leading independent climate and social scientists. Since 2008, NPCC has analyzed </font><font>climate
trends, developed projections, explored key impacts, issued reports (the </font><font>“</font><font>NPCC Reports</font><font>”</font><font>) and advised on response </font><font>strategies for the
City. The NPCC has determined that the City is already experiencing the impacts of climate change and </font><font>projects dramatic impacts on the City in the future. Climate change is causing
more extreme heat, extreme rainfall, coastal </font><font>storm surge, and chronic tidal flooding. NPCC projections form the basis for the City’s climate resiliency planning, which

<div> <div><font>involves coordination and cooperation among
multiple public and private stakeholders, and expansion of ongoing </font><font>maintenance and development of municipal infrastructure as well as specific initiatives such as those described
below.</font><font> </font></div> <div> <div><font>Building on NPCC’s recommendations and the City’s strategic planning, the City is in the process of implementing
</font><font>infrastructure projects to protect the City from the effects of extreme rainfall, addressing some of the risks identified in the </font><font>NPCC Reports. In addition, the City is pursuing heat mitigation strategies. These projects and initiatives are in various stages </font><font>of feasibility review, design and construction and implementation. Funding for these projects is expected to come from City,
</font><font>State and federal sources. Some projects are expected to require additional funding to the extent that they are in the planning </font><font>stages or current funding does not provide for the costs of construction.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Several major coastal resiliency projects are currently underway throughout the City, including the East Side Coastal
</font><font>Resiliency Project (</font><font>“</font><font>ESCR</font><font>”</font><font>). ESCR, which broke ground in 2021, is an integrated coastal flood protection system which will </font><font>create resilient open spaces and improve waterfront access on Manhattan’s east side, from East 25th Street at the north to </font><font>Montgomery Street at the south. The City anticipates the entire flood protection system will be in place and operational by
</font><font>the end of 2026. The total expected cost of ESCR is $1.97 billion, with remaining costs fully funded through a combination of </font><font>City, federal and other funding.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (</font><font>“</font><font>USACE</font><font>”</font><font>) is pursuing the South Shore of Staten Island Coastal Storm Risk Management </font><font>Project (the </font><font>“</font><font>Staten Island Project</font><font>”</font><font>) and the Rockaways Shorefront and Back Bay Projects (the </font><font>“</font><font>Rockaways Project</font><font>”</font><font>). The </font><font>Staten Island Project will create a 5.5-mile line of coastal protection on Staten Island between Fort Wadsworth and
Oakwood </font><font>Beach. USACE currently estimates that the project will cost $1.7 billion. The City is responsible for 10.5% of the project costs, </font><font>and the remaining project costs are to be paid for with federal and State funds. Approximately half of the City’s share of such </font><font>project costs is currently reflected in the Preliminary Ten Year Capital Strategy. The Rockaways Project consists of coastal
</font><font>protection elements on the Atlantic shorefront and on the Jamaica Bay side of the Rockaways. Construction has begun on the </font><font>project, which will be fully funded by the federal government, with an expected cost of approximately $590 million.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Other projects in Lower Manhattan include constructing flood walls and deployable flip-up
barriers to protect the Two </font><font>Bridges neighborhood, which lies south of Montgomery Street at the north to the Brooklyn Bridge at the south, developing a </font><font>plan that contemplates extending the Manhattan shoreline from the Brooklyn Bridge to the Battery into the East River to
</font><font>protect the Seaport and Financial District area, and constructing an elevated waterfront esplanade in the Battery and flood </font><font>barriers in Battery Park City. Coastal resilience projects are also underway in the Tottenville, Red Hook, and Hunts Point
</font><font>neighborhoods, with shoreline reinforcement projects happening in other identified areas of the City. These projects are in </font><font>various stages of feasibility review, design and construction and implementation. Funding for these projects is coming from
</font><font>City and federal sources. While the full cost of these projects is not yet known, $522 million is included in the Preliminary </font><font>Ten-Year Capital Strategy.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In addition to site-specific resiliency projects, the City is taking steps to integrate climate resiliency into capital planning </font><font>through the NYC Climate Resiliency Design Guidelines, which translate future-looking climate change projections into
</font><font>technical guidance to inform the design of roads, buildings, sewer systems, hospitals, public housing, and other pieces of </font><font>critical public infrastructure. In 2021, the City began a five-year pilot program through which dozens of new projects will be
</font><font>designed and constructed using the standards in the NYC Climate Resiliency Design Guidelines. By 2026, all City projects will </font><font>be required to meet a stringent set of requirements that will certify their preparedness for extreme weather threats.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Reducing risk from extreme rainfall requires a multi-layered strategy with investments in
infrastructure adaptation, building </font><font>level protection, data collection, and community engagement. In July 2022, the City released the Rainfall Ready NYC action </font><font>plan, a plan to prepare the City for more extreme rainfall in the future. The City continues to install grey infrastructure, such </font><font>as building out a comprehensive storm sewer system in Southeast Queens, and green infrastructure, such as rain gardens </font><font>and
bluebelt wetlands, to manage stormwater and protect water quality. This work is being carried out by DEP and funding is </font><font>included in the City’s capital budget. The City is
also working to develop Cloudburst management projects that will use grey </font><font>and green infrastructure to absorb, store and transfer rainwater.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>In 2015, FEMA issued preliminary updated flood insurance rate maps, which would have expanded
the 100-year floodplain </font><font>beyond the areas designated in the flood maps issued in 2007. The City appealed the 2015 preliminary flood maps </font><font>challenging the modeling FEMA used to develop them. The 2015 preliminary flood maps were adopted into the building </font><font>code, but
the prior 2007 flood maps remain in effect for flood insurance purposes. In 2016, FEMA agreed with the City’s </font><font>appeal, and the City is currently working with FEMA to update
the maps. FEMA’s new maps are expected to generally expand </font><font>the 100-year floodplain from the 2007 flood maps and may cover different areas than the 2015 preliminary flood
maps. Such </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>56</font></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>expansion could negatively impact property values
in those newly designated areas. In addition, an increase in areas of the </font><font>City susceptible to flooding resulting from climate change could result in greater recovery costs to the
City if flooding were to </font><font>occur within such larger areas.</font></div> <div> <div><font>The City is also committed to minimizing its own greenhouse gas emissions by reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. The City’s </font><font>efforts to reach such goal include promoting and investing in electrification, clean energy, energy efficiency, and sustainable </font><font>transportation, and reducing energy use. Since 2014, the City has invested over $700 million in more than 10,300 energy
</font><font>conservation measures across almost 2,000 buildings, comprising more than 70 percent of City government’s building </font><font>square footage. The investments have decreased energy use and reduced emissions by nearly 266,000 metric tons. The
</font><font>Preliminary Ten-Year Capital Strategy includes $4.4 billion to continue this work to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas </font><font>emissions.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Despite the efforts described above, the magnitude of the impact on the City’s operations, economy, or financial condition </font><font>from climate change is indeterminate and unpredictable. No assurance can be given that the City will not encounter natural
</font><font>disaster risks, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, heatwaves or catastrophic sea level rise in the future, or that such risks will </font><font>not have an adverse effect on the operations, economy or financial condition of the City.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Cybersecurity</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The City relies on a large and complex technology environment to conduct its operations. As a recipient and provider of
</font><font>personal, private or sensitive information, the City and its agencies and offices face multiple cyber threats including, but not </font><font>limited to, hacking, viruses, malware and other attacks on computers and other sensitive digital networks and systems. The
</font><font>City’s Office of Cyber Command
(</font><font>“</font><font>Cyber Command</font><font>”</font><font>), which was created in 2017, is charged with setting information </font><font>security policies and standards for the City, directing
the City’s citywide cyber defense and incident response, deploying </font><font>defensive technical and administrative controls and providing guidance to the Mayor and City agencies on
cyber defense. In </font><font>January 2022, Cyber Command became part of the City’s Office of Technology and Innovation (</font><font>“</font><font>OTI</font><font>”</font><font>) (formerly the </font><font>Department of Information Technology and telecommunications).</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Cyber Command has over 100 full-time employees and works with designated cybersecurity
contacts at each City agency as </font><font>part of the Citywide Cybersecurity Program. The Financial Plan reflects funding for Cyber Command of $122 million in fiscal </font><font>year 2023, $121 million in fiscal year 2024 and $122 million in each of fiscal years 2025 through 2027. Such funding does not
</font><font>account for cybersecurity funding at other City agencies. Cyber Command is built around two core cybersecurity functions: </font><font>(1) threat management, which manages incident response and cyber threat intelligence and vulnerability management, </font><font>which
helps agencies prioritize remediation efforts on identified unpatched systems in the City’s networks; and (2) security </font><font>sciences, which manages strategic and tactical cyber
defense technologies and initiatives.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In carrying out its functions,
Cyber Command works with a range of City, State, and federal law enforcement agencies, </font><font>including the New York City Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s
Joint Terrorism Task Force. In </font><font>February 2022, the City and the State, along with the mayors of Albany, Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, and Yonkers, unveiled </font><font>the Joint Security Operations Center. The center should enhance coordination of cybersecurity efforts across the State,
</font><font>helping to foster collaboration among city, State, and federal entities. Cyber Command also regularly works with other states </font><font>and municipalities throughout the country to share cybersecurity threat intelligence and best practices, as well as with non-governmental</font><font> entities such as utilities, telecommunications providers and financial services companies for the purpose of </font><font>enhancing
collective cyber defenses. The City has developed standard cybersecurity policies and standards for third party </font><font>vendors of the City to follow, and security provisions for contracts
with vendors, which help ensure that the City is notified of </font><font>cyber breaches and suspected cyber breaches of a vendor’s network environment. The City has also developed a
Citywide </font><font>Incident Response Policy, which requires City agencies to develop incident response plans in accordance with Cyber </font><font>Command policies and standards.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>While the City conducts periodic tests and reviews of its networks, no assurances can be given that such security and
</font><font>operational control measures will be successful in guarding against all cyber threats and attacks. New technical cyber </font><font>vulnerabilities are discovered in the United States daily. In addition, cyber attacks have become more sophisticated and
</font><font>increasingly are capable of impacting municipal control systems and components. The techniques used to obtain
</font><font>unauthorized access to, or to disable or degrade, electronic networks, computers, systems and solutions are rapidly evolving </font><font>and have become increasingly complex and sophisticated. In addition, there is heightened risk due to an increase in remote
</font><font>access to City systems by City employees as a result of the outbreak of COVID-19. As cybersecurity threats continue to </font><font>evolve, the City may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify and strengthen security </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>measures, investigate and remediate any
vulnerabilities, or invest in new technology designed to mitigate security risks. The </font><font>results of any successful attack on the City’s computer and information technology
systems could impact its operations and </font><font>damage the City’s digital networks and systems, and the costs of remedying any such damage could be substantial. </font><font>Consistent with the City’s general policy to self-insure, the City does not carry insurance against cyber attacks.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>On Saturday, June 5, 2021, Cyber Command detected unusual activity on one server located
within the City Law </font><font>Department’s information technology systems and promptly determined, with the assistance of the Law Department, a third-party</font><font> had accessed the server in an unauthorized manner. Consistent with the City’s Cybersecurity Incident Response
</font><font>protocols, Cyber Command, OTI, and the Law Department took immediate action to contain the server, identify any
</font><font>additional impacted systems and contain such systems, and engaged in various defensive measures to address the
</font><font>unauthorized activity, including, without limitation, temporarily disabling remote access capability to the Law Department’s </font><font>network and blocking incoming connections from the remote access systems. The disabling and blocking resulted in the
</font><font>inability of Law Department employees to remotely access the Law Department network, although such employees could </font><font>continue to access the network while present at the Law Department's offices. Such disabling and blocking remained in </font><font>effect
as the City implemented certain security measures which led to continued business interruption. Due to certain COVID </font><font>restrictions and the remote nature of certain Law Department
work, the inability to access the network remotely led to </font><font>temporary, significant business interruption. Beginning on September 13, 2021, all mayoral agency employees, including Law
</font><font>Department employees, have returned to full in-person work. With the replacement of components and system upgrades, full </font><font>functionality of the Law Department’s computer network is substantially complete. Cyber Command’s investigation has </font><font>found no evidence of data exfiltration or unauthorized encryption of City information technology systems or the presence of
</font><font>ransomware.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The DOE investigated a cybersecurity incident at Illuminate Education (</font><font>“</font><font>Illuminate</font><font>”</font><font>), a third-party vendor that provided
</font><font>cloud-based services to some DOE schools. Illuminate advised DOE that between December 28, 2021 and January 8, 2022, </font><font>certain of Illuminate’s databases that contained confidential student information were subject to unauthorized access.
</font><font>Illuminate has stated that no financial account information or social security numbers were affected in this incident, and no </font><font>DOE computer systems were affected. DOE directed all schools to cease using any Illuminate products and services after June
</font><font>30, 2022.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Certain Reports</font><font>. Set forth below are summaries of the most recent reports of the City Comptroller, OSDC and
the staff of the </font><font>Control Board. These summaries do not purport to be comprehensive or definitive.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>On March 6, 2023, the City Comptroller released a report entitled </font><font>“</font><font>Comments on New York City’s Preliminary Budget for </font><font>Fiscal Year 2024 and the Financial Plan for Fiscal Years 2023-2027</font><font>”</font><font>. The report states that the City’s fiscal outlook differs </font><font>significantly from that depicted in the Financial Plan, for
three main reasons. First, a tentative contract agreement was </font><font>announced between DC 37 and the City with annual raises of 3 percent for the first four years and 3.25 percent for the
fifth </font><font>year – higher than the 1.25 percent annual raises funded in the Financial Plan. If this were to be the pattern for all other </font><font>unions, it would add costs to the Financial Plan of $2.5 billion in fiscal year 2023, $1.8 billion in fiscal year 2024, $3.4 billion in </font><font>fiscal year 2025, $3.9 billion in fiscal year 2026, and $4.7 billion in fiscal year 2027 for a total of $16.3 billion. Second, the cost </font><font>for shelter and services provided to asylum seekers is escalating. The Financial Plan assumed the annual cost to be $1 billion
</font><font>in fiscal year 2023 and zero in fiscal year 2024 and beyond, and also assumed these costs would be covered in full by federal </font><font>aid. By February 7, 2023, City Hall had projected the cumulative cost for fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2024 would be $4.2
</font><font>billion. State and federal aid are currently projected to cover only one-quarter of that amount. Third, the Governor’s Executive </font><font>Budget includes $1 billion in cost shifts, unfunded mandates, and revenue cuts just in fiscal year 2024. Additional, significant </font><font>costs could derive from the Governor’s proposals regarding charter schools. The cost of implementing the State’s class size </font><font>mandate legislation enacted in 2022, which requires the City to reduce class size in its schools over the next five years, also </font><font>remains unfunded.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The report incorporates an updated forecast of economic conditions and City revenues. This forecast reflects the economic </font><font>resiliency in response to tighter monetary policy shown so far, and an outlook predicated on an economic </font><font>“</font><font>soft-landing</font><font>”</font><font>. The </font><font>analysis also incorporates up-to-date information on the City’s property tax, not included in the Financial Plan. The City </font><font>Comptroller’s net revenue projections are higher than the Financial Plan projections by $1.38 billion, $2.32 billion, $1.90 </font><font>billion, $2.19 billion, and $3.61 billion in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively. The report projects that: (i) property tax </font><font>revenues will be higher by $177 million, $577 million, $730 million, $1.21 billion and $2.54 billion in fiscal years 2023 through </font><font>2027, respectively; (ii) personal income tax revenues will be higher by $193 million, $632 million, $509 million, $654 million
</font><font>and $973 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively; (iii) business tax revenues will be higher by $180 million and </font></div> </div> </div>

<div> <div><a name="xx_a947e660-0edd-4807-973e-765f2e4dfa58_59"></a> <div> <div> </div>
<div> <div><font>$27 million in fiscal years 2023 and 2024,
respectively, but lower by $152 million, $21 million and $59 million in fiscal years </font><font>2025 through 2027, respectively; (iv) sales tax revenues will be higher by $202 million, $525
million, $390 million, $133 </font><font>million and $26 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively; (v) real estate transaction-related tax revenues will be </font><font>higher by $60 million, $305 million and $126 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2025, respectively, and lower by $105 million </font><font>and $195 million in fiscal years 2026 and 2027, respectively; (vi) other tax revenue will be higher by $47 million, $14 million, </font><font>$54 million, $88 million and $94 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively; and (vii) revenues from audit
</font><font>collections will be higher by $579 million in fiscal year 2023 and $179 million in each of fiscal years 2024 through 2027.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>Despite the revised revenue projection, the City Comptroller projects additional net risks of
$1.3 billion, $1.51 billion, $3.90 </font><font>billion, $5.21 billion and $5.20 billion in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively, which, when added to the results </font><font>projected in the Financial Plan would result in gaps of $1.30 billion, $1.51 billion, $7.07 billion, $10.22 billion and $11.66 billion </font><font>in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively. Such gaps do not include risks associated with costs of providing services to
</font><font>asylum seekers: $823 million and $2.18 billion in fiscal years 2023 and 2024, respectively, and potentially $2.8 billion in each </font><font>fiscal year thereafter. The differences from the Financial Plan projections result in part from the City Comptroller’s net </font><font>expenditure projections, which are higher than the Financial Plan projections by $2.68 billion, $3.83 billion, $5.81 billion,
</font><font>$7.40 billion and $8.81 billion in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively, as a result of: (i) additional overtime </font><font>expenditures of $651 million and $563 million in fiscal years 2023 and 2024, respectively, and $440 million in each of fiscal
</font><font>years 2025 through 2027; (ii) increased expenditures related to education related risks of $255 million, $856 million, $1.07 </font><font>billion, $1.95 billion and $2.63 billion in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively; (iii) increased expenditures to fund the </font><font>Fire Department’s mental health response program of $37 million in each of fiscal years 2024 through 2027; (iv) increased </font><font>public assistance costs of $125 million in each of fiscal years 2023 through 2026; (v) increased expenditures associated with
</font><font>rental assistance of $237 million in each of fiscal years 2024 through 2027; (vi) increased costs of contributions to MTA of </font><font>$74 million, $125 million, $271 million, $445 million and $492 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively; (vii)
</font><font>increased expenditures associated with paying prevailing wage rates for homeless shelter security guards of $64 million in </font><font>each of fiscal years 2024 through 2027; (viii) increased expenditures associated with the State’s foster care reimbursement </font><font>rate of $47 million in fiscal year 2023 and $118 million in each of fiscal years 2024 through 2027; (ix) an increased
</font><font>expenditure of $82 million in fiscal year 2024 relating to a class action settlement on behalf of former detainees whose </font><font>releases had been delayed after posting bail; (x) increased expenditures of $84 million in each of fiscal years 2023 through
</font><font>2027 for court-appointed counsel; (xi) increased expenditures of $194 million in fiscal year 2024 for temporary and </font><font>professional services; (xii) increased expenditures for Public Health Corps of $13 million in fiscal year 2025 and $49 million in </font><font>each of fiscal years 2026 and 2027; and (xiii) increased expenditures for collective bargaining agreements of $2.50 billion,
</font><font>$1.80 billion, $3.40 billion, $3.90 billion and $4.70 billion in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively, if other unions follow </font><font>the DC 37 tentative contract settlement. The report also projects: (i) anticipated debt service savings from lower interest rates </font><font>on variable rate bonds of $60 million in fiscal year 2023 and $50 million in each of fiscal years 2024 through 2027; (ii)
</font><font>decreased expenditures of $285 million and $48 million in fiscal years 2023 and 2024, respectively, relating to enhanced </font><font>federal Medicaid assistance; and (iii) anticipated personal services accrual savings due to vacancies of $714 million and $357
</font><font>million in fiscal years 2023 and 2024, respectively.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>On March 6, 2023, the City Comptroller released a report relating to vacancies in City
government agencies, as a follow-up to </font><font>the City Comptroller’s report relating to vacancies released on December 6, 2022. The report compares staff vacancies as of </font><font>October 2022 to the Preliminary Mayor’s Management Report (</font><font>“</font><font>MMR</font><font>”</font><font>) released in January 2023, which provides a
snapshot </font><font>of the City’s performance on metrics related to its agencies’ core missions in the first four months of the fiscal year. The </font><font>report identifies MMR outcomes for City agencies with the highest vacancy rates identified in the December 2022 report, and
</font><font>also identifies Units of Appropriation with low MMR indicator performance and high vacancy rates. The report found that, </font><font>among the fifteen agencies with the highest vacancy rates highlighted in the prior report, the Department of Small Business
</font><font>Services stands out as an agency that is particularly struggling to meet performance metrics. The Department of Health and </font><font>Mental Hygiene, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, and the Department of City Planning are also, </font><font>the
report found, consistently failing to meet or improve on the goals self-identified as critical. The City Comptroller’s office </font><font>recommends in the report that the City should
modernize hiring and retention practices, including by expediting hiring, </font><font>allowing hybrid work for appropriate positions, reconsidering compensation levels for key hard-to-recruit
slots, and </font><font>designating a Chief Talent/Recruitment/Retention Officer to drive this work.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>On February 23, 2023, the OSDC released a report entitled </font><font>“</font><font>Review of the Financial Plan of the City of New York.</font><font>”</font><font> The report </font><font>states that the City’s preliminary fiscal year 2024 budget, adjusted for prepayments for future expenses,
reflects better-than-projected</font><font> revenue collections, the allocation of federal pandemic relief funds and the accumulated impact of savings </font><font>initiatives. The report identifies fiscal risks stemming from uncertainty over the national economy and financial markets, the </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>City’s own lagging economic recovery,
unreimbursed costs of sheltering asylum seekers, state budget actions, and the </font><font>operating performance of the MTA and NYCHA, which could increase the potential magnitude of
volatility in the City’s </font><font>budget and create additional fiscal pressures.</font><font> </font></div>
<div> <div><font>The report identifies net risks to the Financial Plan of $3.30 billion, $3.72 billion, $5.77
billion, $6.78 billion and $7.40 billion in </font><font>fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively. When combined with the results projected in the Financial Plan, the report </font><font>estimates potential budget gaps of $3.30 billion, $3.72 billion, $8.93 billion, $11.79 billion and $13.87 billion in fiscal years </font><font>2023 through 2027, respectively.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The specific risks to the Financial Plan noted in the OSDC report include: (i) increased
costs of operating subsidies to the </font><font>MTA of $80 million, $113 million, $259 million, $424 million and $478 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively; </font><font>(ii) increased expenditures for various social services (including those associated with programs providing prevailing wages
</font><font>for Department of Homeless Services security guards, foster care, emergency family and rental assistance and access to legal </font><font>counsel in housing court) of $132 million, $760 million, $760 million, $776 million and $691 million in fiscal years 2023
</font><font>through 2027, respectively; (iii) increased uniform services overtime costs of $507 million, $456 million, $457 million, $460 </font><font>million and $460 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively; (iv) increased expenditures for programs associated
</font><font>with the DOE (such as providing services to students with disabilities, increases in charter school tuition rates, universal early </font><font>childhood education for three-year-olds and certain other education initiatives) of $783 million, $903 million, $1.28 billion,
</font><font>$2.12 billion and $2.76 billion in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively; (v) increased expenditures related to the early </font><font>childhood intervention program of $45 million in each of fiscal years 2024 through 2027; (vi) increased expenditures to fund
</font><font>school health programs of $39 million in each of fiscal years 2024 through 2027; (vii) increased expenditures to fund the </font><font>Public Health Corps of $13 million, $25 million, $61 million and $61 million in fiscal years 2024 through 2027, respectively;
</font><font>(viii) increased expenditures for residual services for asylum seekers of $400 million, $2.8 billion, $2.1 billion, $1.05 billion and </font><font>$525 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively; (ix) lower than anticipated federal or State reimbursement for
</font><font>costs of services for asylum seekers of $231 million in fiscal year 2023; and (x) increased expenditures for collective </font><font>bargaining agreements of $2.5 billion, $1.8 billion, $3.4 billion, $3.9 billion and $4.7 billion in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, </font><font>respectively. The report also identifies: (i) payroll savings of $750 million in fiscal year 2023; (ii) variable rate debt service </font><font>savings of $50 million in fiscal year 2023; and (iii) debt service savings from refundings of $46 million in each of fiscal years </font><font>2024 through 2027.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The report also projects (i) increased federal and State reimbursement for costs of services for asylum seekers of $1.87 </font><font>billion, $1.4 billion, $700 million and $350 million in fiscal years 2024 through 2027, respectively; (ii) increased tax revenues of </font><font>$530 million, $1.2 billion, $1.05 billion, $1.25 billion and $1.86 billion in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively; and (iii) </font><font>increased miscellaneous revenue of $100 million in each of fiscal years 2024 through 2027.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>On March 24, 2023, the Control Board released a report on the Financial Plan titled
</font><font>“</font><font>Staff Report January Modification FYs
</font><font>2023-2027</font><font>”</font><font>. The report notes that
the City’s economic forecast, as reflected in the Financial Plan, shows a slowdown in the </font><font>City’s economy in 2023 commensurate with consensus expectation of a slowing
national economy as Federal Reserve </font><font>interest rate hikes course through the economy. The Control Board projects larger budget gaps than those in the Financial </font><font>Plan. Such projected gaps are driven by the Control Board’s estimates of higher expenditures, chief of which is the additional </font><font>cost of collective bargaining above the amount budgeted in the labor reserve. The report notes that the City’s capital program </font><font>will require an increasing portion of the City’s tax revenues to pay debt service expenses, which is projected to reach 14.9 </font><font>percent and 14.8 percent in fiscal years 2032 and 2033, respectively, closely approaching the 15 percent affordability level
</font><font>determined by the City.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Control Board report identified estimated net risks to the Financial Plan of $1.02 billion, $4.24 billion, $4.84 billion, $5.61 </font><font>billion and $6.68 billion in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively, resulting in budget gaps of $1.02 billion, $4.24 billion, </font><font>$8.01 billion, $10.63 billion and $13.15 billion in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively. Such net risks result from: (i) </font><font>increases in property tax revenues of $206 million, $291 million, $433 million, $562 million and $562 million in fiscal years
</font><font>2023 through 2027, respectively; (ii) increases in non property tax revenues of $1.24 billion, $1.24 billion, $1.26 billion, $1.29 </font><font>billion and $1.32 billion in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively; (iii) increases in non-tax revenues of $65 million in </font><font>fiscal year 2023 and $150 million in each of fiscal years 2024 through 2027; (iv) increased expenditures relating to collective </font><font>bargaining agreements of $2.5 billion, $1.8 billion, $3.4 billion, $3.9 billion and $4.7 billion in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, </font><font>respectively; (v) increases in uniformed services overtime expenses of $461 million, $697 million, $699 million, $702 million
</font><font>and $702 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2027, respectively; (vi) increased expenditures associated with increases in </font><font>charter school tuition rates of $81 million, $133 million, $313 million and $514 million in fiscal years 2024 through 2027, </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

associated with providing services to students with disabilities of $252 million in </font><font>fiscal year 2023 and $472 million in each of fiscal years 2024 through 2027; (viii) increased
expenditures associated with </font><font>student transportation of $75 million, $100 million, $150 million and $225 million in fiscal years 2024 through 2027, </font><font>respectively; (ix) increased expenditures associated with the expansion of pre-kindergarten and kindergarten for three year

<div><font>Outstanding General Obligation Indebtedness</font><font>. As of December 31, 2022,
approximately $39.32 billion of City general </font><font>obligation bonds were outstanding.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Currently, the Hudson Yards Infrastructure Corporation (</font><font>“</font><font>HYIC</font><font>”</font><font>) has outstanding approximately $2.55
billion aggregate </font><font>principal amount of bonds. In addition, HYIC has entered into a term loan facility with Bank of America, N.A. pursuant to </font><font>which HYIC may draw up to an aggregate amount of $380 million, approximately $9.9 million of which has been drawn. The </font><font>term
loan facility has a scheduled maturity of June 30, 2027. HYIC expects to issue bonds to repay such term loan facility or </font><font>further extend the maturity date prior to the scheduled
maturity. The bonds financed the extension of the Number 7 subway </font><font>line and other public improvements in the Hudson Yards area, and the term loan will be used to finance any
remaining costs </font><font>of completion of the original project and the expansion of the park in the Hudson Yards area. HYIC’s bonds and, on a </font><font>subordinate basis, draws under the term loan facility are secured by and payable from payments in lieu of taxes and other
</font><font>revenues generated by development in the Hudson Yards area. To the extent payments in lieu of taxes and other HYIC </font><font>revenues are insufficient to pay interest on the HYIC bonds or the term loan, the City has agreed to pay the amount of any
</font><font>shortfall in interest, subject to appropriation. The Financial Plan does not reflect the need for such interest support payments. </font><font>The City has no obligation to pay the principal of such bonds or of such term loan.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Water and Sewer</font><font>. The City’s financing program includes the
issuance of water and sewer revenue bonds by the Water </font><font>Authority which is authorized to issue bonds to finance capital investment in the City’s water and sewer system.
Pursuant to </font><font>State law, debt service on Water Authority indebtedness is secured by water and sewer fees paid by users of the water and </font><font>sewer system. Such fees are revenues of the Water Board, which holds a lease interest in the City’s water and sewer system. </font><font>After providing for debt service on obligations of the Water Authority and certain incidental costs, the revenues of the Water
</font><font>Board are paid to the City to cover the City’s costs of operating the water and sewer system and as rental for the system. In </font><font>fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019, the City did not request the rental payment due to the City from the Water Board. In fiscal
</font><font>years 2020 and 2021, on account of the outbreak of COVID-19, the City requested rental payments of $128 million and $137 </font><font>million, respectively. The Financial Plan reflects no additional rental payment requests for fiscal years 2022 through 2026. The </font><font>City’s Preliminary Ten-Year Capital Strategy applicable to the City’s water and sewer system covering fiscal years 2024 </font><font>through 2033, projects City-funded water and sewer investment (which is expected to be financed with proceeds of Water
</font><font>Authority debt) at approximately $29.0 billion. The 2023 2027 Capital Commitment Plan reflects total anticipated City-funded </font><font>water and sewer commitments of $15.5 billion which are expected to be financed with the proceeds of Water Authority debt.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>New York City Transitional Finance Authority</font><font>. The TFA is authorized to have outstanding $13.5 billion of Future Tax Secured </font><font>Bonds (excluding Recovery Bonds). The TFA
may have outstanding Future Tax Secured Bonds in excess of $13.5 billion </font><font>provided that the amount of the Future Tax Secured Bonds, together with the amount of indebtedness
contracted by the City, </font><font>do not exceed the debt limit of the City. Future Tax Secured Bonds are issued for general City capital purposes and are </font><font>secured by the City’s personal income tax revenues and, to the extent such revenues do not satisfy specified debt ratios, sales </font><font>tax revenues. In addition, the TFA is authorized to have outstanding $9.4 billion of Building Aid Revenue Bonds to pay for a </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>portion of the City’s five-year educational
facilities capital plan. Building Aid Revenue Bonds are secured by State building aid, </font><font>which the Mayor has assigned to the TFA.</font><font> </font></div> <div>
<div><font>Implementation of the financing program is dependent upon the ability of the City and other financing entities to market </font><font>their securities successfully in the public credit markets which will be subject to prevailing market conditions at the times of </font><font>sale. No assurance can be given that the credit markets will absorb the projected amounts of public bond sales. A significant
</font><font>portion of bond financing is used to reimburse the City’s General Fund for capital expenditures already incurred. If the City </font><font>and such other entities are unable to sell such amounts of bonds, it would have an adverse effect on the City’s cash position. </font><font>In addition, the need of the City to fund future debt service costs from current operations may also limit the City’s capital </font><font>program. The Preliminary Ten-Year Capital Strategy for fiscal years 2024 through 2033 totals $159.3 billion, of which
</font><font>approximately 97.5% is to be financed with funds borrowed by the City and such other entities. Congressional developments </font><font>affecting federal taxation generally could reduce the market value of tax-favored investments and increase the debt-service
</font><font>costs of carrying out the major portion of the City’s capital plan which is currently eligible for tax-exempt financing.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>NEW YORK STATE</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>New York is the fourth most populous state in the nation, after California, Texas, and
Florida, and has a relatively high level of </font><font>personal wealth. The State’s economy is diverse, with a comparatively large share of the nation’s financial activities,
</font><font>information, education, and health services employment, and a small share of the nation’s farming and mining activity. The </font><font>State’s location, air transport facilities and natural harbors have made it an important hub for international commerce. Travel </font><font>and tourism constitute an important part of the economy. Like the rest of the nation, New York has a declining proportion of
</font><font>its workforce engaged in manufacturing and an increasing proportion engaged in service industries.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Manufacturing employment continues to stagnate as a share of total State nonfarm employment,
as in most other states, </font><font>and as a result New York’s economy is less reliant on this sector than in the past. However, it remains an important sector of </font><font>the State economy, particularly for the upstate region, which hosts higher concentrations of manufacturers. As defined under
</font><font>the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), the trade, transportation, and utilities supersector accounts for </font><font>the third largest component of State nonfarm employment, but only the fifth largest when measured by wage share. This </font><font>sector
accounts for proportionally less employment and wages for the State than for the nation. New York City is the nation’s </font><font>leading center of banking and finance. For this reason,
this is far more important for the State than for the nation. Although </font><font>this sector accounts for less than one-tenth of all nonfarm jobs in the State, it contributes more than
one-fifth of total wages. </font><font>The remaining service-producing sectors include information, professional and business services, private education and </font><font>healthcare, leisure and hospitality services, and other services. When combined, these industries account for over half of all
</font><font>nonfarm jobs in New York. Information, education and health, and other services account for a higher proportion of total </font><font>State employment than for the nation. Farming is an important part of the State’s rural economy, although it constitutes less </font><font>than 0.2 percent of total State GDP. According to the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets, New York </font><font>ranked
in the top ten in the production of 30 commodities in 2020. Notably, the State was the second-largest producer of </font><font>apples, snap beans, and maple syrup. The State was also the
third-largest producer of cabbage, grapes, and dairy, which </font><font>represented the largest segment of the State’s agricultural sector that year.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Federal, State, and local governments together comprise the second largest sector in terms of
nonfarm jobs. Public education </font><font>is the source of over 40 percent of total State and local government employment.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Annual Information Statement</font><font>. The Annual Information Statement, dated June 29, 2022 (the </font><font>“</font><font>AIS</font><font>”</font><font>), reflects the State’s </font><font>Enacted Budget Financial Plan (the </font><font>“</font><font>Enacted
Budget Financial Plan</font><font>”</font><font>) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 and sets forth the State’s </font><font>official Financial Plan projections for Fiscal Year 2023 through Fiscal Year 2027 (the </font><font>“</font><font>Financial Plan period</font><font>”</font><font>). The State </font><font>updates the Annual Information Statement quarterly and released its first quarterly update on September 20, 2022 , its
</font><font>second quarterly update on December 21, 2022 and its third quarterly update on March 8, 2023 (the
</font><font>“</font><font>AIS Update</font><font>”</font><font>). The AIS </font><font>Update includes information on the State’s current financial projections, including summaries and extracts
from the </font><font>Governor’s Executive Budget Financial Plan for FY 2024, as amended (the </font><font>“</font><font>Updated Financial Plan</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>Updated Executive </font><font>Budget Financial Plan</font><font>”</font><font>) issued by the Division of the Budget (DOB) in March 2023. The Updated Financial Plan (which is </font><font>available on the DOB website, </font><font>www.budget.ny.gov</font><font>) includes a summary of third quarter operating results for FY 2023 </font><font>(quarter ended December 31, 2022) and updates to the
State’s official financial projections for FY 2023 through FY 2027 (the </font><font>“</font><font>Financial Plan

year 2023 (</font><font>“</font><font>FY 2023</font><font>”</font><font>) is the fiscal year that began on April </font><font>1, 2022 and will end on March 31, 2023.</font></div> </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <div><font>FINANCIAL PLAN
OVERVIEW</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Summary of Revisions to the Executive
Budget Financial Plan</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>On March 1, 2023, as required by law, the Executive
and Legislature issued a joint report containing a consensus forecast for </font><font>the economy and estimate of receipts for the current and upcoming fiscal years. The parties agreed that
tax receipts in FY </font><font>2023 and FY 2024 are likely to exceed the Executive Budget forecast, as amended, by $800 million. As such, DOB has created </font><font>an $800 million reserve for this purpose that will be taken into consideration in negotiations to adopt a budget for FY 2024.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>On March 3, 2023, Governor Kathy Hochul submitted amendments to the Executive Budget proposal
for FY 2024 to the </font><font>Legislature. The Governor’s amendments are not expected to have a material Financial Plan impact.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Based on updated economic data and information, as well as operating results to date, DOB has
revised the Executive Budget </font><font>Financial Plan multi-year receipts forecast. The General Fund receipts forecast, excluding PTET related revisions, is reduced </font><font>by almost $1.3 billion in the current year, followed by upward revisions to projections of $1.2 billion in FY 2024, $609 million in </font><font>FY 2025, $411 million in FY 2026, and $317 million in FY 2027 compared to the Executive Budget Financial Plan. The FY 2023
</font><font>and FY 2024 revisions are offset by the Transaction Risk Reserve and the set aside of $800 million consistent with the </font><font>consensus revenue forecast agreement.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>PIT receipts have been revised to reflect higher projected withholding ($550 million in both FY 2023 and FY 2024; $170
</font><font>million in later years). In FY 2023, the higher withholding is offset by a downward adjustment to estimated extensions ($2.45 </font><font>billion) for a net reduction totaling $1.9 billion.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Other revisions include higher bank tax collections associated with the resolution of a large audit and growth in investment
</font><font>income consistent with rising interest rates. In addition, the estimate for mobile sports wagering receipts has been increased </font><font>in all years based on updated collections experience. The additional mobile sports wagering receipts collected in FY 2023 will
</font><font>be transferred to the General Fund beginning in FY 2024 to support education.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The Updated Financial Plan maintains a Transaction Risk Reserve to guard against unexpected declines in receipts or costs </font><font>related to transaction risk execution. Accordingly, the Transaction Risk Reserve is used to offset the $1.3 billion downward
</font><font>revision to the receipts forecast in the current year. In FY 2024, the Transaction Risk Reserve will be increased by $436 million.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>PTET Related Receipts Revisions</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>In the Executive Budget Financial Plan, the State recognized higher personal income tax
collections. However, based on </font><font>updated information from the Department of Taxation and Finance (DTF), a portion ($2.45 billion) of the higher collections </font><font>are projected to be due to delayed claims of PTET credits and has been set aside for PTET. Other PTET related revisions
</font><font>include an upward revision to PIT refunds ($1 billion in FY 2023 and $2 billion in FY 2024) to reflect the delayed credits that </font><font>are expected to be paid at the end of the year and through FY 2024, which is partly offset by revisions to estimated payments
</font><font>and other adjustments totaling $400 million. In FY 2023, the PTET reserve is increased by $1.85 billion and will be mostly </font><font>used in FY 2024 to support expected refund payments.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Executive Summary</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The State’s Financial Rebound from COVID-19</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In the decade between the Great Recession and the onset of COVID, the New York economy steadily expanded. The State’s
</font><font>gross product grew at 4.4 percent annually and total employment increased by nearly 1.4 million. State finances were stable, </font><font>with State Operating Funds spending increasing at an average annual rate of 2.4 percent. Tax collections, which fund roughly
</font><font>three- quarters of State Operating Funds spending, grew at a yearly average of just under 3.8 percent, reaching a
</font><font>“</font><font>pre-COVID</font><font>”</font><font> peak in FY 2020, rising by nearly 10 percent over FY 2019.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>The onset of the COVID pandemic in New York, which
coincided with the start of the State’s 2021 fiscal year, triggered </font><font>sweeping public health measures at the State and local levels to slow the spread of the virus. Economic
activity slowed </font><font>dramatically, unemployment spiked, and the State prepared for a prolonged economic downturn. State spending, adjusted </font><font>for the timing of payments, flattened.</font></div> <div> <div><font>State finances, however, have fared better than expected. In FY 2021, during the acute phase of the pandemic, tax collections
</font><font>declined by just 0.6 percent from FY 2020, bolstered by Federal economic stimulus — and have subsequently soared. In FY </font><font>2022, tax collections grew by 27 percent, which is equal to about seven years of typical tax receipts growth compressed into
</font><font>a single year. In FY 2023, collections are expected to increase by nearly 10 percent to total almost $115 billion, or over $32 </font><font>billion higher than FY 2021 results.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In October 2021, Governor Hochul committed to building the State’s reserves to ensure that it could honor its current
</font><font>commitments through good and bad times. The extraordinary gains in tax receipts have been directed to accomplish that </font><font>purpose. By the end of FY 2023, the State will have boosted its reserves by over $20 billion since FY 2020. It will have also
</font><font>prepaid over $10 billion in future debt service costs that were due in FY 2024 through FY 2027.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The Post-COVID-19 Expansion is Ending</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Yet even as tax receipts continue to show strength in the current year, DOB has downgraded its expectations for the </font><font>economic outlook twice since the FY 2023 Enacted Budget Financial Plan was published in May 2022, first in the First
</font><font>Quarterly Update to the Financial Plan and again in the Updated Financial Plan. It is now forecasting a mild national recession </font><font>in calendar year 2023.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>At the State level, key economic drivers of tax receipts have been revised sharply downward. Total wage growth is now
</font><font>expected to slow to 2.8 percent in FY 2023 and 2.3 percent in FY 2024, compared to 3.3 percent and 4.3 percent in the May </font><font>2022 forecast. Bonus income is expected to decline by 27 percent in FY 2024 from the FY 2022 peak. In comparison, the
</font><font>Enacted Budget forecast called for a 15.5 percent decline in bonus income in FY 2023 followed by growth of 3.5 percent in FY </font><font>2024.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Beginning
in FY 2024, the weakening economic activity is expected to start becoming apparent in tax collections (which are a </font><font>lagging indicator of changing economic activity). This is
expected to carry through the following years of the Financial Plan, </font><font>with the most pronounced impact on FY 2025 and FY 2026 operations. General Fund tax receipts, before proposed
actions in </font><font>the FY 2024 Executive Budget, have been reduced by $2.1 billion in FY 2024, $7.4 billion in FY 2025, $7.8 billion in FY 2026, </font><font>and $5.2 billion in FY 2027 in comparison to the Enacted Budget Financial Plan.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>FY 2024 Updated Executive Budget Financial Plan</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The Governor introduced the FY 2024 Executive Budget on February 1, 2023 and submitted amendments on March 3, 2023. </font><font>DOB estimates that the General Fund will be balanced on a cash basis in FY 2024, if the Legislature adopts the Governor’s </font><font>proposal without modification. The FY 2024 Executive Budget fully funds existing commitments, including the third and final
</font><font>year of the Foundation Aid phase-in. By the end of School Year (SY) 2024, Foundation Aid will have increased by $5.7 billion </font><font>since SY 2021. DOB expects the General Fund to end FY 2024 with a balance of $35.7 billion, with principal reserves intact.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Three of the most pressing issues facing the State at the start of 2023 are addressed in the
FY 2024 Executive Budget: the </font><font>solvency of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), the stability of the State’s health care system, and the </font><font>provision of care for thousands of new asylum seekers coming to the State. In response to these challenges, the FY 2024
</font><font>Executive Budget advances a comprehensive funding plan to put the MTA on stable financial footing. It adds substantial new </font><font>operating and capital aid for health care and establishes a new commission to examine and recommend reforms to improve
</font><font>quality and reduce costs. It also provides extraordinary funding to local governments that are providing services and assisting </font><font>with the resettlement process for asylum seekers.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The proposed FY 2024 Executive Budget also funds the initiatives outlined in the Governor’s State of the State address. These </font><font>include expanding mental health inpatient, outpatient, and supportive services (FY 2024: $134 million; FY 2025: $276 million);
</font><font>providing matching funds to increase the State University centers endowments (maximum of $500 million total); giving a </font><font>monthly discount on electric utility bills for moderate-income customers (FY 2024: $200 million; FY 2025: $50 million); and
</font><font>indexing the minimum wage to inflation and funding the cost for State service providers (FY 2024: $19 million; FY 2025: $63 </font><font>million).</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>The Updated Financial Plan projects that State
Operating Funds spending will total $125.2 billion in FY 2024, an increase of </font><font>$2.5 billion, or 2 percent, from the current fiscal year.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>The Updated Executive Budget Financial Plan projects out-year budget gaps of $5.1 billion in
FY 2025, $8.6 billion in FY 2026, </font><font>and $7.2 billion in FY 2027, a total of roughly $21 billion over three years. The budget gaps that have opened in each year are </font><font>due principally to the downward revisions in projected tax receipts, which have been lowered by $20 billion (FY 2025 to FY
</font><font>2027) in comparison to the Enacted Budget Financial Plan. If the FY 2025 Budget is balanced with recurring savings, the </font><font>projected budget gap for FY 2026 would be $3.5 billion. The projected budget gaps do not reflect the use of any reserves to
</font><font>balance operations.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Economic turning points create heightened risks to the Financial Plan. In the two recessions prior to COVID, tax receipts fell
</font><font>more steeply and for a longer period than originally expected. While the DOB forecast is based on reasonable assumptions, </font><font>the impact of an economic slowdown is highly unpredictable. A second, new risk has been created by the PTET program, </font><font>which
has introduced a high degree of uncertainty in the level and timing of expected PIT tax collections. Lastly, the State is </font><font>dependent on a range of Federal approvals to implement
savings measures and receive reimbursement for costs it has </font><font>incurred in the first instance. The Updated Financial Plan maintains a reserve for such transaction risks, in addition
to the </font><font>principal reserves and other reserves for specific purposes (e.g., future labor agreements).</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The updated
</font><font>“</font><font>base</font><font>”</font><font> forecast provides the basis for the development of the Governor’s FY 2024 Executive Budget proposal. </font><font>DOB has made
several forecast
(</font><font>“</font><font>base</font><font>”</font><font>) revisions to the Financial Plan estimates in the Mid-Year Update. The most </font><font>significant change has been to base tax
receipts, which have been reduced in each year of the Financial Plan, starting in FY </font><font>2024. The downward revisions are consistent with DOB’s updated economic forecast, which
calls for a mild recession in </font><font>calendar year 2023. Disbursements have been revised for updated operating results and program information. Other changes </font><font>include revisions to the Reserve for the Timing of PTET/PIT Credits and the addition of an $800 million reserve consistent
</font><font>with the consensus revenue forecast agreement.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Governor's Executive Budget Proposal</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Governor’s Updated Executive Budget Financial Plan for FY 2024 is balanced in the General Fund, and State Operating
</font><font>Funds spending grows by 2 percent. The FY 2024 Executive Budget funds initiatives and investments for a range of essential </font><font>services including the health care system, MTA and local governments. It also funds the initiatives outlined in the Governor’s </font><font>State of the State address, including investments in mental health, housing, public safety, and additional funding for SUNY. In </font><font>addition, State operations funding is increased for essential services. Lastly, new capital commitments proposed in the
</font><font>budget are funded not only with bonds but also with cash resources, to ensure that the State’s debt burden remains </font><font>affordable.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Receipts</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The FY 2024 Executive Budget proposes the following tax law changes with significant Financial Plan impacts:</font></div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Corporate Franchise Tax Rates. The FY 2024 Executive Budget extends through Tax Year 2026 the
tax rates on the </font><font>business income base for Article 9-A filers with business income tax bases over $5 million, as well as reinstates the </font><font>capital base tax rate for certain taxpayers.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Tobacco Tax Increase/Flavor Ban. To reduce tobacco use, especially among young people, the FY
2024 Executive Budget </font><font>proposes expanding the State's ban on the sale of flavored vaping products by prohibiting the sale of all flavored tobacco </font><font>products and increasing the cigarette tax from $4.35 to $5.35 per pack. These actions are expected to reduce cigarette </font><font>tax
receipts that flow to both the General Fund and the Health Care Reform Act (HCRA).</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Other Tax Revenue Actions. The FY 2024 Executive Budget proposes various extensions, enforcement initiatives and </font><font>reforms
including the proposed extension of credits for historic property rehabilitation, NYC musical arts, and farmers, as </font><font>well as a new credit for child care expansion.</font></div>
</div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><font>Debt Service. Costs reflect
the financing of new capital initiatives included in the FY 2024 Executive Budget. The Updated </font><font>Financial Plan also includes $900 million of additional debt service prepayments in
FY 2023 that reduce debt service costs in </font><font>FY 2024.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Other Receipts/Transfers. The Updated Financial Plan also includes reductions to certain planned transfers due to the
</font><font>availability of revenues in other funds that are earmarked to support new investments.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Disbursements</font></div>
<div> <div><font>Local Assistance</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>School Aid. The Updated Executive Budget Financial Plan recommends $34.4 billion in State aid to schools for school year </font><font>(SY) 2024, an increase of $3.1 billion (10.0 percent). Including Federal prekindergarten expansion grants, schools will receive </font><font>$34.5 billion. This growth primarily reflects a $2.7 billion (12.8 percent) Foundation Aid increase, including a minimum 3
</font><font>percent annual increase to fully funded districts that would otherwise not receive a Foundation Aid increase under current </font><font>law. The growth in Foundation Aid largely reflects the full funding of the current formula for the first time in its 17-year
</font><font>history, marking the final year of the three-year phase-in. Additionally, a High-Impact Tutoring Set-Aside of $250 million </font><font>within Foundation Aid directs support to students struggling to recover from pandemic-related learning loss. In addition to
</font><font>the Foundation Aid increase, School Aid growth includes a $232 million increase in expense-based aids and a $125 million </font><font>increase in State-funded full-day prekindergarten programming for four-year-old children.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Medicaid Global Cap. Global Cap spending growth in FY 2024 is estimated at $1.4 billion. The Global Cap index has been </font><font>revised based on updated Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) annual projections of health care spending. The
</font><font>revised rates allow additional Medicaid spending growth above the Mid-Year Financial Plan forecast of $224 million in FY </font><font>2023 and $475 million in FY 2024, growing to $754 million in FY 2027.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Medicaid spending is currently projected to exceed the cap by $454 million in FY 2026 and $526 million in FY 2027. The
</font><font>higher cost is mainly attributable to higher-than-expected enrollment, utilization and spending trends.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The FY 2024 Executive Budget proposes several investments in health care, including
increasing and/or adding Medicaid </font><font>reimbursement for hospitals, nursing homes and assisted living providers, primary care, school-based health centers, </font><font>transportation services, and additional types of mental health providers in community health centers. In addition, the
</font><font>Updated Financial Plan includes savings beginning April 1, 2023 due to the transition of the prescription drug program for all </font><font>Medicaid members enrolled in Mainstream Managed Care to the State run Medicaid Pharmacy Program. With this transition, </font><font>New
York State will pay pharmacies directly for drugs and supplies on behalf of Medicaid members. Transitioning the </font><font>pharmacy benefit from Managed Care to Medicaid Fee-for-Service will
result in significant savings to the State, most of </font><font>which will be reinvested back into healthcare. Other proposals include expanding the Medicaid Buy-in program so more </font><font>disabled persons can continue to work without the risk of losing health benefits and supporting critical primary and
</font><font>preventative care for Medicaid enrollees that will help improve population health and reduce preventable hospitalizations and </font><font>emergency room visits.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>To maintain spending within the Global Cap, several proposals to reduce or offset costs are advanced in the FY 2024
</font><font>Executive Budget. Most notably, the State expects to utilize the entirety of Affordable Care Act (ACA) Enhanced Federal </font><font>Medical Assistance Percentage (eFMAP) savings to offset growth in Medicaid costs borne by the State rather than counties
</font><font>($624 million). Other savings proposals include shifting pregnancy coverage to the Essential Plan (EP) ($53 million in FY 2024 </font><font>and $210 million annually thereafter); and aligning the timing of expanded coverage for certain groups with the Federal
</font><font>waiver submission ($172 million).</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>eFMAP Extension. The Federal FY 2023 Omnibus Appropriations bill included an extension of eFMAP through the end of the </font><font>2023
calendar year. Beginning April 1, 2023, eFMAP will be reduced over the next three quarters: 5 percent through June 30, </font><font>2.5 percent through September 30, and 1.5 percent through
December 31. The Financial Plan previously reflected eFMAP </font><font>through March 31, 2023.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Asylum Seekers Services and Assistance. The FY 2024 Executive Budget provides support to asylum seekers in New York City, </font><font>including shelter cost reimbursement.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Minimum Wage Indexing. The FY 2024 Executive Budget proposes indexing New York’s minimum wage to inflation to benefit
</font><font>hundreds of thousands of minimum wage workers across New York State and assist them to meet the rising cost of living, </font><font>which results in increased State assistance to mental hygiene, health care and social services providers supported by the
</font><font>State.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Mental Health. Proposed actions for the Office of Mental Health (OMH) include investments across the continuum of care for </font><font>mental health and continued support for community-based services, including residential programs. Specifically, this
</font><font>includes establishing and operating 3,500 new residential units for people with mental illness, including 1,500 Supportive </font></div> </div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>Housing beds, 900 transitional step-down beds, 600
licensed apartment treatment beds and 500 community residence-single</font><font> room occupancy (CR-SRO) beds. Outpatient mental health services throughout the State will be significantly
</font><font>expanded by funding twelve new Comprehensive Psychiatric Emergency Programs; 42 new Assertive Community Treatment
</font><font>teams; 26 new Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics, including an Indigent Care Program to ensure providers are </font><font>reimbursed for care; eight new Safe Options Support teams; the expansion of the Critical Time Intervention (CTI) initiative
</font><font>started in 2022; 42 new Health Home Plus Care Managers; and start-up funding and operating costs for expanded clinic </font><font>capacity at 20 sites. The FY 2024 Executive Budget also expands mental health services for children and families, enhances
</font><font>suicide prevention programs, strengthens supportive housing programs, and supports the 2.5 percent Cost of Living
</font><font>Adjustment (COLA) for voluntary operated providers.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Public Health/Aging. The FY 2024 Executive Budget adds funding for respite care for high-need family caregivers and </font><font>expands
access to home care aides for lower income older adults.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Social
Services/Housing. The FY 2024 Executive Budget provides funding to ensure continuity in the level of childcare </font><font>subsidies, expands eligibility for child care subsidies to more
families, and creates an Employer-Supported Child Care Pilot </font><font>Program to provide new financial support for child care. Other significant increases include investments in permanency
</font><font>resource centers and kinship services, consolidating afterschool program funding in the Office of Children and Family </font><font>Services (OCFS), assisting foster care agencies with Federal provisions as they relate to Institutions for Mental Disease (IMD), </font><font>and establishing the Planning Assistance Fund to support local governments in achieving new home targets pursuant to the </font><font>New
York Housing Compact. These investments are offset by making permanent the restructured financing approach for </font><font>residential school placements of children with special needs outside
New York City and utilization of Mortgage Insurance </font><font>Fund (MIF) resources to fund housing and homelessness programs.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Environment/Energy. The FY 2024 Executive Budget includes funding to expand the Energy
Affordability Program to </font><font>consumers who have not been previously eligible. The program will provide income-eligible customers with a discount on </font><font>their monthly electric and/or gas bills ($200 million in FY 2024 and $50 million thereafter).</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Higher Education. The FY 2024 Executive Budget adds $40 million in recurring annual operating support for City University of </font><font>New York (CUNY) campuses starting in Academic Year 2024 and provides additional funding in FY 2024 to help cover student
</font><font>tuition costs.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Public Safety. The FY 2024 Executive Budget includes increased support for Prosecutors, Alternatives to Incarceration (ATI),
</font><font>the Gun Involved Violence Elimination (GIVE) program, re-entry services, and pretrial services. The Budget also includes </font><font>funding to combat the flow of fentanyl, including the establishment of an Anti-Fentanyl Innovation Grant, as well as support
</font><font>to hire additional crime and data analysts focused on fentanyl distribution and deaths.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Transportation. The FY 2024 Executive Budget proposes one-time State assistance to the MTA to address extraordinary </font><font>revenue impacts caused by the pandemic ($300 million) and increases to upstate transit operating aid to match the year to
</font><font>year increase in on-budget, traditional MTA aid. Other initiatives include $24 million annually for operating costs of the </font><font>Gateway Development Commission and $2 million to begin funding an Innovative Mobility Initiative for non-MTA systems.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>All Other Local Assistance. The FY 2024 Executive Budget includes increased funding for
various other programs and </font><font>initiatives including recurring assistance to the City of Albany ($15 million), the Liberty Defense Project and the Office of New </font><font>Americans, and various programs administered by the Empire State Development Corporation.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Agency Operations</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Agency Operations. The growth in executive agency budgets reflects funding to meet critical service needs, as well as efforts
</font><font>to assess lead risks and support lead abatement in housing across the State and modernize health reporting systems. In </font><font>addition, funding is included to support consulting costs associated with development of Section 1115 Medicaid </font><font>demonstration
waivers that have allowed the State to implement a managed care program that provides comprehensive and </font><font>coordinated health care to Medicaid patients. Increased funding for agency
operations also supports inpatient beds in State-operated</font><font> Psychiatric Centers, expanded State Police community stabilization units, enhanced parole supervisions programs, </font><font>investments in information technology including the Joint Security Operations Center, and geographical wage adjustments.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Asylum Seekers Services and Assistance. The
Division of Military and Naval Affairs (DMNA) has deployed national guard </font><font>servicemembers to various hotels, homeless shelters, and emergency sites throughout New York City to
implement, </font><font>administer, and effectuate the provision of services.</font></div> <div> <div><font>State Police Recruiting Class. Increased funding will support two additional State Police recruiting classes in FY 2024, for a
</font><font>total of four planned classes.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>SUNY Endowment Funding. The State will provide $1 in State funds (up to $500 million) for every $2 in private contributions
</font><font>to endowments for SUNY’s four university centers: Buffalo, Binghamton, Albany, and Stony Brook. The endowment funds are </font><font>expected to be used to provide long-term support for campus operations, student scholarships, research, endowed
</font><font>professorships, and the development of new academic fields.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Legislature/Judiciary. The FY 2024 Executive Budget reflects budget requests submitted by the Legislature and Judiciary. The
</font><font>Judiciary requested increases in annual operating spending to fund expected hiring, three planned Court Officer Academy </font><font>classes, the addition of 34 new Judgeships, and collective bargaining increases expected to be implemented by March 2023.
</font><font>Spending increases for the Legislature are mainly driven by personnel costs for legislative staff, as well as anticipated </font><font>increases for the recently approved increase in member salaries.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Accelerate Deposits to the Retiree Health Benefit Trust Fund (RHBTF) . In FY 2022, the State made its first deposit to the
</font><font>RHBTF, which was created in FY 2018 to reserve money for the payment of health benefits of retired employees and their </font><font>dependents. The reserves establish an asset against the State’s post-employment health insurance liability. The Updated
</font><font>Financial Plan reflects making deposits that were planned in later years of the Financial Plan in FY 2023.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Fringe Benefits/Fixed Costs. The Judiciary Budget includes lower pension estimates offset by
increased health insurance </font><font>costs.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The FY 2024 Executive Budget also includes proposed legislation again this year that would align interest rates paid on court
</font><font>judgements by public and private entities to the rate permitted for civil money judgments recovered in Federal district court. </font><font>Since the early 1980’s, the interest rate on judgments and accrued claims has been set at 9 percent. Payment of a prevailing </font><font>market rate is expected to help ensure that neither party in a lawsuit is disadvantaged by an interest rate that is above or
</font><font>below what otherwise could be earned while cases are being adjudicated. This proposal will provide relief for local </font><font>governments and lower State taxpayer costs by millions of dollars.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Transfer to Other Funds</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Capital Projects. The FY 2024 Executive Budget proposes investments to expand housing capacity, outpatient mental health
</font><font>services, facilitate digital transformation across the SUNY system, invest in new and renovated research buildings, </font><font>laboratories, and state-of-the art instrumentation at SUNY Flagship institutions, improve capital facilities through the SUNY
</font><font>and CUNY systems and various economic development projects. The FY 2024 Executive Budget also funds the DMV
</font><font>transformation initiative and geographic pay increases for DOT maintenance staff.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>SUNY Operations. The FY 2024 Executive Budget includes $75 million in State aid to SUNY in Academic Year 2024 ($56 </font><font>million in FY 2024) for transformational initiatives at campuses that support innovation, help meet workforce needs, and
</font><font>provide student support. This funding commitment will disburse over a two-year period. In addition, the Updated Financial </font><font>Plan provides $60 million ($45 million in FY 2024) in new recurring general operating support for SUNY campuses and </font><font>provides
additional funding in FY 2024 to help cover student tuition costs.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Reserve Changes</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The previously planned deposits to principal reserves in FY 2024 ($2.4 billion) and FY 2025 ($2.9 billion) will be accelerated
</font><font>and completed in the current year (FY 2023). In addition, the projected available surpluses in FY 2023 ($782 million) and FY </font><font>2024 ($851 million) will be carried forward and used to lower the projected outyear budget gaps.</font></div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>Principal Reserves</font><font>2</font><font> . The Updated Financial Plan reflects completing the remaining $10.6 billion of planned
deposits and set </font><font>asides to principal reserves two years ahead of schedule. By the end of FY 2023, the balance in principal reserves is expected </font><font>to be just over $19.5 billion, an amount that maintains 15 percent of projected FY 2025 State Operating Funds disbursements
</font><font>as proposed in the FY 2023 Executive Budget.</font>
<hr/> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>2</font></div>
<div><font>DOB defines principal reserves as the two </font><font>“</font><font>rainy day</font><font>”</font><font> reserves (consisting of the Tax Stabilization Reserve and the Rainy Day Reserve) and the </font><font>portion of the General Fund balance
informally designated for economic uncertainties.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><font>The FY 2024 Executive Budget includes legislation to increase the amount the State is permitted to set aside in statutory
</font><font>reserves by increasing the maximum allowable balance for the Rainy Day Reserve from 15 percent to 20 percent, and the </font><font>maximum annual deposit from 3 percent to 10 percent, of State Operating Funds spending. In addition, the calculation </font><font>would
be based on the spending projection included in the Enacted Budget Financial Plan. The allocation of principal reserves </font><font>may be adjusted in future updates consistent with the
allowable balance and deposit authorization for the Rainy Day Reserve.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Debt Reduction Reserve Fund. To ensure the State can abide by the limits imposed by the Debt Reform Act, $1 billion will be </font><font>used to recapitalize the debt reduction reserve.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>RHBTF. The Updated Financial Plan reflects accelerating a $600 million deposit in FY 2023, from FY 2026 and FY 2027,
</font><font>increasing the reserve to $1.2 billion by the end of FY 2023. The deposit is consistent with the statutory limit of 1.5 percent of </font><font>the actuarial accrued liability.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Cash Position</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>DOB expects that the General Fund will have sufficient liquidity in FY 2024 to make all planned payments as they become </font><font>due.
DOB continues to reserve money on a quarterly basis for debt service payments that are financed with General Fund </font><font>resources. Money to pay debt service on bonds secured by dedicated
receipts, including PIT bonds and Sales Tax bonds, </font><font>continues to be set aside as required by law and bond covenants.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Debt Service</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Debt service spending consists of the payment of principal, interest, and related expenses on
State-supported debt. </font><font>Prepayments executed in prior years, as well as planned prepayments in FY 2023, have a substantial impact on total debt </font><font>service spending. Excluding the impact of the prepayments, debt service expenses are projected to remain flat in FY 2024
</font><font>over the prior year. The table below provides a summary of the impact of actual and planned prepayments.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>General Fund Financial Plan</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>General Fund receipts are affected by the deposit of dedicated taxes in other funds for debt
service and other purposes, the </font><font>transfer of balances between funds of the State, and other factors. Three significant factors affect reported General Fund tax </font><font>receipts, as described below.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>First, changes in debt service on State-supported revenue bonds affect General Fund tax receipts. The State utilizes bonding
</font><font>programs where tax receipts are deposited into dedicated debt service funds (outside the General Fund) and used to make </font><font>debt service payments. After satisfying debt service requirements for these bonding programs, the balance is transferred to
</font><font>the General Fund.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Second, the STAR program is funded from PIT receipts, with changes in the State-supported cost of the program affecting
</font><font>reported PIT receipts.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Lastly, beginning in FY 2022, the PTET program began affecting reported General Fund tax collections. In FY 2022, the State
</font><font>collected $16.4 billion in PTET payments through business tax receipts. In FY 2023, it expects to continue to collect PTET and </font><font>pay PIT credits connected with the program for tax years 2021 and 2022. The General Fund reserved the entire amount of </font><font>PTET
collections received in FY 2022 and will use a portion of that balance to cover the difference between PTET collections </font><font>and related PIT refunds in FY 2023 and beyond. The timing
between the initial PTET collections and subsequent refunds will </font><font>be managed in a similar manner in each year of the Financial Plan. The PTET program is expected to have no net
impact on </font><font>operations over its life but will distort the annual change for business and PIT receipts.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>General Fund disbursements are affected by the
level of financing sources available in other funds, transfers of balances </font><font>between funds of the State, and other factors that may change annually. For example, education and health
care programs </font><font>are affected by the level of financing sources (i.e., HCRA and lottery/gaming receipts) available in other funds. Projected </font><font>spending also reflects DOB's cautious estimates of disbursements, a practice that provides a cushion for potential receipts
</font><font>shortfalls and unanticipated costs.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Updated FY 2023 Financial Plan</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Receipts</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>General Fund receipts, including transfers but excluding PTET, are expected to total $106.2
billion in FY 2023, an increase of </font><font>$9.9 billion (10.2 percent) over FY 2022.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Tax receipts, excluding the impact of PTET, but including transfers after payment of debt service, are estimated to total $99.0 </font><font>billion in FY 2023, an increase of $13.7 billion (16.1 percent) from FY 2022. The increase reflects projected growth in tax
</font><font>receipts and the impact of prepayments of future debt service costs. Excluding the prepayments, tax receipts are estimated to </font><font>increase by 9.8 percent from FY 2022.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>PIT receipts, excluding PTET and debt prepayments, are estimated to total $70.1 billion in FY 2023, an increase of $6.3 billion </font><font>(9.9 percent) from FY 2022 reflecting underlying growth in collections. The actual and planned prepayments of debt service
</font><font>due in future years reduce reported PIT receipts in the fiscal year in which the payments are made and increase PIT receipts </font><font>in the fiscal years in which the debt service was originally scheduled to be paid. Debt prepayments reduce General Fund PIT
</font><font>receipts by $4.3 billion and $1.8 billion in FY 2022 and FY 2023, respectively and increase PIT receipts in FY 2024 by $3.2 </font><font>billion.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Consumption/use tax receipts, including transfers after payment of debt service on Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, are estimated </font><font>to total $17.2 billion in FY 2023, an increase of $569 million (3.4 percent) from FY 2022. This includes the impact of the
</font><font>prepayment of debt service in FY 2022, which reduces receipts by $2.25 billion. Base sales tax growth is estimated at 10.6 </font><font>percent in FY 2023 and is offset by the drop in tax revenue attributable to the temporary suspension of the State sales tax on
</font><font>gasoline and diesel motor fuel from June 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022 and estimated declines in cigarette and tobacco tax </font><font>collections.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Business tax receipts, excluding PTET, are estimated at $10.2 billion in FY 2023, an increase of $1.8 billion (20.8 percent) from </font><font>FY 2022. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in Corporate Franchise Tax (CFT) gross receipts and audit
</font><font>receipts. FY 2023 includes the first prepayment affected by the temporary increase in the business income and capital base </font><font>rates enacted in FY 2022.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Other tax receipts, including transfers after payment of debt service on Clean Water/Clean Air (CW/CA) Bonds, are expected
</font><font>to total $3.2 billion in FY 2023, an increase of $357 million from FY 2022. This is primarily due to the receipt of multiple </font><font>super-large estate tax payments of more than $100 million.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Miscellaneous receipts are projected to increase by $707 million from FY 2022 primarily driven by higher investment income
</font><font>receipts. The State used $4.5 billion from ARP recovery aid in FY 2022 and plans to use another $2.4 billion from American </font><font>Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARP) recovery aid in FY 2023 to fund eligible expenditures, including essential governmental
</font><font>services.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Non-tax transfers in FY 2023 includes a Transaction Risk Reserve that offsets total projected transfers from other funds and
</font><font>provides a hedge against risks to receipts that may materialize later in the fiscal year or in FY 2024. The Transaction Risk </font><font>Reserve totals $1.8 billion in FY 2023, after adjustments made herein and the movement of $1 billion to the reserve for Debt
</font><font>Management. Excluding the risk reserve, total non-tax transfers are estimated at $3.6 billion in FY 2023, a decrease of $623 </font><font>million from FY 2022 due to the transfer of a large Tribal State Compact Fund receipt in FY 2022. </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Disbursements</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>General Fund disbursements, including transfers to other funds, are expected to total $94.5 billion in FY 2023, an increase of
</font><font>$5.6 billion (6.3 percent) from FY 2022. The growth in spending is attributable to initiatives and investments in nearly all </font><font>major programs, including health care, School Aid, mental hygiene, social services, one-time bonus payments to health
</font><font>care/direct care workers, and recovery assistance to individuals and small businesses.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Local assistance spending is estimated at $64.5
billion in FY 2023, an increase of $6.1 billion from FY 2022. In FY 2023, </font><font>healthcare and direct care workers earning less than $125,000 will receive a State-funded bonus payment of
up to $3,000 at </font><font>an estimated cost of $1.3 billion. School Aid and Medicaid, the largest local programs, are projected to increase spending by a </font><font>combined $4.0 billion in FY 2023. School Aid is estimated to increase by nearly $1 billion on a State fiscal year basis, primarily </font><font>driven by the continuing phase-in of the Foundation Aid formula. Medicaid spending is projected to grow by $3.1 billion,
</font><font>reflecting the updated method for calculating allowable spending growth under the Global Cap, increased costs related to </font><font>minimum wage and funding of the local share of program growth.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Other areas with significant growth include the Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance (OTDA) ($1.2 billion) driven by
</font><font>rental assistance and homeless housing services; funding for backlogged Child Welfare Services claims ($796 million), mental </font><font>hygiene ($196 million) for expanded services, increased capacity, and a 5.4 percent human services COLA; special education
</font><font>and other education programs ($255 million) driven by increased special education provider tuition rates and enrollment </font><font>growth for such programs, charter school supplemental tuition reimbursement and aid to nonpublic schools; utility arrears
</font><font>assistance ($250 million); public health and aging ($200 million); public protection and safety ($73 million); and other </font><font>programs including child care, housing, and economic development.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Agency operations costs, including fringe benefits, are expected to total $21.9 billion in FY 2023, an increase of $1.1 billion </font><font>from FY 2022. The annual change is partly driven by several nonrecurring transactions processed in FY 2022, including the
</font><font>funding of $2.2 billion of eligible payroll costs, including fringe benefits, from the Coronavirus Relief Fund (CRF), which </font><font>lowered FY 2022 spending. The lower spending in FY 2022 is partly offset by the ongoing purchase of COVID-19 test kits,
</font><font>payment of retroactive salary increases, and the transfer of additional funds to RHBTF, including the acceleration of deposits </font><font>previously planned in FYs 2025 and 2026 to FY 2023 ($600 million). In addition, FY 2023 spending includes an offset of $800
</font><font>million for expected Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reimbursement that lowers spending. Excluding these </font><font>nonrecurring transactions, operational costs are projected to increase in FY 2023 due to rising energy and commodity prices
</font><font>and negotiated general salary increases.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>General Fund transfers to Other Funds are projected to total $8.2 billion in FY 2023, a decrease of $1.6 billion from FY 2022.
</font><font>Transfers for capital projects are expected to decline by $2.4 billion reflecting the timing of bond reimbursements and a $931 </font><font>million transfer to the MTA accelerated from FY 2023 to March 2022 and are partly offset by higher transfers for SUNY ($122
</font><font>million) and all other transfers ($656 million) mainly for health care, indigent legal services and transportation and transit </font><font>support. </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>FY 2023 Closing Balance</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Excluding the PTET reserve for the timing of PTET/PIT credits and the reserve for extraordinary monetary settlements to fund
</font><font>existing commitments and projects, DOB estimates the General Fund will end FY 2023 with a balance of $26.8 billion, an </font><font>increase of $12.0 billion over FY 2022.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Principal reserves are expected to increase by $10.6 billion </font><font>—</font><font> $3.1 billion in statutory Rainy Day Reserves and $7.4 billion set </font><font>aside for economic uncertainties. This
includes the acceleration of planned deposits totaling $5.3 billion from FY 2024 and FY </font><font>2025 that will be deposited in FY 2023. The reserves for debt management and labor
settlements increase by $2.3 billion. The </font><font>balance available for all other purposes is expected to decline due to funding of new commitments, including pandemic relief </font><font>and recovery assistance, offset by resources available for FY 2024 operations.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>FY 2024 Executive Budget Financial Plan</font><font> </font></div> </div>

<div> <div><font>PIT receipts, excluding PTET and debt prepayments,
but including transfers after payment of debt service, are estimated to </font><font>total $66.7 billion in FY 2024, a decrease of $3.4 billion (4.9 percent) from FY 2023. The decrease reflects
reduced extension </font><font>payments for tax year 2022 driven by a strong decline in nonwage income, coupled with declines in final returns and </font><font>delinquencies, offset by a decrease in total refunds primarily attributable to the expiration of the 2022 homeowner tax rebate
</font><font>credit.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>Consumption/use tax receipts, including transfers after payment of debt service on Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, are estimated </font><font>to total $18.4 billion in FY 2024, an increase of $1.2 billion (6.8 percent) from FY 2023. This increase reflects moderate growth </font><font>in the sales tax base (2.9 percent), including the expiration of the temporary suspension of the State sales tax on gasoline
</font><font>and diesel motor fuel on December 31, 2022.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Business tax receipts, excluding PTET, are estimated at $8.8 billion in FY 2024, a decrease of $1.4 billion (14.0 percent) from </font><font>FY 2023. The decrease primarily reflects a decrease in CFT gross receipts, reflecting a projected decline in corporate profits, </font><font>and a decrease in audit receipts to recent trend levels.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Other tax receipts, including transfers after payment of debt service on CW/CA Bonds, are expected to total $2.4 billion in FY
</font><font>2024, a decrease of $889 million from FY 2023. This is primarily due to a decline in the real estate transfer tax and the estate </font><font>tax returning to typical trends following record receipt collections in FY 2023.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Miscellaneous receipts are projected to decline by over $600 million from FY 2023 due to high investment income receipts in </font><font>FY 2023.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Non-tax
transfers are estimated to total $1.9 billion in FY 2024, an increase of $99 million from FY 2023. The modest change </font><font>is mainly attributable to increases in transfers from the

<div> <div><font>Disbursements</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>General Fund disbursements, including transfers to other funds, are expected to total $106.9
billion in FY 2024, an increase of </font><font>$12.4 billion (13.2 percent) from FY 2023. The annual change in spending is affected by the expected expiration of the eFMAP </font><font>at the end of the third quarter of FY 2024. The higher Federal matching rate has temporarily lowered State-share spending
</font><font>and increased the Federal share of Medicaid costs.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Local assistance spending is estimated to total $73.3 billion in FY 2024, an increase of $8.8 billion from FY 2023. General Fund </font><font>spending for education and health care represents most of the local assistance spending. General Fund support for these
</font><font>programs is affected by the level of financing sources (i.e., HCRA and lottery/gaming receipts) available in other funds, as </font><font>well as the impact of eFMAP. School Aid is estimated to increase by $3.2 billion (12.6 percent) on a State fiscal year basis,
</font><font>primarily reflecting the final year of the phase-in of full funding of the current Foundation Aid formula, a $125 million </font><font>investment in State-funded full day prekindergarten programming for four- year old children and assumed growth in
</font><font>expense-based aids.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Medicaid spending is projected to grow by $2.3 billion due to investments in health care, offset by savings resulting from the
</font><font>transition of the pharmacy benefit from Managed Care to Medicaid Fee- for-Service, the phase down of the eFMAP extension </font><font>through December 31, 2023, and actions to maintain spending within the Global Cap. Additional local assistance growth is
</font><font>primarily a result of additional assistance to the MTA to address operating shortfalls, initiatives and investments to improve </font><font>mental health care services, access to affordable housing, additional support for public safety initiatives, wage increases, and </font><font>one-time funding to support asylum seekers services and assistance in New York City. Partially offsetting these increases are
</font><font>one-time funding for Child welfare services and pandemic recovery initiatives. Lastly, General Fund local assistance has been </font><font>reduced in the current year based on operating results to date and other information.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>General Fund agency operations costs, including fringe benefits, are expected to total $23.3 billion in FY 2024, an increase of </font><font>$1.5 billion from FY 2023. The growth in executive agency budgets reflects efforts to assess lead risks and support lead
</font><font>abatement for housing across the State, modernize health reporting systems, conduct additional State Police recruiting </font><font>classes, provide State matching funds for contributions to the endowments for SUNY’s four university centers, and increase </font><font>inpatient beds in State-operated Psychiatric Centers.

</font><font>existing commitments and projects, DOB projects the State will end FY 2024 with a General Fund cash balance of $26.7 </font><font>billion, a decrease of $95 million from FY 2023. The reserves for debt management and labor settlements are projected to
</font><font>increase by just over $1 billion. The balance available for all other purposes is expected to decline due to the use of prior year </font><font>resources to fund certain commitments and operations in FY 2024, partially offset by the addition of an $800 million reserve
</font><font>consistent with the consensus revenue agreement.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Cash Flow</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>State Finance Law authorizes the General Fund to borrow money temporarily from available funds held in the Short-Term
</font><font>Investment Pool (STIP). Loans to the General Fund are limited to a term not to exceed four months or the end of the fiscal </font><font>year, whichever is shorter. The resources that can be borrowed by the General Fund are limited to available balances in STIP,
</font><font>as determined by the State Comptroller. Available balances include money in the State’s governmental funds and a relatively </font><font>small amount of other money belonging to the State, held in internal service and enterprise funds, as well as certain agency
</font><font>funds. Several accounts in Debt Service Funds and Capital Projects Funds that are part of All Governmental Funds are </font><font>excluded from the balances deemed available in STIP. These excluded funds consist of bond proceeds and money obligated </font><font>for
debt service payments.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The FY 2024 Executive Budget continues to
authorize short-term financing for liquidity purposes during the fiscal year. In </font><font>doing so, it provides a tool to help the State manage cashflow, if needed, and more effectively
deploy resources as the State </font><font>continues to respond to the pandemic. Specifically, the authorization allows for the issuance of up to $3 billion of PIT revenue </font><font>anticipation notes which mature no later than March 31, 2024. It also allows up to $2 billion in line of credit facilities, to be </font><font>drawn through March 31, 2024, subject to available appropriation. Neither authorization allows borrowed amounts to be
</font><font>extended or refinanced beyond their initial maturity. The Updated Financial Plan does not assume the use of short-term </font><font>financing for liquidity purposes during FY 2024. DOB evaluates cash results regularly and may adjust the use of notes and/or
</font><font>the line of credit based on liquidity needs, market considerations, and other factors.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The State continues to reserve money on a quarterly basis for debt service payments financed with General Fund resources. </font><font>Money to pay debt service on bonds secured by dedicated receipts, including PIT bonds and Sales Tax Revenue bonds, </font><font>continues
to be set aside as required by law and bond covenants.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>PTET Financial Plan Impact</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have determined that State and local
</font><font>income taxes imposed on and paid by a partnership or an S corporation on its income, such as the PTET, are allowable as a </font><font>Federal deduction to taxable income. In November 2020, the IRS released Notice 2020-75, which announced that the </font><font>Treasury
and IRS intend to issue clarifying regulations with respect to such pass-through taxes.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>As part of the State’s continuing response to Federal tax law changes, legislation was enacted in FY 2022 to allow an optional </font><font>PTET on the New York-sourced income of partnerships and S corporations. Qualifying entities that elect to pay PTET will pay
</font><font>a tax of up to 10.9 percent on their taxable income at the partnership or corporation level, and their individual partners, </font><font>members and shareholders will receive a refundable PIT credit equal to the proportionate or pro rata share of axes paid by
</font><font>the electing entity. Additionally, the program includes a resident tax credit that allows for reciprocity with other states that </font><font>have implemented substantially similar taxes, which currently include Connecticut and New Jersey.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>In December 2021, electing entities began making estimated PTET payments that were classified as business taxes and </font><font>totaled $16.4 billion in FY 2022. The accompanying tax credits result in decreased PIT collections beginning in April 2022.
</font><font>DOB expects that the PTET will, on a multi-year basis, be revenue neutral for the State. However, because the PTET credits </font></div> </div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>are not necessarily realized by taxpayers within
the same fiscal year that PTET revenue is received by the State, the PTET will </font><font>not be revenue-neutral to the State within each fiscal year. The Updated Financial Plan includes an
estimate for PTET within </font><font>business taxes and the corresponding decrease in PIT receipts. Additionally, it has reserved PTET collected in FY 2022 for </font><font>purposes of offsetting the decrease in PIT receipts expected in FY 2023 and beyond. It is expected that the tax benefit
</font><font>accompanying the PTET program will end in 2025 due to the scheduled expiration of the State and Local Tax (SALT) cap </font><font>under current Federal law. Therefore, the estimates in the Updated Financial Plan reflect the likelihood that entities cease to </font><font>participate in the later years of the Financial Plan period.</font></div> <div> <div><font>PTET is expected to reduce FY 2023 PIT collections by $18.8 billion and reduce all funds receipts by a net amount of $5.9
</font><font>billion, due to timing. PIT credits may be claimed on the April tax return in the following fiscal year, or they can be reflected </font><font>sooner through reductions in current estimated payments. In 2021, taxpayers could not reduce their current estimated PIT
</font><font>payments for PTET, because enrollment in the PTET was not completed until late 2021 and affected taxpayers were not </font><font>statutorily authorized to do so. Going forward, some taxpayers are expected to choose this option. FY 2023 PIT collections
</font><font>are expected to be reduced by credits for both the full amount of tax year 2021 PTET collections (through extensions and </font><font>refunds) and a portion of tax year 2022 PTET collections (through reductions in current estimated PIT payments).</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The net impact of PTET declines in FY 2024 but is expected to reduce FY 2024 PIT collections
by $13.8 billion and reduce all </font><font>funds receipts by a net amount of $2.3 billion.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>FY 2023 State Operating Funds Spending</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>State Operating Funds encompass the General Fund and a wide range of State activities funded from revenue sources </font><font>outside the General Fund, including dedicated tax revenues, tuition, income, fees, and assessments. Activities funded with
</font><font>these dedicated revenue sources often have no direct bearing on the State’s ability to maintain a balanced budget in the </font><font>General Fund but are captured in State Operating Funds.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Local Assistance</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Approximately two-thirds of State spending is for local assistance that includes payments to local governments, school
</font><font>districts, health care providers, managed care organizations, and other entities, as well as financial assistance to, or on behalf </font><font>of, individuals, families, and not-for-profit organizations. School Aid and Medicaid account for more than half of local
</font><font>assistance spending. Over the past two years, local assistance funding includes spending for pandemic recovery initiatives, </font><font>which support time-limited programs including the Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP), Landlord Rental </font><font>Assistance
Program, assistance to excluded workers, small business assistance, funding for hospitals that are experiencing </font><font>financial distress from the COVID- 19 pandemic, public utility
arrears assistance, Healthcare/Direct Care Worker Bonuses, </font><font>and other targeted initiatives. Most of the one-time assistance is expected to be exhausted in FY 2023.</font></div>
</div> <div> <div><font>School Aid spending for School Year (SY) 2024 is estimated at $34.4 billion, excluding
Federal prekindergarten grants, </font><font>representing an annual increase of $3.1 billion (10.0 percent). This annual growth is primarily driven by increased funding for </font><font>Foundation Aid ($2.7 billion), expense-based reimbursement programs ($232 million), and the expansion of State-funded
</font><font>full-day prekindergarten programming for four-year-old children ($125 million). The growth in Foundation Aid reflects the </font><font>full funding of the current formula for the first time in its history, marking the final year of the three-year phase-in, and a </font><font>minimum 3 percent annual increase to fully funded districts that would otherwise not receive a Foundation Aid increase </font><font>under
current law.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Department of Health (DOH) Medicaid local assistance
spending, excluding eFMAP, is estimated at $27.3 billion in FY 2024, </font><font>an annual increase of 7.4 percent. Medicaid costs reported under the Global Cap are projected to increase by
$475 million, </font><font>consistent with the updated growth index. The increased funding will support growth in enrollment and medical cost </font><font>inflation, increased rates to nursing homes, increased homecare wages, expanded access to health coverage, and higher
</font><font>provider reimbursements. The remaining growth is attributable to costs reported outside the Global Cap and is mainly driven </font><font>by minimum wage for health care providers ($188 million) and financial relief to counties and New York City associated with
</font><font>full coverage of the local share of spending growth ($183 million). A portion of Medicaid-related expenses of Office for </font><font>People with Developmental Disabilities (OPWDD) will be funded outside of the DOH Global Cap with additional Financial Plan
</font><font>resources to accommodate DOH Medicaid spending growth.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>State Medicaid spending is also affected by the Federal government’s increased share of Medicaid funding through eFMAP.
</font><font>Beginning January 1, 2020, the Federal government increased its share by 6.2 percent, which will be phased out by the end of </font></div> </div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>the 2023 calendar year. Beginning April 1, 2023,
eFMAP will be reduced for each of the three quarters to 5 percent through </font><font>June 30, 2.5 percent through September 30, and 1.5 percent through December 31. The estimated State
benefit of the </font><font>eFMAP in FY 2023 and FY 2024 is $3.7 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. State share savings from eFMAP have and </font><font>continue to be used to offset increased costs associated with persistently elevated COVID related enrollment, asylum seekers
</font><font>services and assistance, and lost Medicaid Redesign Team II (MRT II) savings due to Federal restrictions regarding program </font><font>restructuring while the eFMAP remained in place. These costs and most of the eFMAP are outside of the Global Cap and are
</font><font>funded through the Mental Hygiene Stabilization Fund.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Mental Hygiene spending growth provides increased support for targeted investments in services to ensure individuals with
</font><font>developmental disabilities, mental illness, substance use disorders and problem gambling have appropriate access to care. </font><font>The increases include continued support for prior year initiatives, such as implementation of the nationwide 988 Suicide and
</font><font>Crisis Lifeline, OPWDD housing subsidy enhancements, and Office of Mental Health (OMH) residential investments.
</font><font>Additional funding is included for a 2.5 percent human services COLA, new costs associated with indexing the minimum </font><font>wage to inflation, establishing and operating 3,500 new OMH residential units, increased support for youth suicide
</font><font>prevention programs and other evidence-based programs serving children, and enhanced mental health services in schools.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Spending for transportation is projected to increase significantly due to one-time funding to
the MTA to address </font><font>extraordinary financial impacts resulting from the pandemic ($300 million), increases to upstate transit operating aid and </font><font>forecasted increases in dedicated receipts that are collected by the State and remitted to the various transit systems.
</font><font>Including one-time aid, total year to year increases are expected to provide an additional $560 million to the MTA, $40 </font><font>million for non-MTA downstate transit systems, and $18 million for upstate transit systems. The remaining increases reflect a
</font><font>new Innovative Mobility Initiative for non-MTA transit systems and funding for the State share of operating costs for the </font><font>Gateway Development Commission.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Social Services increases include funding for services and assistance to New York City for asylum seekers in FY 2024 and
</font><font>increases in child care assistance due to an expanded subsidy eligibility, increased reimbursement for child care providers and </font><font>their workforce, and the creation of an Employer-Supported Child Care Pilot Program. Other Social Services actions include
</font><font>investments in permanency resource centers and kinship services, the consolidation of the Empire State and Advantage </font><font>Afterschool programs under OCFS, assistance for foster care agencies transitioning under Federal requirements, and the
</font><font>indexing of the minimum wage. There is also increased funding for Code Blue, New York’s emergency weather safety plan, </font><font>and increases in the Empire State Supportive Housing Initiative (ESSHI). Payments for the child welfare program will continue
</font><font>to support local districts' services and the year-to-year decline in such spending is attributable to the timing of such </font><font>payments.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Higher
education spending is projected to grow by 4.9 percent in FY 2024, primarily reflecting estimated increases in </font><font>spending for student financial aid programs, including the continued
expansion of TAP for part-time students, and increased </font><font>operating support for CUNY senior colleges.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Increased funding for other education programs largely reflects the continuation of increased
State support for special </font><font>education programs related to approval of an 11 percent COLA for provider tuition rates for SY 2023 and enrollment growth </font><font>for such programs, as well as increased costs to reimburse school districts for charter school supplemental tuition and
</font><font>increased payments to New York City for charter school facilities aid. These increases are partially offset by the </font><font>discontinuation of one-time additions to the FY 2023 Enacted Budget.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Other local assistance spending growth includes additional funding for energy affordability; criminal justice programs
</font><font>including Aid to Prosecution, Alternatives to Incarceration (ATI) and Gun Involved Violence Elimination (GIVE) programs; </font><font>pretrial services; and Fentanyl abuse prevention. This increased spending is more than offset by time-limited pandemic
</font><font>recovery initiatives including small business assistance, public utility arrears assistance, and one time funding for the Office of </font><font>Cannabis Management Social Equity Fund and world university games.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>State Operations/General State Charges (GSCs)</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Operating costs for State agencies include salaries, wages, fringe benefits, and Non-Personal Service (NPS) costs (e.g.,
</font><font>supplies, utilities) and comprise about a quarter of State Operating Funds spending.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Operational spending for executive agencies is affected by the timing of Federal reimbursement for State incurred pandemic </font><font>response and recovery efforts; and the payment of salary increases pursuant to existing contracts, including retroactive salary </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>increases. FY 2024 spending includes increased
spending to support asylum seekers services and assistance efforts, four </font><font>State Police recruiting classes, lead abatement, and the opening of new inpatient beds in State-operated
Psychiatric Centers.</font></div> <div> <div><font>University systems spending growth in FY 2024 reflects
expected State payments related to the establishment of a $500 </font><font>million SUNY Endowment Fund to match new philanthropic contributions to the endowments of SUNY’s university
centers. </font><font>Among other purposes, the earnings on these funds will provide long-term support for campus operations, student </font><font>scholarships, endowed professorships, innovative research, and the development of new academic fields. It also includes a
</font><font>one-time investment of $75 million for transformational initiatives at SUNY campuses that support innovation, help meet the </font><font>workforce needs of the future, and provide needed supports to students. In addition, the Updated Financial Plan includes $60
</font><font>million in new recurring operating aid support for SUNY State-operated campuses and $21 million in additional funding to </font><font>help cover student tuition costs in response to proposed tuition changes at SUNY campuses.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The operating costs for the offices of independently elected officials (Attorney General, Comptroller, Judiciary, and </font><font>Legislature) are projected to increase by a combined $100 million (3.6 percent). The increase is primarily due to planned
</font><font>increases for personnel and contract costs.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Growth in GSCs spending is primarily attributable to cost increases for health insurance, driven by medical cost inflation and
</font><font>projected utilization growth following delayed medical visits and procedures during the pandemic, and pension benefits for </font><font>current and retired employees. This annual growth is entirely offset by the advance payment to the State’s Retiree Health </font><font>Insurance Trust Fund of $600 million in FY 2023. The State’s annual pension payment is projected to grow by $200 million.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Other Matters Affecting the Financial Plan</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The Updated Financial Plan is subject to economic, social, financial, political, public health, and environmental risks and </font><font>uncertainties, many of which are outside the ability of the State to predict or control. The projections of receipts and
</font><font>disbursements in the Updated Financial Plan are based on reasonable assumptions at the time they were prepared, but DOB </font><font>is unable to provide any assurance that actual results will not differ materially and adversely from these projections.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The Updated Financial Plan is based on numerous assumptions including the condition of the
State and national economies, </font><font>and the collection of economically sensitive tax receipts in the amounts projected. Uncertainties and risks that may affect </font><font>economic and receipts forecasts include, but are not limited to, national and international events; inflation; consumer
</font><font>confidence; commodity prices; supply chain disruptions; major terrorist events; hostilities or war; climate change and </font><font>extreme weather events; severe epidemic or pandemic events; cybersecurity threats; Federal funding laws and regulations;
</font><font>financial sector compensation; monetary policy affecting interest rates and the financial markets; credit rating agency </font><font>actions; financial and real estate market developments which may adversely affect bonus income and capital gains
</font><font>realizations; technology industry developments and employment; effect of household debt on consumer spending and State </font><font>tax collections; and outcomes of litigation and other claims affecting the State.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Litigation against the State may include, among other things, potential challenges to the constitutionality of various actions. </font><font>The State may also be affected by adverse decisions that are he result of various lawsuits. Such adverse decisions may not
</font><font>meet the materiality threshold to warrant a description herein but, in the aggregate, could still adversely affect the Updated </font><font>Financial Plan</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The Updated Financial Plan is subject to various uncertainties and contingencies including, but not limited to, wage and </font><font>benefit increases for State employees that exceed projected annual costs; changes in the size of the State’s workforce;
</font><font>realization of the projected rate of return for pension fund asset assumptions with respect to wages for State employees </font><font>affecting the State's required pension fund contributions; the willingness and ability of the Federal government to provide the </font><font>aid projected in the Updated Financial Plan, including the Federal matching grant for the healthcare/direct care worker bonus
</font><font>program; the ability of the State to implement cost reduction initiatives, including reductions in State agency operations, and </font><font>the success with which the State controls expenditures; unanticipated growth in Medicaid program costs; and the ability of
</font><font>the State and its public authorities to issue securities successfully in public credit markets. Some of these issues are described </font><font>in more detail herein. The projections and assumptions contained in the Updated Financial Plan are subject to revisions
</font><font>which may result in substantial changes. No assurance can be given that these estimates and projections, which depend in </font><font>part upon actions the State expects to be taken but which are not within the State's control, will be realized.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>DOB routinely executes cash management actions to manage the State’s large and complex
budget. These actions are </font><font>intended to improve the State’s cash flow, manage resources within and across State fiscal years, adhere to spending targets, </font></div> </div>

<div> <div><font>and better position the State to address
unanticipated costs, including economic downturns, revenue deterioration, and </font><font>unplanned expenditures. In recent years, the State has prepaid certain payments, subject to available
resources, to maintain </font><font>budget flexibility.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Climate Change</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Climate change poses significant long-term threats to physical, biological, and economic systems in New York and around </font><font>the
world. Potential hazards and risks related to climate change for the State include, among other things, rising sea levels, </font><font>increased coastal flooding and related erosion hazards,
intensifying storms, and more extreme heat. The potential effects of </font><font>climate change could adversely impact the Updated Financial Plan in current or future years. To mitigate and
manage these </font><font>impacts, significant long-term planning and investments by the Federal government, the State, municipalities, and public </font><font>utilities are expected to be needed to adapt existing infrastructure.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In August 2021, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of the United Nations (IPCC) reported that 1.5°C of warming
</font><font>is likely to occur by 2040 under all emissions scenarios considered and that the 1.5°C benchmark will be exceeded by 2100 </font><font>unless deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions occur in the coming decades. Human-induced climate change is </font><font>already
affecting many weather extremes in every region across the globe. Further warming is expected to increase the risk </font><font>of adverse outcomes, including extreme weather events and coastal
flooding.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Storms affecting the State, including Hurricane Ida (September
2021), Superstorm Sandy (October 2012), Tropical Storm Lee </font><font>(September 2011), and Hurricane Irene (August 2011), have demonstrated vulnerabilities in the State’s
infrastructure </font><font>(including mass transit systems, power transmission and distribution systems, and other critical lifelines) to extreme weather </font><font>driven events, including coastal flooding caused by storm surges and flash floods from rainfall.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The State continues to recover from damage sustained during these powerful storms. Hurricane Irene disrupted power and </font><font>caused extensive flooding in various counties. Tropical Storm Lee caused flooding in additional counties, and, in some cases,
</font><font>exacerbated damage caused by Hurricane Irene two weeks earlier. Superstorm Sandy struck the East Coast, causing
</font><font>widespread infrastructure damage and economic losses to the greater New York region. Hurricane Ida caused severe flooding </font><font>in the New York metropolitan area. The frequency and intensity of these storms present economic and financial risks to the
</font><font>State. Reimbursement claims for costs of the immediate response, recovery, and future mitigation efforts continue, largely </font><font>supported by Federal funds.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Rating agencies are incorporating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors into their credit analysis for the State
</font><font>and other issuers. Rising sea levels and their effect on coastal infrastructure have been identified as the primary climate risks </font><font>for the northeastern United States, including New York State. These risks are heightened by population and critical
</font><font>infrastructure concentration in coastal counties. In June 2021, Moody’s first assigned New York State an environmental issuer </font><font>profile score of E-3 (moderately negative), below the nationwide median score of E-2 (neutral to low). The E-3 score reflected
</font><font>Moody’s assessment that the State faces moderately negative exposure to physical climate risks, especially hurricanes and </font><font>sea level rise, which could cause significant economic disruption and pose risks to the State’s economy and tax base. In
</font><font>March 2022, S&amp;P assigned New York State an environmental issuer profile score of E-3 (moderately negative) due to the risk </font><font>of coastal flooding in New York City and Long Island, which S&amp;P equates to risk exposure affecting about 40 percent of the
</font><font>State’s population and roughly half of its jobs. The S&amp;P report cited the risk that a climate-related natural disaster could </font><font>disrupt the State’s economy and budgetary balance. The release of issuer ESG scores by the rating agencies does not cause a </font><font>change in the State’s overall credit ratings, which are based on financial information in addition to the ESG component.
</font><font>Climate change risks increasingly fall within the maximum maturity term of current outstanding bonds of the State, its public </font><font>authorities, and municipalities. State bonds may generally be issued with a term of up to 30 years under State statute.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The State is participating in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate the risk
of severe impacts from climate </font><font>change. In 2019, the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) was signed into law. The CLCPA set the </font><font>State on a path toward developing regulations to reduce statewide greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent below the 1990
</font><font>level by 2030, and 85 percent below the 1990 level by 2050. Additionally, in accordance with the CLCPA, the State plans to </font><font>generate a minimum of 70 percent of electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and to fully transition its electricity sector
</font><font>away from carbon emissions by 2040. There can be no assurances that such goals will ultimately be achieved.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The CLCPA created the Climate Action Council (CAC), which was tasked with developing a
Scoping Plan with </font><font>recommendations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase renewable energy usage, and promote climate justice. The </font><font>CAC approved and adopted the final Scoping Plan on December 19, 2022. Pursuant to the CLCPA, by January 1, 2024 the </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Department of Environmental Conservation is
required to draft and circulate enforceable rules and regulations that are </font><font>consistent with meeting the CLCPA's statewide greenhouse gas emission limits.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>Concurrently, the State has been taking regulatory and legislative actions that are intended
to limit greenhouse gas </font><font>emissions, electrify transportation, and generate more electricity from renewable sources. There can be no assurances that </font><font>such actions, or their intended outcomes, will be realized as planned. Major regulatory and legislative actions include:</font></div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Requiring new off-road vehicles and equipment sold in New York to be zero-emissions by 2035 and
new medium-duty </font><font>and heavy-duty vehicles to be zero-emissions by 2045;</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Requiring the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority to formulate the
creation of a zero-emissions </font><font>vehicle development strategy in 2023;</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Mandating that by no later than July 1, 2027, school districts and private transportation
contractors purchase or lease </font><font>only zero-emission school buses when purchasing or leasing new school buses, with full fleet conversion and operation </font><font>of zero-emission school buses required by July 1, 2035;</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Enacting the
</font><font>“</font><font>Advanced Building Codes, Appliance and Equipment Efficiency Standards Act of 2022</font><font>”</font><font> to align the State's </font><font>energy code with its
climate policies and strengthen efficiency standards for appliances;</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Appropriating $500 million to advance the offshore wind industry; and</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Amending the Clean Energy Standard to reflect CLCPA targets.</font></div> </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <div><font>In addition, New York State has
been a member of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which utilizes a cap-and-trade </font><font>mechanism to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from electric power plants operating within
each participating state since </font><font>2008.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>During the November 2022 general election, New York State voters approved the Clean Water, Clean Air, and Green Jobs Bond
</font><font>Act. The $4.2 billion bond act will support capital improvements and enhancements in the following areas: flood risk </font><font>reduction/restorations; open space, working lands conservation, and recreation; climate change mitigation; and water quality
</font><font>improvement and resilient infrastructure.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>COVID-19 Pandemic</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Important State revenue sources, including personal income, consumption, and business tax collections, may be adversely
</font><font>affected by the long-term impact of COVID-19 on a range of activities and behaviors, including commuting patterns, remote </font><font>working and education, business activity, social gatherings, tourism, public transportation, and aviation. It is not possible to </font><font>assess or forecast the effects of such changes at this time.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to changes in the behavior of resident and nonresident taxpayers. Consistent </font><font>with
the growth in remote work arrangements, many residents and non-residents are no longer commuting into New York </font><font>City and instead are working remotely from home offices. However,
under long-standing State policy, a non-resident working </font><font>from home pays New York income taxes on wages from a New York employer unless that employer has established the
non-resident’s</font><font> home office as a bona fide office of the employer.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The COVID-19 pandemic also led some New York residents to shelter in locations outside of the State. In addition, some </font><font>taxpayers who previously resided in New York have permanently relocated outside of the State during the pandemic. The </font><font>State
continues to monitor the data to understand whether these trends are transitory.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>There can be no assurance that existing and future COVID-19 variants will not adversely impact the State’s financial
</font><font>condition. State officials continue to closely monitor global COVID-19 impacts and emerging Federal guidance.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Federal Policy and Funding</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The Federal government influences the economy and budget of New York State through grants, direct spending on its own </font><font>programs such as Medicare and Social Security, and through Federal tax policy. Federal policymakers may place conditions </font><font>on
grants, mandate certain state actions, preempt state laws, change SALT bases and taxpayer behavior through tax policies, </font><font>and influence industries through regulatory action. Federal
resources support vital services such as health care, education, </font><font>and transportation, as well as severe weather and emergency response and recovery. Any changes to Federal policy or
</font><font>funding levels could have a materially adverse impact on the Updated Financial Plan.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Federal funding is a significant component of New
York’s budget representing more than one-third of All Funds spending. </font><font>Routine Federal aid supports programs for vulnerable populations and those living at or near the poverty
level. Such </font><font>programs include Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Elementary and Secondary Education Act </font><font>(ESEA) Title I grants, and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) grants. Other Federal resources are directed at
</font><font>infrastructure and public protection.</font></div> <div> <div><font>In response to the COVID-19 PHE, the Federal government has taken legislative, administrative, and Federal Reserve actions
</font><font>intended to stabilize financial markets, extend aid to large and small businesses, health care providers, and individuals, and </font><font>reimburse governments for the direct costs of pandemic response. The Federal government enacted several laws between </font><font>March
2020 and March 2021 to provide financial assistance to state and local governments, schools, hospitals, transit </font><font>systems, businesses, families and individuals for COVID-19 pandemic
response and recovery. The State also received </font><font>additional Federal aid in the form of enhanced Unemployment Insurance funding, which is reported under Proprietary and </font><font>Fiduciary Funds and is excluded from All Governmental Funds.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Total Federal Funds spending for all purposes, inclusive of both capital and operating
spending, is expected to total $83.9 </font><font>billion in FY 2024 and includes $11 billion in spending identified as pandemic assistance. The reporting of certain program </font><font>spending related to the pandemic is included in the agency disbursements, the largest of which include Disproportionate
</font><font>Share Hospital (DSH), CHP, eFMAP, IDEA, and the TANF Pandemic Emergency Fund. Federal Funds spending estimated in FY </font><font>2024 continues to include significant pandemic assistance funds for education, eFMAP related to the extension of the COVID
</font><font>eFMAP phase down, and Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) eFMAP, as well as Federal reimbursement of
</font><font>pandemic related spending incurred in prior fiscal years. Federal Funds spending programs are summarized below.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Medicaid/Health. Funding shared by the Federal government helps support health care costs for
over nine million New </font><font>Yorkers, including more than two million children. Medicaid is the single largest category of Federal funding. The Federal </font><font>government also provides support for several health programs administered by DOH, including the EP, which provides </font><font>health
care coverage for low-income individuals who do not qualify for Medicaid or CHP.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Social Services. Federal funding helps with several programs managed by OTDA, including TANF-funded public </font><font>assistance
benefits and the Flexible Fund for Family Services, Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP), Supplemental </font><font>Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and Child Support. Funding from the
Federal government also supports programs </font><font>managed by OCFS, including Child Care, Child Welfare Services, Adult Protective &amp; Domestic Violence Services, Foster </font><font>Care, and Adoption Subsidies.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Education. Federal funding supports K-12 education, special education and Higher Education. Like Medicaid and the </font><font>social
services programs, significant portions of Federal education funding are directed toward vulnerable New Yorkers, </font><font>such as students in schools with high poverty levels, students with
disabilities, and higher education students who </font><font>qualify for programs such as Pell grants and Work-Study.</font></div> </div> <div> </div>
</div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Public Protection. Federal funding supports various programs and operations of the State
Police, the Department of </font><font>Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS), the Office of Victim Services, the Division of Homeland Security and </font><font>Emergency Services (DHSES), and DMNA. Federal funds are also passed on to municipalities to support a variety of </font><font>public

Federal resources support infrastructure investments in highway and transit systems throughout the </font><font>State, including funding participation in ongoing transportation capital plans.
The recently enacted Infrastructure </font><font>Investment and Jobs Act (P.L. 117-58) increases the amount of Federal resources available to the State to fund capital </font><font>costs associated with transportation projects.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>All Other. Other programs supported by Federal resources include housing, economic development,

<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Child Care Funds. The CARES, Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations
(CRRSA), and ARP Acts </font><font>granted additional funding to aid in stabilizing the childcare sector.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Education ARP Funds. The ARP granted additional education funding for Elementary and Secondary

<div> <div><font>the PHE. The enhanced funding
began on January 1, 2020, and pursuant to the 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act </font><font>signed into law on December 29, 2022, will be phased out by the end of December 2023: eFMAP will
be reduced to 5 </font><font>percent from April 1, 2023 through June 30, 2023, to 2.5 percent from July 1, 2023 through September 30, 2023, and to </font><font>1.5 percent from October 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023. The Updated Executive Budget Financial Plan projects a </font><font>benefit
to the State of $3.7 billion in FY 2023 and $1.5 billion in FY 2024 through this enhanced Federal funding.</font></div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>ARP HCBS eFMAP. The ARP also provided a temporary 10 percentage point increase to the FMAP for certain Medicaid </font><font>HCBS through
March 31, 2022. In accordance with Maintenance of Effort requirements on ARP HCBS eFMAP eligibility, </font><font>the State has delayed the implementation of certain MRT II savings actions so
that the State can receive an estimated </font><font>$2.4 billion in eFMAP for HCBS expenditures across health and mental hygiene programs ($975 million in FY 2023 and </font><font>$1.5 billion in FY 2024). CMS guidelines require the use of additional funding to supplement existing State funding, not
</font><font>supplant existing resources, and the State has until March 31, 2024 to expend its earned eFMAP in accordance with the </font><font>submitted spending plan.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The State, as required by CMS, submitted an initial spending plan and narrative detailing the use of the temporary </font><font>eFMAP on July 8, 2021. Following, the initial submission, CMS requires states to submit quarterly spending plan updates </font><font>and
semi-annual spending plan narratives. Accordingly, the State submitted spending plans on October 18, 2021, </font><font>February 15, 2022, May 6, 2022, July 28, 2022, October 31, 2022, and
February 7, 2023. Updates to the spending plan will </font><font>continue to be submitted in accordance with the reporting requirements. To date, CMS provided a partial spending plan </font><font>approval of 40 out of 42 proposals, and the State will continue working with CMS to receive full approval.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Education Supplemental Appropriations Act. As part of CRRSA, additional funding for education
was provided through </font><font>the ESSER Fund and the Governor’s Emergency Education Relief (GEER) Fund, including dedicated GEER funds to </font><font>support pandemic-related services and assistance to nonpublic schools through the EANS program.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>ERAP. The CRRSA Act established the ERAP to assist households that are unable to pay rent and
utilities due to the </font><font>COVID-19 pandemic. The ARP provided additional funding for the program.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Education CARES Act Funds. Additional education support provided through the CARES Act included
funding to school </font><font>districts and charter schools.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>SUNY State-Operated Campuses Federal Stimulus Spending. Funding provided through various

</div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>FEMA Reimbursement of Eligible Pandemic Expenses. The State has applied for FEMA reimbursement
for expenses </font><font>incurred to date related to emergency protective measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including home test kits for </font><font>schools. The Updated Financial Plan assumes reimbursement of $800 million in FY 2023, $425 million in FY 2024, and </font><font>$225
million in FY 2025. However, there is no assurance that FEMA will approve claims for the State to receive </font><font>reimbursement in the amounts or State fiscal years as projected in the
Updated Financial Plan.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>FEMA Local
Pass-Through Funding. Funding from this program is assumed to flow through the Updated Financial Plan </font><font>to reimburse local entities for their Federal share of COVID-19 claims
submitted to FEMA.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Coronavirus Local
Fiscal Recovery Fund Non-Entitlement Pass-Through. The ARP requires states to pass-through the </font><font>allocations to non-entitlement cities, towns, and villages. The State distributed
$387 million to local governments in FY </font><font>2022 and distributed an additional $387 million to local governments in FY 2023, for a total of $774 million overall.</font></div> </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Homeowner

<div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>HEAP. The ARP
provided supplemental funding to the existing HEAP that helps low-income households pay the cost of </font><font>heating, cooling, and weatherizing their homes.</font></div> </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Coronavirus
Capital Projects Fund. The ARP created the Coronavirus Capital Projects Fund to provide funding to carry </font><font>out critical capital projects that directly enable work, education, and
health monitoring, including remote options, in </font><font>response to the COVID-19 PHE. The State has been allocated $345 million for the program.</font></div> </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>State Small

<div> <div><font>The Federal government enacted the following
legislation in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The table below </font><font>summarizes the total amount of Federal pandemic assistance available to New York State, including direct
recipients of </font><font>Federal aid such as individuals, hospitals, businesses, transit authorities including the MTA, and school districts, along with </font><font>the funds expected to flow through the Updated Financial Plan.</font></div> <div> <div><font>A large portion of the Federal pandemic assistance flows directly to various recipients (e.g., tax rebates to individuals, and
</font><font>loans or grants to large and small businesses) and is thus excluded from the Updated Financial Plan. In addition, on May 18, </font><font>2021, the State received $12.75 billion in Federal aid authorized in the ARP to offset revenue loss, ensure the continuation of </font><font>essential services and assistance provided by government, and assist in the PHE response and recovery efforts. These funds
</font><font>are expected to be transferred to State Funds over multiple years to support eligible uses and spending. Thus, the spending </font><font>of the ARP aid to the State does not appear in Federal funds.</font></div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>CARES Act provides aid for Federal agencies, individuals, businesses, states, and localities, as well as $100 billion for
</font><font>hospitals and health care providers, to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <div><font>Assistance to
states through the CARES Act is generally restricted to specific purposes and includes the CRF ($5.1 billion </font><font>State allocation) and the Education Stabilization Fund ($1.2 billion
State allocation). Pursuant to U.S. Treasury eligibility </font><font>guidelines, CRF funds allocated to the State were used for eligible expenses incurred, including payroll expenses for
</font><font>public health and safety employees, through December 31, 2021.</font></div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>FFCRA provides aid through paid sick leave, free testing, expanded food assistance and unemployment benefits, </font><font>protections
for health care workers, and increased Medicaid funding through the emergency 6.2 percent increase to the </font><font>Medicaid eFMAP during the PHE. Beginning January 1, 2023, the Consolidated
Appropriations Act delinks the eFMAP </font><font>from the PHE and provides for a phase-out of enhanced funding over nine months.</font></div> </div> <div>
</div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>ARP Act of 2021 provides aid for Federal agencies, individuals, businesses, states and
localities, and others, to respond to </font><font>the COVID-19 pandemic. The ARP has provided the State with $12.75 billion in general aid (</font><font>“</font><font>recovery aid</font><font>”</font><font>) and $19.2 </font><font>billion in categorical aid for schools, universities, childcare, housing, and other purposes. The ARP also
provides $10 </font><font>billion in recovery aid to localities in New York State and $7 billion directly to the MTA. The State aid provided through </font><font>the ARP is included in the Updated Financial Plan as a deposit of Federal aid to the General Fund to offset revenue loss,
</font><font>ensure the continuation of essential services and assistance provided by government, and assist with the PHE response </font><font>and recovery efforts. These funds are expected to be transferred to State Funds over multiple years to support eligible </font><font>uses
and spending.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><font>Finally, the ARP established a Capital Projects Fund to provide funding to states, territories, and Tribal governments to
</font><font>carry out critical capital projects directly enabling work, education, and health monitoring, including remote options, in </font><font>response to the PHE. The State has also been allocated $345 million from the Coronavirus Capital Projects Fund.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>The CRRSA Act of 2021 provided funding for education, testing, tracing, vaccine distribution,
unemployment assistance, </font><font>small business programs, and housing.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>FEMA Lost Wages Assistance (LWA) provided grants to eligible claimants that were unemployed or
partially unemployed </font><font>due to the pandemic.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>The Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act provides funding for small
business programs and </font><font>healthcare programs, including $75 billion for hospitals, health care providers, and testing and tracing activities.</font></div> </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Coronavirus
Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act (CPRSA) of 2020 provides emergency </font><font>funding to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, including support for vaccine development,
the PHE Preparedness </font><font>program, and small businesses.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div>
<div> <div><font>In addition, the pandemic has resulted in a significant increase in individuals filing for
unemployment benefits. Such benefits </font><font>are paid from the Unemployment Insurance (UI) Trust Fund, which is supported by employer contributions. If there are </font><font>insufficient resources in the UI Trust Fund to pay benefits, as became the case starting in May 2020, the UI Trust Fund may
</font><font>borrow from the Federal government for this purpose. As of December 31, 2022, the UI Trust Fund’s Federal loan balance was </font><font>approximately $7.97 billion. The balance in the UI Trust Fund is expected to be repaid by employers through UI contribution
</font><font>rates. </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font> </font><font>Federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA)</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>In November 2021, Congress passed, and the President signed, the $1.2 trillion IIJA,
including approximately $550 billion in </font><font>new authorized spending nationally on transportation, water, energy, broadband and natural resources.</font></div> </div> </div>

<div> <div><font>The IIJA is expected to provide the State with an
additional $4.6 billion in highway and bridge program aid over the life of the </font><font>Federal Aid Highway program reauthorization, as well as significant off-budget funds available across
the State for transit, </font><font>rail, airport, water, and energy grid infrastructure. The annual levels of funds to the State from the IIJA are subject to Federal </font><font>budget and appropriation action in each year. </font></div> <div> <div><font> </font><font>Federal Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>In August 2022, Congress passed, and the President signed, the $437 billion IRA (H.R. 5376),
including approximately $374 </font><font>billion in energy and climate provisions, tax credits for electric vehicles and incentives for clean-energy projects. It also </font><font>contains health subsidies and drought relief while raising about $740 billion in revenue over ten years, funded through new
</font><font>taxes on corporations as well as stepped-up enforcement by the Internal Revenue Service.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Most spending in the IRA is likely to flow directly to individuals and businesses. The legislation also directs money to support </font><font>states’ climate plans and energy efficiency initiatives. The level of funds the State will receive from the IRA may be subject to </font><font>eligibility criteria of competitive grant processes. </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font> </font><font>Federal Risks</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The amount and composition of Federal funds received by the State have changed over time
because of legislative and </font><font>regulatory actions at the Federal level and will likely continue to change over the Financial Plan period. The Updated Financial </font><font>Plan may also be adversely affected by other Federal government actions including audits, disallowances, and changes to
</font><font>Federal participation rates or other Medicaid rules. Any reductions in Federal aid could have a materially adverse impact on </font><font>the Updated Financial Plan. Notable areas with potential for changes in Federal funding include health care and human
</font><font>services.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>CMS 1115 Waiver Extension. The State submitted an 1115 waiver extension request to CMS that preserves current Medicaid
</font><font>Managed Care Programs, Children’s HCBS, and self-direction of personal care services. This waiver was approved on March </font><font>31, 2022 and is effective for five years.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Separately, DOH has developed a new programmatic amendment to the now-renewed 1115 waiver, titled New York Health </font><font>Equity
Reform (NYHER): Making Targeted, Evidence-Based Investments to Address the Health Disparities Exacerbated by the </font><font>COVID-19 Pandemic. This request seeks approximately $13.5 billion
in Federal funding over five years to invest in an array of </font><font>initiatives that would change the way the Medicaid program integrates and pays for social, physical, and behavioral
health </font><font>care in New York State.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>After working directly with CMS and stakeholders on concepts contained in this new programmatic waiver amendment, in
</font><font>accordance with Federal transparency requirements, DOH submitted a Federal public notice to the New York State Registry </font><font>on April 13, 2022 and held two public hearings on May 3, 2022 and May 10, 2022. The presentation slides, recordings, and
</font><font>transcripts from both webinars are available on the DOH website. The 30-day public comment period closed on May 20, </font><font>2022 and another public hearing was held on September 28, 2022.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>During the public comment period, DOH received 358 written comment submissions and heard from 75 speakers at the </font><font>three
public hearings. DOH has worked with partner agencies to review and evaluate the approximately 1,800 comments </font><font>received and incorporated feedback from stakeholders where possible
and appropriate. DOH formally submitted the final </font><font>waiver amendment application on September 2, 2022. CMS deemed the application submission complete on September 15, </font><font>2022, and the Federal public comment period ended on October 19, 2022, during which 298 unique comments were </font><font>submitted via
the Medicaid.gov portal.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>After submission to CMS, the review and approval
process can take several months or longer. However, DOH is actively </font><font>working with CMS to achieve an approval as expeditiously as possible. DOH plans to begin the five-year waiver
</font><font>demonstration period upon approval from CMS. Program implementation will begin once the amendment, or components of </font><font>the amendment, is approved and special terms and conditions are received from CMS.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Healthcare/Direct Care Worker Bonus. The Updated Financial Plan assumes that the State will receive Federal approval for </font><font>Federal matching funds for the State program to provide bonus payments to eligible healthcare and direct care workers
</font><font>earning less than $125,000. However, there is considerable risk that CMS may not approve all the Federal matching funds for </font><font>the bonus payments. In the event the Federal matching funds are not approved as assumed, the General Fund would incur
</font><font>unbudgeted costs of up to $1.3 billion over FY 2024 and FY 2025.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>The State has submitted the application for
reimbursement to CMS, and CMS responded on December 6, 2022 seeking </font><font>additional information. The State responded on February 15, 2023, after which CMS has an additional 90 days (May
15, 2023) </font><font>to respond.</font></div> <div> <div><font>In the interim, the State advanced the anticipated Federal share of the bonus payments for claims received to date
</font><font>(approximately $680 million). DOB estimates the Federal share for the entire bonus program to be approximately $1.3 billion. </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font> </font><font>Federal Debt Limit</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>On January 19, 2023 the U.S. reached its debt limit, and the Treasury Secretary subsequently announced that the Treasury
</font><font>would begin extraordinary cash management measures. The Treasury Secretary further indicated that
</font><font>“</font><font>it is unlikely that cash </font><font>and
extraordinary measures will be exhausted before early June.</font><font>”</font><font> Congress would need to act to increase or
suspend the </font><font>debt limit before then to avoid delaying payments and/or defaulting on debt obligations. Congress last acted on debt limit </font><font>legislation in December 2021.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>A Federal government default on payments, particularly for a prolonged period, could have a materially adverse effect on
</font><font>national and state economies, financial markets, and intergovernmental aid payments. Specific effects on the Updated </font><font>Financial Plan resulting from a future Federal government default are unknown and impossible to predict. However, data from
</font><font>past economic downturns suggests that the State’s revenue loss could be substantial if there was an economic downturn </font><font>due to a Federal default.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>A payment default by the Federal government may also adversely affect the municipal bond market. Municipal issuers,
</font><font>including the State and its public authorities and localities, could face higher borrowing costs and impaired access to capital </font><font>markets. This would jeopardize planned capital investments in transportation infrastructure, higher education facilities,
</font><font>hazardous waste remediation, environmental projects, and economic development projects. Additionally, the market for and </font><font>market value of outstanding municipal obligations, including municipal obligations of the State and its public authorities,
</font><font>could be adversely affected. </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font> </font><font>Federal Tax Law Changes</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) made major changes to the Federal Internal Revenue
Code, most of which were </font><font>effective in tax year 2018. The TCJA made extensive changes to Federal PIT, corporate income taxes, and estate taxes.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The State’s income tax system interacts with the Federal system. Changes to the Federal
tax code have significant flow-through</font><font> effects on State tax burdens and concomitantly on State tax receipts. One key impact of the TCJA on New York State </font><font>taxpayers is the $10,000 limit on the deductibility of SALT payments, which, until its scheduled expiration after 2025,
</font><font>represents a large increase in the State’s effective tax rate relative to historical experience and may adversely affect New York </font><font>State’s economic competitiveness.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Moreover, the TCJA contains numerous provisions that may adversely affect residential real estate prices in New York State
</font><font>and elsewhere, of which the SALT deduction limit is the most significant. A loss of wealth associated with a decline in home </font><font>prices could have a significant impact on household spending in the State through the wealth effect, whereby consumers
</font><font>perceive the rise and fall of the value of an asset, such as a home, as a corresponding increase or decline in income, causing </font><font>them to alter their spending practices. Reductions in household spending by New York residents, if they were to occur, would
</font><font>be expected to result in lower sales for the State’s businesses which, in turn, would cause further reductions in economic </font><font>activity and employment. Lastly, falling home prices could result in homeowners delaying the sale of their homes. The
</font><font>combined impact of lower home prices and fewer sales transactions could result in lower real estate transfer tax collections. </font><font>The TCJA changes may intensify migration pressures and decrease the value of home prices, thereby posing risks to the
</font><font>State’s tax base and current Financial Plan projections. </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font> </font><font>State Response to Federal Tax Law Changes</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>PTET. As part of the State’s continuing response to Federal tax law changes and in
connection with the FY 2022 Enacted </font><font>Budget, the State Legislature enacted an optional PTET on the New York- sourced income of partnerships and S corporations. </font><font>Qualifying entities that elect to pay PTET pay a tax of up to 10.9 percent on their taxable income at the partnership or
</font><font>corporation level, and their individual partners, members and shareholders receive a refundable tax credit equal to the </font><font>proportionate or pro rata share of taxes paid by the electing entity. Additionally, the program includes a resident tax credit </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>that allows for reciprocity with other states that
have implemented substantially similar taxes, which currently include </font><font>Connecticut and New Jersey.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>DOB expects that, on a multi-year basis, the PTET will be revenue neutral for the State as individual taxpayers claim credits </font><font>against their PIT liabilities that reflect PTET payments made at the entity level. However, because the PTET credits are not
</font><font>necessarily realized by taxpayers within the same fiscal year that PTET revenue is received by the State, the PTET is not </font><font>revenue-neutral to the State within each fiscal year.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Updated Financial Plan includes estimates for PTET receipts and the corresponding decrease in PIT receipts. The overall
</font><font>effect on projected receipts to the Revenue Bond Tax Fund (RBTF), to which 50 percent of both PIT and PTET receipts are </font><font>deposited, is that PTET increased FY 2022 receipts and is projected to decrease FY 2023 receipts by a significant amount. See
</font><font>the </font><font>“</font><font>PTET – Financial Plan
Impact</font><font>”</font><font> herein for a table summarizing projected PTET receipts and the associated change in </font><font>projected PIT collections. Projections are based on limited experience of taxpayer behavior to date, and there can be no
</font><font>assurance that such projections will be realized.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS have determined that State and local income taxes imposed on and paid by a
</font><font>partnership or an S corporation on its income, such as the PTET, are allowable as a Federal deduction to taxable income. In </font><font>November 2020, the IRS released Notice 2020-75, which announced that the Treasury and IRS intend to issue clarifying
</font><font>regulations with respect to such pass-through taxes. The IRS has not yet issued such proposed regulations.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Charitable Gifts Trust Fund. Other State tax reforms enacted in tax year 2018 to mitigate
issues arising from the TCJA </font><font>included decoupling many State tax provisions from the Federal changes, creation of an optional payroll tax program, the </font><font>Employer Compensation Expense Program (ECEP), and establishment of a new State Charitable Gifts Trust Fund.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The Charitable Gifts Trust Fund was established in tax year 2018 to accept gifts for the purposes of funding health care and </font><font>education in New York State. Taxpayers who itemize deductions were able to claim these charitable contributions as
</font><font>deductions on their Federal and State income tax returns. Any taxpayer who donates may also claim a State tax credit equal </font><font>to 85 percent of the donation amount for the tax year after the donation is made. However, after enactment of this program,
</font><font>the IRS issued regulations that impaired the ability of taxpayers to deduct donations to the Charitable Gifts Trust Fund from </font><font>Federal taxable income while receiving State tax credits for such donations.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Through FY 2022, the State received $93 million in charitable gifts deposited to the Charitable Gifts Trust Fund for healthcare </font><font>and education ($58 million and $35 million, respectively). Charitable Gifts to date have been appropriated and used for the
</font><font>authorized purposes.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>As part of State tax reforms enacted in 2018, taxpayers may claim reimbursement from the State for interest on </font><font>underpayments
of Federal tax liability for the 2019, 2020 and 2021 tax years if the underpayments arise from reliance on the </font><font>2018 amendments to State Tax Law. To receive reimbursement, taxpayers
are required to submit their reimbursement claims </font><font>to DTF within 60 days of making an interest payment to the IRS. To date, the State has not received any claims for </font><font>reimbursement of interest on underpayments of Federal tax liability.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Updated Financial Plan does not include any estimate of the magnitude of the possible interest expense to the State. Any
</font><font>such interest expense would depend on several factors including the rate of participation in the ECEP; magnitude of </font><font>donations to the Charitable Gifts Trust Fund; amount of time between the due date of the Federal return and the date any IRS
</font><font>underpayment determination is issued; Federal interest rate applied; aggregate amount of Federal tax underpayments </font><font>attributable to reliance on the 2018 amendments to State Tax Law; and frequency at which taxpayers submit timely
</font><font>reimbursement claims to the State.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Litigation Challenging Limitation of Charitable Contributions Deductibility. </font><font>On June 13, 2019, the IRS
issued final </font><font>regulations (Treasury Decision 9864) that provided final rules and additional guidance with respect to the availability of </font><font>Federal income tax deductions for charitable contributions when a taxpayer receives or expects to receive a State or local tax
</font><font>credit for such charitable contributions. These regulations require a taxpayer to reduce the Federal charitable contribution </font><font>deduction by the amount of any State tax credit received due to such charitable contribution. This rule does not apply if the
</font><font>value of the State tax credit does not exceed 15 percent of the charitable contribution. Regulations were made retroactive to </font><font>August 27, 2018 (the date on which the U.S. Treasury Department and IRS first published proposed regulatory changes).</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>On July 17, 2019, the State, joined by Connecticut
and New Jersey, filed a Federal lawsuit in the United States District Court for </font><font>the Southern District of New York challenging these charitable contribution regulations. Among other
things, the lawsuit </font><font>seeks to restore the full Federal income tax deduction for charitable contributions, regardless of the amount of any State tax </font><font>credit provided to taxpayers as a result of contributions made to the Charitable Gifts Trust Fund, in accordance with
</font><font>precedent since 1917. The Federal defendants moved to dismiss the complaint or, alternatively, for summary judgment on </font><font>December 23, 2019. The states responded and filed their own motion for summary judgment on February 28, 2020. Briefing </font><font>on
the motions was completed in July 2020. The district court denied the states’ request for oral argument on March 16, </font><font>2021, but a decision on the outstanding motions to
dismiss, and cross-motions for summary judgment, remains pending.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>Major Operating Programs</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Beginning in FY 2012, the State enacted legislation intended to limit the year-to-year growth in the State’s two largest local </font><font>assistance programs, School Aid and Medicaid. </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font> </font><font>School Aid</font><font>. In FY 2012, the State enacted a School Aid growth cap that was intended to limit the growth in School Aid to the </font><font>annual
growth in State Personal Income, as calculated in the Personal Income Growth Index (PIGI). Beginning in FY 2021, the </font><font>statutory PIGI for School Aid was amended to limit School Aid
increases to no more than the average annual income growth </font><font>over a ten-year period. This change reduces volatility in allowable growth and aligns the School Aid cap with the
statutory </font><font>Medicaid cap utilized prior to FY 2023. Prior to FY 2021, the PIGI generally relied on a one-year change in personal income.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The authorized School Aid increases exceeded the indexed levels in FYs 2014 through 2019,
were within the indexed levels in </font><font>FYs 2020 and 2021, and again exceeded the indexed level in FY 2022 and 2023. The proposed increase in School Aid for SY </font><font>2024 of $3.1 billion (10.0 percent) is above the indexed PIGI rate of 4.2 percent. This $3.1 billion increase includes a $2.7
</font><font>billion increase in Foundation Aid</font><font>3</font><font> as part of the final year of the three-year phase-in of the formula and a 3 percent </font><font>“</font><font>due </font><font>minimum</font><font>”</font><font> increase for districts whose annual Foundation Aid levels exceed their full funding level targets. The increase also
</font><font>includes a $125 million investment in State-funded full- day prekindergarten programming for four-year-old children, </font><font>including a $100 million formula- based allocation and a $25 million grant to be competitively awarded. In SY 2025 and
</font><font>beyond, School Aid is projected to increase in line with the rate allowed under the School Aid growth cap.</font>
<hr/> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>3</font></div>
<div><font>Foundation Aid is formula-based, unrestricted aid provided to school districts. It is the
largest aid category within School Aid and is projected to total </font><font>$24.1 billion in SY 2024. The Foundation Aid formula consists of four components: a State-specified expected
expenditure per pupil to which the </font><font>State and districts will contribute, a State- specified expected minimum local contribution per pupil, the number of aid-eligible pupil units in
the </font><font>district, and additional adjustments based on phase-in factors and minimum or maximum increases. </font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div>
<div> <div><font> </font><font>Medicaid</font><font>. Approximately 85 percent of DOH State Funds Medicaid spending growth is subject to the
Global Cap. Prior to FY </font><font>2023, the Global Cap was previously calculated using the ten-year rolling average of the medical component of the CPI for all </font><font>urban consumers and thus allowed for growth attributable to increasing costs, though not increasing utilization. To
</font><font>accommodate growth in factors not currently indexed under the Global Cap and reflect recent trends, beginning in FY 2023, </font><font>the allowable spending growth for activities under the Global Cap is set at the five-year rolling average of health care
</font><font>spending, using projections from the CMS Actuary. The FY 2023 Executive Budget and Enacted Budget utilized the CMS </font><font>Actuary projections issued on March 24, 2020, which were the most recent published data available in developing the
</font><font>Executive Budget proposal and during the legislative budget negotiation period. The FY 2024 Executive Budget incorporates </font><font>multi-year revisions to the index consistent with updated CMS Actuary projections issued on March 28, 2022.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The statutory provisions of the Global Cap grant the Commissioner of Health (the
</font><font>“</font><font>Commissioner</font><font>”</font><font>) certain powers to limit </font><font>Medicaid disbursements to the level authorized by the Global Cap and allow for flexibility in
adjusting Medicaid projections to </font><font>meet unanticipated costs resulting from a disaster. The Commissioner’s powers are intended to limit the annual growth rate </font><font>to the levels set by the Global Cap for the then-current fiscal year, through actions which may include reducing
</font><font>reimbursement rates to providers. These actions may be dependent upon timely Federal approvals and other elements of the </font><font>program that govern implementation. Additional State share Medicaid spending, outside of the Global Cap, includes State
</font><font>costs for the takeover of Medicaid growth from local governments and reimbursement to providers for increased minimum </font><font>wage costs. It should be further noted that General Fund Medicaid spending remains sensitive to revenue performance in the
</font><font>State’s HCRA fund that finances approximately one-quarter of DOH State-share Medicaid costs.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Since the enactment of the Global Cap, the portion of State Funds Medicaid spending subject
to the Global Cap has remained </font><font>at or below indexed levels. However, in certain fiscal years, DOH has taken management actions, including adjustments to </font><font>the timing of Medicaid payments consistent with contractual terms, to ensure compliance with the Global Cap. </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font> </font><font>Public Health Insurance Programs/Public Assistance</font><font>. Historically, the State has experienced growth
in Medicaid enrollment </font><font>and public assistance caseloads during economic downturns due mainly to increases in unemployment. Many people who </font><font>were laid off or otherwise experienced a decrease in family income in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic became
</font><font>qualifying enrollees and began to participate in public health insurance programs such as Medicaid, EP, and Child Health Plus </font><font>(CHP). Participants in these programs remain eligible for coverage for 12 continuous months regardless of changes in
</font><font>employment or income levels that may otherwise make them ineligible. Estimated costs for increased enrollment are
</font><font>budgeted in the Updated Financial Plan through FY 2025. Beginning in June of 2023, the State will begin reprocessing </font><font>eligibility determinations for approximately 9 million public health insurance enrollees to be completed over a fourteen
</font><font>month period, consistent with CMS requirements. Compared to the Mid-Year Financial Plan, Medicaid enrollment is expected </font><font>to be significantly higher than previously forecasted, adding approximately $1.6 billion in new Medicaid costs over the multi-year</font><font> Financial Plan, which is a significant contribution to the reported Medicaid deficits in FY 2026 and FY 2027.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>Likewise, the rise in unemployment and decrease in family income during the pandemic have resulted in increased public </font><font>assistance caseloads, particularly in New York City. In addition to existing family and safety net assistance programs, the FY
</font><font>2023 Enacted Budget included a recurring State-funded rent supplement program to assist individuals and families. </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font> </font><font>Extraordinary Aid to Hospitals</font><font>. The pandemic further stressed the financial stability of hospitals
responsible for supporting </font><font>medical needs in underserved communities across the State, including those with higher rates of uninsured and government </font><font>payor mix. Accordingly, the FY 2023 Enacted Budget committed an additional $800 million in one-time resources in FY 2023, </font><font>in
addition to $984 million in ongoing annual base support, to strengthen the financial position of certain financially </font><font>distressed providers. The importance of the hospital industry
to local communities for purposes of accessing critical health </font><font>care services, as well as other social and economic benefits, creates the potential for increased cost pressure
within the </font><font>Financial Plan should the State continue to assist hospitals.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Opioid Settlement Fund</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The Attorney General (AG) and the Department of Financial Services (DFS) have reached
significant opioid related </font><font>settlements with several corporations for their roles in helping fuel the opioid epidemic.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Johnson &amp;
Johnson, the parent company of Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., is expected to pay the State and its </font><font>subdivisions up to $230 million. The settlement established a multi-year payout
structure of up to ten years </font><font>commencing in April 2022. The first settlement payment of $92.4 million was deposited in the Opioid Settlement Fund </font><font>(Opioid Settlement Fund) in August 2022.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>On September 17, 2021, a Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York entered an Order
confirming a plan, </font><font>including provisions releasing and barring further litigation against Purdue Pharma’s executives and directors. Pursuant </font><font>to that plan, the owners of Purdue Pharma, the Sackler family, were to pay the State and its subdivisions at least $200
</font><font>million as part of a $4.5 billion bankruptcy plan over a nine-year period commencing in 2022. The settlement between </font><font>the State and Purdue Pharma would shut down Purdue Pharma, prevent the Sackler family from participating in the </font><font>opioids
business prospectively, and establish a substantial document repository of 30 million plus documents. Following </font><font>an appeal, on December 16, 2021, a U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York vacated the confirmation of </font><font>Purdue Pharma’s plan. In re: Purdue Pharma L.P., Case No. 21-cv-07532-CM (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 16, 2021). The District
Court </font><font>held that the law does not allow a bankruptcy plan to give releases to individuals who are not bankrupt. Subsequently, </font><font>Purdue Pharma appealed to the Second Circuit, which held oral argument on April 29, 2022.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Drug distributors McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health Inc., and Amerisource Bergen Drug
Corporation will pay the </font><font>State and its subdivisions up to $1.0 billion over 18 years and develop a monitoring mechanism to collect and analyze </font><font>opioid drug distribution. The first settlement payment of $36.3 million was deposited in the New York State Opioid
</font><font>Settlement Fund in March 2022, and payments will continue over the next 17 years.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>

<div><font>Drug manufacturer Endo Health Solutions (Endo) settled for $50 million with New York State (AG

<div><font>The Financial Plan will be updated pending confirmation of the timing and value of the settlements the State will receive. The </font><font>State’s share of the resources will be deposited into the Opioid Settlement Fund. Pursuant to Chapter 190 of the Laws of

</font><font>Money within the Opioid Settlement Fund will be used to supplement funding for substance use disorder prevention,
</font><font>treatment, recovery, and harm reduction services or programs and/or for payment to local governments as a result of their </font><font>participation in such settlements or judgments. Money in the Opioid Settlement Fund must be kept separate and not </font><font>commingled

agreement.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>State Labor Force</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>As of March 31, 2022, the State had approximately 169,200 FTE annual salaried employees funded from All Funds, including </font><font>some part-time and temporary employees, independently-elected agencies and university systems, but excluding seasonal,
</font><font>legislative and judicial employees. The State workforce is projected to total 184,000 positions at the end of FY 2023. The State </font><font>workforce subject to direct Executive control is expected to total 118,802 full time equivalent positions at the end of FY 2023. </font><font>The State workforce peaked in 1990, at approximately 230,000 positions.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Labor Negotiations and Agreements</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The State negotiates multi-year collective bargaining agreements with its unionized workforce
that impact personal service </font><font>and fringe benefit costs. The State recently negotiated a new agreement with the Civil Service Employees Association (CSEA) </font><font>through FY 2026, but all other contracts have expired or will expire by the end of FY 2023.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The State’s agreement with CSEA is for the five-year period from FY 2022 through FY 2026. The agreement maintains general </font><font>salary increases at 2 percent annually for the two-year period through FY 2023, and provides general salary increases of 3
</font><font>percent annually for the three-year period through FY 2026. Additionally, the agreement provides a one-time bonus of </font><font>$3,000, and changes in longevity resulting from changes in the health insurance program that are expected to encourage
</font><font>in-network employee utilization to help control health insurance costs.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The State has commenced labor negotiations with several unions for successor contracts; however, there can be no </font><font>assurance that amounts informally reserved in the Updated Financial Plan for labor settlements and agency operations will </font><font>be
sufficient to fund the cost of future labor contracts.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Judiciary has

<div><font>Pension Contributions</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>State Retirement System (System)</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The System provides pension benefits to public employees of the State and its localities
(except employees of New York City, </font><font>and public school teachers and administrators, who are covered by separate public retirement systems). State employees </font><font>made up about 31 percent of the System’s membership as of March 31, 2022. There were 2,972 public employers
</font><font>participating in the System, including the State, all cities and counties (except New York City), most towns, villages and </font><font>school districts (with respect to non-teaching employees), and many public authorities.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>As of March 31, 2022, 685,450 persons were members of the System, and 507,923 pensioners or beneficiaries were receiving </font><font>pension benefits. Article 5, section 7 of the State Constitution considers membership in any State pension or retirement
</font><font>system to be </font><font>“</font><font>a contractual
relationship, the benefits of which shall not be diminished or impaired.</font><font>”</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Overview</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The State makes annual contributions to the New York State and Local Retirement System (NYSLRS) for employees in the </font><font>New
York State and Local Employees Retirement System (ERS) and the New York State and Local Police and Fire Retirement </font><font>System (PFRS). This section discusses contributions from the
State, including the Judiciary, to the NYSLRS, which account for </font><font>the majority of the State’s pension costs.</font><font>4</font><font> All projections are based on estimated market returns and numerous actuarial </font><font>assumptions which, if unrealized, could adversely and materially affect these projections.</font>
<hr/> </div> </div> <div> <div>

<div><font>The State’s aggregate pension costs also include State employees in the Teachers’
Retirement System (TRS) for both the SUNY and the State </font><font>Education Department (SED), the Optional Retirement Program (OR) for both SUNY and SED, and the New York State Voluntary
Defined </font><font>Contribution Plan (VDC).</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div><font>New York State Retirement and Social Security Law (RSSL) Section 11 directs the actuary for NYSLRS to provide regular </font><font>reports on the Systems’ experience and to propose assumptions and methods for the actuarial valuations. Employer
</font><font>contribution rates for NYSLRS are determined based on investment performance in the Common Retirement Fund and
</font><font>actuarial assumptions recommended by the Retirement System's Actuary and approved by the State Comptroller. Pension </font><font>estimates are based on the actuarial report issued in August 2021.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>On August 25, 2021, the Comptroller announced reductions in employer contribution rates for both ERS and PFRS which will
</font><font>impact payments in FY 2023. This reduction was primarily accomplished by realizing the entire benefit of the FY 2021 </font><font>investment return of 33.55 percent in the valuation of assets available to pay retirement benefits, rather than the standard
</font><font>approach of </font><font>“</font><font>asset smoothing</font><font>”</font><font> the return over a five-year period to guard against volatility in investment returns. This action </font><font>—</font><font> termed </font><font>“</font><font>the market-restart</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>—</font><font> offset the Comptroller's simultaneous action of lowering the long-term assumed
rate of </font><font>return on investments from 6.8 percent to 5.9 percent, which, in and of itself, would have resulted in a substantial increase in </font><font>the FY 2023 employer contribution rates.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>As a result of the Comptroller's actions, the estimated average employer contribution rate for ERS will be lowered from 16.2
</font><font>percent to 11.6 percent of payroll, and the estimated average employer contribution rate for PFRS will be reduced from 28.3 </font><font>percent to 27 percent of payroll. Employers who have previously participated in the Contribution Stabilization Program,
</font><font>including the State, are required to contribute at the higher graded (amortization) rate of 14.1 percent for ERS.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>On September 1, 2022, the Comptroller announced an increase in employer contribution rates
for both ERS and PFRS which </font><font>will impact payments in FY 2024. The average employer contribution rate for ERS increased from 11.6 percent to 13.1 percent </font><font>of payroll, and the average employer contribution rate for PFRS increased from 27 percent to 27.8 percent of payroll. The
</font><font>increase in rates was primarily attributed to salary increases for active members and a 3 percent COLA increase to most </font><font>retirees’ pension benefits. State law requires that COLA payments be calculated based on 50 percent of the annual rate of </font><font>inflation, as measured at the end of the State fiscal year (March 31). The annual COLA increase is required to be at least 1
</font><font>percent, but no more than 3 percent, and is typically applied on up to the first $18,000 of a retiree’s pension.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>In addition to the change in contribution rates, the Comptroller authorized a change in the
asset smoothing methodology </font><font>from five to eight years. Asset smoothing is used to mitigate the impact to employer contribution rates as a result of any </font></div> </div> </div>

<div> <div><font>unexpected gains or losses in annual investment
returns. This is achieved by recognizing any deviation from the assumed </font><font>rate of return, currently at 5.9 percent, in equal proportions. Increasing the asset smoothing methodology
from five to eight </font><font>years will dampen the effects of year-to-year volatility in the Common Retirement Fund’s returns and the impact on employer </font><font>rates.</font></div> <div> <div><font>The Updated
Financial Plan reflects the actuarial changes approved by the Comptroller, including revised ERS/PFRS pension </font><font>estimates of $1.8 billion for FY 2023 and $2 billion for FY 2024 based
on the December 2022 estimate provided by the </font><font>Actuary. Approximately $67 million in pension interest savings was achieved from the payment of the State’s FY 2023 </font><font>ERS/PFRS bill in May 2022.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>This estimate also reflects the payoff of all prior year amortization balances. The ERS (non-Judiciary) and PFRS portion was
</font><font>fully repaid in March 2021, and the Judiciary portion was fully repaid in October 2021. Collectively, this reduced the FY 2023 </font><font>cost by $331 million from prior estimates. The total payoff of outstanding prior-year amortization balances was $1 billion,
</font><font>resulting in interest savings of roughly $76 million over the Financial Plan period.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The Comptroller does not forecast pension liability estimates for the later years of the Updated Financial Plan. Thus, </font><font>estimates for FY 2025 and beyond are developed by DOB. DOB’s forecast assumes growth in the salary base consistent with
</font><font>collective bargaining agreements and a lower rate of return compared to the current assumed rate of return by NYSLRS.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Social Security</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The CARES Act allowed employers, including the State, to defer the deposit and payment of the
employer’s share of Social </font><font>Security taxes through December 2020, and for the deferral to be repaid, interest free, in two equal installments no later than </font><font>December 31, 2022. The Executive and the Judiciary have repaid the interest-free loan in full. SUNY is expected to remit its
</font><font>final repayment of $24 million by December 2022. </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB)</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>State employees become eligible for post-employment benefits (e.g., health insurance) if they reach retirement while working
</font><font>for the State; are enrolled in either the New York State Health Insurance Program (NYSHIP) or the NYSHIP opt-out program at </font><font>the time they reach retirement; and have the required years of eligible service. The cost of providing post-retirement health
</font><font>insurance is shared between the State and the retired employee. Contributions are established by law and may be amended </font><font>by the Legislature. The State pays its share of costs on a PAYGO basis as required by law.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The State Comptroller adopted Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement (GASBS) 75, Accounting and Financial </font><font>Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions, for the State’s Basic Financial Statements for FY 2019. GASBS
</font><font>75, which replaces GASBS 45 and GASBS 57, addresses accounting and financial reporting for OPEB that is provided to the </font><font>employees of state and local governmental employers. GASBS 75 establishes standards for recognizing and measuring
</font><font>liabilities and expenses/expenditures, as well as identifying the methods and assumptions required to be used to project </font><font>benefit payments, discount projected benefit payments to their actuarial determined present value, and attribute that present
</font><font>value to periods of employee service. Specifically, GASBS 75 now requires that the full liability be recognized.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The State’s total OPEB liability equals the employer's share of the actuarial
determined present value of projected benefit </font><font>payments attributed to past periods of employee service. The total OPEB obligation less any OPEB assets set aside in an OPEB </font><font>trust or similar arrangement represents the net OPEB obligation.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>As reported in the State’s Basic Financial Statements for FY 2022, the total ending OPEB liability for FY 2022 was $65.7 billion </font><font>($52.1 billion for the State and $13.6 billion for SUNY). The total OPEB liability as of March 31, 2022, was measured as of
</font><font>March 31, 2021, and was determined using an actuarial valuation as of April 1, 2020, with updated procedures used to roll </font><font>forward the total OPEB liability to March 2021. The total beginning OPEB liability for FY 2022 was $75.8 billion ($60.3 billion </font><font>for the State and $15.5 billion for SUNY). The total OPEB liability was calculated using the Entry Age Normal cost method. The
</font><font>discount rate is based on the Bond Buyer 20-year general obligation municipal bond index rate on March 31 (2.84 percent in </font><font>FY 2021 and 2.34 percent in FY 2022). The total OPEB liability decreased by $10.1 billion (13.3 percent) during FY 2022
</font><font>primarily due to updated medical trend assumptions based on current anticipation of future costs, and projected claim costs </font><font>were updated based on the recent claims experience for the Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) plan and premium rates </font><font>for
the Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) plan.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>89</font></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>The contribution requirements of NYSHIP members
and the State are established by, and may be amended by, the </font><font>Legislature. The State is not required to provide funding above the PAYGO amount necessary to provide current benefits
to </font><font>retirees. The State continues to fund these costs, along with all other employee health care expenses, on a PAYGO basis, </font><font>meaning the State pays these costs as they become due.</font></div> <div> <div><font>The RHBTF was created in FY 2018 as a qualified trust under GASBS 74 and is authorized to reserve money for the payment </font><font>of
health benefits of retired employees and their dependents. Unlike State pensions, which are pre-funded, future retiree </font><font>health care costs are unfunded, meaning no money is set aside
to pay these future expenses. The State pays these expenses </font><font>each year as they come due. Under current law, the State may deposit into the RHBTF, in any given fiscal year, up to 1.5
</font><font>percent of total then-current unfunded actuarial accrued OPEB liability ($65.7 billion on March 31, 2022). The FY 2023 </font><font>Enacted Budget increased the maximum allowable deposit from 0.5 percent of the OPEB liability to 1.5 percent of the
</font><font>outstanding OPEB liability. The Updated Financial Plan reflects a deposit of $320 million in FY 2022 and planned deposits of </font><font>$920 million in FY 2023 and $375 million annually thereafter, fiscal conditions permitting. These deposits, which were
</font><font>allocated in prior Financial Plan updates, are the first deposits to the RHBTF.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>GASBS 74 and 75 are not expected to alter the Updated Financial Plan PAYGO projections for health insurance costs. DOB’s </font><font>methodology for forecasting these costs over a multi-year period already incorporates factors and considerations consistent
</font><font>with the new actuarial methods and calculations required by the GASBS.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>State Debt</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font> </font><font>Bond Market and Credit Ratings</font><font>. Successful execution of the Updated Financial Plan is dependent on the State's ability to </font><font>market bonds. The State finances
much of its capital spending, in the first instance, from the General Fund or STIP, which it </font><font>then reimburses with proceeds from the sale of bonds. An inability of the State to sell
bonds or notes at the level or on the </font><font>timetable it expects could have a material and adverse impact on the State’s financial position and the implementation of its </font><font>Capital Plan. The success of projected public sales of municipal bonds is subject to prevailing market conditions and related
</font><font>ratings issued by national credit rating agencies, among other factors. The outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States </font><font>temporarily disrupted the municipal bond market in 2020, and the emergence of future variants could further disrupt the
</font><font>municipal bond market. In addition, future developments in the financial markets, including possible changes in Federal tax </font><font>law relating to the taxation of interest on municipal bonds, may affect the market for outstanding State-supported and State-related</font><font> debt.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>As of the
date of the AIS Update, the major rating agencies </font><font>—</font><font> Fitch, Kroll,
Moody’s, and S&amp;P </font><font>—</font><font> have assigned the State </font><font>general credit ratings of AA+, AA+, Aa1, and AA+, respectively. The State's rating has a stable outlook from all four rating
</font><font>agencies. These ratings reflect the State's economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and commitment to strong
</font><font>reserve levels. The most recent rating action was on April 13, 2022, when Moody’s raised the State’s credit rating from Aa2 to </font><font>Aa1, noting </font><font>“</font><font>a significant increase in resources
combined with agile fiscal management that has resulted in balanced or </font><font>nearly balanced budgets projected through the State's five-year financial plan.</font><font>”</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font> </font><font>Debt Reform Act Limit</font><font>. The Debt Reform Act of 2000 (</font><font>“</font><font>Debt Reform
Act</font><font>”</font><font>) restricts the issuance of State-supported debt </font><font>funding to capital purposes only and limits the maximum term of bonds to 30 years. The Act limits the amount of new State-supported</font><font> debt to 4 percent of State personal income, and new State-supported debt service costs to 5 percent of All Funds </font><font>receipts.
The restrictions apply to State-supported debt issued after April 1, 2000. DOB, as administrator of the Debt Reform </font><font>Act, determined that the State complied with the statutory caps
in the most recent calculation period (FY 2022).</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The State enacted legislation that suspended certain provisions of the Debt Reform Act for FY 2021 and FY 2022 bond </font><font>issuances as part of the State’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, State-supported debt issued in FY 2021
</font><font>and FY 2022 was not limited to capital purposes and is not counted towards the statutory caps on debt outstanding and debt </font><font>service.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Following this temporary two year suspension as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the provisions of the Debt Reform Act </font><font>were reinstated for State-supported debt issued in FY 2023 and beyond. One limited exception to the Debt Reform Act </font><font>remains
for issuances undertaken by the State for MTA capital projects which may be issued with maximum maturities </font><font>longer than 30 years. This allows bonds to be issued over the full useful
life of the assets being financed, subject to Federal </font><font>tax law limitations, and is consistent with the rules that would have been in effect if the projects had been directly
financed by </font><font>the MTA.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>Current projections anticipate that
State-supported debt outstanding and State-supported debt service will continue to </font><font>remain below the limits imposed by the Debt Reform Act, in part reflecting the statutory
suspension of the debt caps during </font><font>FY 2021 and FY 2022.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Based on the most recent personal income and debt outstanding forecasts, the available debt capacity under the debt
</font><font>outstanding cap is expected to decline from $21.6 billion in FY 2023 to a low point of $290 million in FY 2028. This </font><font>calculation includes the estimated impact of funding capital commitments with State bonds. The debt service on
State-supported</font><font> debt subject to the statutory cap is projected at $2.7 billion in FY 2023, or roughly $8.7 billion below the statutory </font><font>debt service limit.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The State uses personal income estimates published by the Federal government, specifically the Bureau of Economic Analysis </font><font>(BEA), to calculate the cap on debt outstanding, as required by statute. The BEA revises these estimates on a quarterly basis
</font><font>and such revisions can be significant. For Federal reporting purposes, BEA reassigns income from the state where it was </font><font>earned to the state in which a person resides, for situations where a person lives and earns income in different states (the
</font><font>“</font><font>residency adjustment</font><font>”</font><font>). The BEA residency adjustment has the effect of reducing reported New York State personal income </font><font>because income earned in
New York by non-residents regularly exceeds income earned in other states by New York residents. </font><font>The State taxes all personal income earned in New York, regardless of place of
residency.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In the FY 2024 Executive Budget, the State proposes new
bond-financed capital commitments that would add $4 billion in </font><font>new debt over the five-year Capital Plan period. The new capital commitments and FY 2024 Executive Budget personal
</font><font>income forecast decrease debt capacity, which is offset by the assumption that the State will issue bonds on a slower </font><font>schedule and higher underspending on capital projects than previously assumed. Debt capacity also reflects the suspension </font><font>of
the Debt Reform Act for FY 2021 and FY 2022 issuances in response to the COVID- 19 pandemic, as discussed previously. </font><font>The State may adjust capital spending priorities and debt
financing practices from time to time to preserve available debt </font><font>capacity and stay within the statutory limits, as events warrant. As part of the FY 2024 Executive Budget, the
State has set </font><font>aside $1 billion in a debt reduction reserve that can be used, as needed, for debt management actions in the future.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Financial Condition of New York State Localities</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The State’s localities rely in part on State aid to balance their budgets and meet
their cash requirements. As such, </font><font>unanticipated financial needs among localities can adversely affect the State’s Updated Financial Plan projections. The wide-ranging</font><font> economic, health, and social disruptions caused by COVID-19 have adversely affected the City of New York and </font><font>surrounding
localities. Localities outside New York City, including cities and counties, have also experienced financial </font><font>problems, and have been allocated additional State assistance during
the last several State fiscal years. In 2013, the Financial </font><font>Restructuring Board for Local Governments was created to aid distressed local governments. The Restructuring Board
</font><font>performs comprehensive reviews and provides grants and loans on the condition of implementing recommended efficiency </font><font>initiatives.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>MTA</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The MTA operates public transportation in the New York City metropolitan area, including subways, buses, commuter rail, </font><font>and
tolled vehicle crossings. The services provided by MTA and its operating agencies are integral to the economy of New </font><font>York City and the surrounding metropolitan region, as well as
to the economy of the State. MTA operations are funded mainly </font><font>from fare and toll revenue, dedicated taxes, and subsidies from the State and New York City.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>MTA Capital Plans also rely on significant direct contributions from the State and New York City. The State is directly </font><font>contributing $9.1 billion to the MTA’s 2015-19 Capital Plan and $3.1 billion to the MTA’s 2020-24 Capital Plan. These State </font><font>commitment levels represent substantial increases from the funding levels for prior MTA Capital Plans (2010-2014: $770
</font><font>million; 2005-2009: $1.45 billion). In addition, a substantial amount of new funding to the MTA was authorized in the FY 2020 </font><font>Enacted Budget as part of a comprehensive reform plan expected to generate an estimated $25 billion in financing for the
</font><font>MTA’s 2020-2024 Capital Plan.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The COVID-19 pandemic caused severe declines in MTA ridership and traffic in 2020, and
ridership remains significantly </font><font>below pre-pandemic levels. To offset operating losses to MTA’s Financial Plan from the estimated fare, toll, and dedicated </font><font>revenue loss attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, significant Federal operating aid is provided to the MTA from the CARES
</font><font>Act ($4 billion), CRRSA Act ($4.1 billion), and the ARP ($7 billion). The MTA also borrowed $2.9 billion through the Federal </font><font>Reserve’s Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF).</font><font> </font></div> </div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>If the financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic
on the MTA’s operating budget extend after the Federal funds are fully </font><font>spent, and without additional Federal aid, the MTA will need to consider additional actions to balance
its future budgets. </font><font>Risks to MTA's current financial projections include, but are not limited to, the level and pace at which ridership will return, </font><font>the economic conditions of the MTA region, the ability to implement cost controls and savings actions, and the ability to
</font><font>implement biennial fare and toll increases. If additional resources are provided by the State, either through additional </font><font>subsidies or new revenues, it could have a material and adverse impact on the State's Updated Financial
Plan.</font><font> </font></div> <div> <div><font>The State has taken action to address MTA financing issues that arose during the pandemic. Specifically, the pandemic
</font><font>adversely affected credit ratings on MTA Transportation Revenue Bonds, which increased the cost of borrowing for the MTA. </font><font>As a result, the State has issued PIT revenue bonds since the start of FY 2021 to fund $5.5 billion of the State’s portion of the </font><font>MTA’s 2015-19 Capital Plan. Previously, the Financial Plan assumed that the projects would be bonded by the MTA but
</font><font>funded by the State through additional operating aid to the MTA. The Updated Financial Plan now assumes the State will </font><font>fund its direct contributions to the MTA 2015-19 and 2020-24 Capital Plans through PIT and Sales Tax revenue bonds.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Other Risks And Ongoing Concerns</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Cybersecurity</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>New York State government, like many other large public and private entities, relies on a
large and complex technology </font><font>environment to conduct its operations. As a recipient and provider of personal, private, or sensitive information, the State and </font><font>its authorities, agencies and public benefit corporations, as well as its political subdivisions (including counties, cities, towns, </font><font>villages and school districts) face multiple cyber threats involving, among others, hacking, viruses, malware and other
</font><font>electronic attacks on computer and other sensitive digital networks and systems. Entities or individuals may attempt to gain </font><font>unauthorized access to the State’s digital systems for the purposes of misappropriating assets or information or causing
</font><font>operational disruption and damage. In addition, the tactics used in malicious attacks to obtain unauthorized access to digital </font><font>networks and systems change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target. Accordingly, the State
</font><font>may be unable to fully anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>To mitigate the risk of business operations impact and/or damage from cyber incidents or cyber- attacks, the State invests in </font><font>multiple forms of cybersecurity and operational controls. The State’s Chief Information Security Office (CISO) within the </font><font>State’s Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) maintains policies and standards, programs, and services relating to </font><font>the security of State government networks, and annually assesses the maturity of State agencies' cyber posture through the
</font><font>Nationwide Cyber Security Review. In addition, the CISO maintains the New York State Cyber Command Center team, which </font><font>provides a security operations center, digital forensics capabilities, and cyber incident reporting and response. The CISO also </font><font>distributes real-time advisories and alerts, provides managed security services, and implements statewide information,
</font><font>security awareness and training.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In February 2022, the Governor announced the creation of a Joint Security Operations Center (JSOC) that will serve as the
</font><font>center for joint local, state, and Federal cybersecurity efforts, including data collection, response efforts and information </font><font>sharing. A partnership launched with New York City and other major cities and cybersecurity leaders across the State, the
</font><font>JSOC is intended to provide a statewide view of the cyber-threat landscape. The initiative is designed to increase </font><font>collaboration on threat intelligence, reduce response times, and yield faster and more effective remediation in the event of a
</font><font>major cyber incident. The FY 2024 Executive Budget provides funding to expand the shared services program to help local </font><font>governments and other regional partners acquire and deploy high quality cybersecurity services to bolster their cyber
</font><font>defenses.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Occasionally, intrusions into State digital systems have been detected but they have generally been contained. While
</font><font>cybersecurity procedures and controls are routinely reviewed and tested, there can be no assurance that such security and </font><font>operational control measures will be completely successful at guarding against future cyber threats and attacks. The results
</font><font>of any successful attacks could adversely impact business operations and/or damage State digital networks and systems, or </font><font>State and local infrastructure, and the costs of remediation could be substantial.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The State has also adopted regulations designed to protect the financial services industry from cyberattacks. Banks, </font><font>insurance companies and other covered entities regulated by DFS are, unless eligible for limited exemptions, required to: (a)
</font><font>maintain a cybersecurity program, (b) create written cybersecurity policies and perform risk assessments, (c) designate </font><font>someone with responsibility to oversee the cybersecurity program, (d) annually certify compliance with the cybersecurity
</font><font>regulations, and (e) report to DFS cybersecurity events that have a reasonable likelihood of materially harming any </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>substantial part of the entity’s normal
operation(s) or for which notice is required to any government body, self-regulatory </font><font>agency, or supervisory body.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>Supranational Entities Risk. </font><font> </font><font>Certain of the Funds may invest in obligations issued or guaranteed by supranational entities
</font><font>(</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, the World Bank,
European Investment Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, and Asia Development Bank), which </font><font>are often chartered to promote economic development. The government members, or </font><font>“</font><font>stockholders,</font><font>”</font><font> usually make initial </font><font>capital contributions to the supranational entity and, in many cases, are committed to make additional
capital contributions </font><font>if such entity is unable to repay its borrowings. There is no guarantee that one or more stockholders of the supranational </font><font>entity will continue to make any necessary additional capital contributions. If such contributions are not made, the entity
</font><font>may be unable to pay interest or repay principal on its debt securities, certain of the Funds may have limited legal recourse in </font><font>the event of default, and certain of the Funds may lose money on such investments.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Tax Risks Associated with Municipal Securities.
</font><font> </font><font>As with any investment, you should consider how your investment in </font><font>shares of each Municipal Bond Fund will be taxed. The tax information in the relevant Prospectus and this SAI is provided as
</font><font>general information. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of an investment in shares of </font><font>each Municipal Bond Fund.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Unless your investment in shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an
</font><font>individual retirement account, you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when each Municipal Bond Fund </font><font>makes distributions or you sell Municipal Bond Fund shares. In general, each Municipal Bond Fund seeks to produce income
</font><font>that is generally exempt from federal income tax and will not benefit investors in tax deferred retirement accounts such as </font><font>IRAs or investors not subject to federal income tax. Further, the iShares California Muni Bond ETF generally invests in
</font><font>securities that produce income that is generally exempt from California's income tax, which will not provide any state tax </font><font>benefit to investors who are not subject to California's state income tax and the iShares New York Muni Bond ETF generally
</font><font>invests in securities that produce income that is generally exempt from New York's income tax, which will not provide any </font><font>state tax benefit to investors who are not subject to New York's state income tax.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>In response to the national economic downturn in recent years, governmental cost burdens may be reallocated among </font><font>federal, state and local governments. Also, as a result of the downturn, many state and local governments are experiencing
</font><font>significant reductions in revenues and are consequently experiencing difficulties meeting ongoing expenses. Certain of these </font><font>state or local governments may have difficulty paying principal or interest on their outstanding debt and may experience
</font><font>ratings downgrades of their debt.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>U.S. Economic Trading Partners Risk. </font><font> </font><font>The U.S. is a significant, and in some cases the most significant, trading partner of, or </font><font>foreign investor in, certain
countries in which a Fund invests. As a result, economic conditions of such countries may be </font><font>particularly affected by changes in the U.S. economy. A decrease in U.S. imports or
exports, new trade and financial </font><font>regulations or tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate or an economic slowdown in the U.S. may have a material </font><font>adverse effect on a country’s economic conditions and, as a result, securities to which a Fund has exposure. Circumstances </font><font>could arise that could prevent the timely payment of interest or principal on U.S. government debt, such as reaching the
</font><font>legislative </font><font>“</font><font>debt ceiling.</font><font>”</font><font> Such non-payment would result in substantial negative consequences for the U.S. economy and the </font><font>global financial system.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>There are strained relations between the U.S. and a number of foreign countries, including traditional allies, such as certain
</font><font>European countries, and historical adversaries, such as North Korea, Iran, China and Russia. If these relations were to worsen, </font><font>it could adversely affect U.S. issuers as well as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also experienced </font><font>increased internal unrest and discord. If these trends were to continue, it may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy
</font><font>and many of the issuers in which a Fund invests.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>U.S. Treasury Obligations Risk. </font><font> </font><font>U.S. Treasury obligations may differ from other securities in their interest rates, maturities, </font><font>times of issuance and other
characteristics. Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial condition or credit rating of the </font><font>U.S. government may cause the value of a Fund's U.S. Treasury obligations to
decline. U.S. Treasury securities are rated AA+ </font><font>by S&amp;P Global Ratings. A downgrade of the rating of U.S. Treasury securities may cause the value of a Fund's U.S. Treasury
</font><font>obligations to decline. Because U.S. government debt obligations are often used as a benchmark for other borrowing </font><font>arrangements, a downgrade could also result in higher interest rates for a range of borrowers, cause disruptions in the
</font><font>international bond markets and have a substantial adverse effect on the U.S. and global economy.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>A high national debt level may increase market
pressures to meet government funding needs, which may drive debt cost </font><font>higher and lead the government to issue additional debt, thereby increasing refinancing risk. A high national
debt also raises </font><font>concerns that the U.S. government will not be able to make principal or interest payments when they are due. If market </font><font>participants determine that U.S. sovereign debt levels have become unsustainable, the value of the U.S. dollar could decline,
</font><font>thus increasing inflationary pressures, particularly with respect to services outsourced to non-U.S. providers and imported </font><font>goods and constrain or prevent the U.S. government from implementing effective countercyclical fiscal policy in economic
</font><font>downturns. Direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury have historically involved little risk of loss of principal if held to maturity. </font><font>However, due to fluctuations in interest rates, the market value of such securities may vary during the period that
</font><font>shareholders own shares of a Fund. Notwithstanding that U.S. Treasury obligations are backed by the full faith and credit of </font><font>the U.S., circumstances could arise that could prevent the timely payment of interest or principal, such as reaching the
</font><font>legislative </font><font>“</font><font>debt ceiling.</font><font>”</font><font> Such non-payment would result in losses to a Fund and substantial negative consequences for the </font><font>U.S. economy and the global financial system.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Valuation Risk.
</font><font> </font><font>In certain circumstances, a Fund’s securities may be valued using techniques
other than market quotations. </font><font>The value established for a security may be different from what would be produced through the use of another methodology </font><font>or if the value had been priced using market quotations. Securities that are valued using methods other than market
</font><font>quotations, including </font><font>“</font><font>fair
valued</font><font>”</font><font> securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation in their value from one day to the next </font><font>than would be the case if market quotations were used. In addition, there is no assurance that a Fund could sell a security for </font><font>the value established for it at any time, and it is possible that a Fund could incur a loss if a security is sold for less than its </font><font>established value.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Africa.</font><font>  </font><font>Investments in securities of issuers in certain African countries involve heightened risks </font><font>including, among others,
expropriation and/or nationalization of assets, confiscatory taxation, political instability, including </font><font>authoritarian and/or military involvement in governmental decision-making,
armed conflict, civil war, and social instability as </font><font>a result of religious, ethnic and/or socio-economic unrest or widespread outbreaks of disease and, in certain countries,
</font><font>genocidal warfare.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Certain countries in Africa generally have less developed capital markets than traditional
emerging market countries, and, </font><font>consequently, the risks of investing in foreign securities are magnified in such countries. Because securities markets of </font><font>countries in Africa are generally underdeveloped and are generally less correlated to global economic cycles than those
</font><font>markets located in more developed countries, securities markets in African countries are subject to greater risks associated </font><font>with market volatility, lower market capitalization, lower trading volume, illiquidity, inflation, greater price fluctuations and </font><font>uncertainty regarding the existence of trading markets. Moreover, trading on African securities markets may be suspended
</font><font>altogether.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Market volatility may also be heightened by the actions of a small number of investors. Brokerage firms in certain countries in </font><font>Africa may be fewer in number and less established than brokerage firms in more developed markets. Since a Fund may need </font><font>to
effect securities transactions through these brokerage firms, the Fund is subject to the risk that these brokerage firms will </font><font>not be able to fulfill their obligations to the Fund
(</font><font>i.e., </font><font>counterparty risk). This risk is magnified to the extent that a Fund </font><font>effects securities transactions through a single brokerage firm or a small number of brokerage firms.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Certain governments in African countries restrict or control to varying degrees the ability of foreign investors to invest in </font><font>securities of issuers located or operating in those countries. Moreover, certain countries in Africa require governmental
</font><font>approval or special licenses prior to investment by foreign investors and may limit the amount of investment by foreign </font><font>investors in a particular industry and/or issuer, and may limit such foreign investment to a certain class of securities of an
</font><font>issuer that may have less advantageous rights than the classes available for purchase by domestic investors of the countries </font><font>and/or impose additional taxes on foreign investors. A delay in obtaining a government approval or a license would delay
</font><font>investments in a particular country, and, as a result, a Fund may not be able to invest in certain securities while approval is </font><font>pending. The government of a particular country may also withdraw or decline to renew a license that enables a Fund to
</font><font>invest in such country. These factors make investing in issuers located or operating in countries in Africa significantly riskier </font><font>than investing in issuers located or operating in more developed countries, and any one of these factors could cause a
</font><font>decline in the value of a Fund's investments. Issuers located or operating in countries in Africa are generally not subject to the </font><font>same rules and regulations as issuers located or operating in more developed countries. Therefore, there may be less
</font><font>financial and other information publicly available with regard to issuers located or operating in countries in Africa and such </font><font>issuers are generally not subject to the uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards applicable to issuers
</font><font>located or operating in more developed countries.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>In addition, governments of certain countries in
Africa in which a Fund may invest may levy withholding or other taxes on </font><font>income such as dividends, interest and realized capital gains. Although in certain countries in Africa a
portion of these taxes </font><font>are recoverable, the non-recovered portion of foreign withholding taxes will reduce the income received from investments in </font><font>such countries.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>Investment in countries in Africa may be subject to a greater degree of risk associated with governmental approval in </font><font>connection with the repatriation of investment income, capital or the proceeds of sales of securities by foreign investors. In
</font><font>addition, there is the risk that if an African country’s balance of payments declines, such African country may impose </font><font>temporary restrictions on foreign capital remittances. Consequently, a Fund could be adversely affected by delays in, or a
</font><font>refusal to grant, required governmental approval for repatriation of capital, as well as by the application to the Fund of any </font><font>restrictions on investments. Additionally, investments in countries in Africa may require a Fund to adopt special procedures,
</font><font>seek local government approvals or take other actions, each of which may involve additional costs to a Fund.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Securities laws in many countries in Africa are relatively new and unsettled and,
consequently, there is a risk of rapid and </font><font>unpredictable change in laws regarding foreign investment, securities regulation, title to securities and shareholder rights. </font><font>Accordingly, foreign investors may be adversely affected by new or amended laws and regulations. In addition, there may be
</font><font>no single centralized securities exchange on which securities are traded in certain countries in Africa and the systems of </font><font>corporate governance to which issuers located in countries in Africa are subject may be less advanced than those systems to
</font><font>which issuers located in more developed countries are subject, and, therefore, shareholders of issuers located in such </font><font>countries may not receive many of the protections available to shareholders of issuers located in more developed countries.
</font><font>Even in circumstances where adequate laws and shareholder rights exist, it may not be possible to obtain swift and equitable </font><font>enforcement of the law. In addition, the enforcement of systems of taxation at federal, regional and local levels in countries in </font><font>Africa may be inconsistent and subject to sudden change.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Certain countries in Africa may be heavily dependent upon international trade and, consequently, have been and may </font><font>continue
to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values and </font><font>other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the
countries with which they trade. These countries also have been </font><font>and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade. Certain
countries </font><font>in Africa depend to a significant extent upon exports of primary commodities such as gold, silver, copper and diamonds. </font><font>These countries therefore are vulnerable to changes in commodity prices, which may be affected by a variety of factors. In
</font><font>addition, certain issuers located in countries in Africa in which a Fund invests may operate in, or have dealings with, countries </font><font>subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations, and/or countries identified </font><font>by
the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer may sustain damage to its reputation if it is </font><font>identified as an issuer which operates in, or has dealings
with, such countries. A Fund, as an investor in such issuers, will be </font><font>indirectly subject to those risks.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The governments of certain countries in Africa may exercise substantial influence over many
aspects of the private sector </font><font>and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic </font><font>conditions in such countries, which could have a negative impact on private sector companies. There is also the possibility of
</font><font>diplomatic developments that could adversely affect investments in certain countries in Africa. Some countries in Africa may </font><font>be affected by a greater degree of public corruption and crime, including organized crime.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Political instability and protests in North Africa and the Middle East have caused and may in the future cause significant </font><font>disruptions to many industries. In addition, the outbreak of Ebola in Western Africa severely challenged health care industries </font><font>in those countries and adversely impacted the region’s economy due to quarantines and disruptions of trade, which has
</font><font>further increased instability in the region. This instability has demonstrated that political and social unrest can spread quickly </font><font>through the region, and that developments in one country can influence the political events in neighboring countries. Some
</font><font>protests have turned violent, and civil war and political reconstruction in certain countries such as Libya, Iraq and Syria pose a </font><font>risk to investments in the region. Continued political and social unrest in these regions, including the ongoing warfare and
</font><font>terrorist activities in the Middle East and Africa, may negatively affect the value of an investment in a Fund.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Asia.</font><font>  </font><font> Investments in securities of issuers in certain Asian countries involve risks not typically
associated </font><font>with investments in securities of issuers in other regions. Such heightened
risks</font><font> </font><font>include, among others, expropriation and/or </font><font>nationalization of assets, confiscatory taxation, piracy of intellectual property, data and other security breaches (especially of </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>data stored electronically), political
instability, including authoritarian and/or military involvement in governmental decision-making,</font><font> armed conflict and social instability as a result of religious, ethnic and/or
socio-economic unrest. Certain Asian </font><font>economies have experienced rapid rates of economic growth and industrialization in recent years, and there is no assurance </font><font>that these rates of economic growth and industrialization will be maintained.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Certain Asian countries have democracies with relatively short histories, which may increase the risk of political instability. </font><font>These countries have faced political and military unrest, and further unrest could present a risk to their local economies and
</font><font>securities markets. Indonesia and the Philippines have each experienced violence and terrorism, which has negatively </font><font>impacted their economies. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial military capabilities, and historical tensions
</font><font>between the two countries present the risk of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of </font><font>hostilities between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on
</font><font>the entire Asian region. Certain Asian countries have also developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if </font><font>these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. Political, religious, and </font><font>border disputes persist in India. India has recently experienced and may continue to experience civil unrest and hostilities
</font><font>with certain of its neighboring countries. Increased political and social unrest in these geographic areas could adversely affect </font><font>the performance of investments in this region.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Certain governments in this region administer prices on several basic goods, including fuel and electricity, within their
</font><font>respective countries. Certain governments may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector in their </font><font>respective countries and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on </font><font>the
economic conditions in this region, which in turn could have a negative impact on private sector companies. There is also </font><font>the possibility of diplomatic developments adversely
affecting investments in the region.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Corruption and the perceived lack of
a rule of law in dealings with international companies in certain Asian countries may </font><font>discourage foreign investment and could negatively impact the long-term growth of certain
economies in this region. In </font><font>addition, certain countries in the region are experiencing high unemployment and corruption, and have fragile banking </font><font>sectors.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Some
economies in this region are dependent on a range of commodities, including oil, natural gas and coal. Accordingly, </font><font>they are strongly affected by international commodity prices and
particularly vulnerable to any weakening in global demand </font><font>for these products. The market for securities in this region may also be directly influenced by the flow of international
capital, </font><font>and by the economic and market conditions of neighboring countries. China is a key trading partner of many Asian countries </font><font>and any changes in trading relationships between China and other Asian countries may affect the region as a whole. Adverse
</font><font>economic conditions or developments in neighboring countries may increase investors' perception of the risk of investing in </font><font>the region as a whole, which may adversely impact the market value of the securities issued by companies in the region.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Australasia. </font><font> </font><font>The economies of Australasia, which include Australia and New Zealand, are dependent on </font><font>exports from the agricultural and mining sectors. This makes Australasian economies susceptible to fluctuations in the
</font><font>commodity markets. Australasian economies are also increasingly dependent on their growing service industries. Australia </font><font>and New Zealand are located in a part of the world that has historically been prone to natural disasters, such as drought and
</font><font>flooding. Any such event in the future could have a significant adverse impact on the economies of Australia and New </font><font>Zealand and affect the value of securities held by a relevant Fund. The economies of Australia and New Zealand are </font><font>dependent
on trading with certain key trading partners, including Asia and the U.S. Economic events in the U.S., Asia, or in </font><font>other key trading countries can have a significant economic
effect on the Australasian economies. The economies of </font><font>Australia and New Zealand are heavily dependent on the mining sector. Passage of new regulations limiting foreign </font><font>ownership of companies in the mining sector or imposition of new taxes on profits of mining companies may dissuade </font><font>foreign
investment, and as a result, have a negative impact on companies to which a Fund has exposure.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Central and South America. </font><font> </font><font>The economies of certain Central and South American countries have </font><font>experienced high interest rates, economic volatility,
inflation, currency devaluations, government defaults, high </font><font>unemployment rates and political instability which can adversely affect issuers in these countries. In addition,
commodities </font><font>(such as oil, gas and minerals) represent a significant percentage of the region's exports and many economies in this region </font><font>are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in commodity prices. Adverse economic events in one country may have a significant
</font><font>adverse effect on other countries of this region.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The governments of certain countries in Central and South America may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of
</font><font>the private sector and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the </font></div> </div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>economic conditions in such countries, which could
have a negative impact on the securities in which the Fund invests. </font><font>Diplomatic developments may also adversely affect investments in certain countries in Central and South America.
Some </font><font>countries in Central and South America may be affected by public corruption and crime, including organized crime.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>Certain countries in Central and South America may be heavily dependent upon international
trade and, consequently, have </font><font>been and may continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative </font><font>currency values and other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade. These
</font><font>countries also have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the countries with which they </font><font>trade. In addition, certain issuers located in countries in Central and South America in which the Fund invests may be the
</font><font>subject of sanctions (for example, the U.S. has imposed sanctions on certain Venezuelan individuals, corporate entities and </font><font>the Venezuelan government) or have dealings with countries subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S.
</font><font>government and the United Nations and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. An </font><font>issuer may sustain damage to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer that has dealings with such countries. The Fund may </font><font>be adversely affected if it invests in such issuers.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. </font><font> </font><font>Many countries with developed markets have recently experienced significant </font><font>economic pressures. These countries generally
tend to rely on the services sectors (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, the financial services sector) as the </font><font>primary source of economic growth and may be susceptible to the risks of individual service sectors. For example, companies
</font><font>in the financial services sector are subject to governmental regulation and, recently, government intervention, which may </font><font>adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge and amount of capital they must maintain.
</font><font>Dislocations in the financial sector and perceived or actual governmental influence over certain financial companies may lead </font><font>to credit rating downgrades and, as a result, impact, among other things, revenue growth for such companies. If financial
</font><font>companies experience a prolonged decline in revenue growth, certain developed countries that rely heavily on financial </font><font>companies as an economic driver may experience a correlative slowdown. Concerns have emerged with respect to the </font><font>economic
health of certain developed countries. These concerns primarily stem from heavy indebtedness of many developed </font><font>countries and their perceived inability to continue to service high
debt loads without simultaneously implementing stringent </font><font>austerity measures. Such concerns have led to tremendous downward pressure on the economies of these countries. As a
</font><font>result, it is possible that interest rates on debt of certain developed countries may rise to levels that make it difficult for such </font><font>countries to service such debt. Spending on health care and retirement pensions in most developed countries has risen
</font><font>dramatically. Medical innovation, extended life expectancy and higher public expectations are likely to continue the increase </font><font>in health care and pension costs. Any increase in health care and pension costs will likely have a negative impact on the
</font><font>economic growth of many developed countries. Certain developed countries rely on imports of certain key items, such as </font><font>crude oil, natural gas, and other commodities. As a result, an increase in demand for, or price fluctuations of, certain
</font><font>commodities may negatively affect developed country economies. Developed market countries generally are dependent on </font><font>the economies of certain key trading partners. Changes in any one economy may cause an adverse impact on several </font><font>developed
countries. In addition, heavy regulation of, among others, labor and product markets may have an adverse effect </font><font>on certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic
growth or cause prolonged periods of recession. Such </font><font>risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of a Fund’s investments.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets. </font><font> </font><font>Certain of the Funds may invest in securities of issuers domiciled in emerging </font><font>market countries. Investments in emerging market countries may be subject to greater risks than investments in developed
</font><font>countries. These risks include: (i) less social, political, and economic stability; (ii) greater illiquidity and price volatility due to </font><font>smaller or limited local capital markets for such securities, or low or non-existent trading volumes; (iii) companies,
</font><font>custodians, clearinghouses, foreign exchanges and broker-dealers may be subject to less scrutiny and regulation by local </font><font>authorities; (iv) local governments may decide to seize or confiscate securities held by foreign investors and/or local
</font><font>governments may decide to suspend or limit an issuer's ability to make dividend or interest payments; (v) local governments </font><font>may limit or entirely restrict repatriation of invested capital, profits, and dividends; (vi) capital gains may be subject to local </font><font>taxation, including on a retroactive basis; (vii) issuers facing restrictions on standard payments imposed by local
</font><font>governments may attempt to make dividend or interest payments to foreign investors in the local currency; (viii) there may </font><font>be significant obstacles to obtaining information necessary for investigations into or litigation against companies and
</font><font>investors may experience difficulty in enforcing legal claims related to the securities and/or local judges may favor the </font><font>interests of the issuer over those of foreign parties; (ix) bankruptcy judgments may only be permitted to be paid in the local
</font><font>currency; (x) limited public information regarding the issuer may result in greater difficulty in determining market valuations </font><font>of the securities; and (xi) lack of financial reporting on a regular basis, substandard disclosure and differences in accounting </font><font>standards may make it difficult to ascertain the financial health of an issuer. The Funds are not actively managed and do not
</font><font>select investments based on investor protection considerations.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Emerging market securities markets are typically
marked by a high concentration of market capitalization and trading volume </font><font>in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries, as well as a high concentration
of ownership of </font><font>such securities by a limited number of investors. In addition, brokerage and other costs associated with transactions in </font><font>emerging market securities can be higher, sometimes significantly, than similar costs incurred in securities markets in
</font><font>developed countries. Although some emerging markets have become more established and tend to issue securities of higher </font><font>credit quality, the markets for securities in other emerging market countries are in the earliest stages of their development,
</font><font>and these countries issue securities across the credit spectrum. Even the markets for relatively widely traded securities in </font><font>emerging market countries may not be able to absorb, without price disruptions, a significant increase in trading volume or
</font><font>trades of a size customarily undertaken by institutional investors in the securities markets of developed countries. The limited </font><font>size of many of these securities markets can cause prices to be erratic for reasons apart from factors that affect the
</font><font>soundness and competitiveness of the securities issuers. For example, prices may be unduly influenced by traders who </font><font>control large positions in these markets. Additionally, market making and arbitrage activities are generally less extensive in
</font><font>such markets, which may contribute to increased volatility and reduced liquidity of such markets. The limited liquidity of </font><font>emerging market country securities may also affect a Fund's ability to accurately value its portfolio securities or to acquire or </font><font>dispose of securities at the price and time it wishes to do so or in order to meet redemption requests.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>Many emerging market countries suffer from uncertainty and corruption in their legal frameworks. Legislation may be </font><font>difficult to interpret and laws may be too new to provide any precedential value. Laws regarding foreign investment and
</font><font>private property may be weak or non-existent. Sudden changes in governments may result in policies which are less
</font><font>favorable to investors such as policies designed to expropriate or nationalize </font><font>“</font><font>sovereign</font><font>”</font><font> assets. Certain emerging market
</font><font>countries in the past have expropriated large amounts of private property, in many cases with little or no compensation, and </font><font>there can be no assurance that such expropriation will not occur in the future.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Investment in the securities markets of certain emerging market countries is restricted or controlled to varying degrees. </font><font>These restrictions may limit a Fund's investment in certain emerging market countries and may increase the expenses of the
</font><font>Fund. Certain emerging market countries require governmental approval prior to investments by foreign persons or limit </font><font>investment by foreign persons to only a specified percentage of an issuer's outstanding securities or a specific class of
</font><font>securities which may have less advantageous terms (including price) than securities of the company available for purchase </font><font>by nationals.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Many emerging market countries lack the social, political, and economic stability characteristic of the U.S. Political instability </font><font>among emerging market countries can be common and may be caused by an uneven distribution of wealth, social unrest, </font><font>labor
strikes, civil wars, and religious oppression. Economic instability in emerging market countries may take the form of: (i) </font><font>high interest rates; (ii) high levels of inflation,
including hyperinflation; (iii) high levels of unemployment or </font><font>underemployment; (iv) changes in government economic and tax policies, including confiscatory taxation; and (v)
</font><font>imposition of trade barriers.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>A Fund's income and, in some cases, capital gains from foreign securities will be subject to applicable taxation in certain of
</font><font>the emerging market countries in which it invests, and treaties between the U.S. and such countries may not be available in </font><font>some cases to reduce the otherwise applicable tax rates.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Emerging markets also have different clearance and settlement procedures, and in certain of these emerging markets there
</font><font>have been times when settlements have been unable to keep pace with the volume of securities transactions, making it </font><font>difficult to conduct such transactions.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In the past, certain governments in emerging market countries have become overly reliant on the international capital
</font><font>markets and other forms of foreign credit to finance large public spending programs, which in the past have caused huge </font><font>budget deficits. Often, interest payments have become too overwhelming for a government to meet, representing a large
</font><font>percentage of total GDP. These foreign obligations have become the subject of political debate and served as fuel for political </font><font>parties of the opposition, which pressure the government not to make payments to foreign creditors, but instead to use these
</font><font>funds for, among other things, social programs. Either due to an inability to pay or submission to political pressure, foreign </font><font>governments have been forced to seek a restructuring of their loan and/or bond obligations, have declared a temporary
</font><font>suspension of interest payments or have defaulted. These events have adversely affected the values of securities issued by </font><font>foreign governments and corporations domiciled in those countries and have negatively affected not only their cost of
</font><font>borrowing, but their ability to borrow in the future as well.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Europe.
</font><font> </font><font>Investing in European countries may expose a Fund to the economic and political risks
</font><font>associated with Europe in general and the specific European countries in which it invests. The economies and markets of </font><font>European countries are often closely connected and interdependent, and events in one European country can have an </font><font>adverse
impact on other European countries. A Fund makes investments in securities of issuers that are domiciled in, have </font><font>significant operations in, or that are listed on at least one
securities exchange within member states of the EU. A number of </font><font>countries within the EU are also members of the EMU (the </font><font>“</font><font>eurozone</font><font>”</font><font>) and have adopted the euro as their currency. </font><font>Eurozone membership requires member states to comply with restrictions on
inflation rates, deficits, interest rates, debt </font><font>levels and fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every country in Europe. Changes in import or
</font><font>export tariffs, changes in governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro and other </font><font>currencies of certain EU countries which are not in the eurozone, the default or threat of default by an EU member state on its </font><font>sovereign debt, and/or an economic recession in an EU member state may have a significant adverse effect on the </font><font>economies of
other EU member states and their trading partners. Although certain European countries are not in the </font><font>eurozone, many of these countries are obliged to meet the criteria for joining
the eurozone.</font><font> </font></div> <div> <div><font>Consequently, these countries must comply with many of the restrictions noted above. The European financial markets have
</font><font>experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns, government debt levels and the </font><font>possible default of government debt in several European countries, including, but not limited to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus,
</font><font>France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. In order to prevent further economic deterioration, certain </font><font>countries, without prior warning, can institute
</font><font>“</font><font>capital controls.</font><font>”</font><font> Countries may use these controls to restrict volatile </font><font>movements of capital entering and exiting their country. Such
controls may negatively affect a Fund’s investments. A default </font><font>or debt restructuring by any European country would adversely impact holders of that country’s debt and
sellers of credit </font><font>default swaps linked to that country’s creditworthiness, which may be located in countries other than those listed above. In </font><font>addition, the credit ratings of certain European countries were downgraded in the past. These events have adversely affected
</font><font>the value and exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect the economies of every country in Europe, </font><font>including countries that do not use the euro and non-EU member states. Responses to the financial problems by European
</font><font>governments, central banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may </font><font>result in social unrest and may limit future growth and economic recovery or have other unintended consequences. Further
</font><font>defaults or restructurings by governments and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on </font><font>economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more countries may abandon the </font><font>euro
and/or withdraw from the EU. The impact of these actions, especially if they occur in a disorderly fashion, is not clear </font><font>but could be significant and far-reaching and could
adversely impact the value of a Fund’s investments in the region.</font></div> </div> <div>

conditions and could contribute to instability in global political </font><font>institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Certain European countries have also developed increasingly strained relationships with the
U.S., and if these relations were </font><font>to worsen, they could adversely affect European issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The national politics of countries in </font><font>Europe have been unpredictable and subject to influence by disruptive political groups and ideologies, including for example,
</font><font>secessionist movements. The governments of European countries may be subject to change and such countries may
</font><font>experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments may result in sudden and </font><font>significant investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe or war in the region also could impact
</font><font>financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching</font><font> </font><font>and could adversely affect </font><font>the
value and liquidity of a Fund's investments.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Russian

</font><font>activity, including purchasing and financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer or purchaser preferences, </font><font>sanctions, import and export restrictions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Russian government, Russian companies or Russian
</font><font>individuals, including politicians, may impact Russia's economy, Russian issuers of securities in which a Fund invests, or the </font><font>economies of Europe as a whole. Actual and threatened responses to Russian military action may also impact the markets for
</font><font>certain Russian commodities, such as oil and natural gas, as well as other sectors of the Russian economy, and are likely to </font><font>have collateral impacts on such sectors across Europe and globally.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Middle
East. </font><font> </font><font>Many Middle Eastern countries have little or no democratic tradition, and the
political </font><font>and legal systems in such countries may have an adverse impact on a Fund. Many economies in the Middle East are highly </font><font>reliant on income from the sale of oil and natural gas or trade with countries involved in the sale of oil and natural gas, and </font><font>their economies are therefore vulnerable to changes in the market for oil and natural gas and foreign currency values. As
</font><font>global demand for oil and natural gas fluctuates, many Middle Eastern economies may be significantly impacted.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>In addition, many Middle Eastern governments have exercised and continue to exercise
substantial influence over many </font><font>aspects of the private sector. In certain cases, a Middle Eastern country’s government may own or control many companies, </font><font>including some of the largest companies in the country. Accordingly, governmental actions in the future could have a
</font><font>significant effect on economic conditions in Middle Eastern countries. This could affect private sector companies and a Fund, </font><font>as well as the value of securities in a Fund's portfolio.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Certain Middle Eastern markets are in the earliest stages of development. As a result, there
may be a high concentration of </font><font>market capitalization and trading volume in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries, as well as </font><font>a high concentration of investors and financial intermediaries. Brokers in Middle Eastern countries typically are fewer in
</font><font>number and less capitalized than brokers in the U.S.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The legal systems in certain Middle Eastern countries also may have an adverse impact on a Fund. For example, the potential
</font><font>liability of a shareholder in a U.S. corporation with respect to acts of the corporation generally is limited to the amount of the </font><font>shareholder’s investment. However, the notion of limited liability is less clear in certain Middle Eastern countries. A Fund </font><font>therefore may be liable in certain Middle Eastern countries for the acts of a corporation in which it invests for an amount
</font><font>greater than its actual investment in that corporation. Similarly, the rights of investors in Middle Eastern issuers may be more </font><font>limited than those of shareholders of a U.S. corporation. It may be difficult or impossible to obtain or enforce a legal
</font><font>judgment in a Middle Eastern country. Some Middle Eastern countries prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on </font><font>investments in their capital markets, particularly their equity markets, by foreign entities such as a Fund. For example, certain </font><font>countries may require governmental approval prior to investment by foreign persons or limit the amount of investment by
</font><font>foreign persons in a particular issuer. Certain Middle Eastern countries may also limit investment by foreign persons to only a </font><font>specific class of securities of an issuer that may have less advantageous terms (including price) than securities of the issuer </font><font>available for purchase by nationals of the relevant Middle Eastern country.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The manner in which foreign investors may invest in companies in certain Middle Eastern countries, as well as limitations on
</font><font>those investments, may have an adverse impact on the operations of a Fund. For example, in certain of these countries, a </font><font>Fund may be required to invest initially through a local broker or other entity and then have the shares that were purchased
</font><font>re-registered in the name of a Fund. Re-registration in some instances may not be possible on a timely basis. This may result </font><font>in a delay during which a Fund may be denied certain of its rights as an investor, including rights as to dividends or to be
</font><font>made aware of certain corporate actions. There also may be instances where a Fund places a purchase order but is
</font><font>subsequently informed, at the time of re-registration, that the permissible allocation of the investment to foreign investors </font><font>has already been filled and, consequently, a Fund may not be able to invest in the relevant company.</font><font>
</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Substantial limitations may exist in certain Middle Eastern countries
with respect to a Fund’s ability to repatriate investment </font><font>income or capital gains. A Fund could be adversely affected by delays in, or a refusal to grant, any required
governmental </font><font>approval for repatriation of capital, as well as by the application to a Fund of any restrictions on investment.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Certain Middle Eastern countries may be heavily dependent upon international trade and,
consequently, have been and may </font><font>continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values and </font><font>other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade. These countries also have been
</font><font>and may continue to be adversely impacted by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade. In addition, </font><font>certain issuers located in Middle Eastern countries in which a Fund invests may operate in, or have dealings with, countries
</font><font>subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations, and/or countries identified </font><font>by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer may sustain damage to its reputation if it is
</font><font>identified as an issuer which operates in, or has dealings with, such countries. A Fund, as an investor in such issuers, will be </font><font>indirectly subject to those risks.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Certain Middle Eastern countries have strained relations with other Middle Eastern countries due to territorial disputes,
</font><font>historical animosities, international alliances, defense concerns or other reasons, which may adversely affect the economies </font><font>of these Middle Eastern countries. Certain Middle Eastern countries experience significant unemployment, as well as
</font><font>widespread underemployment. There has also been a recent increase in recruitment efforts and an aggressive push for </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>territorial control by terrorist groups in the
region, which has led to an outbreak of warfare and hostilities. Warfare in Syria has </font><font>spread to surrounding areas, including many portions of Iraq and Turkey. Such hostilities may
continue into the future or may </font><font>escalate at any time due to ethnic, racial, political, religious or ideological tensions between groups in the region or foreign </font><font>intervention or lack of intervention, among other factors.</font><font> </font></div>
<div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in North America. </font><font> </font><font>A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations or an economic recession </font><font>in any North American country can have a significant economic effect on the entire North American region and on some or </font><font>all
of the North American countries in which a Fund invests. </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The U.S. is
Canada's and Mexico's largest trading and investment partner. The Canadian and Mexican economies are </font><font>significantly affected by developments in the U.S. economy. Since the
implementation of the North American Free Trade </font><font>Agreement (</font><font>“</font><font>NAFTA</font><font>”</font><font>) in 1994 among Canada, the U.S. and
Mexico, total merchandise trade among the three countries has </font><font>increased. However, political developments including the implementation of tariffs by the U.S., and the renegotiation
of </font><font>NAFTA in the form of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (</font><font>“</font><font>USMCA</font><font>”</font><font>), which replaced NAFTA on July 1, 2020,
could </font><font>negatively affect North America’s economic outlook and, as a result, the value of securities held by a Fund. Policy and </font><font>legislative changes in one country may have a significant effect on North American markets generally, as well as on the value
</font><font>of certain securities held by a Fund. </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Russia. </font><font> </font><font>Investing in the Russian securities market involves a high degree of risk and special </font><font>considerations not typically
associated with investing in the U.S. securities market, and should be considered highly </font><font>speculative. Risks include: the absence of developed legal structures governing private and
foreign investments and private </font><font>property; the possibility of the loss of all or a substantial portion of a Fund’s assets invested in Russia as a result of </font><font>expropriation; certain national policies which may restrict the Fund’s investment opportunities, including, without limitation, </font><font>restrictions on investing in issuers or industries deemed sensitive to relevant national interests; and potentially greater price </font><font>volatility in, significantly smaller capitalization of, and relative illiquidity of, the Russian market. There can also be no
</font><font>assurance that a Fund’s investments in the Russian securities market would not be expropriated, nationalized or otherwise </font><font>confiscated. In the event of the settlement of any such claims or such expropriation, nationalization or other confiscation, a
</font><font>Fund could lose its entire investment. In addition, it may be difficult and more costly to obtain and enforce a judgment in the </font><font>Russian court system.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Russia may also be subject to a greater degree of economic, political and social instability than is the case in other developed </font><font>countries. Such instability may result from, among other things, the following: (i) an authoritarian government or military
</font><font>involvement in political and economic decision-making, including changes in government through extra-constitutional </font><font>means; (ii) popular unrest associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions; (iii) internal
</font><font>insurgencies; (iv) hostile relations, including armed conflict, with neighboring countries; and (v) ethnic, religious and racial </font><font>disaffection.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The
Russian economy is heavily dependent upon the export of a range of commodities including most industrial metals, </font><font>forestry products and oil and gas. Accordingly, it is strongly
affected by international commodity prices and is particularly </font><font>vulnerable to any weakening in global demand for these products. Any acts of terrorism or armed conflicts in Russia
or </font><font>internationally could have an adverse effect on the financial and commodities markets and the global economy. As Russia </font><font>produces and exports large amounts of crude oil and gas, any acts of terrorism or armed conflict causing disruptions of
</font><font>Russian oil and gas exports could negatively affect the Russian economy and, thus, adversely affect the financial condition, </font><font>results of operations or prospects of related companies. Current and future economic sanctions may also adversely affect the
</font><font>Russian oil, banking, mining, metals, rail, pipeline and gas sectors, among other sectors.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The Russian government may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector and may own or control </font><font>many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic conditions in Russia, which </font><font>could
have a negative impact on private sector companies. There is also the possibility of diplomatic developments that could </font><font>adversely affect investments in Russia. In recent years, the
Russian government has begun to take bolder steps to re-assert its </font><font>regional geopolitical influence (including military steps) and launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on
February 24, 2022. </font><font>Additionally, Russia is alleged to have participated in state-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign companies and foreign </font><font>governments. Such steps have increased tensions between Russia and its neighbors and Western countries and may </font><font>negatively
affect economic growth. Actual and threatened responses by other nation-states to Russia’s alleged cyber activity </font><font>may have an adverse impact on the Russian economy and the
Russian issuers of securities in which a Fund invests. For </font><font>example, the U.S. has added certain foreign technology companies to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of
Industry </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>101</font></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div><font>Russian invasion of Ukraine</font><font>. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of
Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The extent and duration </font><font>of the military action, resulting sanctions and resulting future market disruptions, including declines in its stock markets
and </font><font>the value of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but could be significant. Disruptions caused by Russian </font><font>military action or other actions (including cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting actual and threatened responses to such
</font><font>activity, including purchasing and financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer or purchaser preferences, </font><font>sanctions, import and export restrictions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Russian government, Russian companies or Russian
</font><font>individuals, including politicians, may impact Russia’s economy, Russian issuers of securities in which a Fund invests, or the </font><font>economies of Europe as a whole. Actual and threatened responses to Russian military action may also impact the markets for
</font><font>certain Russian commodities, such as oil and natural gas, as well as other sectors of the Russian economy, and are likely to </font><font>have collateral impacts on such sectors across Europe and globally.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Russia Sanctions</font><font>. Governments in the U.S. and many other countries (collectively, the </font><font>“</font><font>Sanctioning Bodies</font><font>”</font><font>) have imposed </font><font>economic sanctions on certain Russian individuals, including politicians, and Russian corporate and banking
entities, </font><font>including banning Russia from global payments systems that facilitate cross-border payments. The Sanctioning Bodies, or </font><font>others, could also institute broader sanctions on Russia. These sanctions, or even the threat of further sanctions, may result
</font><font>in the decline of the value and liquidity of Russian securities, a weakening of the ruble or other adverse consequences to the </font><font>Russian economy. These sanctions could also result in the immediate freeze of Russian securities and/or funds invested in
</font><font>prohibited assets, impairing the ability of a Fund to buy, sell, receive or deliver those securities and/or assets. Recently, Russia </font><font>has issued a number of countersanctions, some of which restrict the distribution of profits by limited liability companies (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, </font><font>dividends), and prohibits
Russian persons from entering into transactions with designated persons from </font><font>“</font><font>unfriendly states</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>as well as the export of raw
materials or other products from Russia to certain sanctioned persons.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The sanctions against certain Russian issuers include prohibitions on transacting in or dealing in issuances of debt or equity </font><font>of such issuers. Compliance with each of these sanctions has and may continue to impair the ability of a Fund to buy, sell,
</font><font>hold, receive or deliver the affected securities or other securities of such issuers. If it becomes impracticable or unlawful for a </font><font>Fund to hold securities subject to, or otherwise affected by, sanctions (collectively, </font><font>“</font><font>affected securities</font><font>”</font><font>), or if deemed </font><font>appropriate by BFA, a Fund may prohibit in-kind deposits of the affected securities in connection with creation transactions
</font><font>and instead require a cash deposit, which may also increase a Fund’s transaction costs. A Fund may also be legally required </font><font>to freeze assets in a blocked account.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Sanctions have resulted in Russia taking counter measures or retaliatory actions, which has impaired the value and liquidity
</font><font>of Russian securities. These retaliatory measures include the immediate freeze of Russian assets held by a Fund. Due to such </font><font>a freeze of these assets, including depositary receipts, a Fund may need to liquidate non-restricted assets in order to satisfy </font><font>any Fund redemption orders. The liquidation of Fund assets during this time may also result in a Fund receiving substantially
</font><font>lower prices for its securities. Russia may implement additional retaliatory measures, which may further impair the value and </font><font>liquidity of Russian securities and the ability of the Fund to receive dividend payments. Recently, Russia has issued a number
</font><font>of countersanctions, some of which restrict the distribution of profits by limited liability companies (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, dividends), and </font><font>prohibits
Russian persons from entering into transactions with designated persons from </font><font>“</font><font>unfriendly states</font><font>”</font><font> as well as the </font><font>export of raw materials or other
products from Russia to certain sanctioned persons. Russian companies may be unable to </font><font>pay dividends and, if they pay dividends, the Fund may be unable to receive
them.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>These sanctions, the decision by Russia to suspend trading on the
Moscow Exchange (MOEX) and prohibit non-resident </font><font>investors from executing security sales, and other events have led to changes in the Fund's Underlying Index. The Fund’s
</font><font>Index Provider has removed Russian securities from the Underlying Index. To the extent that the Fund rebalances its portfolio </font><font>and trades in non-Russian securities to seek to track the investment results of the Underlying Index, this may result in
</font><font>transaction costs and increased tracking error. The Fund is currently restricted from trading in Russian securities, including </font><font>those in its portfolio, while the Underlying Index has removed Russian securities. This disparity will also lead to increased
</font><font>tracking error. The inability of the Fund to trade in Russian securities may adversely affect the Fund’s ability to meet its </font><font>investment objective. It is unknown when, or if, sanctions may be lifted or the Fund’s ability to trade in Russian securities will </font><font>resume.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Also, if
an affected security is included in a Fund’s Underlying Index, a Fund may, where practicable, seek to eliminate its </font><font>holdings of the affected security by employing or
augmenting its representative sampling strategy to seek to track the </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>investment results of its Underlying Index. The
use of (or increased use of) a representative sampling strategy may increase a </font><font>Fund’s tracking error risk. If the affected securities constitute a significant percentage of
the Underlying Index, a Fund may </font><font>not be able to effectively implement a representative sampling strategy, which may result in significant tracking error </font><font>between a Fund’s performance and the performance of its Underlying Index.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Saudi Arabia. </font><font> </font><font> The ability of foreign investors (such as the Funds) to invest in the securities of Saudi </font><font>Arabian issuers is relatively
new. Such ability could be restricted by the Saudi Arabian government at any time, and </font><font>unforeseen risks could materialize with respect to foreign ownership in such securities. In
addition, the Capital Market </font><font>Authority (</font><font>“</font><font>CMA</font><font>”</font><font>) places investment limitations on the
ownership of the securities of Saudi Arabian issuers by foreign </font><font>investors, including a limitation on a Fund’s ownership of the securities of any single issuer listed on the
Saudi Arabian Stock </font><font>Exchange, which may prevent a Fund from investing in accordance with its strategy and contribute to tracking error against </font><font>the Underlying Index. These restrictions may be changed or new restrictions, such as licensing requirements, special
</font><font>approvals or additional foreign taxes, may be instituted at any time. A Fund may not be able to obtain or maintain any such </font><font>licenses or approvals and may not be able to buy and sell securities at full value. Major disruptions or regulatory changes
</font><font>could occur in the Saudi Arabian market, any of which could negatively impact a Fund. These risks may be exacerbated, </font><font>compared to more developed markets, given the limited history of foreign investment in the Saudi Arabian market. </font><font>Investments
in Saudi Arabia may also be subject to loss due to expropriation or nationalization of assets and property or the </font><font>imposition of restrictions on additional foreign investments and
repatriation of capital. Such heightened risks may include, </font><font>among others, restrictions on and government intervention in international trade, confiscatory taxation, political
instability, </font><font>including authoritarian and/or military involvement in governmental decision making, armed conflict, crime and instability as </font><font>a result of religious, ethnic and/or socioeconomic unrest. Saudi Arabia has privatized, or has begun the process of privatizing, </font><font>certain entities and industries. Newly privatized companies may face strong competition from government-sponsored
</font><font>competitors that have not been privatized. In some instances, investors in newly privatized entities have suffered losses due </font><font>to the inability of the newly privatized entities to adjust quickly to a competitive environment or changing regulatory and
</font><font>legal standards or, in some cases, due to re-nationalization of such privatized entities. There is no assurance that similar </font><font>losses will not recur. Saudi Arabia is highly reliant on income from the sale of petroleum and trade with other countries
</font><font>involved in the sale of petroleum, and its economy is therefore vulnerable to changes in foreign currency values and the </font><font>market for petroleum, as well as acts targeting petroleum production or processing facilities in Saudi Arabia. As global
</font><font>demand for petroleum fluctuates, Saudi Arabia may be significantly impacted. In the recent past, the Saudi Arabian </font><font>government has explored privatization and diversification of the economy in the wake of a diminished petroleum market.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Like most Middle Eastern governments, the government of Saudi Arabia exercises substantial
influence over many aspects of </font><font>the private sector. Although liberalization in the wider economy is underway, in many areas it has lagged significantly: </font><font>restrictions on foreign ownership persist, and the government has an ownership stake in many key industries. The situation is
</font><font>exacerbated by the fact that Saudi Arabia is governed by an absolute monarchy. Saudi Arabia has historically experienced </font><font>strained relations with economic partners worldwide, including other countries in the Middle East, due to geopolitical events.
</font><font>Incidents involving a Middle Eastern country’s or the region’s security, including terrorism, may cause uncertainty in their </font><font>markets and may adversely affect its economy and a Fund’s investments.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Governmental actions in the future could have a significant effect on economic conditions in
Saudi Arabia, which could affect </font><font>private sector companies and a Fund, as well as the value of securities in a Fund’s portfolio. Any economic sanctions on </font><font>Saudi Arabian individuals or Saudi Arabian corporate entities, or even the threat of sanctions, may result in the decline of the </font><font>value and liquidity of Saudi Arabian securities, a weakening of the Saudi riyal or other adverse consequences to the Saudi
</font><font>Arabian economy. Any sanctions could also result in the immediate freeze of Saudi Arabian securities and/or funds investing </font><font>in prohibited assets, impairing the ability of a Fund to buy, sell, receive or deliver those securities and/or assets. In addition, </font><font>Saudi Arabia’s economy relies heavily on cheap, foreign labor, and changes in the availability of this labor supply could have </font><font>an adverse effect on the economy.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The securities markets in Saudi Arabia may not be as developed as those in other countries. As a result, securities markets in
</font><font>Saudi Arabia are subject to greater risks associated with market volatility, lower market capitalization, lower trading volume, </font><font>illiquidity, inflation, greater price fluctuations, uncertainty regarding the existence of trading markets, governmental control </font><font>and heavy regulation of labor and industry. Shares of certain Saudi Arabian companies tend to trade less frequently than
</font><font>those of companies on exchanges in more developed markets. Such infrequent trading may adversely affect the pricing of </font><font>these securities and a Fund’s ability to sell these securities in the future.</font><font> </font></div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Although the political situation in Saudi Arabia
is largely stable, Saudi Arabia has historically experienced political instability, </font><font>and there remains the possibility that the stability will not hold in the future or that
instability in the larger Middle East region </font><font>could adversely impact the economy of Saudi Arabia. Instability may be caused by military developments, government </font><font>interventions in the marketplace, terrorism, extremist attitudes, attempted social or political reforms, religious differences, or </font><font>other factors. Additionally, anti-Western views held by certain groups in the Middle East may influence government policies
</font><font>regarding foreign investment. Further developments in U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia and other Middle-Eastern countries </font><font>may affect these attitudes and policies. The U.S. is a significant trading partner of, or foreign investor in, Saudi Arabia. As a </font><font>result, economic conditions of Saudi Arabia may be particularly affected by changes in the U.S. economy. A decrease in U.S.
</font><font>imports or exports, new trade and financial regulations or tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate or an economic </font><font>slowdown in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on the economic conditions of Saudi Arabia and, as a result,
</font><font>securities to which a Fund has exposure. Political instability in North Africa and the larger Middle East region has caused </font><font>significant disruptions to many industries. Continued political and social unrest in these areas may negatively affect the value </font><font>of securities in a Fund’s portfolio.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Certain issuers located in Saudi Arabia may operate in, or have dealings with, countries subject to sanctions and/or
</font><font>embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as </font><font>state sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer may sustain damage to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer which </font><font>operates in, or has dealings with, such countries. A Fund, as an investor in such issuers, will be indirectly subject to those
</font><font>risks.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Automotive Sub-Industry. </font><font> </font><font>The automotive sub-industry can be highly cyclical, and companies in the </font><font>automotive sub-industry may suffer periodic losses.
The automotive sub-industry is also highly competitive and there may </font><font>be, at times, excess capacity in the global and domestic automotive sub-industry. Over the last several
decades, the U.S. </font><font>automotive sub-industry has experienced periodic downturns; certain automotive companies required stimulus from the U.S. </font><font>government, while others formed strategic industry alliances in order to weather the substantially difficult market conditions. </font><font>In general, the automotive sub-industry is susceptible to labor disputes, product defect litigation, patent expiration, increased </font><font>pension liabilities, rise in material or component prices and changing consumer tastes.</font><font> </font></div>
</div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Basic Materials Industry. </font><font> </font><font>Issuers in the basic materials industry could be adversely affected by </font><font>commodity price volatility, exchange rate fluctuations, social and political unrest, import controls and increased competition. </font><font>Companies in the basic materials industry may be subject to swift fluctuations in supply and demand. Fluctuations may be
</font><font>caused by events relating to political and economic developments, the environmental impact of basic materials operations, </font><font>and the success of exploration projects. Production of industrial materials often exceeds demand as a result of over-building
</font><font>or economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns. Issuers in the basic materials industry are at risk for </font><font>environmental damage and product liability claims and may be adversely affected by depletion of resources, delays in
</font><font>technical progress, labor relations, tax and government regulations related to changes to, among other things, energy and </font><font>environmental policies.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Capital Goods Industry. </font><font> </font><font>Companies in the capital goods industry may be affected by fluctuations in </font><font>the business cycle and by other factors affecting
manufacturing demands. Companies in the capital goods industry depend </font><font>heavily on corporate spending. Companies in the capital goods industry may perform well during times of
economic </font><font>expansion, and as economic conditions worsen, the demand for capital goods may decrease due to weakening demand, </font><font>worsening business cash flows, tighter credit controls and deteriorating profitability. During times of economic volatility,
</font><font>corporate spending may fall and adversely affect the capital goods industry. This industry may also be affected by changes in </font><font>interest rates, corporate tax rates and other government policies. Many capital goods are sold internationally and such
</font><font>companies are subject to market conditions in other countries and regions.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Cyclical Industry.
</font><font> </font><font>A Fund may invest in consumer cyclical companies, which rely heavily </font><font>on business cycles and economic conditions. Consumer cyclical companies include automotive manufacturers, retail </font><font>companies,
and housing-related companies. The consumer cyclical industry can be significantly affected by several factors, </font><font>including, without limitation, the performance of domestic and
international economies, exchange rates, changing consumer </font><font>tastes and trends, marketing campaigns, cyclical revenue generation, consumer confidence, commodity price volatility,
labor </font><font>relations, interest rates, import and export controls, intense competition, technological developments and government </font><font>regulation.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Consumer
Discretionary Sector. </font><font> </font><font>Companies engaged in the design, production or distribution of
</font><font>products or services for the consumer discretionary sector (including, without limitation, television and radio broadcasting, </font><font>manufacturing, publishing, recording and musical instruments, motion pictures, photography, amusement and theme parks,
</font><font>gaming casinos, sporting goods and sports arenas, camping and recreational equipment, toys and games, apparel, travel-related</font><font> services, automobiles, hotels and motels, and fast food and other restaurants) are subject to the risk that their </font><font>products
or services may become obsolete quickly. The success of these companies can depend heavily on disposable </font><font>household income and consumer spending. During periods of an expanding
economy, the consumer discretionary sector </font><font>may outperform the consumer staples sector, but may underperform when economic conditions worsen. Moreover, the </font><font>consumer discretionary sector can be significantly affected by several factors, including, without limitation, the performance
</font><font>of domestic and international economies, exchange rates, changing consumer preferences, demographics, marketing
</font><font>campaigns, cyclical revenue generation, consumer confidence, commodity price volatility, labor relations, interest rates, </font><font>import and export controls, intense competition, technological developments and government regulation.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Goods Industry.
</font><font> </font><font>Companies in the consumer goods industry include companies involved </font><font>in the design, production or distribution of goods for consumers, including food, household, home, personal and office
</font><font>products, clothing and textiles. The success of the consumer goods industry is tied closely to the performance of the </font><font>domestic and international economy, interest rates, exchange rates, competition, consumer confidence and consumer </font><font>disposable
income. The consumer goods industry may be affected by trends, marketing campaigns and other factors </font><font>affecting consumer demand. Governmental regulation affecting the use of various
food additives may affect the profitability </font><font>of certain companies in the consumer goods industry. Moreover, international events may affect food and beverage </font><font>companies that derive a substantial portion of their net income from foreign countries. In addition, tobacco companies may
</font><font>be adversely affected by new laws, regulations and litigation. Many consumer goods may be marketed globally, and
</font><font>consumer goods companies may be affected by the demand and market conditions in other countries and regions.
</font><font>Companies in the consumer goods industry may be subject to severe competition, which may also have an adverse impact </font><font>on their profitability. Changes in demographics and consumer preferences may affect the success of consumer products.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Services Industry. </font><font> </font><font>The success of firms in the consumer services industry and certain </font><font>retailers (including food and beverage, general
retailers, media, and travel and leisure) is tied closely to the performance of </font><font>the domestic and international economy, interest rates, exchange rates, competition and consumer
confidence. The </font><font>consumer services industry depends heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending. Companies in the </font><font>consumer services industry may be subject to severe competition, which may also have an adverse impact on their
</font><font>profitability. Companies in the consumer services industry are facing increased government and regulatory scrutiny and may </font><font>be subject to adverse government or regulatory action. Changes in demographics and consumer preferences may affect the
</font><font>success of consumer service providers.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Staples Sector. </font><font> </font><font>Companies in the consumer staples sector may be adversely affected by </font><font>changes in the global economy, consumer spending,
competition, demographics and consumer preferences, and production </font><font>spending. Companies in the consumer staples sector may also be affected by changes in global economic,
environmental </font><font>and political events, economic conditions, the depletion of resources, and government regulation. For instance, government </font><font>regulations may affect the permissibility of using various food additives and production methods of companies that make </font><font>food
products, which could affect company profitability. In addition, tobacco companies may be adversely affected by the </font><font>adoption of proposed legislation and/or by litigation. Companies
in the consumer staples sector also may be subject to risks </font><font>pertaining to the supply of, demand for and prices of raw materials. The prices of raw materials fluctuate in response
to a </font><font>number of factors, including, without limitation, changes in government agricultural support programs, exchange rates, </font><font>import and export controls, changes in international agricultural and trading policies, and seasonal and weather conditions.
</font><font>Companies in the consumer staples sector may be subject to severe competition, which may also have an adverse impact on </font><font>their profitability.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Electric Utilities Sector. </font><font> </font><font>The electric utility industry consists of companies that are engaged </font><font>principally in the generation, transmission and sale of
electric energy, although many also provide other energy-related </font><font>services. In the past, electric utility companies, in general, have been favorably affected by lower fuel and
financing costs and </font><font>the full or near completion of major construction programs. In addition, many of these companies have generated cash flows </font><font>in excess of current operating expenses and construction expenditures, permitting some degree of diversification into
</font><font>unregulated businesses. Some electric utilities have also taken advantage of the right to sell power outside of their traditional </font><font>geographic areas. Electric utility companies have historically been subject to the risks associated with increases in fuel and
</font><font>other operating costs, high interest costs on borrowings needed for capital construction programs, costs associated with </font></div> </div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>compliance with environmental and safety
regulations and changes in the regulatory climate. As interest rates declined, </font><font>many utilities refinanced high cost debt and in doing so improved their fixed charges coverage.
Regulators, however, lowered </font><font>allowed rates of return as interest rates declined and thereby caused the benefits of the rate declines to be shared wholly or </font><font>in part with customers. In a period of rising interest rates, the allowed rates of return may not keep pace with the utilities’ </font><font>increased costs. The construction and operation of nuclear power facilities are subject to strict scrutiny by, and evolving
</font><font>regulations of, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and state agencies which have comparable jurisdiction. Strict scrutiny </font><font>might result in higher operating costs and higher capital expenditures, with the risk that the regulators may disallow
</font><font>inclusion of these costs in rate authorizations or the risk that a company may not be permitted to operate or complete </font><font>construction of a facility. In addition, operators of nuclear power plants may be subject to significant costs for disposal of
</font><font>nuclear fuel and for decommissioning such plants.</font><font> </font></div>
<div> <div><font>The rating agencies look closely at the business profile of utility companies. Ratings for
companies are expected to be </font><font>impacted to a greater extent in the future by the division of their asset base. Electric utility companies that focus more on the </font><font>generation of electricity may be assigned less favorable ratings as this business is expected to be competitive and the least
</font><font>regulated. On the other hand, companies that focus on transmission and distribution, which is expected to be the least </font><font>competitive and the more regulated part of the business, may see higher ratings given the greater predictability of cash flow.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>A number of states are considering or have enacted deregulation proposals. The introduction of competition into the </font><font>industry as a result of such deregulation has at times resulted in lower revenue, lower credit ratings, increased default risk, </font><font>and lower electric utility security prices. Such increased competition may also cause long-term contracts, which electric
</font><font>utilities previously entered into to buy power, to become </font><font>“</font><font>stranded assets</font><font>”</font><font> which have no economic value.
Any loss </font><font>associated with such contracts must be absorbed by ratepayers and investors. In addition, some electric utilities have </font><font>acquired electric utilities overseas to diversify, enhance earnings and gain experience in operating in a deregulated
</font><font>environment. In some instances, such acquisitions have involved significant borrowings, which have burdened the acquirer’s </font><font>balance sheet. There is no assurance that current deregulation proposals will be adopted. However, deregulation in any form
</font><font>could significantly impact the electric utilities industry.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Energy Sector. </font><font> </font><font>Companies in the energy sector are strongly affected by the levels and volatility of </font><font>global energy prices, energy supply and
demand, government regulations and policies, energy production and conservation </font><font>efforts, technological change, development of alternative energy sources, and other factors that
they cannot control. These </font><font>companies may also lack resources and have limited business lines. Energy companies may have relatively high levels of debt </font><font>and may be more likely to restructure their businesses if there are downturns in certain energy markets or in the global
</font><font>economy. If an energy company in a Fund's portfolio becomes distressed, a Fund could lose all or a substantial portion of its </font><font>investment.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The
energy sector is cyclical and is highly dependent on commodity prices; prices and supplies of energy may fluctuate </font><font>significantly over short and long periods of time due to, among
other things, national and international political changes, </font><font>Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(</font><font>“</font><font>OPEC</font><font>”</font><font>) policies, changes in relationships among OPEC members and </font><font>between OPEC and oil-importing nations, the regulatory
environment, taxation policies, the enactment or cessation of trade </font><font>sanctions, war or other geopolitical conflicts, and the economies of the key energy-consuming countries.
Commodity prices </font><font>have recently been subject to increased volatility, which may negatively affect companies in which a Fund invests. For </font><font>example, in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak and disputes among oil-producing countries regarding potential limits on
</font><font>the production of crude oil, the energy sector has experienced increased volatility. In particular, significant market volatility </font><font>occurred in the crude oil markets as well as the oil futures markets, which resulted in the market price of certain crude oil
</font><font>futures contracts falling below zero for a period of time.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Companies in the energy sector may be adversely affected by terrorism, war, cyber incidents, natural disasters or other
</font><font>catastrophes. Companies in the energy sector are at risk of civil liability from accidents resulting in injury, loss of life or </font><font>property, pollution or other environmental damage claims. Disruptions in the oil industry or shifts in fuel consumption may
</font><font>significantly impact companies in this sector. Significant oil and gas deposits are located in emerging markets countries </font><font>where corruption and security may raise significant risks, in addition to the other risks of investing in emerging markets.
</font><font>Additionally, the Middle East, where many companies in the energy sector may operate, has historically and recently </font><font>experienced widespread social unrest.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Companies in the energy sector may also be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates, interest rates, economic
</font><font>conditions, tax treatment, government regulation and intervention, negative perception, efforts at energy conservation and </font></div> </div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>world events in the regions in which the companies
operate (</font><font>e.g.,</font><font> expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and </font><font>property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest,
</font><font>violence or labor unrest). Because a significant portion of revenues of companies in this sector is derived from a relatively </font><font>small number of customers that are largely composed of governmental entities and utilities, governmental budget </font><font>constraints
may have a significant impact on the stock prices of companies in this sector. The energy sector is highly </font><font>regulated. Entities operating in the energy sector are subject to
significant regulation of nearly every aspect of their </font><font>operations by governmental agencies. Such regulation can change rapidly or over time in both scope and intensity. Stricter
</font><font>laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be enacted in the future which would likely increase compliance costs and </font><font>may materially adversely affect the financial performance of companies in the energy sector. Energy companies may have
</font><font>relatively high levels of debt and may be more likely than companies in other sectors to restructure their businesses during </font><font>economic downturns or adversity in global energy markets.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Russia's large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 has led to further disruptions and increased volatility in the
</font><font>energy and commodity futures markets due to actual and potential disruptions in the supply and demand for certain
</font><font>commodities, including oil and natural gas. The U.S. and certain European countries have announced bans or restrictions on </font><font>imports of hydrocarbon commodities from Russia. The effect of such bans and any similar restrictions by other countries, as
</font><font>well as the extent, scope and duration of the conflict, resulting sanctions and associated market disruptions on the energy </font><font>sector, are impossible to predict and depend on a number of factors. The effect of these events or any related developments
</font><font>could be significant and may have a severe adverse effect on the performance of a Fund.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Risk of Investing in the Financials Sector.
</font><font> </font><font>Companies in the financials sector include small, regional and money center </font><font>banks, securities brokerage firms, asset management companies, savings banks and thrift institutions, specialty finance
</font><font>companies (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, credit
card, mortgage providers), insurance and insurance brokerage firms, consumer finance firms, </font><font>financial conglomerates and foreign banking and financial companies.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Most financial companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which limits their activities and may affect their </font><font>ability to earn a profit from a given line of business. Government regulation may change frequently and may have significant
</font><font>adverse consequences for companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by the regulation. Direct </font><font>governmental intervention in the operations of financial companies and financial markets may materially and adversely affect
</font><font>the companies in which a Fund invests, including legislation in many countries that may increase government regulation, </font><font>repatriation and other intervention. The impact of governmental intervention and legislative changes on any individual
</font><font>financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. The valuation of financial companies has been </font><font>and continues to be subject to unprecedented volatility and may be influenced by unpredictable factors, including interest
</font><font>rate risk and sovereign debt default. Certain financial businesses are subject to intense competitive pressures, including </font><font>market share and price competition. Financial companies in foreign countries are subject to market-specific and general
</font><font>regulatory and interest rate concerns. In particular, government regulation in certain foreign countries may include taxes and </font><font>controls on interest rates, credit availability, minimum capital requirements, bans on short sales, limits on prices and
</font><font>restrictions on currency transfers. In addition, companies in the financials sector may be the targets of hacking and potential </font><font>theft of proprietary or customer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their
</font><font>businesses.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The profitability of banks, savings and loan associations and other financial companies is
largely dependent on the availability </font><font>and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change; for instance, when interest rates go up, </font><font>the value of securities issued by many types of companies in the financials sector generally goes down. In other words,
</font><font>financial companies may be adversely affected in certain market cycles, including, without limitation, during periods of rising </font><font>interest rates, which may restrict the availability and increase the cost of capital, and during periods of declining economic
</font><font>conditions, which may cause, among other things, credit losses due to financial difficulties of borrowers.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>In addition, general economic conditions are important to the operations of these companies, and financial difficulties of </font><font>borrowers may have an adverse effect on the profitability of financial companies. Companies in the financials sector are
</font><font>exposed directly to the credit risk of their borrowers and counterparties, who may be leveraged to an unknown degree, </font><font>including through swaps and other derivatives products, and who at times may be unable to meet their obligations to the
</font><font>financial services companies. Financial services companies may have significant exposure to the same borrowers and </font><font>counterparties, with the result that a borrower’s or counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations to one company may affect </font><font>other companies with exposure to the same borrower or counterparty. This interconnectedness of risk, including cross-default</font><font>
risk, may result in significant negative impacts to the financial condition and reputation of companies with direct </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>exposure to the defaulting counterparty as well as
adverse cascading effects in the markets and the financials sector </font><font>generally. Financial companies can be highly dependent upon access to capital markets, and any impediments to
such </font><font>access, such as adverse overall economic conditions or a negative perception in the capital markets of a financial company’s </font><font>financial condition or prospects, could adversely affect its business. Deterioration of credit markets can have an adverse
</font><font>impact on a broad range of financial markets, causing certain financial companies to incur large losses. In these conditions, </font><font>companies in the financials sector may experience significant declines in the valuation of their assets, take actions to raise
</font><font>capital and even cease operations. Some financial companies may also be required to accept or borrow significant amounts </font><font>of capital from government sources and may face future government-imposed restrictions on their businesses or increased
</font><font>government intervention. In addition, there is no guarantee that governments will provide any such relief in the future. These </font><font>actions may cause the securities of many companies in the financials sector to decline in value.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>Risk of Investing in the Healthcare Sector.
</font><font> </font><font>Companies in the healthcare sector are often issuers whose profitability may be </font><font>affected by extensive government regulation, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising or
</font><font>falling costs of medical products and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, a limited </font><font>number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market developments. Many healthcare </font><font>companies
are heavily dependent on patent protection and the actual or perceived safety and efficiency of their products.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Patents have a limited duration, and, upon expiration, other companies may market substantially similar </font><font>“</font><font>generic</font><font>”</font><font> products </font><font>that are typically sold at a lower price than the patented product, which can cause the original developer of the product to
</font><font>lose market share and/or reduce the price charged for the product, resulting in lower profits for the original developer. As a </font><font>result, the expiration of patents may adversely affect the profitability of these companies.</font><font> </font></div>
</div> <div> <div><font>In addition, because the products and services of many companies in the healthcare
sector affect the health and well-being </font><font>of many individuals, these companies are especially susceptible to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar </font><font>claims. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may
</font><font>result in price discounting. Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The process </font><font>of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, which can result in increased development costs, delayed cost recovery
</font><font>and loss of competitive advantage to the extent that rival companies have developed competing products or procedures, </font><font>adversely affecting the company’s revenues and profitability. In other words, delays in the regulatory approval process may </font><font>diminish the opportunity for a company to profit from a new product or to bring a new product to market, which could have </font><font>a
material adverse effect on a company’s business. Healthcare companies may also be strongly affected by scientific </font><font>biotechnology or technological developments, and their
products may quickly become obsolete. Also, many healthcare </font><font>companies offer products and services that are subject to governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by
changes </font><font>in governmental policies or laws. Changes in governmental policies or laws may span a wide range of topics, including cost </font><font>control, national health insurance, incentives for compensation in the provision of healthcare services, tax incentives and
</font><font>penalties related to healthcare insurance premiums, and promotion of prepaid healthcare plans. In addition, a number of </font><font>legislative proposals concerning healthcare have been considered by the U.S. Congress in recent years. It is unclear what
</font><font>proposals will ultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect they may have on companies in the healthcare sector.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Additionally, the expansion of facilities by healthcare-related providers may be subject to
</font><font>“</font><font>determinations of
need</font><font>”</font><font> by certain </font><font>government
authorities. This process not only generally increases the time and costs involved in these expansions, but also </font><font>makes expansion plans uncertain, limiting the revenue and
profitability growth potential of healthcare-related facilities </font><font>operators and negatively affecting the prices of their securities. Moreover, in recent years, both local and
national </font><font>governmental budgets have come under pressure to reduce spending and control healthcare costs, which could both </font><font>adversely affect regulatory processes and public funding available for healthcare products, services and facilities.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Industrials Sector. </font><font> </font><font>The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be </font><font>adversely affected by supply of and demand for
both their specific products or services and for industrials sector products in </font><font>general. The products of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological
developments and </font><font>frequent new product introduction. Government regulations, trade disputes, world events and economic conditions may </font><font>affect the performance of companies in the industrials sector. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by
</font><font>changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. For example, commodity price </font><font>declines and unit volume reductions resulting from an over-supply of materials used in the industrials sector can adversely
</font><font>affect the sector. Furthermore, companies in the industrials sector may be subject to liability for environmental damage, </font><font>product liability claims, depletion of resources, and mandated expenditures for safety and pollution control.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the
Infrastructure Industry. </font><font> </font><font>Companies in the infrastructure industry may be subject to a
variety of </font><font>factors that could adversely affect their business or operations, including high interest costs in connection with capital </font><font>construction programs, high degrees of leverage, costs associated with governmental, environmental and other regulations,
</font><font>the effects of economic slowdowns, increased competition from other providers of services, uncertainties concerning costs, </font><font>the level of government spending on infrastructure projects, and other factors. Infrastructure companies may be adversely
</font><font>affected by commodity price volatility, changes in exchange rates, import controls, depletion of resources, technological </font><font>developments, and labor relations. There is also the risk that corruption may negatively affect publicly funded infrastructure
</font><font>projects, especially in emerging markets, resulting in delays and cost overruns. Infrastructure issuers can be significantly </font><font>affected by government spending policies because companies involved in this industry rely to a significant extent on U.S. and
</font><font>other government demand for their products.</font><font> </font></div>
<div> <div><font>Infrastructure companies in the oil and gas industry may be adversely affected by government
regulation or world events in </font><font>the regions where the companies operate (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the </font><font>imposition of restrictions on foreign
investments and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest, violence or labor </font><font>unrest). Infrastructure companies may have significant capital investments in, or engage
in transactions involving, emerging </font><font>market countries, which may heighten these risks.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Operations Risk. </font><font>The failure of an infrastructure company to carry
adequate insurance or to operate its assets appropriately </font><font>could lead to significant losses. Infrastructure may be adversely affected by environmental clean-up costs and
catastrophic </font><font>events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Customer Risk. </font><font>Infrastructure companies can be dependent upon a narrow
customer base. Additionally, if these customers </font><font>fail to pay their obligations, significant revenues could be lost and may not be replaceable.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Regulatory Risk. </font><font>Infrastructure companies may be subject to significant regulation by various governmental
authorities and </font><font>also may be affected by regulation of rates charged to customers, service interruption due to environmental, operational or </font><font>other events, the imposition of special tariffs and changes in tax laws, regulatory policies and accounting standards.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Strategic Asset Risk. </font><font>Infrastructure companies may control significant strategic assets (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, major pipelines or highways), </font><font>which are assets that have a national or regional profile, and may have monopolistic
characteristics. Given their national or </font><font>regional profile or irreplaceable nature, strategic assets could generate additional risk not common in other industry sectors </font><font>and they may be targeted for terrorist acts or adverse political actions.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Interest Rate Risk. </font><font>Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for infrastructure
companies, which could </font><font>negatively impact their ability to meet payment obligations.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Leverage Risk. </font><font>Infrastructure companies can be highly leveraged, which
increases investments risk and other risks normally </font><font>associated with debt financing and could adversely affect an infrastructure company's operations and market value in </font><font>periods of rising interest rates.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Inflation Risk. </font><font>Many infrastructure companies may have fixed income streams. Consequently, their market
values may decline </font><font>in times of higher inflation. Additionally, the prices that an infrastructure company is able to charge users of its assets may be </font><font>linked to inflation, whether by government regulation, contractual arrangement or other factors. In this case, changes in the
</font><font>rate of inflation may affect the company's profitability.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Transportation Risk. </font><font>The stock prices of companies in the transportation industry group are affected by
both supply and </font><font>demand for their specific product. Government regulation, world events and economic conditions may affect the </font><font>performance of companies in the transportation industry group.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Oil and Gas Risk.</font><font> The profitability of oil and gas companies is related to worldwide energy prices,
exploration, and production </font><font>spending.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Utilities Risk. </font><font>Utilities companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which
may have an adverse </font><font>effect on their profit margins. The rates charged by regulated utility companies are subject to review and limitation by </font><font>governmental regulatory commissions.</font><font> </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the
Insurance Industry. </font><font> </font><font>The insurance industry is subject to extensive government
regulation in some </font><font>countries and can be significantly affected by changes in interest rates, general economic conditions, price and marketing </font><font>competition, the imposition of premium rate caps or other changes in government regulation or tax law. Different segments </font><font>of
the insurance industry can be significantly affected by changes in mortality and morbidity rates, environmental clean-up </font><font>costs and catastrophic events such as earthquakes,
hurricanes and terrorist acts.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Media
Sub-Industry. </font><font> </font><font>Companies in the media sub-industry may encounter distressed cash flows
</font><font>due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition, particularly in formulating new products and </font><font>services using new technology. Media companies are subject to risks that include cyclicality of revenues and earnings, a
</font><font>potential decrease in the discretionary income of targeted individuals, changing consumer tastes and interests, competition </font><font>in the industry and the potential for increased state and federal regulation. Advertising spending is an important source of
</font><font>revenue for media companies. During economic downturns, advertising spending typically decreases and, as a result, media </font><font>companies tend to generate less revenue.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Municipal Securities in the Utilities Sector. </font><font> </font><font>Certain municipal securities are issued by public bodies, </font><font>including state and municipal utility authorities, to, among other
things, finance the operation or expansion of utility entities. </font><font>Various future economic and other conditions may adversely affect utility entities, including inflation, increases
in financing </font><font>requirements, increases in raw material costs and other operating costs, changes in demand for services and the effects of </font><font>environmental and other governmental regulations. Municipal securities that are issued to finance a particular utility project
</font><font>often depend on revenues from that project to make principal and interest payments. Adverse conditions and developments </font><font>affecting a particular utility project can result in lower revenues to the issuer of the municipal securities. Certain utilities are </font><font>subject to specific risks. Gas utilities are subject to risks of supply conditions and increased competition from other providers </font><font>of utility services. In addition, gas utilities are affected by gas prices, which may be magnified to the extent that a gas utility </font><font>enters into long-term contracts for the purchase or sale of gas at a fixed price, since such prices may change significantly
</font><font>and to the disadvantage of the gas utility.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Oil and Gas Industry. </font><font> </font><font>Companies in the oil and gas industry are strongly affected by the levels and </font><font>volatility of global energy prices, oil and
gas supply and demand, government regulations and policies, oil and gas production </font><font>and conservation efforts and technological change. The oil and gas industry is cyclical and from
time to time may experience </font><font>a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or qualified personnel, or due to significant demand, such services may not be </font><font>available on commercially reasonable terms. Prices and supplies of oil and gas may fluctuate significantly over short and long
</font><font>periods of time due to national and international political changes, OPEC policies, changes in relationships among OPEC </font><font>members and between OPEC and oil-importing nations, the regulatory environment, taxation policies, the enactment or
</font><font>cessation of trade sanctions, war or other geopolitical conflicts, and the economies of key energy-consuming countries. </font><font>Disruptions in the oil sub-industry or shifts in energy consumption may significantly impact companies in this industry. For
</font><font>instance, significant oil and gas deposits are located in emerging market countries where corruption and security may raise </font><font>significant risks, in addition to the other risks of investing in emerging markets. In addition, the Middle East, where many
</font><font>companies in the oil and gas industry may operate, has recently experienced widespread social unrest. Oil and gas
</font><font>companies operate in a highly competitive industry, with intense price competition. A significant portion of their revenues </font><font>may depend on a relatively small number of customers, including governmental entities and utilities.</font><font>
</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In the context of the COVID-19 outbreak and disputes among oil-producing
countries regarding potential limits on the </font><font>production of crude oil, the energy sector has experienced increased volatility. In particular, significant market volatility in the
</font><font>crude oil markets as well as the oil futures markets resulted in the market price of the front month WTI crude oil futures </font><font>contracts falling below zero for a period of time. Russia's large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 has led to
</font><font>further disruptions and increased volatility in the energy and commodity futures markets due to actual and potential </font><font>disruptions in the supply and demand for certain commodities, including oil and natural gas. In March 2022, the United
</font><font>States announced that it would ban imports of oil, natural gas and coal from Russia. The effect of the U.S. ban and any similar </font><font>bans by other countries, as well as the extent and duration of the Russian military action, resulting sanctions and associated
</font><font>market disruptions on the energy sector, are impossible to predict and depend on a number of factors. The effect of these </font><font>events or any related developments could be significant and may have a severe adverse effect on the performance of a Fund.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Real Estate Industry. </font><font> </font><font>Companies in the real estate industry include companies that invest in real </font><font>estate, such as REITs, real estate holding and operating companies or real estate development companies (collectively,
</font><font>“</font><font>Real </font><font>Estate Companies</font><font>”</font><font>). Investing in Real Estate Companies exposes investors to the risks of owning real estate directly, as well </font><font>as to risks that relate specifically to the way in which Real Estate Companies are organized and operated. The real estate </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>industry is highly sensitive to general and local
economic conditions and developments, and characterized by intense </font><font>competition and periodic overbuilding. Investing in Real Estate Companies involves various risks. Some risks that
are specific </font><font>to Real Estate Companies are discussed in greater detail below.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>Concentration Risk.</font><font> Real Estate Companies may own a limited number of
properties and concentrate their investments in a </font><font>particular geographic region or property type. Economic downturns affecting a particular region, industry or property type </font><font>may lead to a high volume of defaults within a short period.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Distressed Investment Risk.</font><font> Real Estate Companies may invest in distressed, defaulted or out-of-favor bank
loans. </font><font>Identification and implementation by a Real Estate Company of loan modification and restructure programs involves a high </font><font>degree of uncertainty. Even successful implementation may still require adverse compromises and may not prevent </font><font>bankruptcy.
Real Estate Companies may also invest in other debt instruments that may become non-performing, including </font><font>the securities of companies with higher credit and market risk due to
financial or operational difficulties. Higher risk securities </font><font>may be less liquid and more volatile than the securities of companies not in distress.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Illiquidity Risk.</font><font> Investing in Real Estate Companies may involve risks similar to those associated with investing in small-capitalization</font><font>
companies. Real Estate Company securities, like the securities of small-capitalization companies, may be more </font><font>volatile than, and perform differently from, shares of
large-capitalization companies. There may be less trading in Real Estate </font><font>Company shares, which means that buy and sell transactions in those shares could have a magnified impact on
share price, </font><font>resulting in abrupt or erratic price fluctuations. In addition, real estate is relatively illiquid, and, therefore, a Real Estate </font><font>Company may have a limited ability to vary or liquidate properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Interest Rate Risk.</font><font> Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could </font><font>negatively impact a
Real Estate Company’s ability to meet its payment obligations. Declining interest rates could result in </font><font>increased prepayment on loans and require redeployment of capital in
less desirable investments.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Leverage Risk.</font><font> Real Estate Companies may use leverage (and some may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk </font><font>and could
adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s operations and market value in periods of rising interest rates. Real Estate </font><font>Companies are also exposed to the risks normally
associated with debt financing. Financial covenants related to a Real Estate </font><font>Company’s leverage may affect the ability of the Real Estate Company to operate effectively. In
addition, real property may be </font><font>subject to the quality of credit extended and defaults by borrowers and tenants. If the properties do not generate sufficient </font><font>income to meet operating expenses, including, where applicable, debt service, ground lease payments, tenant improvements,
</font><font>third-party leasing commissions and other capital expenditures, the income and ability of a Real Estate Company to make </font><font>payments of any interest and principal on its debt securities will be adversely affected.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Loan Foreclosure Risk.</font><font> Real Estate Companies may foreclose on loans
that the Real Estate Company originated and/or </font><font>acquired. Foreclosure may generate negative publicity for the underlying property that affects its market value. In addition to
</font><font>the length and expense of such proceedings, the validity of the terms of the applicable loan may not be recognized in </font><font>foreclosure proceedings. Claims and defenses asserted by borrowers or other lenders may interfere with the enforcement of
</font><font>rights by a Real Estate Company. Parallel proceedings, such as bankruptcy, may also delay resolution and limit the amount of </font><font>recovery on a foreclosed loan by a Real Estate Company even where the property underlying the loan is liquidated.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Management Risk.</font><font> Real Estate Companies are dependent upon management skills and may have limited financial resources. </font><font>Real Estate Companies
are generally not diversified and may be subject to heavy cash flow dependency, default by borrowers </font><font>and voluntary liquidation. In addition, transactions between Real Estate
Companies and their affiliates may be subject to </font><font>conflicts of interest, which may adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s shareholders. A Real Estate Company may also have
</font><font>joint venture investments in certain of its properties, and, consequently, its ability to control decisions relating to such </font><font>properties may be limited.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Property Risk.</font><font> Real Estate Companies may be subject to risks relating to functional obsolescence or
reduced desirability of </font><font>properties; extended vacancies due to economic conditions and tenant bankruptcies; catastrophic events such as </font><font>earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts; and casualty or condemnation losses. Real estate income and values also may be
</font><font>greatly affected by demographic trends, such as population shifts or changes in consumer preferences and values, or </font><font>increasing vacancies or declining rents resulting from legal, cultural, technological, global or local economic developments.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Regulatory Risk.</font><font> Real estate income and values may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable domestic and foreign </font><font>laws (including
tax laws). Government actions, such as tax increases, zoning law changes, mandated closures or other </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>
<div><font>111</font></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><a name="xx_a947e660-0edd-4807-973e-765f2e4dfa58_112"></a> <div> <div> </div>
<div> <div><font>commercial restrictions or environmental
regulations, also may have a major impact on real estate income and values. In </font><font>addition, quarterly compliance with regulations limiting the proportion of asset types held by a U.S.
REIT may force certain </font><font>Real Estate Companies to liquidate or restructure otherwise attractive investments. Some countries may not recognize REITs </font><font>or comparable structures as a viable form of real estate funds.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Underlying Investment Risk.</font><font> Real Estate Companies make investments in a variety of debt and equity
instruments with </font><font>varying risk profiles. For instance, Real Estate Companies may invest in debt instruments secured by commercial property </font><font>that have higher risks of delinquency and foreclosure than loans on single family homes due to a variety of factors associated
</font><font>with commercial property, including the tie between income available to service debt and productive use of the property. Real </font><font>Estate Companies may also invest in debt instruments and preferred equity that are junior in an issuer’s capital structure and </font><font>that involve privately negotiated structures. Subordinated debt investments, such as B-Notes and mezzanine loans, involve a
</font><font>greater credit risk of default due to the need to service more senior debt of the issuer. Similarly, preferred equity investments </font><font>involve a greater risk of loss than conventional debt financing due to their non-collateralized nature and subordinated
</font><font>ranking. Investments in CMBS may also be junior in priority in the event of bankruptcy or similar proceedings. Investments in </font><font>senior loans may be effectively subordinated if the senior loan is pledged as collateral. The ability of a holder of junior claims </font><font>to proceed against a defaulting issuer is circumscribed by the terms of the particular contractual arrangement, which vary
</font><font>considerably from transaction to transaction.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>U.S. Tax Risk.</font><font> Certain U.S. Real Estate Companies are subject to special U.S. federal tax requirements. A
REIT that fails to </font><font>comply with such tax requirements may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation, which may affect the value of the REIT </font><font>and the characterization of the REIT’s distributions. The U.S. federal tax requirement that a REIT distribute substantially all of </font><font>its net income to its shareholders may result in a REIT having insufficient capital for future expenditures. A REIT that
</font><font>successfully maintains its qualification may still become subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes, including excise, </font><font>penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage recording, and transfer taxes, both directly and indirectly through its subsidiaries.
</font><font>Because REITs often do not provide complete tax information until after the calendar year-end, a Fund may at times need to </font><font>request permission to extend the deadline for issuing your tax reporting statement or supplement the information otherwise
</font><font>provided to you.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Retail Industry. </font><font> </font><font>The retail industry may be affected by changes in domestic and international </font><font>economies, consumer confidence, disposable
household income and spending, and consumer tastes and preferences. </font><font>Companies in the retail industry face intense competition, which may have an adverse effect on their
profitability. The </font><font>success of companies in the retail industry may be strongly affected by social trends, marketing campaigns and public </font><font>perceptions. Companies in the retail industry may be dependent on outside financing, which may be difficult to obtain. Many
</font><font>of these companies are dependent on third party suppliers and distribution systems. Retail companies may be unable to </font><font>protect their intellectual property rights or may be liable for infringing the intellectual property rights of others.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Technology Sector. </font><font> </font><font>Technology companies are characterized by periodic new product introductions, </font><font>innovations and evolving industry standards, and, as a result, face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, </font><font>which may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Companies in the technology sector are often smaller and less
</font><font>experienced companies and may be subject to greater risks than larger companies; these risks may be heightened for </font><font>technology companies in foreign markets. Technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial </font><font>resources
or personnel. The products of technology companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological </font><font>developments and frequent new product introduction, changes in consumer
and business purchasing patterns, </font><font>unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. In addition, a rising interest </font><font>rate environment tends to negatively affect companies in the technology sector because, in such an environment, those
</font><font>companies with high market valuations may appear less attractive to investors, which may cause sharp decreases in the </font><font>companies’ market prices. Companies in the technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property
</font><font>rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Companies in the </font><font>technology sector are facing increased government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or
</font><font>regulatory action. The technology sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which </font><font>may be influenced or characterized by unpredictable factors. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network
</font><font>security breaches, certain companies in the technology sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of </font><font>proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</font><font> </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the
Telecommunications Sector. </font><font> </font><font>The telecommunications sector of a country’s economy
is often </font><font>subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with governmental regulations, delays or failure to </font><font>receive required regulatory approvals, or the enactment of new regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of
</font><font>telecommunications companies. Government actions around the world, specifically in the area of pre-marketing clearance of </font><font>products and prices, can be arbitrary and unpredictable. Companies in the telecommunications sector may experience
</font><font>distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition, particularly in </font><font>developing new products and services using new technology. Technological innovations may make the products and services </font><font>of
certain telecommunications companies obsolete. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network security </font><font>breaches, certain companies in the telecommunications sector may
be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of </font><font>proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their
businesses.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Transportation
Infrastructure Industry. </font><font> </font><font>Municipal securities include, among others, bonds payable
</font><font>from fuel taxes and tolls for municipal toll roads, as well as general airport bonds. Issuers in the transportation infrastructure </font><font>industry can be significantly affected by economic changes, fuel prices, labor relations, technology developments, exchange
</font><font>rates, industry competition, insurance costs and deteriorating public infrastructure, such as bridges, roads, rails, ports and </font><font>airports. Municipal securities that are issued to finance a particular transportation project often depend on revenues from
</font><font>that project to make principal and interest payments. Adverse conditions and developments affecting a particular project can </font><font>result in lower revenues to the issuer of the municipal securities. Other risk factors that may affect the transportation
</font><font>infrastructure industry include the risk of increases in fuel and other operating costs and the effects of regulatory changes or </font><font>other government decisions.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the Utilities Sector. </font><font> </font><font>The utilities sector may be adversely affected by changing commodity prices, </font><font>government regulation stipulating rates charged
by utilities, increased tariffs, changes in tax laws, interest rate fluctuations </font><font>and changes in the cost of providing specific utility services. The utilities industry is also
subject to potential terrorist attacks, </font><font>natural disasters and severe weather conditions, as well as regulatory and operational burdens associated with the operation </font><font>and maintenance of nuclear facilities. Government regulators monitor and control utility revenues and costs, and therefore
</font><font>may limit utility profits. In certain countries, regulatory authorities may also restrict a company’s access to new markets, </font><font>thereby diminishing the company’s long-term prospects.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>There are substantial differences among the regulatory practices and policies of various jurisdictions, and any regulatory
</font><font>agency may make major shifts in policy from time to time. There is no assurance that regulatory authorities will, in the future, </font><font>grant rate increases. Additionally, existing and possible future regulatory legislation may make it even more difficult for
</font><font>utilities to obtain adequate relief. Certain of the issuers of securities held in a Fund's portfolio may own or operate nuclear </font><font>generating facilities. Governmental authorities may from time to time review existing policies and impose additional
</font><font>requirements governing the licensing, construction and operation of nuclear power plants. Prolonged changes in climate </font><font>conditions can also have a significant impact on both the revenues of an electric and gas utility as well as the expenses of a
</font><font>utility, particularly a hydro-based electric utility.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The rates that traditional regulated utility companies may charge their customers generally are subject to review and
</font><font>limitation by governmental regulatory commissions. Rate changes may occur only after a prolonged approval period or may </font><font>not occur at all, which could adversely affect utility companies when costs are rising. The value of regulated utility debt
</font><font>securities (and, to a lesser extent, equity securities) tends to have an inverse relationship to the movement of interest rates. </font><font>Certain utility companies have experienced full or partial deregulation in recent years. These utility companies are frequently </font><font>more similar to industrial companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been permitted by regulators to
</font><font>diversify outside of their original geographic regions and their traditional lines of business. As a result, some companies may </font><font>be forced to defend their core business and may be less profitable. Deregulation may also permit a utility company to expand
</font><font>outside of its traditional lines of business and engage in riskier ventures.</font><font> </font></div>
</div> <div> <div><font>Proxy Voting Policy</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>For the Funds, the Board has delegated the voting of proxies for each Fund’s securities to BFA pursuant to the Funds' Proxy </font><font>Voting Policy (the </font><font>“</font><font>iShares ETFs</font><font> </font><font>Proxy Voting
Policy</font><font>”</font><font>), and BFA has adopted policies and procedures (the </font><font>“</font><font>BlackRock Proxy </font><font>Voting Policies</font><font>”</font><font>) governing proxy voting by accounts managed by BFA, including the Funds.</font><font> </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>Under the BlackRock Proxy Voting Policies, BFA
will vote proxies related to Fund securities in the best interests of a Fund and </font><font>its shareholders. From time to time, a vote may present a conflict between the interests of a
Fund’s shareholders, on the one </font><font>hand, and those of BFA, or any affiliated person of a Fund or BFA, on the other. BFA maintains policies and procedures that </font><font>are designed to prevent undue influence on BFA’s proxy voting activity that might stem from any relationship between the
</font><font>issuer of a proxy (or any dissident shareholder) and BFA, BFA’s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund’s affiliates. Most conflicts are </font><font>managed through a structural separation of BFA’s Corporate Governance Group from BFA’s employees with sales and client </font><font>responsibilities. In addition, BFA maintains procedures to ensure that all engagements with corporate issuers or dissident
</font><font>shareholders are managed consistently and without regard to BFA’s relationship with the issuer of the proxy or the dissident </font><font>shareholder. In certain instances, BFA may determine to engage an independent fiduciary to vote proxies as a further
</font><font>safeguard to avoid potential conflicts of interest or as otherwise required by applicable law.</font></div> <div>

Fixed-to-Float </font><font>bonds are eligible, provided that there is a minimum of 12 months until the transition date to the floating rate period.

<div> <div><font>Number of Components: approximately

bond market while retaining similar risk characteristics. Component securities include U.S. Treasury </font><font>bonds with at least seven years to final maturity; mortgage-backed pass-through
securities (MBS) and investment-grade and </font><font>high yield U.S. and non-U.S. corporate bonds, each with at least one year to final maturity; and commercial mortgage-backed </font><font>securities (CMBS) and asset-backed securities
(</font><font>“</font><font>ABS</font><font>”</font><font>) of any maturity. The Underlying Index includes bonds registered with </font><font>the SEC or exempt from registration at the time of
issuance or offered pursuant to Rule 144A with or without registration </font><font>rights.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Index Methodology. </font><font>The Underlying Index determines constituents and
their weights based on a proprietary factor model </font><font>that systematically applies (1) macroeconomic factor timing, (2) macroeconomic factor tilt, and (3) style factors. The first
</font><font>step of the factor model is macroeconomic factor timing, which considers high yield bond prices and the price momentum </font><font>of high yield securities to determine the status of the economy (as reflected in the bond market) at a given point in time (</font><font>i.e</font><font>., </font><font>whether default risk is low,
average and declining, average and increasing, or high). The status of the macroeconomic regime </font><font>at rebalance is used to determine several features of the Underlying Index
composition, including the duration and duration-times-spread</font><font> (</font><font>“</font><font>DxS,</font><font>”</font><font> which measures credit volatility) targets,
as well as determining high yield and MBS sector allocations. </font><font>The ABS and CMBS weights are then set in line with the weights in the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond
ETF.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The second step of the factor model is macroeconomic factor tilt,
which assigns the Underlying Index's allocation to </font><font>predetermined maturity bands of the yield curve, specifically (1) long-maturity U.S. Treasury bonds and (2) short- and </font><font>intermediate-maturity investment grade corporate bonds in seeking to maximize total return per unit of risk (defined as
</font><font>duration for U.S. Treasuries and DxS for corporate bonds). The Underlying Index constituents are the result of an asset </font><font>allocation optimization process that seeks maximum carry, the return generated from an investment in a higher yielding
</font><font>security over a lower yielding security, assuming prices remain constant, subject to the Underlying Index's duration and DxS </font><font>targets.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The last step of the model is to select securities based on style factor attributes: quality and value. The quality factor seeks to </font><font>reduce relative exposure to securities with the highest default risk, and the value factor seeks to increase the relative weight </font><font>of bonds with lower market prices compared to other bonds with similar fundamental characteristics. The Underlying Index </font><font>is
rebalanced monthly.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Component Selection Criteria.
</font><font>Eligible bonds are chosen by applying the eligibility rules and optimization methodology listed </font><font>above. There is

<div> <div><font>Index Description.</font><font> The Bloomberg MSCI US Aggregate ESG Focus Index, the Underlying Index, is designed to maximize </font><font>exposure to favorable
environmental, social and governance (</font><font>“</font><font>ESG</font><font>”</font><font>) practices while seeking to exhibit risk and return </font><font>characteristics similar to those of the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index, the parent index. The Underlying Index is
</font><font>constructed by selecting constituents from the parent index and applying an optimization process to certain constituents </font><font>using ESG rating inputs from MSCI ESG Research in an effort to maximize exposure to ESG factors for a target tracking error
</font><font>constraint of 10 basis points relative to the parent index. To construct the Underlying Index, the Fund’s index provider begins </font><font>with the parent index and replicates its U.S. Treasury bond, MBS, CMBS and ABS exposures. These exposures are preserved at
</font><font>the weights of the parent index and are not subject to the index provider’s optimization process, which is a quantitative </font><font>process that seeks to determine optimal weights for securities to maximize exposure to securities of entities with higher
</font><font>MSCI ESG Research ratings subject to seeking to maintain risk and return characteristics similar to the parent index. For the </font><font>remaining constituents of the parent index, the index provider excludes securities of entities without an MSCI ESG Research
</font><font>rating and:</font></div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>tobacco producers or companies with 15% or more of their revenue derived from tobacco
products;</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>

index provider also excludes securities of entities involved in very severe business controversies (as determined by MSCI </font><font>ESG Research), and then follows the index provider’s
optimization process. MSCI ESG Research identifies key ESG </font><font>controversies, including, among other things, issues involving: (i) the environment (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, biodiversity and land use, toxic
</font><font>emissions and waste, energy and climate change, water stress, non-hazardous operational waste, and supply chain
</font><font>management); (ii) human rights and communities (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, impact on local communities, human rights concerns, and civil </font><font>liberties); (iii) labor rights and supply chains (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, child labor, collective bargaining and union, health and safety, </font><font>discrimination and workforce diversity, and labor management relations); (iv) customers (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, anti-competitive practices, </font><font>customer relations, privacy and data security, product safety and quality, and marketing and
advertising); and (v) governance </font><font>(</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, bribery and fraud, governance structures, and controversial investments). MSCI ESG Research then rates each entity’s
</font><font>exposure to these ESG issues and evaluates the extent to which the entity has created strategies and programs to manage </font><font>ESG risks and opportunities. Entities are scored by MSCI ESG Research based on both their risk exposure and risk </font><font>management,
and then ranked in comparison to their industry peers. Using MSCI ESG Research’s ESG ratings, the index </font><font>provider then follows its optimization process.</font></div> </div>

<div><font>Number of Components: approximately 3,738</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Index Description.</font><font> The Bloomberg MSCI US Corporate ESG Focus Index, the Underlying Index, is designed to maximize </font><font>exposure to positive ESG
characteristics while seeking to exhibit risk and return characteristics similar to those of the </font><font>Bloomberg US Corporate Index, the parent index. The Underlying Index is constructed
by selecting constituents from the </font><font>parent index through an optimization process using ESG rating inputs from MSCI ESG Research in an effort to maximize </font><font>exposure to ESG factors for a target tracking error constraint of 10 basis points relative to the parent index. The Fund’s index </font><font>provider begins with the parent index, excludes companies without an MSCI ESG Research rating and:</font></div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>tobacco producers or companies with 15% or more of their revenue derived from tobacco
products;</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>civilian firearms producers or retailers that derive 5% or more of their revenue, or more than
$20 million in revenue, </font><font>from civilian firearms-related products;</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>cluster bomb, landmine, depleted uranium, or chemical/biological weapon systems or components
manufacturers; </font><font>and</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> </div>
</div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>any issuer with 5% or more revenue derived from thermal coal (power and heat) or oil
sands.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><font>The
index provider also excludes companies involved in very severe business controversies (as determined by MSCI ESG </font><font>Research), and then follows the index provider’s optimization
process. MSCI ESG Research identifies key ESG controversies, </font><font>including, among other things, issues involving: (i) the environment (</font><font>e.g., </font><font>biodiversity and land use, toxic emissions and </font></div> </div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>waste, energy and climate change, water stress,
non-hazardous operational waste, and supply chain management); (ii) </font><font>human rights and communities (</font><font>e.g.,</font><font> impact on local communities, human rights concerns, and civil liberties); (iii) labor </font><font>rights and supply chains (</font><font>e.g.,</font><font> child
labor, collective bargaining and union, health and safety, discrimination and workforce </font><font>diversity, and labor management relations); (iv) customers (</font><font>e.g.,</font><font> anti-competitive practices, customer relations, privacy and </font><font>data security, product safety and quality, and marketing and advertising); and (v) governance
(</font><font>e.g.,</font><font> bribery and fraud,
</font><font>governance structures, and controversial investments). MSCI ESG Research then rates each company’s exposure to these </font><font>ESG issues and evaluates the extent to which the company has created strategies and programs to manage ESG risks and
</font><font>opportunities. Companies are scored by MSCI ESG Research based on both their risk exposure and risk management, and </font><font>then ranked in comparison to their industry peers. Using MSCI ESG Research’s ESG ratings, the index provider then follows a </font><font>quantitative process in an effort to determine optimal weights for securities to maximize exposure to securities of companies
</font><font>with higher ESG ratings subject to seeking to maintain risk and return characteristics similar to those of the parent index.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>Index Methodology.</font><font> The Underlying Index consists of U.S. dollar-denominated, investment-grade corporate bonds issued by </font><font>companies that have
positive ESG characteristics (as determined by MSCI ESG Research ratings) and have remaining </font><font>maturities of greater than or equal to one year. In addition, the securities included
in the Underlying Index must be fixed-rate, </font><font>taxable corporate securities. Excluded from the Underlying Index include, but are not limited to, structured notes, private </font><font>placements and floating rate securities. The Underlying Index is market capitalization weighted and the securities in the

<div><font>Bloomberg U.S. Agency Bond Index</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Number of Components: approximately 447</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Index Description. </font><font>The Bloomberg U.S. Agency Bond Index measures the performance of the agency sector of the U.S. </font><font>government bond market and is
composed of investment-grade U.S. dollar-denominated publicly-issued government agency </font><font>bonds or debentures. The Underlying Index includes callable and non-callable securities
issued by U.S. government agencies, </font><font>quasi-federal corporations (as described under </font><font>Index
Methodology</font><font> below), and corporate or non-U.S. debt guaranteed by the </font><font>U.S. government. In addition, the
securities in the Underlying Index must be fixed-rate and non-convertible and have $300 </font><font>million or more of outstanding face value. As of February 28, 2023, approximately 100% of
the composite market value of the </font><font>bonds represented in the Underlying Index was in the form of U.S. agency debentures. The largest issues within the </font><font>Underlying Index were FHLB, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with a composite market value weight in the Underlying Index of
</font><font>approximately 33.67%, 23.52%, and 18.34%, respectively.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Index Methodology.</font><font> The Underlying Index measures the performance of both callable and non-callable U.S.
dollar-denominated</font><font> government agency debentures, including securities of the following categories:</font></div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>U.S. government guaranteed securities:</font><font> corporate and non-U.S. issuances that carry direct guarantees from the U.S. </font><font>government;</font></div> </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>U.S. government owned, not guaranteed, securities:</font><font> issuances of quasi-federal corporations (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, entities that are partially </font><font>or wholly-owned by the U.S. government); such issuances generally carry no explicit guarantee
of repayment from the </font><font>U.S. government; and</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>U.S. government sponsored securities:</font><font> issuances of U.S. government sponsored entities (including Fannie Mae and </font><font>Freddie Mac), which are not 100% government
owned, but carry out government policies and benefit from implied </font><font>involvement of central governments, such as by benefiting from certain government subsidies, credit provisions, or
other </font><font>government support; such issuances generally have no guarantees from the U.S. government.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The Underlying Index is market value weighted and the securities in the Underlying Index are
updated on the last business </font><font>day of each month.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Underlying Index represents the U.S. Agency portion of the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, whose eligible </font><font>universe
is defined by total market issuance, meeting the selection criteria mentioned above.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Index Maintenance. </font><font>The Underlying Index constituents are reset on the last business day of each month and
remain static </font><font>throughout the month. The universe of Underlying Index constituents adjust for securities that become ineligible for </font><font>inclusion in an Underlying Index during the month (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, because of downgrades or called bonds) or for issues that are newly </font><font>eligible (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, up-grades or newly issued bonds) on the last business day of each month. The Bloomberg Indexes are
valued </font><font>using end of day bid side prices, as marked by Bloomberg. Intra-month cash flows contribute to monthly returns, but they </font><font>are not reinvested during the month and do not earn a reinvestment return.

bond </font><font>market, which includes investment-grade (must be Baa3/BBB- or higher using the middle rating of Moody’s, S&amp;P Global </font><font>Ratings, and Fitch) U.S. Treasury bonds, government-related bonds, investment-grade corporate bonds, MBS, CMBS and ABS </font><font>that
are publicly offered for sale in the U.S. The securities in the Underlying Index must have $300 million or more of </font><font>outstanding face value and must have at least one year remaining
to maturity, with the exception of amortizing securities </font><font>such as ABS and MBS, which have lower minimum thresholds as defined by the index provider. In addition, the securities
</font><font>must be denominated in U.S. dollars and must be fixed-rate, non-convertible, and taxable. Certain types of securities, such as </font><font>SLGs, are excluded from the Underlying Index. Also excluded from the Underlying Index are structured notes with embedded
</font><font>swaps or other special features, private placements, floating rate securities and Eurobonds. The Underlying Index is market </font><font>capitalization weighted and the securities in the Underlying Index are updated on the last business day of each month. As of
</font><font>February 28, 2023, approximately 27.4% of the bonds represented in the Underlying Index were U.S. fixed-rate agency MBS. </font><font>U.S. fixed-rate agency MBS are securities issued by entities such as Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae that are backed
</font><font>by pools of mortgages. Most transactions in fixed-rate MBS occur through standardized contracts for future delivery in which </font><font>the exact mortgage pools to be delivered are not specified until a few days prior to settlement (TBA transactions). The Fund
</font><font>may enter into such contracts on a regular basis. The Fund, pending settlement of such contracts, will invest its assets in </font><font>high-quality, liquid short-term instruments, including shares of BlackRock Cash Funds. The Fund will assume its pro rata
</font><font>share of the fees and expenses of any money market fund that it may invest in, in addition to the Fund's own fees and </font><font>expenses. The Fund may also acquire interests in mortgage pools through means other than such standardized contracts for

<div> <div><font>Index Methodology.</font><font> The Underlying Index measures the performance of U.S. dollar-denominated taxable bonds that are </font><font>rated either
investment-grade or high yield and are from issuers generally evaluated for favorable ESG practices (as </font><font>determined by MSCI ESG Research) while exhibiting risk and return
characteristics similar to those of the parent index, which </font><font>includes securities with at least one year until final maturity, without regard to optionality features such as call
provisions or </font><font>conversion provisions. The Underlying Index includes U.S. Treasury bonds, government-related bonds (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, U.S. and non-U.S. </font><font>agencies,
sovereign, quasi-sovereign, supranational and local authority debt), investment-grade and high yield (as well as </font><font>unrated) corporate bonds, mortgage-backed pass-through securities,
CMBS, ABS, Eurodollar bonds, bonds registered with </font><font>the SEC or exempt from registration at the time of issuance or offered pursuant to Rule 144A with or without registration </font><font>rights and U.S. dollar-denominated emerging market bonds.

</div> </div> <div> <div><font>Index constituents are market capitalization weighted, subject to the following
capping mechanism and constraints:</font></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>For each of the
ICE AMT-Free US National Municipal Index and ICE Short Maturity AMT-Free US National Municipal </font><font>Index, individual issuers are capped at 10% of the index, with any excess
redistributed across the uncapped issuers of </font><font>the index on a pro rata basis. For each of the ICE AMT-Free California Municipal Index and ICE AMT-Free New York Plus </font><font>Municipal Index, individual issuers are capped at 25% of the index, with any excess redistributed across the uncapped
</font><font>issuers of the index on a pro rata basis.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>After applying the caps in step 1, the index is segmented into a large cap group, consisting of
issuers with index weights </font><font>greater than or equal to 5%, and a small cap group consisting of issuers with less than 5% weight in the index.</font></div> </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Issuer weights in
the small cap group are capped at 4.85%, with any excess redistributed across the remaining </font><font>uncapped issuers’ securities in the small cap group on a pro rata
basis.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>For each of the ICE
AMT-Free US National Municipal Index and ICE Short Maturity AMT-Free US National Municipal </font><font>Index, if the combined weight of the large cap group is greater than 25% of the index,
the weight of the group is </font><font>reduced to 25%, with the weights of all issuers in the group reduced on a pro rata basis, provided no issuer is reduced </font><font>below 5%. For each of the ICE AMT-Free California Municipal Index and ICE AMT-Free New York Plus Municipal Index, if </font><font>the
combined weight of the large cap group is greater than 50% of the index, the weight of the group is reduced to 50%, </font><font>with the weights of all issuers in the group reduced on a pro
rata basis, provided no issuer is reduced below 5%.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Any excess weight resulting from the reduction of the large cap group weight in step 4 is redistributed across all issuers
</font><font>in the small cap group on a pro-rata basis, provided no issuer exceeds 4.85%.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>If all small cap issuers reach the 4.85% cap, any remaining excess weight is redistributed
across all index issuers on a pro </font><font>rata basis.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <div><font>For purposes of applying the above
caps, issuers are defined as issuing entities except for conduit debt, in which case the </font><font>underlying issuer is used. In addition, an issuing entity’s general obligation debt
is considered to be issued by a separate, </font><font>distinct issuer from revenue bonds issued by the same entity. Pre-refunded securities are not included in issuer weights and </font><font>are not subject to any issuer caps, nor do they receive redistributions of any excess weights.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Accrued interest is calculated assuming next-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments, including interest coupons </font><font>and principal repayments of maturing or called bonds that are received during the month, are retained in the index until the
</font><font>end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is </font><font>held in the index. Information concerning constituent bond prices, timing and conventions and index governance and
</font><font>administration is provided in the ICE Bond Index Methodologies, which can be accessed on ICE’s public website </font><font>(https://indices.theice.com), or by sending a request to iceindices@theice.com.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Each index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on information available up to and including the third </font><font>business day before the last business day of the month. New issues must settle on or before the following calendar month </font><font>end
rebalancing date in order to qualify for the coming month (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, an issue must settle on or
before November 30 in order </font><font>to be included in the index on October 31). No changes are made to constituent holdings other than on month end </font><font>rebalancing dates.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>ICE AMT-Free California Municipal Index</font><font> </font></div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Index Methodology.</font><font> To construct the Underlying Index, Markit begins with the parent index and then applies a series of </font><font>climate-based and
values-based screens.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The parent index is designed to reflect the performance of U.S. dollar-denominated investment grade corporate bonds that:
</font><font>(i) are issued by companies domiciled in countries classified as developed markets by Markit; (ii) have an average rating of </font><font>investment grade (ratings from Fitch, Moody’s, or S&amp;P Global Ratings are considered; if more than one agency provides a </font><font>rating, the average rating is attached to the bond); (iii) have at least $750 million of outstanding face value for the specific </font><font>bond issue; (iv) are from issuers with at least $2 billion outstanding face value of all of the issuer's bonds eligible for inclusion </font><font>in the parent index; and (v) have at least three years to maturity at rebalance (three years and six months to maturity for new </font><font>index insertions). As of February 28, 2023, the Index Provider classifies the following countries as developed markets:
</font><font>Andorra, Australia, Austria, the Bahamas, Belgium, Bermuda, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Cayman Islands, Cyprus, Denmark, </font><font>Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Macao, Malta,
</font><font>the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, San Marino, Singapore, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the U.K. and </font><font>the U.S.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The
climate-based screens remove issuers with an industry tie to fossil fuels (</font><font>e.g</font><font>., thermal
coal, oil, and gas) including reserve </font><font>ownership, related revenues and power generation (as determined by MSCI ESG Research); issuers classified by IHS Markit in </font><font>the Oil and Gas Market Sector; and issuers with MSCI Environmental controversies scores below two (2). The values-based
</font><font>screens remove a variety of controversial business activities (as determined by MSCI ESG Research) including adult </font><font>entertainment, alcohol, civilian firearms, controversial weapons, conventional weapons, for profit prisons, gambling,
</font><font>genetically modified organisms, nuclear power, nuclear weapons, palm oil, predatory lending, and tobacco based on revenue </font><font>or percentage of revenue thresholds for certain categories (</font><font>e.g</font><font>. $500 million or 50%) and categorical exclusions for others </font><font>(</font><font>e.g.</font><font> nuclear weapons). The values-based screens also remove issuers violating the United Nations Global
Compact. </font><font>Additionally, the index removes issuers with a MSCI ESG ratings below BBB and issuers with a MSCI ESG controversies score </font><font>of less than one (1).</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>To determine if companies are involved in ESG controversies, MSCI assesses the possible negative environmental, social,
</font><font>and/or governance impact of a company’s operations or products on a scale from zero to ten, with zero being the most </font><font>severe controversy rating. To determine if companies are involved in environmental controversies, MSCI assesses the possible
</font><font>impact of a company’s operations or products in environmental issues such as energy and climate change, land use and </font><font>biodiversity, toxic emissions and waste, water stress and operational waste. The impact is rated on a scale from zero to ten,
</font><font>with zero being the most severe controversy rating. To determine ESG ratings, MSCI rates the ESG characteristics of securities </font><font>on a scale of </font><font>“</font><font>CCC</font><font>”</font><font> (lowest) to </font><font>“</font><font>AAA</font><font>”</font><font> (highest). MSCI evaluates a company’s
risks and opportunities using a sector-specific </font><font>ESG Key Issues (</font><font>“</font><font>Key Issues</font><font>”</font><font>) (</font><font>e.g</font><font>., carbon emissions) selection and weighting model. Each company is scored on a scale of </font><font>0 to 10, with 10 being the highest, for each Key Issue before being provided an ESG rating based on average Key Issue score.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>After applying the criteria mentioned above, the remaining securities are weighted based on market capitalization, with an </font><font>issuer cap of 3% of the Underlying Index. The securities in the Underlying Index are updated on the last business day of each
</font><font>month.</font></div> </div> <div>

bonds from large issuers with at least $1 billion in aggregate outstanding </font><font>issuance and $500 million face value per bond are included in the Underlying Index. The Underlying Index
uses a modified </font><font>market-value weighted methodology with a cap on each issuer of 3%.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>Index Methodology.</font><font> Bonds in the Underlying Index are selected from the
universe of eligible bonds using defined rules. </font><font>Currently, the bonds eligible for inclusion in the Underlying Index include fixed rate U.S. dollar-denominated corporate bonds
</font><font>that: (i) are issued by issuers domiciled in the countries classified as developed markets by the index provider; (ii) are rated </font><font>BBB, or equivalently, by Fitch, Moody’s, or S&amp;P Global Ratings; (iii) are from issuers with at least $1 billion aggregate </font><font>outstanding face value; (iv) have at least $500 million of outstanding face value; (v) have a time to maturity of at least one
</font><font>year at issuance; and (vi) have at least six months to maturity for new index insertions. However, existing bonds in the index </font><font>are held to maturity.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Component Selection Criteria.</font><font> Eligible bonds are chosen by applying the eligibility rules listed above. The
Underlying Index is </font><font>a modified market-value weighted index with a cap on each issuer at 3%. There is no maximum number of bond issues per </font><font>issuer eligible, but to avoid an over-concentration in any single-issuer, the methodology caps single-issuer exposure to no
</font><font>more than 3% of the index weight. The Underlying Index is updated monthly on the last business day of each month.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The composition of the Underlying Index is held constant for any given calendar month to ensure continuity during the </font><font>month and to avoid jumps unrelated to the price movements of the bonds. The inclusion and exclusion criteria above are
</font><font>applied at month-end. Bonds that were in the Underlying Index, but that no longer satisfy all the criteria at month-end, will </font><font>be removed from the Underlying Index. A bond that drops out of the Underlying Index at the rebalancing day is excluded </font><font>from
reentering the index for a three-month period. The rule for the lockout period takes precedence over the other rules for </font><font>the Underlying Index selection. A locked out bond will not
be selected, even if it qualifies for the index. If a bond becomes </font><font>eligible in the middle of the month, it will still need to satisfy the criteria at the end of the month, and can
be included only </font><font>upon rebalancing at month-end. Any bond that enters the Underlying Index must remain in the Underlying Index for a </font><font>minimum of six months provided it is not downgraded to sub-investment grade, defaulted or fully redeemed in that period.
</font><font>Existing bonds in the Underlying Index that receive a rating upgrade can remain in the index if the six-month minimum has </font><font>not been satisfied. When a bond is called, it remains in the Underlying Index at its call price until the end of the month, after </font><font>which it is removed. Changes in issue size that take place during the month are taken into consideration only at the next
</font><font>rebalancing date.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Markit iBoxx</font><font>®</font><font> USD Liquid High Yield Index</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Number of Components: approximately 1,175</font></div> </div> <div>

7,573 investment-grade bonds. Bonds in the Underlying Index are selected from the universe of </font><font>eligible bonds in the Markit iBoxx USD Corporate Bond Index using defined rules.
Currently, the bonds eligible for inclusion in </font><font>the Underlying Index consist of U.S. dollar-denominated corporate bonds that: (i) are issued by companies domiciled in the </font><font>countries classified as developed markets by the index provider; (ii) have an average rating of investment grade (ratings from

Underlying Index is </font><font>a modified market value weighted index with a cap on each issuer at 3%. The number of bonds in the Underlying Index may </font><font>change and there is no constraint on the number of index constituents. There is no maximum number of bond issues per </font><font>issuer
eligible, but to avoid an over-concentration in any single-issuer, the methodology caps single-issuer exposure to no </font><font>more than 3% of the index weight, calculated on the last

<div> <div><font>The composition of the Underlying Index is held constant for any given calendar month to

</font><font>change without shareholder approval.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to concentration set forth in (1) above, the Investment Company Act does </font><font>not
define what constitutes
</font><font>“</font><font>concentration</font><font>”</font><font> in an industry. The SEC staff has taken the position that investment of 25% or </font><font>more of a fund’s total assets in one
or more issuers conducting their principal activities in the same industry or group of </font><font>industries constitutes concentration. It is possible that interpretations of concentration
could change in the future. The policy </font><font>in (1) above will be interpreted to refer to concentration as that term may be interpreted from time to time. The policy also </font><font>will be interpreted to permit investment without limit in the following: securities of the U.S. government and its agencies or
</font><font>instrumentalities; securities of state, territory, possession or municipal governments and their authorities, agencies, </font><font>instrumentalities or political subdivisions; and repurchase agreements collateralized by any such obligations. Accordingly,
</font><font>issuers of the foregoing securities will not be considered to be members of any industry. There also will be no limit on </font><font>investment in issuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or country. Finance companies will be considered to be in the
</font><font>industries of their parents if their activities are primarily related to financing the activities of the parents. Each foreign </font><font>government will be considered to be a member of a separate industry. With respect to each Fund's industry classifications,
</font><font>each Fund currently utilizes any one or more of the industry sub-classifications used by one or more widely recognized </font><font>market indexes or rating group indexes, and/or as defined by Fund management. The policy also will be interpreted to give
</font><font>broad authority to each Fund as to how to classify issuers within or among industries.</font><font>
</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to borrowing money set
forth in (2) above, the Investment Company Act </font><font>permits each Fund to borrow money in amounts of up to one-third of the Fund's total assets from banks for any purpose, </font><font>and to borrow up to 5% of the Fund's total assets from banks or other lenders for temporary purposes. (The Fund's total
</font><font>assets include the amounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks attendant to borrowing, the Investment Company Act requires </font><font>each Fund to maintain at all times an </font><font>“</font><font>asset
coverage</font><font>”</font><font> of at least 300% of the amount of its borrowings. Asset coverage </font><font>means the ratio that the value of each Fund’s total assets (including amounts borrowed), minus liabilities other than
</font><font>borrowings, bears to the aggregate amount of all borrowings. Borrowing money to increase portfolio holdings is known as </font><font>“</font><font>leveraging.</font><font>”</font><font> Certain trading practices and investments, such as reverse repurchase agreements, may be considered to be </font><font>borrowings or
involve leverage and thus are subject to the Investment Company Act restrictions. In accordance with Rule 18f-4</font><font> under the Investment Company Act, when each Fund engages in reverse
repurchase agreements and similar financing </font><font>transactions, the Fund may either (i) maintain asset coverage of at least 300% with respect to such transactions and any </font><font>other borrowings in the aggregate, or (ii) treat such transactions as </font><font>“</font><font>derivatives transactions</font><font>”</font><font> and comply with Rule
18f-4 </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>137</font></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>with respect to such transactions. Short-term
credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and </font><font>arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered to be borrowings under the policy.
Practices and </font><font>investments that may involve leverage but are not considered to be borrowings are not subject to the policy.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to underwriting set forth in (5) above, the
Investment Company Act does not </font><font>prohibit a fund from engaging in the underwriting business or from underwriting the securities of other issuers; in fact, in the </font><font>case of diversified funds, the Investment Company Act permits a fund to have underwriting commitments of up to 25% of its
</font><font>assets under certain circumstances. Those circumstances currently are that the amount of a fund’s underwriting </font><font>commitments, when added to the value of a fund’s investments in issuers where a fund owns more than 10% of the
</font><font>outstanding voting securities of those issuers, cannot exceed the 25% cap. A fund engaging in transactions involving the </font><font>acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act. Although it is
</font><font>not believed that the application of the 1933 Act provisions described above would cause a fund to be engaged in the </font><font>business of underwriting, the policy in (5) above will be interpreted not to prevent a fund from engaging in transactions
</font><font>involving the acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities, regardless of whether a fund may be considered to be an </font><font>underwriter under the 1933 Act or is otherwise engaged in the underwriting business to the extent permitted by applicable
</font><font>law.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to lending set forth in (7) above, the Investment Company Act does not </font><font>prohibit each Fund from making loans (including lending its securities); however, SEC staff interpretations currently prohibit
</font><font>funds from lending more than one-third of their total assets (including lending its securities), except through the purchase of </font><font>debt obligations or the use of repurchase agreements. In addition, collateral arrangements with respect to options, forward
</font><font>currency and futures transactions and other derivative instruments (as applicable), as well as delays in the settlement of </font><font>securities transactions, will not be considered loans.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Non-Fundamental Investment Policies</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF, iShares 25+ Year Treasury STRIPS Bond ETF, iShares BBB Rated Corporate </font><font>Bond ETF, iShares Core 5-10 Year USD Bond ETF, iShares ESG Advanced Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares </font><font>ESG Advanced Total USD Bond Market ETF, iShares ESG Aware 1-5 Year USD Corporate Bond ETF, iShares ESG Aware U.S. </font><font>Aggregate Bond ETF, iShares ESG Aware USD Corporate Bond ETF, iShares High Yield Systematic Bond ETF, iShares </font><font>Investment Grade Systematic Bond ETF</font><font> and</font><font> iShares USD Systematic Bond ETF.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy not to make short sales of securities or maintain a short position, except to

ETF and iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF have adopted an additional non-fundamental policy under which the </font><font>iShares Core 10+ Year USD Bond ETF and iShares Core U.S. Aggregate
Bond ETF, under normal circumstances, will invest, at </font><font>least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in securities of U.S. issuers. The

the component securities in the Fund’s Underlying </font><font>Index. The iShares ESG Advanced Total USD Bond Market ETF has adopted a non-fundamental investment policy in </font><font>accordance with Rule 35d-1 under the Investment Company Act to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the </font><font>value
of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in component securities in the Fund’s </font><font>Underlying Index and in TBA transactions with respect to
the percentage of the Underlying Index that consists of mortgage </font><font>pass-through securities. The iShares High Yield Systematic Bond ETF, iShares Investment Grade Systematic Bond ETF
and </font><font>iShares USD Systematic Bond ETF have adopted a non-fundamental investment policy in accordance with Rule 35d-1 under </font><font>the Investment Company Act to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the value of its net assets, plus the
</font><font>amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in securities in its Underlying Index and in TBA transactions with respect </font><font>to the percentage of its Underlying Index (if any) that consists of mortgage pass-through securities. Each Fund also has
</font><font>adopted a policy to provide its shareholders with at least 60 days’ prior written notice of any change in such policy. If, </font><font>subsequent to an investment, an 80% requirement is no longer met, a Fund’s future investments will be made in a manner
</font><font>that will bring the Fund into compliance with this policy.</font><font> </font></div>
<div> <div><font>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy not to purchase securities of other investment
companies, except to the </font><font>extent permitted by the 1940 Act. As a matter of policy, however, a Fund will not purchase shares of any registered open-end </font><font>investment company or registered unit investment trust, in reliance on Section 12(d)(1)(F) or (G) (the </font><font>“</font><font>fund of funds</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>provisions) of the 1940 Act, at any time the Fund has knowledge that its shares are purchased by another investment </font><font>company

at the time that a transaction is undertaken. Any change in the percentage of each Fund's assets invested in certain </font><font>securities or other instruments resulting from market
fluctuations or other changes in each Fund’s total assets will not </font><font>require each Fund to dispose of an investment until BFA determines that it is practicable to sell or close
out the investment </font><font>without undue market or tax consequences.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Continuous Offering</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The method by which Creation Units are created and traded may raise certain issues under applicable securities laws. </font><font>Because new Creation Units are issued and sold by the Funds on an ongoing basis, at any point a </font><font>“</font><font>distribution,</font><font>”</font><font> as such term </font><font>is used in the 1933 Act, may occur. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may,
</font><font>depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render </font><font>them statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus delivery requirement and liability provisions of the 1933 Act.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>For example, a broker-dealer firm or its client
may be deemed a statutory underwriter if it takes Creation Units after placing </font><font>an order with the Distributor, breaks them down into constituent shares and sells such shares
directly to customers or if it </font><font>chooses to couple the creation of new shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand </font><font>for shares. A determination of whether one is an underwriter for purposes of the 1933 Act must take into account all of the
</font><font>facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the broker-dealer or its client in the particular case and the examples </font><font>mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that could lead to a categorization as
</font><font>an underwriter.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Broker-dealer firms should also note that dealers who are not </font><font>“</font><font>underwriters</font><font>”</font><font> but are effecting transactions in
shares, </font><font>whether or not participating in the distribution of shares, generally are required to deliver a prospectus. This is because the </font><font>prospectus delivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act is not available in respect of such transactions as a result of </font><font>Section 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that incur a prospectus delivery obligation with respect to shares of the Funds are
</font><font>reminded that, pursuant to Rule 153 under the 1933 Act, a prospectus delivery obligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the 1933 </font><font>Act owed to an exchange member in connection with a sale on the Listing Exchange generally is satisfied by the fact that the
</font><font>prospectus is available at the Listing Exchange upon request. The prospectus delivery mechanism provided in Rule 153 is </font><font>available only with respect to transactions on an exchange.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Management</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Trustees and Officers. </font><font> </font><font>The Board has responsibility for the overall management and operations of the Funds, including </font><font>general supervision of the
duties performed by BFA and other service providers. Each Trustee serves until he or she resigns, is </font><font>removed, dies, retires or becomes incapacitated. Each officer shall hold office
until his or her successor is elected and </font><font>qualifies or until his or her death, resignation or removal. Trustees who are not </font><font>“</font><font>interested persons</font><font>”</font><font> (as defined in the 1940 </font><font>Act) of the Trust are referred to as independent trustees (</font><font>“</font><font>Independent Trustees</font><font>”</font><font>).</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The registered investment companies advised by BFA or its affiliates (the </font><font>“</font><font>BlackRock-advised Funds</font><font>”</font><font>) are organized into one
</font><font>complex of open-end equity, multi-asset, index and money market funds and ETFs (the </font><font>“</font><font>BlackRock Multi-Asset Complex</font><font>”</font><font>), </font><font>one complex of closed-end funds and open-end non-index fixed-income funds (including ETFs) (the </font><font>“</font><font>BlackRock Fixed-Income</font><font> Complex</font><font>”</font><font>) and one complex of ETFs (</font><font>“</font><font>Exchange-Traded Fund
Complex</font><font>”</font><font>) (each, a </font><font>“</font><font>BlackRock Fund Complex</font><font>”</font><font>). Each </font><font>Fund is included in the Exchange-Traded Fund Complex. Each Trustee also serves as a Director of iShares, Inc. and a Trustee
</font><font>of iShares U.S. ETF Trust and, as a result, oversees all of the funds within the Exchange-Traded Fund Complex, which consists </font><font>of 387 funds as of June 30, 2023. With the exception of Stephen Cohen, Robert S. Kapito and Aaron Wasserman, the address </font><font>of
each Trustee and officer is c/o BlackRock, Inc., 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. The address of Mr. Kapito and </font><font>Mr. Wasserman is c/o BlackRock, Inc., 50 Hudson Yards,
New York, NY 10001. The address of Mr. Cohen is c/o BlackRock, </font><font>Inc., Drapers Gardens, 12 Throgmorton Avenue, London EC2N 2DL United Kingdom. The Board has designated John E.

<div> <div><font>Board – Leadership Structure and Oversight
Responsibilities</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Overall responsibility for oversight of the Funds rests
with the Board. The Board has engaged BFA to manage the Funds on a </font><font>day-to-day basis. The Board is responsible for overseeing BFA and other service providers in the operations of
the Funds in </font><font>accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, applicable provisions of state and other laws and the Trust’s charter. The </font><font>Board is currently composed of nine members, seven of whom are Independent Trustees. The Board currently conducts </font><font>regular in
person meetings four times a year. In addition, the Board frequently holds special in person or telephonic meetings </font><font>or informal conference calls to discuss specific matters that
may arise or require action between regular meetings. The </font><font>Independent Trustees meet regularly outside the presence of management, in executive session or with other service </font><font>providers to the Trust.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Board has appointed an Independent Trustee to serve in the role of Board Chair. The Board Chair’s role is to preside at all </font><font>meetings of the Board and to act as a liaison with service providers, officers, attorneys, and other Trustees generally between </font><font>meetings. The Board Chair may also perform such other functions as may be delegated by the Board from time to time. The
</font><font>Board has established seven standing Committees: a Nominating and Governance Committee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c) </font><font>Committee, a Securities Lending Committee, a Risk Committee, an Equity Plus Committee and a Fixed Income Plus </font><font>Committee to
assist the Board in the oversight and direction of the business and affairs of the Funds, and from time to time </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>
<div> <div><font>146</font></div>
</div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div>

<div> <div><font>the Board may establish ad hoc committees or
informal working groups to review and address the policies and practices of </font><font>the Funds with respect to certain specified matters. The Chair of each standing Committee is an
Independent Trustee. The </font><font>role of the Chair of each Committee is to preside at all meetings of the Committee and to act as a liaison with service </font><font>providers, officers, attorneys and other Trustees between meetings. Each standing Committee meets regularly to conduct the
</font><font>oversight functions delegated to the Committee by the Board and reports its finding to the Board. The Board and each </font><font>standing Committee conduct annual assessments of their oversight function and structure. The Board has determined that </font><font>the
Board’s leadership structure is appropriate because it allows the Board to exercise independent judgment over </font><font>management and it allocates areas of responsibility among
committees of Independent Trustees and the full Board to </font><font>enhance effective oversight.</font><font>
</font></div> <div> <div><font>Day-to-day risk management with respect to the Funds is the responsibility of
BFA or other service providers (depending on </font><font>the nature of the risk), subject to the supervision of BFA. Each Fund is subject to a number of risks, including investment, </font><font>compliance, operational, reputational, counterparty and valuation risks, among others. While there are a number of risk
</font><font>management functions performed by BFA and other service providers, as applicable, it is not possible to identify and </font><font>eliminate all of the risks applicable to the Funds. The Trustees have an oversight role in this area, satisfying themselves that </font><font>risk management processes and controls are in place and operating effectively. Risk oversight forms part of the Board’s
</font><font>general oversight of each Fund and is addressed as part of various Board and committee activities. In some cases, risk </font><font>management issues are specifically addressed in presentations and discussions. For example, BFA has an independent </font><font>dedicated
Risk and Quantitative Analysis Group (</font><font>“</font><font>RQA</font><font>”</font><font>) that assists BFA in managing fiduciary and corporate risks, including </font><font>investment, operational, counterparty credit and enterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet with the Board to discuss their
</font><font>analysis and methodologies, as well as specific risk topics such as operational and counterparty risks relating to the Funds. </font><font>The Board, directly or through a committee, also reviews reports from, among others, management and the independent
</font><font>registered public accounting firm for the Trust, as appropriate, regarding risks faced by each Fund and management’s risk </font><font>functions. The Board has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer who oversees the implementation and testing of the Trust's
</font><font>compliance program, including assessments by independent third parties, and reports to the Board regarding compliance </font><font>matters for the Trust and its principal service providers. In testing and maintaining the compliance program, the Chief
</font><font>Compliance Officer (and his or her delegates) assesses key compliance risks affecting each Fund, and addresses them in </font><font>periodic reports to the Board. In addition, the Audit Committee meets with both the Funds' independent registered public
</font><font>accounting firm and BFA’s internal audit group to review risk controls in place that support each Fund as well as test results. </font><font>Board oversight of risk is also performed as needed between meetings through communications between BFA and the Board. </font><font>The
Independent Trustees have engaged independent legal counsel to assist them in performing their oversight </font><font>responsibilities. From time to time, the Board may modify the manner in
which it conducts risk oversight. The Board’s </font><font>oversight role does not make it a guarantor of the Funds' investment performance or other activities.</font></div> </div>

<div> <div><font>BlackRock is one of the world's largest asset
management firms. BlackRock, its subsidiaries and their respective directors, </font><font>officers and employees, including the business units or entities and personnel who may be involved in
the investment </font><font>activities and business operations of a Fund, are engaged worldwide in businesses, including managing equities, fixed-income</font><font> securities, cash and alternative investments, and have interests other than that of managing the Funds. These are
</font><font>considerations of which investors in a Fund should be aware, and which may cause conflicts of interest that could
</font><font>disadvantage a Fund and its shareholders. These businesses and interests include potential multiple advisory, financial and </font><font>other relationships with, or interests in, companies and interests in securities or other instruments that may be purchased or
</font><font>sold by a Fund.</font></div> <div> <div><font>BlackRock has proprietary interests in, and may manage or advise with respect to, accounts or funds (including separate
</font><font>accounts and other funds and collective investment vehicles) that have investment objectives similar to those of a Fund </font><font>and/or that engage in transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and instruments as the Funds. BlackRock is
</font><font>also a major participant in the global currency, equities, swap and fixed income markets, in each case, for the accounts of </font><font>clients and, in some cases, on a proprietary basis. As such, BlackRock is or may be actively engaged in transactions in the
</font><font>same securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests. Such activities could affect the prices and availability of </font><font>the securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests, which could have an adverse impact on a Fund's
</font><font>performance. Such transactions, particularly in respect of most proprietary accounts or client accounts, will be executed </font><font>independently of a Fund's transactions and thus at prices or rates that may be more or less favorable than those obtained by
</font><font>the Funds.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>When BlackRock seeks to purchase or sell the same assets for managed accounts, including a Fund, the assets actually
</font><font>purchased or sold may be allocated among the accounts on a basis determined in its good faith discretion to be equitable. In </font><font>some cases, this system may adversely affect the size or price of the assets purchased or sold for a Fund. In addition,
</font><font>transactions in investments by one or more other accounts managed by BlackRock may have the effect of diluting or
</font><font>otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of a Fund, particularly, but not limited to, with respect to </font><font>small-capitalization, emerging market or less liquid strategies. This may occur with respect to BlackRock-advised accounts
</font><font>when investment decisions regarding a Fund are based on research or other information that is also used to support </font><font>decisions for other accounts. When BlackRock implements a portfolio decision or strategy on behalf of another account </font><font>ahead
of, or contemporaneously with, similar decisions or strategies for a Fund, market impact, liquidity constraints, or other </font><font>factors could result in the Fund receiving less favorable
trading results and the costs of implementing such decisions or </font><font>strategies could be increased or the Fund could otherwise be disadvantaged. BlackRock may, in certain cases, elect
to </font><font>implement internal policies and procedures designed to limit such consequences, which may cause a Fund to be unable to </font><font>engage in certain activities, including purchasing or disposing of securities, when it might otherwise be desirable for it to do </font><font>so.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Conflicts may
also arise because portfolio decisions regarding a Fund may benefit other accounts managed by BlackRock. For </font><font>example, the sale of a long position or establishment of a short
position by a Fund may impair the price of the same security </font><font>sold short by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its other accounts or funds, and the purchase of a security or
covering of a </font><font>short position in a security by a Fund may increase the price of the same security held by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or </font><font>its other accounts or funds. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, certain Funds may invest their assets in
</font><font>other funds advised by BlackRock, including funds that are managed by one or more of the same portfolio managers, which </font><font>could result in conflicts of interest relating to asset allocation, timing of Fund purchases and sales, and increased
</font><font>remuneration and profitability for BlackRock, and/or its personnel, including portfolio managers.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>In certain circumstances, BlackRock, on behalf of the Funds, may seek to buy from or sell
securities to another fund or </font><font>account advised by BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is not required to) effect purchases and sales between BlackRock clients </font><font>(</font><font>“</font><font>cross trades</font><font>”</font><font>), including the Funds, if BlackRock believes such transactions are appropriate based on each party's </font><font>investment objectives and guidelines, subject to applicable law and regulation. There may be potential conflicts of interest or </font><font>regulatory issues relating to these transactions which could limit BlackRock’s decision to engage in these transactions for the </font><font>Funds. BlackRock may have a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities to the parties in such
</font><font>transactions. On any occasion when a Fund participates in a cross trade, BlackRock will comply with procedures adopted </font><font>under applicable rules and SEC guidance.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>BlackRock and its clients may pursue or enforce rights with respect to an issuer in which a Fund has invested, and those
</font><font>activities may have an adverse effect on the Fund. As a result, prices, availability, liquidity and terms of a Fund's investments </font></div> </div> </div>

<div> <div><font>may be negatively impacted by the activities of
BlackRock or its clients, and transactions for the Fund may be impaired or </font><font>effected at prices or terms that may be less favorable than would otherwise have been the
case.</font></div> <div> <div><font>The results of a Fund’s investment activities may differ
significantly from the results achieved by BlackRock for its proprietary </font><font>accounts or other accounts (including investment companies or collective investment vehicles) which it
manages or advises. </font><font>It is possible that one or more accounts managed or advised by BlackRock and such other accounts will achieve investment </font><font>results that are substantially more or less favorable than the results achieved by a Fund. Moreover, it is possible that a Fund </font><font>will sustain losses during periods in which one or more proprietary or other accounts managed or advised by BlackRock
</font><font>achieve significant profits. The opposite result is also possible.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>From time to time, a Fund may be restricted from purchasing or selling securities, or from
engaging in other investment </font><font>activities because of regulatory, legal or contractual requirements applicable to BlackRock or other accounts managed or </font><font>advised by BlackRock, and/or the internal policies of BlackRock designed to comply with such requirements. As a result,
</font><font>there may be periods, for example, when BlackRock will not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions in certain </font><font>securities or instruments with respect to which BlackRock is performing services or when position limits have been reached.
</font><font>For example, the investment activities of BlackRock for its proprietary accounts and accounts under its management may </font><font>limit the investment opportunities for a Fund in certain emerging and other markets in which limitations are imposed upon
</font><font>the amount of investment, in the aggregate or in individual issuers, by affiliated foreign investors.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>In connection with its management of a Fund, BlackRock may have access to certain fundamental
analysis and proprietary </font><font>technical models developed by BlackRock. BlackRock will not be under any obligation, however, to effect transactions on </font><font>behalf of a Fund in accordance with such analysis and models. In addition, BlackRock will not have any obligation to make
</font><font>available any information regarding its proprietary activities or strategies, or the activities or strategies used for other </font><font>accounts managed by them, for the benefit of the management of a Fund and it is not anticipated that BlackRock will have
</font><font>access to such information for the purpose of managing the Fund. The proprietary activities or portfolio strategies of </font><font>BlackRock, or the activities or strategies used for accounts managed by BlackRock or other client accounts could conflict
</font><font>with the transactions and strategies employed by BlackRock in managing a Fund.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The Funds may be included in investment models developed by BlackRock for use by clients and financial advisors. To the </font><font>extent clients invest in these investment models and increase the assets under management of the Funds, the investment
</font><font>management fee amounts paid by the Funds to BlackRock may also increase. The price, availability and liquidity of a Fund </font><font>may be impacted by purchases and sales of the Fund by model-driven investment portfolios, as well as by BlackRock itself </font><font>and
by its advisory clients.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In addition, certain principals and certain
employees of a Fund’s investment adviser are also principals or employees of other </font><font>business units or entities within BlackRock. As a result, these principals and employees
may have obligations to such other </font><font>business units or entities or their clients and such obligations to other business units or entities or their clients may be a </font><font>consideration of which investors in a Fund should be aware.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>BlackRock may enter into transactions and invest in securities, instruments and currencies on behalf of a Fund in which
</font><font>clients of BlackRock or, to the extent permitted by the SEC and applicable law, BlackRock serves as the counterparty, principal </font><font>or issuer. In such cases, such party's interests in the transaction will be adverse to the interests of the Fund, and such party </font><font>may have no incentive to assure that the Fund obtains the best possible prices or terms in connection with the transactions.
</font><font>In addition, the purchase, holding and sale of such investments by a Fund may enhance the profitability of BlackRock.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>BlackRock may also create, write or issue derivatives for clients based on the underlying securities, currencies or instruments </font><font>in which a Fund may invest or on the performance of the Fund. An entity in which BlackRock has a significant minority
</font><font>interest will create, write or issue options which may be based on the performance of certain Funds. BlackRock has the right </font><font>to receive a portion of the gross revenue earned by such entity. Options writing by such entity on a Fund could potentially
</font><font>lead to increased purchase activity with respect to the Fund and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>BlackRock has entered into an arrangement with Markit Indices Limited, the index provider for
underlying fixed-income </font><font>indexes used by certain iShares funds, related to derivative fixed-income products that are based on such iShares funds. </font><font>BlackRock may receive certain payments for licensing intellectual property belonging to BlackRock and for facilitating the
</font><font>provision of data in connection with such derivative products, which may include payments based on the trading volumes of, </font><font>or revenues generated by, the derivative products. However, BlackRock will not receive any such payments on those derivative
</font><font>products utilized by the Funds or other BlackRock funds or accounts. Other funds and accounts managed by BlackRock may </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>from time to time transact in such derivative
products, which could contribute to the viability or success of such derivative </font><font>products by making them more appealing to funds and accounts managed by third parties, and in turn
lead to increased </font><font>payments to BlackRock. Trading activity in such derivative products could also potentially lead to increased purchase activity </font><font>with respect to these iShares funds and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>A Fund may, subject to applicable law, purchase investments that are the subject of an underwriting or other distribution by </font><font>BlackRock and may also enter into transactions with other clients of BlackRock where such other clients have interests
</font><font>adverse to those of the Fund.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>At times, these activities may cause business units or entities within BlackRock to give advice to clients that may cause these </font><font>clients to take actions adverse to the interests of a Fund. To the extent such transactions are permitted, a Fund will deal with </font><font>BlackRock on an arm’s-length basis.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>To the extent authorized by applicable law, BlackRock may act as broker, dealer, agent, lender or adviser or in other
</font><font>commercial capacities for a Fund. It is anticipated that the commissions, mark-ups, mark-downs, financial advisory fees, </font><font>underwriting and placement fees, sales fees, financing and commitment fees, brokerage fees, other fees, compensation or
</font><font>profits, rates, terms and conditions charged by BlackRock will be in its view commercially reasonable, although BlackRock, </font><font>including its sales personnel, will have an interest in obtaining fees and other amounts that are favorable to BlackRock and
</font><font>such sales personnel, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. Index based funds may use an index provider that is </font><font>affiliated with another service provider of a Fund or BlackRock that acts as a broker, dealer, agent, lender or in other
</font><font>commercial capacities for a Fund or BlackRock.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock (and its personnel and other distributors) will be entitled to retain fees and other
</font><font>amounts that they receive in connection with their service to the Funds as broker, dealer, agent, lender, adviser or in other </font><font>commercial capacities. No accounting to the Funds or their shareholders will be required, and no fees or other compensation
</font><font>payable by the Funds or their shareholders will be reduced by reason of receipt by BlackRock of any such fees or other </font><font>amounts.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>When
BlackRock acts as broker, dealer, agent, adviser or in other commercial capacities in relation to the Funds, BlackRock </font><font>may take commercial steps in its own interests, which may
have an adverse effect on the Funds. A Fund will be required to </font><font>establish business relationships with its counterparties based on the Fund's own credit standing. BlackRock will not
have any </font><font>obligation to allow its credit to be used in connection with a Fund's establishment of its business relationships, nor is it </font><font>expected that the Fund's counterparties will rely on the credit of BlackRock in evaluating the Fund's creditworthiness.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>BTC, an affiliate of BFA pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, acts as securities lending agent
to, and receives a share of securities </font><font>lending revenues from, the Funds. BlackRock will also receive compensation for managing the reinvestment of the cash </font><font>collateral from securities lending. There are potential conflicts of interests in managing a securities lending program,
</font><font>including but not limited to: (i) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to increase or decrease the </font><font>amount of securities on loan or to lend particular securities in order to generate additional risk-adjusted revenue for
</font><font>BlackRock and its affiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to allocate loans to clients </font><font>that would provide more revenue to BlackRock. As described further below, BlackRock seeks to mitigate this conflict by
</font><font>providing its securities lending clients with equal lending opportunities over time in order to approximate </font><font>pro rata </font><font>allocation. </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>As part of its securities lending program, BlackRock indemnifies the Funds and certain other clients and/or funds against a </font><font>shortfall in collateral in the event of borrower default. On a regular basis, BlackRock calculates the potential dollar exposure of </font><font>collateral shortfall resulting from a borrower default (</font><font>“</font><font>shortfall risk</font><font>”</font><font>) in the securities lending
program. BlackRock establishes </font><font>program-wide borrower limits (</font><font>“</font><font>credit limits</font><font>”</font><font>) to actively manage
borrower-specific credit exposure. BlackRock oversees the </font><font>risk model that calculates projected collateral shortfall values using loan-level factors such as loan and collateral type
and </font><font>market value as well as specific borrower credit characteristics. When necessary, BlackRock may adjust securities lending </font><font>program attributes by restricting eligible collateral or reducing borrower credit limits. As a result, the management of
</font><font>program-wide exposure as well as BlackRock-specific indemnification exposure may affect the amount of securities lending </font><font>activity BlackRock may conduct at any given point in time by reducing the volume of lending opportunities for certain loans
</font><font>(including by asset type, collateral type and/or revenue profile).</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>BlackRock uses a predetermined systematic process in order to approximate
</font><font>pro rata</font><font> allocation over time. In order to allocate </font><font>a loan to a portfolio: (i) BlackRock as a whole must have sufficient lending capacity pursuant to the various program limits
</font><font>(</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> indemnification
exposure limit and borrower credit limits); (ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset at the time a </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><a name="xx_a947e660-0edd-4807-973e-765f2e4dfa58_171"></a> <div> <div> </div>
<div> <div><font>loan opportunity arrives; and (iii) the lending
portfolio must also have enough inventory, either on its own or when </font><font>aggregated with other portfolios into one single market delivery, to satisfy the loan request. In doing so,
BlackRock seeks to </font><font>provide equal lending opportunities for all portfolios, independent of whether BlackRock indemnifies the portfolio. Equal </font><font>opportunities for lending portfolios does not guarantee equal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-term outcomes for
</font><font>individual clients may vary due to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on different securities, and the overall limits imposed by </font><font>the firm.</font></div> <div> <div><font>BlackRock may
decline to make a securities loan on behalf of a Fund, discontinue lending on behalf of a Fund or terminate a </font><font>securities loan on behalf of a Fund for any reason, including but not
limited to regulatory requirements and/or market rules, </font><font>liquidity considerations, or credit considerations, which may impact Funds by reducing or eliminating the volume of lending
</font><font>opportunities for certain types of loans, loans in particular markets, loans of particular securities or types of securities, or for </font><font>loans overall.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Purchases and sales of securities and other assets for a Fund may be bunched or aggregated with orders for other BlackRock </font><font>client accounts, including with accounts that pay different transaction costs solely due to the fact that they have different
</font><font>research payment arrangements. BlackRock, however, is not required to bunch or aggregate orders if portfolio management </font><font>decisions for different accounts are made separately, or if they determine that bunching or aggregating is not practicable or
</font><font>required, or in cases involving client direction.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Prevailing trading activity frequently may make impossible the receipt of the same price or execution on the entire volume of
</font><font>securities purchased or sold. When this occurs, the various prices may be averaged, and the Funds will be charged or </font><font>credited with the average price. Thus, the effect of the aggregation may operate on some occasions to the disadvantage of
</font><font>the Funds. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Funds will not be charged the same commission or commission </font><font>equivalent rates in connection with a bunched or aggregated order.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock may select brokers that furnish BlackRock, the Funds, other BlackRock client accounts or
</font><font>personnel, directly or through correspondent relationships, with research or other appropriate services which provide, in </font><font>BlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to BlackRock in the investment decision-making process (including with respect to
</font><font>futures, fixed-price offerings and OTC transactions). Such research or other services may include, to the extent permitted by </font><font>law, research reports on companies, industries and securities; economic and financial data; financial publications; proxy
</font><font>analysis; trade industry seminars; computer data bases; research-oriented software and other services and products. </font><font>Research or other services obtained in this manner may be used in servicing any or all of the Funds and other BlackRock
</font><font>client accounts, including in connection with BlackRock client accounts other than those that pay commissions to the broker </font><font>relating to the research or other service arrangements. Such products and services may disproportionately benefit other
</font><font>BlackRock client accounts relative to the Funds based on the amount of brokerage commissions paid by the Funds and such </font><font>other BlackRock client accounts. For example, research or other services that are paid for through one client's commissions
</font><font>may not be used in managing that client's account. In addition, other BlackRock client accounts may receive the benefit, </font><font>including disproportionate benefits, of economies of scale or price discounts in connection with products and services that
</font><font>may be provided to the Funds and to such other BlackRock client accounts. To the extent that BlackRock uses soft dollars, it </font><font>will not have to pay for those products and services itself.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>BlackRock does not currently enter into arrangements to use the Funds' assets for, or
participate in, soft dollars, although </font><font>BlackRock may receive research that is bundled with the trade execution, clearing, and/or settlement services provided by a </font><font>particular broker-dealer. To the extent that BlackRock receives research on this basis, many of the same conflicts related to
</font><font>traditional soft dollars may exist. For example, the research effectively will be paid by client commissions that also will be </font><font>used to pay for the execution, clearing, and settlement services provided by the broker-dealer and will not be paid by
</font><font>BlackRock. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may endeavor to execute trades through brokers who, pursuant to </font><font>such arrangements, provide research or other services in order to ensure the continued receipt of research or other services
</font><font>BlackRock believes are useful in its investment decision-making process. BlackRock may from time to time choose not to </font><font>engage in the above described arrangements to varying degrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may also
</font><font>enter into commission sharing arrangements under which BlackRock may execute transactions through a broker-dealer, and </font><font>request that the broker-dealer allocate a portion of the commissions or commission credits to another firm that provides
</font><font>research to BlackRock. To the extent that BlackRock engages in commission sharing arrangements, many of the same
</font><font>conflicts related to traditional soft dollars may exist.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>BlackRock may utilize certain electronic crossing
networks (</font><font>“</font><font>ECNs</font><font>”</font><font>) (including, without limitation, ECNs in which BlackRock </font><font>has an investment or other interest, to the extent permitted by
applicable law) in executing client</font><font> </font><font>securities transactions for </font><font>certain types of securities. These ECNs may charge fees for their services, including access fees and transaction fees. The
</font><font>transaction fees, which are similar to commissions or markups/markdowns, will generally be charged to clients and, like </font><font>commissions and markups/markdowns, would generally be included in the cost of the securities purchased. Access fees </font><font>may be
paid by BlackRock even though incurred in connection with executing transactions on behalf of clients, including the </font><font>Funds. In certain circumstances, ECNs may offer volume
discounts that will reduce the access fees typically paid by </font><font>BlackRock. BlackRock will only utilize ECNs consistent with its obligation to seek to obtain best execution in client
</font><font>transactions.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>BlackRock owns a minority interest in, and is a member of, Members Exchange
(</font><font>“</font><font>MEMX</font><font>”</font><font>), a newly created U.S. stock </font><font>exchange. Transactions for a Fund may be executed on MEMX if third party brokers select MEMX
as the appropriate venue </font><font>for execution of orders placed by BlackRock traders on behalf of such Funds. In addition, transactions in Fund shares may be </font><font>executed on MEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue for the execution of such orders.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>BlackRock has adopted policies and procedures designed to prevent conflicts of interest from
influencing proxy voting </font><font>decisions that it makes on behalf of advisory clients, including the Funds, and to help ensure that such decisions are made in </font><font>accordance with BlackRock's fiduciary obligations to its clients. Nevertheless, notwithstanding such proxy voting policies and
</font><font>procedures, actual proxy voting decisions of BlackRock may have the effect of favoring the interests of other clients or </font><font>businesses of other divisions or units of BlackRock, provided that BlackRock believes such voting decisions to be in
</font><font>accordance with its fiduciary obligations. For a more detailed discussion of these policies and procedures, see the </font><font>Proxy </font><font>Voting Policy</font><font>
section of this SAI.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>It is also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients (including other funds and separately
</font><font>managed accounts) may, subject to compliance with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of a Fund. Increasing a Fund’s </font><font>assets may enhance liquidity, investment flexibility and diversification and may contribute to economies of scale that tend to
</font><font>reduce the Fund's expense ratio. BlackRock reserves the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to sell into the </font><font>market or redeem in Creation Units through an Authorized Participant at any time some or all of the shares of a Fund
</font><font>acquired for its own accounts or the account of a BlackRock advisory client. A large sale or redemption of shares of a Fund by </font><font>BlackRock itself or a BlackRock advisory client could significantly reduce the asset size of the Fund, which might have an
</font><font>adverse effect on the Fund's liquidity, investment flexibility, portfolio diversification, expense ratio or ability to comply with the </font><font>listing requirements for the Fund.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>It is possible that a Fund may invest in securities of, or engage in transactions with, companies in which BlackRock has
</font><font>significant debt or equity investments or other interests. A Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by </font><font>entities for which BlackRock provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the </font><font>sale
of such issuances. In making investment decisions for a Fund, BlackRock is not permitted to obtain or use material non-public</font><font> information acquired by any unit of BlackRock in the
course of these activities. In addition, from time to time, the </font><font>activities of BlackRock may limit a Fund's flexibility in purchases and sales of securities. As indicated below,
BlackRock may </font><font>engage in transactions with companies in which BlackRock-advised funds or other clients of BlackRock have an investment.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>BlackRock, its personnel and other financial service providers may have interests in promoting sales of the Funds. With </font><font>respect to BlackRock and its personnel, the remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of the Funds or
</font><font>other products may be greater than remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of certain funds or other </font><font>products that might be provided or offered. BlackRock and its sales personnel may directly or indirectly receive a portion of
</font><font>the fees and commissions charged to the Funds or their shareholders. BlackRock and its advisory or other personnel may </font><font>also benefit from increased amounts of assets under management. Fees and commissions may also be higher than for other
</font><font>products or services, and the remuneration and profitability to BlackRock and such personnel resulting from transactions on </font><font>behalf of or management of the Funds may be greater than the remuneration and profitability resulting from other funds or
</font><font>products.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Third parties, including service providers to BlackRock or a Fund, may sponsor events (including, but not limited to,
</font><font>marketing and promotional activities and presentations, educational training programs and conferences) for registered </font><font>representatives, other professionals and individual investors. There is a potential conflict of interest as such sponsorships
</font><font>may defray the costs of such activities to BlackRock, and may provide an incentive to BlackRock to retain such third parties to </font><font>provide services to a Fund.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>BlackRock may provide valuation assistance to
certain clients with respect to certain securities or other investments and the </font><font>valuation recommendations made for such clients' accounts may differ from the valuations for the
same securities or </font><font>investments assigned by a Fund's pricing vendors, especially if such valuations are based on broker-dealer quotes or other </font><font>data sources unavailable to the Fund's pricing vendors. While BlackRock will generally communicate its valuation information
</font><font>or determinations to a Fund's pricing vendors and/or fund accountants, there may be instances where the Fund's pricing </font><font>vendors or fund accountants assign a different valuation to a security or other investment than the valuation for such
</font><font>security or investment determined or recommended by BlackRock.</font></div> <div> <div><font>As disclosed in more detail in the </font><font>Determination of Net Asset Value</font><font> section in this SAI, when market quotations are not </font><font>readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, each
Fund’s investments are valued at fair value by BFA. BFA has been </font><font>designated as each Fund’s valuation designee pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act and
acts through </font><font>BFA’s Rule 2a-5 Committee (the </font><font>“</font><font>2a-5 Committee</font><font>”</font><font>), with assistance from other BFA
pricing committees and in accordance </font><font>with BFA’s policies and procedures (the </font><font>“</font><font>Valuation Procedures</font><font>”</font><font>). When determining a
</font><font>“</font><font>fair value price,</font><font>”</font><font> the 2a-5 Committee </font><font>seeks to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of
that asset or liability in </font><font>an arm’s-length transaction. The price generally may not be determined based on what a Fund might reasonably expect to </font><font>receive for selling an asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. While fair value
</font><font>determinations will be based upon all available factors that BFA deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be </font><font>based on analytical values determined by BFA using proprietary or third-party valuation models, fair value represents only a
</font><font>good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in </font><font>retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair </font><font>values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a </font><font>holding or holdings are valued by the 2a-5 Committee at fair value, may have the effect of diluting or increasing the economic
</font><font>interest of existing shareholders and may affect the amount of revenue received by BFA with respect to services for which it </font><font>receives an asset-based fee.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>To the extent permitted by applicable law, a Fund may invest all or some of its short-term cash investments in any money
</font><font>market fund or similarly-managed private fund advised or managed by BlackRock. In connection with any such investments, </font><font>a Fund, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, may pay its share of expenses of a money market fund or other similarly-managed</font><font> private fund in which it invests, which may result in a Fund bearing some additional expenses.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>BlackRock and its directors, officers and employees, may buy and sell securities or other investments for their own accounts </font><font>and may have conflicts of interest with respect to investments made on behalf of a Fund. As a result of differing trading and
</font><font>investment strategies or constraints, positions may be taken by directors, officers and employees that are the same, different </font><font>from or made at different times than positions taken for a Fund. To lessen the possibility that a Fund will be adversely
</font><font>affected by this personal trading, each Fund, BFA and BlackRock have each adopted a code of ethics in compliance with </font><font>Section 17(j) of the 1940 Act that restricts securities trading in the personal accounts of investment professionals and others </font><font>who normally come into possession of information regarding a Fund's portfolio transactions. Each code of ethics is available
</font><font>by contacting BlackRock at the telephone number on the back cover of each Fund’s Prospectus or by accessing the EDGAR </font><font>Database on the SEC's Internet site at http://www.sec.gov, and copies may be obtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by
</font><font>e-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>BlackRock will not purchase securities or other property from, or sell securities or other property to, a Fund, except that a
</font><font>Fund may in accordance with rules or guidance adopted under the 1940 Act engage in transactions with another Fund or </font><font>accounts that are affiliated with a Fund as a result of common officers, directors, or investment advisers or pursuant to
</font><font>exemptive orders granted to the Funds and/or BlackRock by the SEC. These transactions would be effected in circumstances </font><font>in which BlackRock determined that it would be appropriate for a Fund to purchase and another client of BlackRock to sell, or
</font><font>the Fund to sell and another client of BlackRock to purchase, the same security or instrument on the same day. From time to </font><font>time, the activities of a Fund may be restricted because of regulatory requirements applicable to BlackRock and/or
</font><font>BlackRock's internal policies designed to comply with, limit the applicability of, or otherwise relate to such requirements. A </font><font>client not advised by BlackRock would not be subject to some of those considerations. There may be periods when </font><font>BlackRock
may not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions, or may otherwise restrict or limit its advice in certain </font><font>securities or instruments issued by or related to companies
for which BlackRock is performing advisory or other services or </font><font>has proprietary positions. For example, when BlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or risk management services
for a </font><font>company, BlackRock may be prohibited from or limited in purchasing or selling securities of that company on behalf of a </font><font>Fund, particularly where such services result in BlackRock obtaining material non-public information about the company
</font><font>(</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, in connection
with participation in a creditors’ committee). Similar situations could arise if personnel of BlackRock serve </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

a Fund wishes to purchase or sell. However, if permitted by applicable law, </font><font>and where consistent with BlackRock’s policies and procedures (including the necessary

investment activities of BlackRock for its proprietary accounts and for client accounts may also limit the investment </font><font>strategies and rights of the Funds. For example, in certain
circumstances where the Funds invest in securities issued by </font><font>companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or international markets, or are subject
to </font><font>corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or invest in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits </font><font>on the aggregate amount invested by BlackRock for their proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Funds)
</font><font>that may not be exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if exceeded, may cause </font><font>BlackRock, the Funds or other client accounts to suffer disadvantages or business restrictions.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>If certain aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either through the actions of BlackRock or a Fund or as a result of </font><font>third-party transactions, the ability of BlackRock, on behalf of clients (including the Funds), to purchase or dispose of
</font><font>investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. As </font><font>a result, BlackRock, on behalf of its clients (including the Funds), may limit purchases, sell existing investments, or otherwise </font><font>restrict, forgo or limit the exercise of rights (including transferring, outsourcing or limiting voting rights or forgoing the right </font><font>to receive dividends) when BlackRock, in its sole discretion, deems it appropriate in light of potential regulatory or other
</font><font>restrictions on ownership or other consequences resulting from reaching investment thresholds.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>In those circumstances where ownership thresholds or limitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks to allocate limited </font><font>investment opportunities equitably among clients (including the Funds), taking into consideration benchmark weight and
</font><font>investment strategy. BlackRock has adopted certain controls designed to prevent the occurrence of a breach of any
</font><font>applicable ownership threshold or limits, including, for example, when ownership in certain securities nears an applicable </font><font>threshold, BlackRock may remove such securities from the list of Deposit Securities to be delivered to the Fund in connection
</font><font>with purchases of Creation Units of such Fund and may limit purchases in such securities to the issuer's weighting in the </font><font>applicable benchmark used by BlackRock to manage such Fund. If client (including Fund) holdings of an issuer exceed an
</font><font>applicable threshold and BlackRock is unable to obtain relief to enable the continued holding of such investments, it may be </font><font>necessary to sell down these positions to meet the applicable limitations. In these cases, benchmark overweight positions
</font><font>will be sold prior to benchmark positions being reduced to meet applicable limitations.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>In addition to the foregoing, other ownership thresholds may trigger reporting requirements to governmental and regulatory </font><font>authorities, and such reports may entail the disclosure of the identity of a client or BlackRock’s intended strategy with respect </font><font>to such security or asset.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>BlackRock may not serve as an Authorized Participant in the creation and redemption of iShares ETFs.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Under an ETF Services Agreement, certain Funds have retained BlackRock Investments, LLC, an Affiliate of BFA, to perform </font><font>certain order processing, Authorized Participant communications, and related services in connection with the issuance and
</font><font>redemption of Creation Units of the Funds (</font><font>“</font><font>ETF Services</font><font>”</font><font>). BRIL will retain a portion of the
standard transaction fee received </font><font>from Authorized Participants on each creation or redemption order from the Authorized Participant for the ETF Services </font><font>provided. BlackRock collaborated with, and received payment from, Citibank, N.A. (</font><font>“</font><font>Citibank</font><font>”</font><font>) on the design and </font><font>development of the ETF Services platform. Citibank may have, or from time to time may develop, additional relationships with
</font><font>BlackRock or funds managed by BFA and its affiliates.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In order to defray transaction expenses and protect against possible shareholder dilution, the Funds may collect certain fees
</font><font>from Authorized Participants in connection with creation and redemption transactions. While BlackRock uses good faith </font><font>estimates of the expected costs to the Funds in determining the rates for fees collected by the Funds related to creation and
</font><font>redemption activity, BlackRock may have incentives to improve Fund performance through the collection of these fees. As </font><font>these charges are based on estimates, where the charges exceed actual transaction-related costs and/or expenses incurred </font><font>by
a Fund, Fund performance could improve as a result. BlackRock has established processes to oversee the determination of </font><font>these estimates in an effort to mitigate this
conflict.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>BlackRock may maintain securities indices. To the extent
permitted by applicable laws, the Funds may seek to license and use </font><font>such indices as part of their investment strategy. Index based funds that seek to track the performance of
securities indices </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>174</font></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>also may use the name of the index or index
provider in the fund name. Index providers, including BlackRock (to the extent </font><font>permitted by applicable law), may be paid licensing fees for use of their index or index name.
BlackRock may benefit from the </font><font>Funds using BlackRock indices by creating increasing acceptance in the marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is not </font><font>obligated to license its indices to a Fund and the Funds are under no obligation to use BlackRock indices. Any Fund that
</font><font>enters into a license for a BlackRock index cannot be assured that the terms of any index licensing agreement with BlackRock </font><font>will be as favorable as those terms offered to other licensees.</font></div> <div> <div><font>The custody arrangement described in </font><font>“</font><font>Investment
Advisory, Administrative and Distribution Services</font><font>”</font><font> may lead to potential </font><font>conflicts of interest with BlackRock where BlackRock has agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse ordinary operating expenses
</font><font>in order to cap expenses of the Funds (or where BlackRock charges a unitary management fee). This is because the custody </font><font>arrangements with certain Funds' custodian may have the effect of reducing custody fees when the Funds leave cash </font><font>balances
uninvested. This could be viewed as having the potential to provide BlackRock an incentive to keep high positive </font><font>cash balances for Funds in order to offset fund custody fees that
BlackRock might otherwise reimburse or pay. However, </font><font>BlackRock’s portfolio managers do not intentionally keep uninvested balances high, but rather make investment decisions
</font><font>that they anticipate will be beneficial to fund performance. For funds without a unitary management fee, when a fund’s </font><font>actual operating expense ratio exceeds a stated cap, a reduction in custody fees reduces the amount of waivers and/or
</font><font>reimbursements BlackRock would be required to make to the fund.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>BlackRock may enter into contractual arrangements with third-party service providers to a
Fund (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, custodians,
</font><font>administrators and index providers) pursuant to which BlackRock receives fee discounts or concessions in recognition of </font><font>BlackRock’s overall relationship with such service providers. BlackRock may also enter into contractual arrangements with </font><font>such service providers pursuant to which BlackRock incurs additional costs if the service provider’s services are terminated </font><font>with respect to a Fund. To the extent that BlackRock is responsible for paying these service providers out of its management
</font><font>fee, the benefits of any such fee discounts or concessions, or any additional costs, may accrue, in whole or in part, to </font><font>BlackRock, which could result in conflicts of interest relating to the use or termination of service providers to a Fund.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>BlackRock owns or has an ownership interest in certain trading, portfolio management, operations and/or information </font><font>systems used by Fund service providers. These systems are, or will be, used by a Fund service provider in connection with the
</font><font>provision of services to accounts managed by BlackRock and funds managed and sponsored by BlackRock, including the </font><font>Funds, that engage the service provider (typically the custodian). A Fund’s service provider remunerates BlackRock for the </font><font>use of the systems. A Fund service provider’s payments to BlackRock for the use of these systems may enhance the
</font><font>profitability of BlackRock.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>BlackRock’s receipt of fees from a service provider in connection with the use of
systems provided by BlackRock may create </font><font>an incentive for BlackRock to recommend that a Fund enter into or renew an arrangement with the service provider.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>In recognition of a BlackRock client’s overall relationship with BlackRock, BlackRock
may offer special pricing arrangements </font><font>for certain services provided by BlackRock. Any such special pricing arrangements will not apply to the client’s investment in </font><font>a Fund.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Present and future activities of BlackRock (including BFA), its directors, officers and employees, in addition to those described </font><font>in this section, may give rise to additional conflicts of interest.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Investment Advisory, Administrative and </font><font>Distribution Services</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Investment Adviser. </font><font> </font><font>BFA serves as investment adviser to each Fund pursuant to an investment advisory agreement between
</font><font>the Trust, on behalf of each Fund, and BFA. BFA is a California corporation indirectly owned by BlackRock, Inc. and is </font><font>registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Under the investment advisory
</font><font>agreement, BFA, subject to the supervision of the Board and in conformity with the stated investment policies of each Fund, </font><font>manages and administers the Trust and the investment of each Fund’s assets. BFA is responsible for placing purchase and
</font><font>sale orders and providing continuous supervision of the investment portfolio of each Fund.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Pursuant to the investment advisory agreement, BFA may, from time to time, in its sole discretion and to the extent permitted </font><font>by applicable law, appoint one or more sub-advisers, including, without limitation, affiliates of BFA, to perform investment </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

In addition, BFA may delegate certain of its investment advisory functions </font><font>under the investment advisory agreement to one or more of its affiliates to the extent permitted by
applicable law. BFA may </font><font>terminate any or all sub-advisers or such delegation arrangements in its sole discretion upon appropriate notice at any time </font><font>to the extent permitted by applicable law.</font></div> <div> <div><font>BFA is responsible, under the investment advisory agreement, for substantially all expenses of the Funds, including the cost
</font><font>of transfer agency, custody, fund administration, legal, audit and other services. BFA is not responsible for, and the Funds will </font><font>bear, the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of
</font><font>portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or </font><font>expenses, and litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of the Independent Trustees).</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The following describes the calculation of the management fee for each Fund whose management
fee is subject to </font><font>breakpoints. The management fee for all Funds is set forth in the table that follows the description of breakpoints.</font></div> </div>
<div><font>For its investment advisory services to the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF, BFA is paid a management fee
from </font><font>the Fund based on the aggregate average daily net assets of the following iShares funds: iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate </font><font>Bond ETF and iShares J.P. Morgan USD Emerging Markets Bond ETF. The management fee for the Fund equals the ratio of the
</font><font>Fund's net assets over the aggregate net assets of the above iShares funds multiplied by the amount calculated as follows: 0.5000% </font><font>per annum of the aggregate net assets less than or equal to $19 billion, plus 0.4750% per annum of the aggregate net assets
</font><font>over $19 billion, up to and including $33 billion, plus 0.4513% per annum of the aggregate net assets over $33 billion, up to and </font><font>including $47 billion, plus 0.4287% per annum of the aggregate net assets in excess of $47 billion.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>For its investment advisory services to the iShares 1-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares 5-10 Year </font><font>Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares 10+ Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares iBoxx $ Investment </font><font>Grade
Corporate Bond ETF and iShares MBS ETF, BFA is paid a management fee from each Fund calculated based on the </font><font>aggregate average daily net assets of the following iShares funds:
iShares 1-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, </font><font>iShares 5-10 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares 10+ Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares </font><font>Biotechnology ETF, iShares Cohen &amp; Steers REIT ETF, iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares MBS ETF,

<div><font>The management fee for the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF equals the ratio of the Fund’s net assets </font><font>over the aggregate net assets of the above iShares funds multiplied by the amount calculated as follows: 0.1500% per annum
</font><font>of the aggregate net assets less than or equal to $121 billion, plus 0.1425% per annum of the aggregate net assets over $121 </font><font>billion, up to and including $181 billion, plus 0.1354% per annum of the aggregate net assets over $181 billion, up to and
</font><font>including $231 billion, plus 0.1287% per annum of the aggregate net assets over $231 billion, up to and including $281 </font><font>billion, plus 0.1222% per annum of the aggregate net assets in excess of $281 billion.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>From March 1, 2022 through December 15, 2022, the management fee for each of the iShares 1-5

</font><font>multiplied by the amount calculated as follows: 0.0600% per annum of the aggregate net assets less than or equal to $121 </font><font>billion, plus 0.0570% per annum of the aggregate net assets over $121 billion, up to and including $181 billion, plus 0.0542%
</font><font>per annum of the aggregate net assets over $181 billion, up to and including $231 billion, plus 0.0515% per annum of the </font><font>aggregate net assets over $231 billion, up to and including $281 billion, plus 0.0489% per annum of the aggregate net assets
</font><font>in excess of $281 billion.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Effective December 16, 2022, the management fee for each of the iShares 1-5 Year Investment
Grade Corporate Bond ETF, </font><font>iShares 5-10 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF and iShares 10+ Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF equals </font><font>the ratio of the Fund’s net assets over the aggregate net assets of the above iShares funds multiplied by 0.0400% per annum </font><font>of the aggregate net assets.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The management fee for the iShares MBS ETF equals the ratio of the Fund’s net assets over the aggregate net assets of the </font><font>above iShares funds multiplied by the amount calculated as follows: 0.0400% per annum of the aggregate net assets less </font><font>than

<div> <div><font>Each of the portfolios or accounts for which the Portfolio Managers are primarily responsible
for the day-to-day management </font><font>seeks to track the rate of return, risk profile and other characteristics of independent third-party indexes by either replicating </font><font>the same combination of securities and other financial instruments that compose those indexes or through a representative
</font><font>sampling of the securities and other financial instruments that compose those indexes based on objective criteria and data. </font><font>Pursuant to BFA policy, investment opportunities are allocated equitably among the Funds and other portfolios and accounts.
</font><font>For example, under certain circumstances, an investment opportunity may be restricted due to limited supply in the market, </font><font>legal constraints or other factors, in which event the investment opportunity will be allocated equitably among those
</font><font>portfolios and accounts, including the Funds, seeking such investment opportunity. As a consequence, from time to time the </font><font>Funds may receive a smaller allocation of an investment opportunity than they would have if the Portfolio Managers and BFA
</font><font>and its affiliates did not manage other portfolios or accounts.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Like the Funds, the other portfolios or accounts for which the Portfolio Managers are primarily responsible for the day-to-day
</font><font>portfolio management generally pay an asset-based fee to BFA or its affiliates, as applicable, for its advisory services. One or </font><font>more of those other portfolios or accounts, however, may pay BFA or its affiliates a performance-based fee in lieu of, or in
</font><font>addition to, an asset-based fee for its advisory services. A portfolio or account with a performance-based fee would pay BFA </font><font>or its affiliates a portion of that portfolio's or account's gains, or would pay BFA or its affiliates more for its services than </font><font>would otherwise be the case if BFA or its affiliates meets or exceeds specified performance targets. Performance-based fee
</font><font>arrangements could present an incentive for BFA or its affiliates to devote greater resources, and allocate more investment </font><font>opportunities, to the portfolios or accounts that have those fee arrangements, relative to other portfolios or accounts, in
</font><font>order to earn larger fees. Although BFA and its affiliates have an obligation to allocate resources and opportunities equitably </font><font>among portfolios and accounts and intend to do so, shareholders of the Funds should be aware that, as with any group of
</font><font>portfolios and accounts managed by an investment adviser and/or its affiliates pursuant to varying fee arrangements, </font><font>including performance-based fee arrangements, there is the potential for a conflict of interest, which may result in the
</font><font>Portfolio Managers' favoring those portfolios or accounts with performance-based fee arrangements.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The tables below show, for each Portfolio Manager, the number of portfolios or accounts of
the types set forth in the above </font><font>tables and the aggregate of total assets in those portfolios or accounts with respect to which the investment management </font><font>fees are based on the performance of those portfolios or accounts</font><font> </font><font>as of February 28, 2023:</font></div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Portfolio Manager Compensation Overview</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The discussion below describes the Portfolio Managers' compensation as of February 28,
2023.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>BlackRock, Inc.'s financial arrangements with its portfolio
managers, its competitive compensation and its career path </font><font>emphasis at all levels reflect the value senior management places on key resources. Compensation may include a variety of
</font><font>components and may vary from year to year based on a number of factors. The principal components of compensation
</font><font>include a base salary, a performance-based discretionary bonus, participation in various benefits programs and one or more </font><font>of the incentive compensation programs established by BlackRock, Inc.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Each portfolio manager receives base compensation
based on their position with the firm, as well as retirement and other </font><font>benefits offered to all BlackRock employees. Additionally, each portfolio manager receives discretionary
incentive </font><font>compensation, determined based on several components, including: the performance of BlackRock, Inc., the performance of </font><font>the portfolio manager’s group within BlackRock, the performance of portfolios managed by the portfolio manager and the
</font><font>team relative to the portfolios’ investment objectives (which in the case of index ETFs would be how closely the ETF tracks its </font><font>Underlying Index), and the individual’s performance and contribution to the overall performance of these portfolios and
</font><font>BlackRock. Discretionary incentive compensation is paid in cash up to a certain threshold with the remaining portion </font><font>represented by deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock awards. In some cases, additional deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock may be
</font><font>granted to certain key employees as part of a long-term incentive award to aid in retention, align interests with long-term </font><font>shareholders and motivate performance.</font></div> <div> <div><font>The discretionary incentive income for James Mauro, Scott Radell, Karen Uyehara and Jeff Rosenberg includes as an additional
</font><font>consideration the performance of actively-managed portfolios they manage over 1, 3 and 5 year periods measured against </font><font>the respective benchmark of each portfolio as well as peer group performance. A portion of the discretionary incentive
</font><font>compensation for James Mauro, Scott Radell, Karen Uyehara and Jeff Rosenberg is distributed in the form of deferred cash </font><font>awards that notionally track the returns of select BlackRock, Inc. investment products they manage, which provides direct
</font><font>alignment of portfolio manager discretionary incentive compensation with investment product results. Deferred cash awards </font><font>vest ratably over a number of years and, once vested, settle in the form of cash.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>As of February 28, 2023, the Portfolio Managers beneficially owned shares of the Funds in the amounts reflected in the </font><font>following tables:</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div><font> </font></div> <div> <div> </div> </div> <div>

</div> <div> <div><font>JPMorgan serves as custodian for the Funds in connection with certain securities
lending activities under a Custody Services </font><font>Agreement. JPMorgan’s principal address is 383 Madison Avenue, 11</font><font>th</font><font> Floor, New York, NY 10179. Pursuant to the Custody </font><font>Services Agreement with BTC and the Trust, JPMorgan provides custody and related services required to facilitate securities
</font><font>lending by each Fund. JPMorgan maintains custody as may be necessary to facilitate Fund securities lending activity in </font><font>coordination with other funds, maintains custodial records and provides other services. As compensation for these services,
</font><font>JPMorgan receives certain fees and expenses paid by BTC from its compensation for its services as securities lending agent.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Distributor. </font><font> </font><font>The Distributor's principal address is 50 Hudson Yards, New York, NY 10001. Shares are continuously
offered for </font><font>sale by the Funds through the Distributor or its agent only in Creation Units, as described in the applicable Prospectus and </font><font>below in the</font><font> </font><font>Creation</font><font> </font><font>and Redemption of </font><font>Creation Units</font><font> </font><font>section of this SAI. Fund shares in amounts less than Creation Units </font><font>are generally not distributed by the Distributor or its agent. The Distributor or its agent will arrange for the delivery of the </font><font>applicable Prospectus and, upon request, this SAI to persons purchasing Creation Units and will maintain records of both
</font><font>orders placed with it or its agents and confirmations of acceptance furnished by it or its agents. The Distributor is a broker-dealer</font><font> registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the </font><font>“</font><font>1934 Act</font><font>”</font><font>), and a member of the Financial </font><font>Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.
(</font><font>“</font><font>FINRA</font><font>”</font><font>). The Distributor is also licensed as a broker-dealer in all 50 U.S. states, as well as </font><font>in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin
Islands and the District of Columbia.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Distribution Agreement for each
Fund provides that it may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any </font><font>penalty, on at least 60 days' prior written notice to the other party following (i) the vote of a
majority of the Independent </font><font>Trustees, or (ii) the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the relevant Fund. </font><font>The Distribution Agreement will terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The Distributor may also enter into agreements with securities dealers (</font><font>“</font><font>Soliciting Dealers</font><font>”</font><font>) who will solicit purchases of </font><font>Creation Units of Fund shares. Such Soliciting Dealers may also be Authorized Participants
(as described below), DTC </font><font>participants and/or investor services organizations.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>BFA or its affiliates may, from time to time and from its own resources, pay, defray or absorb costs relating to distribution, </font><font>including payments out of its own resources to the Distributor, or to otherwise promote the sale of shares.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Securities Lending. </font><font> </font><font>To the extent that a Fund engages in securities lending, each Fund conducts its securities lending </font><font>pursuant to SEC exemptive
relief, and BTC acts as securities lending agent for the Funds, subject to the overall supervision of </font><font>BFA, pursuant to a written agreement (the </font><font>“</font><font>Securities Lending Agency
Agreement</font><font>”</font><font>).</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Each Fund retains a portion of the securities lending income and remits the remaining portion to BTC as compensation for its </font><font>services as securities lending agent. Securities lending income is generally equal to the total of income earned from the
</font><font>reinvestment of cash collateral (and excludes collateral investment fees as defined below), and any fees or other payments to </font><font>and from borrowers of securities. As securities lending agent, BTC bears all operational costs directly related to securities
</font><font>lending, including custodial costs of JPMorgan. Each Fund is responsible for fees in connection with the investment of cash </font><font>collateral received for securities on loan in a money market fund managed by BFA (the </font><font>“</font><font>collateral investment fees</font><font>”</font><font>); however, </font><font>BTC has agreed to reduce the amount of securities lending income it receives in order to effectively limit the collateral </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>investment fees the Fund bears to an annual rate
of 0.04%. Such money market fund shares will not be subject to a sales </font><font>load, redemption fee, distribution fee or service fee.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>Under the securities lending program, the Funds are categorized into one of several specific
asset classes. The determination </font><font>of a Fund’s asset class category (fixed-income, domestic equity, international equity or fund-of-funds), each of which may be </font><font>subject to a different fee arrangement, is based on a methodology agreed to by the Trust and BTC.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Pursuant to the Securities Lending Agency Agreement:</font><font> </font></div>
</div> <div> <div><font>(i) fixed-income funds, such as the Funds, retain 82% of securities lending income
(which excludes collateral investment </font><font>fees), and (ii) this amount can never be less than 70% of the sum of securities lending income plus collateral investment fees.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>In addition, commencing the business day following the date that the aggregate securities lending income (which includes, </font><font>for this purpose, collateral investment fees) earned across the Exchange-Traded Fund Complex (as defined in the </font><font>Management</font><font>—</font><font>Trustees and Officers</font><font> section of this SAI) in a calendar year exceeds a specified
threshold, each applicable </font><font>fixed income fund, pursuant to the current Securities Lending Agency Agreement, will receive for the remainder of that </font><font>calendar year securities lending income as follows:</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>(i) 85% of securities lending income (which excludes collateral investment fees) and (ii) this amount can never be less than
</font><font>70% of the sum of securities lending income plus collateral investment fees.</font><font> </font></div>
</div> <div> <div><font>The services provided to the Funds by BTC in the most recent fiscal year ended
February 28, 2023 primarily included the </font><font>following:</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>(1) selecting borrowers from an approved list of borrowers and executing a securities lending agreement as agent on </font><font>behalf of the Funds with each such borrower; </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>(2) negotiating the terms of securities loans, including the amount of fees; </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>(3) directing the delivery of loaned securities; </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>(4) monitoring the daily value of the loaned securities and directing the payment of additional collateral or the return of </font><font>excess collateral, as necessary; </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>(5) investing cash collateral received in connection with any loaned securities; </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>(6) monitoring distributions on loaned securities (for example, interest and dividend activity); </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>(7) in the event of default by a borrower with respect to any securities
loan, using the collateral or the proceeds of the </font><font>liquidation of collateral to purchase replacement securities of the same issue, type, class and series as that of the loaned
</font><font>securities; and </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>(8) terminating securities loans and arranging for the return of loaned securities to the Funds at loan termination.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The following tables show the dollar amounts of income and fees/compensation related to the
securities lending activities of </font><font>each Fund during its most recent fiscal year ended February 28, 2023.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div> </div> </div> <div>

(</font><font>“</font><font>BFA Entities</font><font>”</font><font>) may pay certain broker-dealers, registered </font><font>investment advisers, banks and other financial intermediaries (</font><font>“</font><font>Intermediaries</font><font>”</font><font>) for certain activities related to the Funds, </font><font>other iShares funds or exchange-traded products in general. BFA Entities make
these payments from their own assets and </font><font>not from the assets of the Funds. Although a portion of BFA Entities’ revenue comes directly or indirectly in part from fees </font><font>paid by the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products, these payments do not increase the price paid by
</font><font>investors for the purchase of shares of, or the cost of owning, the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products. </font><font>BFA Entities make payments for Intermediaries’ participation in activities that are designed to make registered
</font><font>representatives, other professionals and individual investors more knowledgeable about exchange-traded products, including </font><font>the Funds and other iShares funds, or for other activities, such as participation in marketing activities and presentations,
</font><font>educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems
(</font><font>“</font><font>Education </font><font>Costs</font><font>”</font><font>). BFA Entities also make payments to Intermediaries for certain printing, publishing and mailing costs or materials
</font><font>relating to the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products (</font><font>“</font><font>Publishing Costs</font><font>”</font><font>). In addition, BFA Entities
make </font><font>payments to Intermediaries that make shares of the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products available to </font><font>their clients, in some cases at a waived or reduced commission rate or ticket charge, develop new products that feature
</font><font>iShares, create educational content about the Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products that is featured on an </font><font>Intermediary’s platform, or otherwise promote the Funds, other iShares funds and exchange-traded products. BFA Entities
</font><font>may also reimburse expenses or make payments from their own assets to Intermediaries or other persons in consideration of </font><font>services or other activities that the BFA Entities believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in the Funds, </font><font>other iShares funds or exchange-traded products.

<div> <div><font>Payments to an Intermediary may be significant to
the Intermediary, and amounts that Intermediaries pay to your </font><font>salesperson or other investment professional may also be significant for your salesperson or other investment
professional. </font><font>Because an Intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it will recommend or make available to its </font><font>clients, what services to provide for various products, or what marketing content to make available to its clients based on
</font><font>payments it receives or is eligible to receive, such payments may create conflicts of interest between the Intermediary and its </font><font>clients. These financial incentives may cause the Intermediary to recommend the Funds, other iShares funds or
exchange-traded</font><font> products, or otherwise promote the Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products over other investments. </font><font>The same conflicts of interest and financial incentives exist with respect to your salesperson or other investment professional </font><font>if he or she receives similar payments from his or her Intermediary firm.</font></div> <div> <div><font>In addition to the payments described above, BFA Entities have developed proprietary tools, calculators and related
</font><font>interactive or digital content that is made available through the www.BlackRock.com website at no additional cost to </font><font>Intermediaries. BlackRock may configure these tools and calculators and localize the content for Intermediaries as part of its

<div> <div><font>As of March 1, 2013, BFA Entities have contractual arrangements to make payments (in addition
to payments for Education </font><font>Costs or Publishing Costs) to one Intermediary, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC
(</font><font>“</font><font>FBS</font><font>”</font><font>). Effective June 4, 2016, this </font><font>relationship was expanded to include National Financial Services, LLC (</font><font>“</font><font>NFS</font><font>”</font><font>), an affiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this special, </font><font>long-term and significant arrangement (the </font><font>“</font><font>Marketing Program</font><font>”</font><font>), FBS, NFS and certain of their affiliates (collectively </font><font>“</font><font>Fidelity</font><font>”</font><font>) have agreed, among other things, to
actively promote iShares funds to customers, investment professionals and </font><font>other intermediaries and in advertising campaigns as the preferred exchange-traded product, to offer
certain iShares funds in </font><font>certain Fidelity platforms and investment programs, in some cases at a waived or reduced commission rate or ticket charge, </font><font>and to provide marketing data to BFA Entities. BFA Entities have agreed to facilitate the Marketing Program by, among other
</font><font>things, making certain payments to FBS and NFS for marketing and implementing certain brokerage and investment
</font><font>programs. Upon termination of the arrangement, the BFA Entities will make additional payments to FBS and/or NFS based </font><font>upon a number of criteria, including the overall success of the Marketing Program and the level of services provided by FBS
</font><font>and NFS during the wind-down period.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In addition, BFA Entities may enter into other contractual arrangements with Intermediaries and certain other third parties
</font><font>that the BFA Entities believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in iShares funds. Such agreements may </font><font>include payments by BFA Entities to such Intermediaries and third parties for data collection and provision, technology
</font><font>support, platform enhancement, or educational content, co-marketing and cross-promotional efforts. Payments made
</font><font>pursuant to such arrangements may vary in any year and may be different for different Intermediaries and third parties. In </font><font>certain cases, the payments to Intermediaries are subject to certain minimum payment levels or tiered payments. As of the
</font><font>date of this SAI, the Intermediaries and other third parties receiving one or more types of the contractual payments described </font><font>above include (in addition to FBS and NFS): Advisor Credit Exchange, Avantax Investment Services, Inc., BNY Mellon Capital
</font><font>Markets, LLC, BNY Mellon Performance &amp; Risk Analytics, LLC, Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Inc., Clearstream Fund Centre AG, </font><font>Commonwealth Equity Services, LLC, Dorsey Wright and Associates, LLC, E*Trade Securities LLC, Envestnet Asset </font><font>Management,

</font><font>occurred since the date of this SAI are not included in the list.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Further, BFA Entities make Education Costs and Publishing Costs payments to other Intermediaries that are not listed in the
</font><font>immediately preceding paragraph. BFA Entities may determine to make such payments based on any number of metrics. For </font><font>example, BFA Entities may make payments at year-end or other intervals in a fixed amount, an amount based upon an
</font><font>Intermediary’s services at defined levels or an amount based on the Intermediary’s net sales of one or more iShares funds in a </font><font>year or other period, any of which arrangements may include an agreed-upon minimum or maximum payment, or any </font><font>combination of
the foregoing. As of the date of this SAI, BFA anticipates that the payments paid by BFA Entities in connection </font><font>with the Funds, iShares funds and exchange-traded products in
general will be immaterial to BFA Entities in the aggregate for </font><font>the next year. </font><font>Please contact

products.</font></div> <div> <div><font>The Funds may participate in certain market maker incentive programs
of a national securities exchange in which an affiliate </font><font>of the Funds would pay a fee to the exchange used for the purpose of incentivizing one or more market makers in the </font><font>securities of a Fund to enhance the liquidity and quality of the secondary market of securities of a Fund. The fee would then
</font><font>be credited by the exchange to one or more market makers that meet or exceed liquidity and market quality standards with </font><font>respect to the securities of a Fund. Each market maker incentive program is subject to approval from the SEC. Any such fee
</font><font>payments made to an exchange will be made by an affiliate of a Fund solely for the benefit of a Fund and will not be paid </font><font>from any Fund assets. Other funds managed by BFA may also participate in such programs.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Determination of Net Asset Value</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Valuation of Shares. </font><font>The NAV for each Fund (except for the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF and iShares
Short Treasury </font><font>Bond ETF) is generally calculated as of the close of regular trading hours on the NYSE (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time) on </font><font>each business day the NYSE is open. The NAV of each of the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF and iShares Short </font><font>Treasury
Bond ETF is generally calculated twice per day: as of 12:00 p.m., Eastern time and as of the close of regular trading </font><font>hours on the NYSE (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time), on each
business day the NYSE is open. Valuation of assets held by a </font><font>Fund is as follows:</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Equity Investments. </font><font>Equity securities traded on a recognized securities
exchange (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, NYSE), on separate trading boards of a </font><font>securities exchange or through a market system that provides contemporaneous transaction pricing information (each an
</font><font>“</font><font>Exchange</font><font>”</font><font>) are valued using information obtained via independent pricing services, generally at the closing price or, if an </font><font>Exchange
closing price is not available, the last traded price on that Exchange prior to the time as of which the assets or </font><font>liabilities are valued. However, under certain circumstances,
other means of determining current market value may be used. If </font><font>an equity security is traded on more than one Exchange, the current market value of the security where it is
primarily traded </font><font>generally will be used. In the event that there are no sales involving an equity security held by a Fund on a day on which a </font><font>Fund values such security, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BFA determines that such prior day’s price no longer </font><font>reflects the fair value of the security, in which case such asset would be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below).</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Fixed-Income Investments. </font><font>Fixed-income securities for which market quotations are readily available are
generally valued </font><font>using such securities’ current market value. A Fund values fixed-income portfolio securities using the last available bid prices </font><font>or current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated prices) supplied by a Fund’s approved
</font><font>independent third-party pricing services, each in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. The pricing services may use </font><font>matrix pricing or valuation models that utilize certain inputs and assumptions to derive values, including transaction data
</font><font>(</font><font>e.g</font><font>., recent
representative bids and offers), credit quality information, perceived market movements, news, and other </font><font>relevant information and by other methods, which may include consideration
of: yields or prices of securities of comparable </font><font>quality, coupon, maturity and type; indications as to values from dealers; general market conditions; and/or other factors and
</font><font>assumptions. Pricing services generally value fixed-income securities assuming orderly transactions of an institutional round </font><font>lot size, but a Fund may hold or transact in such securities in smaller, odd lot sizes. Odd lots may trade at lower prices than </font><font>institutional round lots. The amortized cost method of valuation may be used with respect to debt obligations with 60 days
</font><font>or less remaining to maturity unless such method does not represent fair value. Certain fixed-income investments, including </font><font>asset-backed and mortgage-related securities, may be valued based on valuation models that consider the estimated cash </font><font>flows
of each tranche of the issuer, establish a benchmark yield and develop an estimated tranche-specific spread to the </font><font>benchmark yield based on the unique attributes of the
tranche.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Options, Futures, Swaps and Other Derivatives.
</font><font>Exchange-traded equity options (except those that are customized) for </font><font>which market quotations are readily
available are valued at the mean of the last bid and ask prices as quoted on the </font><font>Exchange or the board of trade on which such options are traded. In the event that there is no mean
price available for an </font><font>exchange traded equity option held by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values such option, the last bid (long positions) or </font><font>ask (short positions) price, if available, will be used as the value of such option. If no bid or ask price is available on a day on </font><font>which a Fund values such option, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BFA determines that such prior day’s price no </font><font>longer reflects the fair value of the option, in which case such option will be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below). </font><font>Customized exchange-traded equity options, as well as OTC derivatives, may be valued using a mathematical model which </font><font>may
incorporate a number of market data factors. Financial futures contracts and options thereon, which are traded on </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>exchanges, are valued at their last sale price or
settle price as of the close of such exchanges. Swap agreements and other </font><font>derivatives are generally valued daily based upon quotations from market makers or by a pricing service in
accordance with </font><font>the Valuation Procedures.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Underlying Funds. </font><font>Shares of underlying open-end funds (including money market funds) are valued at NAV.
Shares of </font><font>underlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs will be valued at their most recent closing price.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>General Valuation Information. </font><font>Prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services, broker-dealers or market </font><font>makers to value a Fund’s
securities and other assets and liabilities are based on information available at the time a Fund </font><font>values its assets and liabilities. In the event that a pricing service quotation
is revised or updated subsequent to the day on </font><font>which a Fund valued such security, the revised pricing service quotation generally will be applied prospectively. Such </font><font>determination will be made considering pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding the revision.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The price a Fund could receive upon the sale of any particular portfolio investment may differ from a Fund’s valuation of the </font><font>investment, particularly for assets that trade in thin or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair valuation methodology </font><font>or a price provided by an independent pricing service. As a result, the price received upon the sale of an investment may be
</font><font>less than the value ascribed by a Fund, and a Fund could realize a greater than expected loss or lesser than expected gain </font><font>upon the sale of the investment. A Fund’s ability to value its investment may also be impacted by technological issues and/or </font><font>errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>All cash, receivables and current payables are carried on a Fund’s books at their fair value.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>In the event that application of the methods of valuation discussed above result in a price for a security which is deemed not </font><font>to be representative of the fair market value of such security, the security will be valued by, under the direction of or in
</font><font>accordance with a method approved by BFA, each Fund’s valuation designee, as reflecting fair value. All other assets and </font><font>liabilities (including securities for which market quotations are not readily available) held by a Fund (including restricted
</font><font>securities) are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by BFA pursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any assets and </font><font>liabilities which are denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference
between the prices used to calculate </font><font>a Fund’s NAV and the prices used in the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between a Fund’s </font><font>performance and the performance of the Underlying Index.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Fair Value.</font><font> When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, a
Fund’s investments are </font><font>valued at fair value (</font><font>“</font><font>Fair Value Assets</font><font>”</font><font>). Fair Value Assets are valued
by BFA in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. </font><font>Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act, the Board of Trustees has designated BFA as the valuation </font><font>designee for the respective Funds for which it serves as investment adviser. BFA may reasonably conclude that a market
</font><font>quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if, among other things, a security or other asset or liability does not have a </font><font>price source due to its complete lack of trading, if BFA believes a market quotation from a broker-dealer or other source is
</font><font>unreliable (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, where
it varies significantly from a recent trade, or no longer reflects the fair value of the security or other </font><font>asset or liability subsequent to the most recent market quotation), or
where the security or other asset or liability is only </font><font>thinly traded or due to the occurrence of a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation. For this
</font><font>purpose, a </font><font>“</font><font>significant event</font><font>”</font><font> is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment, that an event has </font><font>occurred after the close of trading for an asset or liability but prior to or at the time of pricing a Fund’s assets or liabilities, is </font><font>likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or closing market price of one or more assets held by, or
</font><font>liabilities of, a Fund. On any day the NYSE is open and a foreign market or the primary exchange on which a foreign asset or </font><font>liability is traded is closed, such asset or liability will be valued using the prior day’s price, provided that BFA is not aware of </font><font>any significant event or other information that would cause such price to no longer reflect the fair value of the asset or
</font><font>liability, in which case such asset or liability would be treated as a Fair Value Asset.</font><font>
</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>BFA’s Rule 2a-5 Committee is responsible for reviewing and
approving methodologies by investment type and significant </font><font>inputs used in the fair valuation of Fund assets or liabilities. In addition, a Fund’s accounting agent assists BFA
by periodically </font><font>endeavoring to confirm the prices it receives from all third-party pricing services, index providers and broker-dealers and </font><font>regularly evaluating the values assigned to the securities and other assets and liabilities of a Fund. The pricing of all Fair Value </font><font>Assets is subsequently reported to the Board or a committee thereof.</font><font> </font></div> </div> </div>

<div> <div><font>When determining the price for a Fair Value Asset,
BFA will seek to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect </font><font>to receive from the current sale of that asset or liability in an arm’s-length transaction on the
date on which the asset or </font><font>liability is being valued, and does not seek to determine the price a Fund might reasonably expect to receive for selling an </font><font>asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. Fair value determinations will be based upon all </font><font>available factors that BFA deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be based on analytical values determined
</font><font>by BFA using proprietary or third-party valuation models.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. When determining the fair value of an
</font><font>investment, one or more fair value methodologies may be used (depending on certain factors, including the asset type). For </font><font>example, the investment may be initially priced based on the original cost of the investment or, alternatively, using proprietary </font><font>or third-party models that may rely upon one or more unobservable inputs. Prices of actual, executed or historical
</font><font>transactions in the relevant investment (or comparable instruments) or, where appropriate, an appraisal by a third-party </font><font>experienced in the valuation of similar instruments, may also be used as a basis for establishing the fair value of an
</font><font>investment.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in retrospect, be the price at
which those assets or liabilities could </font><font>have been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a </font><font>Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a holding or holdings are valued at fair value, may have the </font><font>effect of diluting or increasing the economic interest of existing shareholders.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Each Fund’s annual audited financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with US GAAP, follow the requirements </font><font>for valuation set forth in Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, </font><font>“</font><font>Fair Value </font><font>Measurements and Disclosures</font><font>”</font><font> (</font><font>“</font><font>ASC 820</font><font>”</font><font>), which defines and establishes a framework for measuring fair value under US </font><font>GAAP and expands financial statement disclosure requirements relating to fair value measurements.</font><font>
</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Generally, ASC 820 and other accounting rules applicable to funds and
various assets in which they invest are evolving. Such </font><font>changes may adversely affect a Fund. For example, the evolution of rules governing the determination of the fair market
</font><font>value of assets or liabilities, to the extent such rules become more stringent, would tend to increase the cost and/or reduce </font><font>the availability of third-party determinations of fair market value. This may in turn increase the costs associated with selling </font><font>assets or affect their liquidity due to a Fund’s inability to obtain a third-party determination of fair market value.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Brokerage Transactions</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Subject to policies established by the Board, BFA is primarily responsible for the execution
of a Fund’s portfolio transactions </font><font>and the allocation of brokerage. BFA does not execute transactions through any particular broker or dealer, but seeks to </font><font>obtain the best net results for the Funds, taking into account such factors as price (including the applicable brokerage
</font><font>commission or dealer spread), size of order, difficulty of execution, operational facilities of the firm and the firm’s risk and skill </font><font>in positioning blocks of securities. While BFA generally seeks reasonable trade execution costs, a Fund does not necessarily
</font><font>pay the lowest spread or commission available, and payment of the lowest commission or spread is not necessarily
</font><font>consistent with obtaining the best price and execution in particular transactions. Subject to applicable legal requirements, </font><font>BFA may select a broker based partly upon brokerage or research services provided to BFA and its clients, including a Fund. In
</font><font>return for such services, BFA may cause a Fund to pay a higher commission than other brokers would charge if BFA
</font><font>determines in good faith that the commission is reasonable in relation to the services
provided.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In selecting brokers or dealers to execute portfolio transactions, BFA seeks to obtain the best price and most favorable
</font><font>execution for a Fund and may take into account a variety of factors including: (i) the size, nature and character of the security </font><font>or instrument being traded and the markets in which it is purchased or sold; (ii) the desired timing of the transaction; (iii)
</font><font>BFA’s knowledge of the expected commission rates and spreads currently available; (iv) the activity existing and expected in </font><font>the market for the particular security or instrument, including any anticipated execution difficulties; (v) the full range of
</font><font>brokerage services provided; (vi) the broker’s or dealer’s capital; (vii) the quality of research and research services provided; </font><font>(viii) the reasonableness of the commission, dealer spread or its equivalent for the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA’s </font><font>knowledge of any actual or apparent operational problems of a broker or dealer. Brokers may also be selected because of
</font><font>their ability to handle special or difficult executions, such as may be involved in large block trades, thinly traded securities, or </font><font>other circumstances.</font><font> </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act (</font><font>“</font><font>Section 28(e)</font><font>”</font><font>) permits a U.S. investment adviser, under certain circumstances, to cause an </font><font>account to pay a broker or dealer a commission
for effecting a transaction in securities that exceeds the amount another </font><font>broker or dealer would have charged for effecting the same transaction in recognition of the value of
brokerage and research </font><font>services provided by that broker or dealer. This includes commissions paid on riskless principal transactions in securities </font><font>under certain conditions.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>From time to time, a Fund may purchase new issues of securities in a fixed price offering. In these situations, the broker may </font><font>be a member of the selling group that will, in addition to selling securities, provide BFA with research services. FINRA has
</font><font>adopted rules expressly permitting these types of arrangements under certain circumstances. Generally, the broker will </font><font>provide research </font><font>“</font><font>credits</font><font>”</font><font> in these situations at a rate that is higher than that available for typical secondary market </font><font>transactions. These arrangements may not fall within the safe harbor of Section 28(e).</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>OTC issues, including most fixed-income securities such as corporate debt and U.S. Government securities, are normally </font><font>traded on a </font><font>“</font><font>net</font><font>”</font><font> basis without a stated commission, through dealers acting for their own account and not as brokers. The </font><font>Funds will primarily engage in transactions with these dealers or deal directly with the issuer unless a better price or
</font><font>execution could be obtained by using a broker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect to both foreign and domestic securities </font><font>will generally include a </font><font>“</font><font>spread,</font><font>”</font><font> which is the difference between the prices at which the dealer is willing to purchase and sell </font><font>the specific security at the time, and includes the dealer’s normal profit.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Under the 1940 Act, persons affiliated with a Fund and persons who are affiliated with such affiliated persons are prohibited </font><font>from dealing with the Fund as principal in the purchase and sale of securities unless a permissive order allowing such
</font><font>transactions is obtained from the SEC. Since transactions in the OTC market usually involve transactions with the dealers </font><font>acting as principal for their own accounts, the Funds will not deal with affiliated persons and affiliated persons of such
</font><font>affiliated persons in connection with such transactions. The Funds will not purchase securities during the existence of any </font><font>underwriting or selling group relating to such securities of which BFA, BRIL or any affiliated person (as defined in the 1940
</font><font>Act) thereof is a member except pursuant to procedures adopted by the Board in accordance with Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 </font><font>Act.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Purchases of
money market instruments by the Funds are made from dealers, underwriters and issuers. The Funds do not </font><font>currently expect to incur any brokerage commission expense on such
transactions because money market instruments are </font><font>generally traded on a </font><font>“</font><font>net</font><font>”</font><font> basis with dealers acting as principal for
their own accounts without a stated commission. The </font><font>price of the security, however, usually includes a profit to the dealer.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>BFA may, from time to time, effect trades on behalf of and for the account of the Funds with brokers or dealers that are </font><font>affiliated with BFA, in conformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under these provisions,
</font><font>any commissions paid to affiliated brokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by </font><font>other brokers or dealers in comparable transactions.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Securities purchased in underwritten offerings include a fixed amount of compensation to the
underwriter, generally referred </font><font>to as the underwriter’s concession or discount. When securities are purchased or sold directly from or to an issuer, no </font><font>commissions or discounts are paid.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Investment decisions for the Funds and for other investment accounts managed by BFA and the other Affiliates are made
</font><font>independently of each other in light of differing conditions. A variety of factors will be considered in making investment </font><font>allocations. These factors include: (i) investment objectives or strategies for particular accounts, including sector, industry, </font><font>country or region and capitalization weightings; (ii) tax considerations of an account; (iii) risk or investment concentration
</font><font>parameters for an account; (iv) supply or demand for a security at a given price level; (v) size of available investment; (vi) </font><font>cash availability and liquidity requirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory restrictions; (viii) minimum investment size of an
</font><font>account; (ix) relative size of account; and (x) such other factors as may be approved by BlackRock’s general counsel. </font><font>Moreover, investments may not be allocated to one client account over another based on any of the following considerations:
</font><font>(i) to favor one client account at the expense of another; (ii) to generate higher fees paid by one client account over another </font><font>or to produce greater performance compensation to BlackRock; (iii) to develop or enhance a relationship with a client or
</font><font>prospective client; (iv) to compensate a client for past services or benefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce future services </font><font>or benefits to be rendered to BlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize investment performance among different client
</font><font>accounts. BFA and the other Affiliates may deal, trade and invest for their own respective accounts in the types of securities </font><font>in which the Funds may invest.</font><font> </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Initial public offerings (</font><font>“</font><font>IPOs</font><font>”</font><font>) of securities may be over-subscribed and subsequently trade at a premium in the secondary </font><font>market. When BFA is given an
opportunity to invest in such an initial offering or </font><font>“</font><font>new</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>hot</font><font>”</font><font> issue, the supply of securities </font><font>available for client accounts is often less than the amount of securities the accounts would otherwise take. In order to
</font><font>allocate these investments fairly and equitably among client accounts over time, each portfolio manager or a member of his </font><font>or her respective investment team will indicate to BFA’s trading desk their level of interest in a particular offering with respect </font><font>to eligible clients’ accounts for which that team is responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities will be identified as eligible for </font><font>particular client accounts that are managed by portfolio teams who have indicated interest in the offering based on market
</font><font>capitalization of the issuer of the security and the investment mandate of the client account and in the case of international </font><font>equity securities, the country where the offering is taking place and the investment mandate of the client account. Generally,
</font><font>shares received during the IPO will be allocated among participating client accounts within each investment mandate on a </font><font>pro rata</font><font> basis. This
</font><font>pro rata</font><font> allocation may result in a Fund receiving less of a particular security than if
pro-rating had not </font><font>occurred. All allocations of securities will be subject, where relevant, to share minimums established for accounts and </font><font>compliance constraints. In situations where supply is too limited to be allocated among all accounts for which the
</font><font>investment is eligible, portfolio managers may rotate such investment opportunities among one or more accounts so long as </font><font>the rotation system provides for fair access for all client accounts over time. Other allocation methodologies that are
</font><font>considered by BFA to be fair and equitable to clients may be used as well.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>Because different accounts may have differing investment objectives and policies, BFA may buy and sell the same securities </font><font>at the same time for different clients based on the particular investment objective, guidelines and strategies of those
</font><font>accounts. For example, BFA may decide that it may be entirely appropriate for a growth fund to sell a security at the same </font><font>time a value fund is buying that security. To the extent that transactions on behalf of more than one client of BFA or the other </font><font>Affiliates during the same period increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold,
</font><font>there may be an adverse effect on price. For example, sales of a security by BlackRock on behalf of one or more of its clients </font><font>may decrease the market price of such security, adversely impacting other BlackRock clients that still hold the security. If
</font><font>purchases or sales of securities arise for consideration at or about the same time that would involve the Funds or other </font><font>clients or funds for which BFA or another Affiliate act as investment manager, transactions in such securities will be made,
</font><font>insofar as feasible, for the respective funds and clients in a manner deemed equitable to all.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>In certain instances, BFA may find it efficient for purposes of seeking to obtain best execution, to aggregate or </font><font>“</font><font>bunch</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>certain contemporaneous purchases or sale orders of its advisory accounts and advisory accounts of
affiliates. In general, all </font><font>contemporaneous trades for client accounts under management by the same portfolio manager or investment team will be </font><font>bunched in a single order if the trader believes the bunched trade would provide each client with an opportunity to achieve a
</font><font>more favorable execution at a potentially lower execution cost. The costs associated with a bunched order will be shared </font><font>pro </font><font>rata</font><font> among the
clients in the bunched order. Generally, if an order for a particular portfolio manager or management team is </font><font>filled at several different prices through multiple trades, all
accounts participating in the order will receive the average price </font><font>(except in the case of certain international markets where average pricing is not permitted). While in some cases
this practice </font><font>could have a detrimental effect upon the price or value of the security as far as the Funds are concerned, in other cases it </font><font>could be beneficial to the Funds. Transactions effected by BFA or the other Affiliates on behalf of more than one of its clients </font><font>during the same period may increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold,
</font><font>causing an adverse effect on price. The trader will give the bunched order to the broker-dealer that the trader has identified </font><font>as being able to provide the best execution of the order. Orders for purchase or sale of securities will be placed within a
</font><font>reasonable amount of time of the order receipt and bunched orders will be kept bunched only long enough to execute the </font><font>order.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The table
below sets forth the brokerage commissions paid by each Fund for the fiscal years noted. Any differences in </font><font>brokerage commissions paid by a Fund from year to year are</font><font> </font><font>principally due to increases or decreases in that Fund’s assets </font><font>over those periods</font><font> </font><font>or the
magnitude of changes to the components of a Fund's Underlying Index:</font></div> </div> <div><font> </font></div>

<div> <div><font>The Funds' purchase and sale orders for securities may be combined with those of other
investment companies, clients or </font><font>accounts that BlackRock manages or advises. If purchases or sales of portfolio securities of the Funds and one or more other </font><font>accounts managed or advised by BlackRock are considered at or about the same time, transactions in such securities are
</font><font>allocated among the Funds and the other accounts in a manner deemed equitable to all by BlackRock. In some cases, this </font><font>procedure could have a detrimental effect on the price or volume of the security as far as the Funds are concerned. However,
</font><font>in other cases, it is possible that the ability to participate in volume transactions and to negotiate lower transaction costs will </font><font>be beneficial to the Funds. BlackRock may deal, trade and invest for its own account in the types of securities in which the
</font><font>Funds may invest. BlackRock may, from time to time, effect trades on behalf of and for the account of the Funds with brokers </font><font>or dealers that are affiliated with BFA, in conformity with the 1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under these provisions, </font><font>any commissions paid to affiliated brokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by
</font><font>other brokers or dealers in comparable transactions. The Funds will not deal with affiliates in principal transactions unless </font><font>permitted by applicable SEC rules or regulations, or by SEC exemptive order.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Portfolio turnover may vary from year to year, as well as within a year.</font><font> </font><font>Certain Funds may use TBA transactions, which are </font><font>expected to cause a higher portfolio turnover rate and may cause
significant variation in portfolio turnover rate because TBA </font><font>positions are rolled every month. High turnover rates may result in comparatively greater brokerage expenses. While
each </font><font>Fund's portfolio turnover rates are generally expected to be low, the portfolio turnover rate for that portion of the iShares </font><font>Core 5-10 Year USD Bond ETF's, iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF's, iShares ESG Advanced Total USD Bond Market </font><font>ETF's,
iShares ESG Aware U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF's, iShares MBS ETF's and iShares USD Systematic Bond ETF's assets </font><font>invested through TBA transactions, if any, is expected to be
substantially higher because TBA positions are rolled every </font><font>month. Higher turnover rates would likely result in comparatively greater transaction costs.</font></div> </div>

the Trust</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Shares.</font><font>  </font><font>The Trust currently consists of more than 315 separate investment series or portfolios called
funds. The Trust issues </font><font>shares of beneficial interests in the funds with no par value. The Board may designate additional iShares funds.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Each share issued by a fund has a </font><font>pro rata</font><font> interest in the assets of that fund. Shares have no preemptive, exchange, </font><font>subscription or conversion rights and are freely
transferable. Each share is entitled to participate equally in dividends and </font><font>distributions declared by the Board with respect to the relevant fund, and in the net distributable
assets of such fund on </font><font>liquidation.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Each share has one vote with respect to matters
upon which the shareholder is entitled to vote. In any matter submitted to </font><font>shareholders for a vote, each fund shall hold a separate vote, provided that shareholders of all affected
funds will vote </font><font>together when: (i) required by the 1940 Act, or (ii) the Trustees determine that the matter affects the interests of more than </font><font>one fund.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Under Delaware
law, the Trust is not required to hold an annual meeting of shareholders unless required to do so under the </font><font>1940 Act. The policy of the Trust is not to hold an annual meeting of
shareholders unless required to do so under the 1940 </font><font>Act. All shares (regardless of the fund) have noncumulative voting rights in the election of members of the Board. Under
</font><font>Delaware law, Trustees of the Trust may be removed by vote of the shareholders.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Following the creation of the initial Creation Unit(s) of shares of a fund and immediately prior to the commencement of </font><font>trading in such fund’s shares, a holder of shares may be a </font><font>“</font><font>control person</font><font>”</font><font> of the fund, as defined in Rule
0-1 under the 1940 </font><font>Act. A fund cannot predict the length of time for which one or more shareholders may remain a control person of the fund.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Shareholders may make inquiries by writing to iShares Trust, c/o BlackRock Investments, LLC, 1 University Square Drive, </font><font>Princeton, NJ 08540.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Absent an applicable exemption or other relief from the SEC or its staff, beneficial owners of more than 5% of the shares of a
</font><font>fund may be subject to the reporting provisions of Section 13 of the 1934 Act and the SEC’s rules promulgated thereunder. In </font><font>addition, absent an applicable exemption or other relief from the SEC or its staff, officers and trustees of a fund and beneficial </font><font>owners of 10% of the shares of a fund
(</font><font>“</font><font>Insiders</font><font>”</font><font>) may be subject to the insider reporting, short-swing profit and short sale </font><font>provisions of Section 16 of the 1934 Act and
the SEC’s rules promulgated thereunder. Beneficial owners and Insiders should </font><font>consult with their own legal counsel concerning their obligations under Sections 13 and 16 of
the 1934 Act and existing </font><font>guidance provided by the SEC staff.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In accordance with the Trust's current Agreement and Declaration of Trust (the </font><font>“</font><font>Declaration of Trust</font><font>”</font><font>), the Board may, </font><font>without shareholder approval (unless such shareholder approval is required by the Declaration of Trust or applicable law,
</font><font>including the 1940 Act), authorize certain funds to merge, reorganize, consolidate, sell all or substantially all of their assets, or </font></div> </div>
<div><font>take other similar actions with, to or into another fund.</font><font>  </font><font>The Trust or a fund may be terminated by a majority vote of the </font><font>Board, subject to the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders of the Trust or such fund entitled to vote on
</font><font>termination; however, in certain circumstances described in the Declaration of Trust, only a majority vote of the Board is </font><font>required. Although the shares are not automatically redeemable upon the occurrence of any specific event, the Declaration of
</font><font>Trust provides that the Board will have the unrestricted power to alter the number of shares in a Creation Unit. Therefore, in </font><font>the event of a termination of the Trust or a fund, the Board, in its sole discretion, could determine to permit the shares to be </font><font>redeemable in aggregations smaller than Creation Units or to be individually redeemable. In such circumstance, the Trust or a
</font><font>fund may make redemptions in-kind, for cash or for a combination of cash or securities. Further, in the event of a termination </font><font>of the Trust or a fund, the Trust or a fund might elect to pay cash redemptions to all shareholders, with an in-kind election for </font><font>shareholders owning in excess of a certain stated minimum amount.</font></div> <div> <div><font>DTC as Securities Depository for Shares of the Funds. </font><font> </font><font>Shares of each Fund are represented by securities registered in the </font><font>name of DTC or its nominee and deposited with, or on
behalf of, DTC.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>DTC was created in 1973 to enable electronic movement of
securities between its participants (</font><font>“</font><font>DTC Participants</font><font>”</font><font>), and </font><font>NSCC was established in 1976 to provide a
single settlement system for securities clearing and to serve as central </font><font>counterparty for securities trades among DTC Participants. In 1999, DTC and NSCC were consolidated within
The Depository </font><font>Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (</font><font>“</font><font>DTCC</font><font>”</font><font>) and became wholly-owned subsidiaries of
DTCC. The common stock of DTCC is </font><font>owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and FINRA, through subsidiaries, hold preferred shares in DTCC that provide them </font><font>with the right to elect one member each to the DTCC board of directors. Access to the DTC system is available to entities,
</font><font>such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies, that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC </font><font>Participant, either directly or indirectly
(</font><font>“</font><font>Indirect
Participants</font><font>”</font><font>).</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Beneficial ownership of shares is limited to DTC Participants, Indirect Participants and persons holding interests through DTC </font><font>Participants and Indirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in shares (owners of such beneficial interests are
</font><font>referred to herein as </font><font>“</font><font>Beneficial
Owners</font><font>”</font><font>) is shown on, and the transfer of ownership is effected only through, records </font><font>maintained by DTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on the records of DTC Participants (with respect to Indirect
</font><font>Participants and Beneficial Owners that are not DTC Participants). Beneficial Owners will receive from or through the DTC </font><font>Participant a written confirmation relating to their purchase of shares. The laws of some jurisdictions may require that certain </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>purchasers of securities take physical delivery of
such securities in definitive form. Such laws may impair the ability of certain </font><font>investors to acquire beneficial interests in shares of the Fund.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>Conveyance of all notices, statements and other communications to Beneficial Owners is
effected as follows. Pursuant to the </font><font>Depositary Agreement between the Trust and DTC, DTC is required to make available to the Trust upon request and for a fee </font><font>to be charged to the Trust a listing of the shares of each Fund held by each DTC Participant. The Trust shall inquire of each
</font><font>such DTC Participant as to the number of Beneficial Owners holding shares, directly or indirectly, through such DTC </font><font>Participant. The Trust shall provide each such DTC Participant with copies of such notice, statement or other communication,
</font><font>in such form, number and at such place as such DTC Participant may reasonably request, in order that such notice,
</font><font>statement or communication may be transmitted by such DTC Participant, directly or indirectly, to such Beneficial Owners. In </font><font>addition, the Trust shall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair and reasonable amount as reimbursement for the expenses
</font><font>attendant to such transmittal, all subject to applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Share distributions shall be made to DTC or its nominee, Cede &amp; Co., as the registered holder of all shares of the Trust. DTC or </font><font>its nominee, upon receipt of any such distributions, shall credit immediately DTC Participants’ accounts with payments in </font><font>amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in shares of each Fund as shown on the records of DTC or its
</font><font>nominee. Payments by DTC Participants to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners of shares held through such DTC </font><font>Participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for the </font><font>accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in a </font><font>“</font><font>street name,</font><font>”</font><font> and will be the responsibility of
such DTC Participants.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Trust has no responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or notices to Beneficial Owners, or
</font><font>payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in such shares, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any </font><font>records relating to such beneficial ownership interests, or for any other aspect of the relationship between DTC and the DTC
</font><font>Participants or the relationship between such DTC Participants and the Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners owning </font><font>through such DTC Participants. DTC may decide to discontinue providing its service with respect to shares of the Trust at any
</font><font>time by giving reasonable notice to the Trust and discharging its responsibilities with respect thereto under applicable law. </font><font>Under such circumstances, the Trust shall take action to find a replacement for DTC to perform its functions at a comparable
</font><font>cost.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Distribution of Shares. </font><font> </font><font>In connection with each Fund's launch, each Fund was seeded through the sale of one or more </font><font>Creation Units by each Fund to
one or more initial investors. Initial investors participating in the seeding may be Authorized </font><font>Participants, a lead market maker or other third party investor or an affiliate of
each Fund or each Fund’s adviser. Each such </font><font>initial investor may sell some or all of the shares underlying the Creation Unit(s) held by them pursuant to the registration
</font><font>statement for each Fund (each, a
</font><font>“</font><font>Selling Shareholder</font><font>”</font><font>), which shares have been registered to permit the resale from time to </font><font>time after purchase. Each Fund will not receive any
of the proceeds from the resale by the Selling Shareholders of these </font><font>shares.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Selling Shareholders may sell shares owned by them directly or through broker-dealers, in accordance with applicable law, on </font><font>any national securities exchange on which the shares may be listed or quoted at the time of sale, through trading systems, in
</font><font>the OTC market or in transactions other than on these exchanges or systems at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the </font><font>time of the sale, at varying prices determined at the time of sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales may be effected through </font><font>brokerage transactions, privately negotiated trades, block sales, entry into options or other derivatives transactions or
</font><font>through any other means authorized by applicable law. Selling Shareholders may redeem the shares held in Creation Unit size </font><font>by them through an Authorized Participant.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Any Selling Shareholder and any broker-dealer or agents participating in the distribution of
shares may be deemed to be </font><font>“</font><font>underwriters</font><font>”</font><font> within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the 1933 Act, in connection with such sales.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Any Selling Shareholder and any other person participating in such distribution will be subject to applicable provisions of the </font><font>1934 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Creation and Redemption of Creation Units</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>General.</font><font>  </font><font>The

the Underlying Index. The Fund Deposit represents the minimum initial and </font><font>subsequent investment amount for a Creation Unit of any Fund. Such Fund Deposit is applicable, subject to
any adjustments </font><font>as described below, to purchases of Creation Units of shares of a given Fund until such time as the next-announced Fund </font><font>Deposit is made available.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>The </font><font>“</font><font>Cash

between the NAV per Creation Unit and the Deposit Amount. Payment of any stamp duty or other similar fees and </font><font>expenses payable upon transfer of beneficial ownership of the Deposit
Securities are the sole responsibility of the Authorized </font><font>Participant purchasing a Creation Unit.</font></div> </div>

or solely in-kind. The iShares </font><font>California Muni Bond ETF and iShares New York Muni Bond ETF generally offer Creation Units for cash, but may offer </font><font>Creation Units partially for cash or solely in-kind.

<div><font>The Trust may require the substitution of an amount of cash
(</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, a </font><font>“</font><font>cash in lieu</font><font>”</font><font> amount) to replace any Deposit
Security of </font><font>the Partial Cash Funds that is a TBA transaction or an interest in a mortgage pass-through security. The amount of cash </font><font>contributed will be equivalent to the price of the TBA transaction or mortgage pass-through security interest listed as a
</font><font>Deposit Security. A transaction fee may be charged on the cash amount contributed in lieu of the TBA transaction or </font><font>mortgage pass-through security.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Fund Deposit may also be modified to minimize the Cash Component by redistributing the cash to the Deposit Securities
</font><font>portion of the Fund Deposit through

towards a forward index rebalance to reflect revisions that account for </font><font>index additions, deletions, and re-weights.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The Trust may, in its sole discretion, substitute a </font><font>“</font><font>cash in lieu</font><font>”</font><font> amount to be added to the Cash
Component to replace any </font><font>Deposit Security in certain circumstances, including: (i) when instruments are not available in sufficient quantity for delivery; </font><font>(ii) when instruments are not eligible for transfer through DTC or the clearing process (as discussed below); (iii) when
</font><font>instruments that the Authorized Participant (or an investor on whose behalf the Authorized Participant is acting) are not able </font><font>to be traded due to a trading restriction; (iv) when delivery of the Deposit Security by the Authorized Participant (or by an
</font><font>investor on whose behalf the Authorized Participant is acting) would be restricted under applicable securities or other local </font><font>laws; (v) in connection with distribution payments to be made by a Fund; or (vi) in certain other situations.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Cash Purchase Method. </font><font> </font><font>Although the Trust does not generally permit partial or full cash purchases of Creation Units of its
</font><font>funds, when partial or full cash purchases of Creation Units are available or specified for a Fund (Creation Units of the Partial </font><font>Cash Funds are generally offered partially for cash and all or a substantial portion of the Deposit Securities of iShares
</font><font>California Muni Bond ETF, iShares National Muni Bond ETF, iShares New York Muni Bond ETF and iShares Short-Term
</font><font>National Muni Bond ETF may be substituted for cash), they will be effected in essentially the same manner as in-kind </font><font>purchases thereof. In the case of a partial or full cash purchase, the Authorized Participant must pay the cash equivalent of
</font><font>the Deposit Securities it would otherwise be required to provide through an in-kind purchase, plus the same Cash
</font><font>Component required to be paid by an in-kind purchaser.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Procedures for Creation of Creation Units.</font><font>  </font><font>To be eligible to place orders with the Distributor and to create a Creation Unit of </font><font>the Funds, an entity must be: (i) a
</font><font>“</font><font>Participating Party,</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>i.e</font><font>., a
broker-dealer or other participant in the clearing process </font><font>through the Continuous Net Settlement System of the NSCC (the </font><font>“</font><font>Clearing Process</font><font>”</font><font>), a clearing agency that is registered </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>with the SEC, or (ii) a DTC Participant, and must
have executed an agreement with the Distributor, with respect to creations </font><font>and redemptions of Creation Units
(</font><font>“</font><font>Authorized Participant
Agreement</font><font>”</font><font>) (discussed below). A member or participant of a </font><font>clearing agency registered with the SEC which has a written agreement with the Funds or one of their service providers that
</font><font>allows such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units is referred to as an </font><font>“</font><font>Authorized Participant.</font><font>”</font><font> All shares of the Funds, however created, will be entered on the records of DTC in the name of Cede </font><font>&amp; Co. for the
account of a DTC Participant.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Role of the Authorized
Participant.</font><font>  </font><font>Creation Units may be purchased only by or through a member or participant
of a </font><font>clearing agency registered with the SEC, which has a written agreement with the Funds or one of their service providers that </font><font>allows such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units. Such Authorized
</font><font>Participant will agree, pursuant to the terms of such Authorized Participant Agreement and on behalf of itself or any investor </font><font>on whose behalf it will act, to certain conditions, including that such Authorized Participant will make available in advance of </font><font>each purchase of shares an amount of cash sufficient to pay the Cash Component, once the NAV of a Creation Unit is next
</font><font>determined after receipt of the purchase order in proper form, together with the transaction fees described below. An </font><font>Authorized Participant, acting on behalf of an investor, may require the investor to enter into an agreement with such
</font><font>Authorized Participant with respect to certain matters, including payment of the Cash Component. Investors who are not </font><font>Authorized Participants must make appropriate arrangements with an Authorized Participant. Investors should be aware that
</font><font>their particular broker may not be a DTC Participant or may not have executed an Authorized Participant Agreement and that </font><font>orders to purchase Creation Units may have to be placed by the investor's broker through an Authorized Participant. As a
</font><font>result, purchase orders placed through an Authorized Participant may result in additional charges to such investor. The Trust </font><font>does not expect to enter into an Authorized Participant Agreement with more than a small number of DTC Participants. A list
</font><font>of current Authorized Participants may be obtained from the Distributor. The Distributor has adopted guidelines regarding </font><font>Authorized Participants’ transactions in Creation Units that are made available to all Authorized Participants. These guidelines </font><font>set forth the processes and standards for Authorized Participants to transact with the Distributor and its agents in connection </font><font>with creation and redemption transactions. In addition, the Distributor may be appointed as the proxy of the Authorized
</font><font>Participant and may be granted a power of attorney under its Authorized Participant Agreement.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Placement of Creation Orders.</font><font>  </font><font>Fund Deposits must be delivered through the Federal Reserve System (for cash and U.S. </font><font>government securities), through DTC
(for corporate and municipal securities) or through a central depository account, such </font><font>as with Euroclear or DTC, maintained by State Street or a sub-custodian (a </font><font>“</font><font>Central Depository Account</font><font>”</font><font>). Any portion of a </font><font>Fund Deposit that may not be delivered through the Fed or DTC must be delivered through a Central
Depository Account. </font><font>The Fund Deposit transfers made through DTC must be ordered by the DTC Participant in a timely fashion so as to ensure the </font><font>delivery of the requisite number of Deposit Securities through DTC to the account of the Funds generally before 3:00 p.m.,
</font><font>Eastern time on the Settlement Date. Fund Deposit transfers made through the Fed must be deposited by the participant </font><font>institution in a timely fashion so as to ensure the delivery of the requisite number or amount of Deposit Securities or cash
</font><font>through the Fed to the account of the Fund generally before 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. Fund Deposit </font><font>transfers made through a Central Depository Account must be completed pursuant to the requirements established by the
</font><font>custodian or sub-custodian for such Central Depository Account generally before 2:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement </font><font>Date. The </font><font>“</font><font>Settlement Date</font><font>”</font><font> for all funds is generally the second business day after the Transmittal Date. All questions as to </font><font>the number of Deposit Securities to be delivered, and the validity, form and eligibility (including time of receipt) for the
</font><font>deposit of any tendered securities, will be determined by the Trust, whose determination shall be final and binding. The </font><font>amount of cash equal to the Cash Component must be transferred directly to State Street through the Federal Reserve Bank
</font><font>wire transfer system in a timely manner so as to be received by State Street generally before 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the </font><font>Settlement Date. If the Cash Component and the Deposit Securities are not received by 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the
</font><font>Settlement Date, the creation order may be canceled. Upon written notice to the Distributor, such canceled order may be </font><font>resubmitted the following Business Day using a Fund Deposit as newly constituted to reflect the then current NAV of the
</font><font>Funds. The delivery of Creation Units so created generally will occur no later than the second Business Day following the day </font><font>on which the purchase order is deemed received by the Distributor, provided that the relevant Fund Deposit has been </font><font>received
by the Funds prior to such time.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Purchase Orders.</font><font>  </font><font> To initiate an order for a Creation Unit, an Authorized Participant must submit to the Distributor
or its </font><font>agent an irrevocable order to purchase shares of a Fund (except for the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF and iShares </font><font>Short Treasury Bond ETF), in proper form,</font><font> </font><font>generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day to receive that day’s </font><font>NAV. For the iShares 0-3 Month
Treasury Bond ETF and iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF, shares of a Fund are sold or </font><font>redeemed only in Creation Units at a price based on the Fund’s NAV next determined, on any
business day, of an order </font><font>tendered to, and received by, the Distributor or its agent in proper form. Generally, an order will be implemented as of the </font></div> </div> </div>

<div> <div><font>next determined NAV, as described in the handbook
for Authorized Participants. The Distributor or its agent will notify BFA </font><font>and the custodian of such order. The custodian will then provide such information to any appropriate
sub-custodian. </font><font>Procedures and requirements governing the delivery of the Fund Deposit are set forth in the procedures handbook for </font><font>Authorized Participants and may change from time to time. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for
</font><font>making arrangements for a creation request to be made through an Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its agent will </font><font>provide a list of current Authorized Participants upon request. Those placing orders to purchase Creation Units through an
</font><font>Authorized Participant should allow sufficient time to permit proper submission of the purchase order to the Distributor or its </font><font>agent by the Cutoff Time (as defined below) on such Business Day.</font><font> </font></div>
<div> <div><font>The Authorized Participant must also make available on or before the contractual settlement
date, by means satisfactory to </font><font>the Funds, immediately available or same day funds estimated by the Funds to be sufficient to pay the Cash Component next </font><font>determined after acceptance of the purchase order, together with the applicable purchase transaction fees. Those placing
</font><font>orders should ascertain the applicable deadline for cash transfers by contacting the operations department of the broker or </font><font>depositary institution effectuating the transfer of the Cash Component. This deadline is likely to be significantly earlier than </font><font>the Cutoff Time of the Funds. Investors should be aware that an Authorized Participant may require orders for purchases of
</font><font>shares placed with it to be in the particular form required by the individual Authorized Participant.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The Authorized Participant is responsible for any and all expenses and costs incurred by a
Fund, including any applicable cash </font><font>amounts, in connection with any purchase order.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Timing of Submission of Purchase Orders.</font><font>  </font><font>An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable order to purchase shares </font><font>of a Fund (except for the iShares 0-3 Month
Treasury Bond ETF and iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF) generally before 4:00 </font><font>p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day in order to receive that day's NAV. For the iShares 0-3 Month
Treasury Bond ETF and </font><font>iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF, shares of a Fund are sold or redeemed only in Creation Units at a price based on the Fund’s </font><font>NAV next determined, on any business day, of an order tendered to, and received by, the Distributor or its agent in proper
</font><font>form. Generally, an order will be implemented as of the next determined NAV, as described in the handbook for Authorized </font><font>Participants. Creation Orders must be transmitted by an Authorized Participant in the form required by the Funds to the
</font><font>Distributor or its agent pursuant to procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Economic or market </font><font>disruptions or changes, or telephone or other communication failure, may impede the ability to reach the Distributor or its
</font><font>agent or an Authorized Participant. Each Fund's deadline specified above for the submission of purchase orders is referred to </font><font>as that Fund's </font><font>“</font><font>Cutoff Time.</font><font>”</font><font> The Distributor or its agent, in their discretion, may permit the submission of such orders and </font><font>requests by or through an Authorized Participant at any time (including on days on which the Listing Exchange is not open
</font><font>for business) via communication through the facilities of the Distributor's or its agent's proprietary website maintained for </font><font>this purpose. Purchase orders and redemption requests, if accepted by the Trust, will be processed based on the NAV next
</font><font>determined after such acceptance in accordance with a Fund's Cutoff Times as provided in the Authorized Participant </font><font>Agreement and disclosed in this SAI.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Acceptance of Orders for Creation Units.</font><font>  </font><font> Subject to the conditions that (i) an irrevocable purchase order has been </font><font>submitted by the Authorized Participant (either
on its own or another investor's behalf) and (ii) arrangements satisfactory to </font><font>the Funds are in place for payment of the Cash Component and any other cash amounts which may be due,
the Funds will </font><font>accept the order, subject to each Fund's right (and the right of the Distributor and BFA) to reject any order until acceptance, </font><font>as set forth below.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Once a Fund has accepted an order, upon the next determination of the NAV of the shares, the Fund will confirm the </font><font>issuance of a Creation Unit, against receipt of payment, at such NAV. The Distributor or its agent will then transmit a
</font><font>confirmation of acceptance to the Authorized Participant that placed the order.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Each Fund reserves the right to reject or revoke a creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor or its agent provided that </font><font>a rejection or revocation of a creation order does not violate Rule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act. For example, a
</font><font>Fund may reject or revoke a creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor or its agent if (i) the order is not in proper form; </font><font>(ii) the investor(s), upon obtaining the shares ordered, would own 80% or more of the currently outstanding shares of the
</font><font>Fund; (iii) the Deposit Securities delivered do not conform to the identity and number of shares specified, as described above; </font><font>(iv) acceptance of the Deposit Securities is not legally required or would, in the opinion of counsel, be unlawful or have an
</font><font>adverse effect on the Fund or its shareholders (</font><font>e.g</font><font>., jeopardize the Fund's tax status); or (v) circumstances outside the control </font><font>of the Fund, the Distributor or its agent and
BFA make it impracticable to process purchase orders. The Distributor or its </font><font>agent shall notify a prospective purchaser of a Creation Unit and/or the Authorized Participant acting
on behalf of such </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>216</font></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>purchaser of its rejection of such order. The
Funds, State Street, the sub-custodian and the Distributor or its agent are under </font><font>no duty, however, to give notification of any defects or irregularities in the delivery of Fund
Deposits nor shall any of them </font><font>incur any liability for failure to give such notification.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>Issuance of a Creation Unit.</font><font>  </font><font> Except as provided herein, a Creation Unit will not be issued until the transfer of good title to </font><font>the applicable Fund of
the Deposit Securities and the payment of the Cash Component have been completed. When the sub-custodian</font><font> has confirmed to the custodian that the securities included in the Fund
Deposit (or the cash value thereof) have </font><font>been delivered to the account of the relevant sub-custodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor or its agent and BFA shall be </font><font>notified of such delivery and the applicable Fund will issue and cause the delivery of the Creation Unit. Creation Units are
</font><font>generally issued on a </font><font>“</font><font>T+2
basis</font><font>”</font><font>
(</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, two Business Days after trade date) (except for the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond
</font><font>ETF and iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF). For the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF and iShares Short Treasury Bond </font><font>ETF, Creation Units are generally issued on a
</font><font>“</font><font>T+1 basis</font><font>”</font><font> (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, one Business Day after trade
date). Each Fund reserves the right </font><font>to settle Creation Unit transactions on a different basis, including a shorter settlement period, if necessary or appropriate </font><font>under the circumstances and compliant with applicable law.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>To the extent contemplated by an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Distributor, each
Fund will issue Creation Units </font><font>to such Authorized Participant, notwithstanding the fact that the corresponding Fund Deposits have not been received in </font><font>part or in whole, in reliance on the undertaking of the Authorized Participant to deliver the missing Deposit Securities as soon </font><font>as possible, which undertaking shall be secured by such Authorized Participant's delivery and maintenance of collateral as set
</font><font>forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants. The Trust may use such collateral at any time to buy Deposit Securities for </font><font>the Funds. Such collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the contractual
</font><font>settlement date. Information concerning the Funds' current procedures for collateralization of missing Deposit Securities is </font><font>available from the Distributor or its agent. The Authorized Participant Agreement will permit the Funds to buy the missing
</font><font>Deposit Securities at any time and will subject the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the cost to the </font><font>Funds of purchasing such securities and the collateral including, without limitation, liability for related brokerage, borrowings </font><font>and other charges.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>In certain cases, Authorized Participants may create and redeem Creation Units on the same trade date and in these </font><font>instances, the Funds reserve the right to settle these transactions on a net basis or require a representation from the
</font><font>Authorized Participants that the creation and redemption transactions are for separate beneficial owners. All questions as to </font><font>the number of shares of each security in the Deposit Securities and the validity, form, eligibility and acceptance for deposit of </font><font>any securities to be delivered shall be determined by each Fund and the Fund's determination shall be final and binding.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Costs Associated with Creation Transactions.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>A standard creation transaction fee is imposed to offset the transfer and other transaction
costs associated with the issuance </font><font>of Creation Units. Under an ETF Services Agreement, the Funds have retained BRIL, an affiliate of BFA, to perform the ETF </font><font>Services. BRIL will receive from an Authorized Participant a standard transaction fee on each creation order, which consists of </font><font>(1) a fee for providing the ETF Services (the
</font><font>“</font><font>ETF Servicing Fee</font><font>”</font><font>) and (2) transfer, processing and other transaction costs </font><font>charged by a Fund custodian in connection with the issuance of
Creation Units for such creation order (</font><font>“</font><font>Custody Transaction </font><font>Costs</font><font>”</font><font>). BRIL is entitled to retain the ETF
Servicing Fee pursuant to the ETF Services Agreement, but BRIL will reimburse any </font><font>Custody Transaction Costs to the applicable Fund custodian according to the amounts invoiced by
such custodian.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The ETF Servicing Fee is a flat fee per order regardless
of the number of Creation Units being purchased, which amount will </font><font>vary among different Funds based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the order and the types of
securities or </font><font>instruments included in a Fund’s Creation Basket, among other variables. The actual Custody Transaction Costs vary per </font><font>order based on the number of trades, underlying markets and settlement locations associated with the issuance of a Creation
</font><font>Unit. The following table sets forth, for each Fund, an estimate of the creation transaction fee for a Creation Unit based on </font><font>data as of November 13, 2023 and December 1, 2023, respectively. The actual fee charged to an Authorized Participant in
</font><font>connection with a creation order will vary over time depending on the factors discussed above, and may be higher than the </font><font>fee set forth below. </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In order to defray transaction expenses for a Fund and protect against possible shareholder dilution, if a creation transaction </font><font>consists solely or partially of cash, the Authorized Participant may also be required to cover (up to the maximum amount
</font><font>shown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution and other costs and expenses related to the execution of </font><font>trades resulting from such transaction (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction
</font><font>costs based on historical data or other inputs, at BlackRock's discretion, and may include part or all of the spread between </font></div> </div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>the expected bid and offer side of the market and
anticipated market impact). However, a Fund is not obligated to trade </font><font>identical securities to the securities identified by BlackRock in estimating these transaction and other costs
and expenses. In </font><font>certain cases, BlackRock or an affiliate may determine in its discretion to deviate from the regular charge, subject to the </font><font>maximum amounts shown below. </font></div> <div> <div><font>For the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF and the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, in </font><font>order
to offset certain potential market impacts related to the use of custom baskets in the fixed income market and protect </font><font>against possible shareholder dilution, if a creation
transaction is executed solely or partially in-kind, the Authorized </font><font>Participant may be assessed a fee, payable to the Fund, which will be identical for each Creation Unit of the
applicable Fund </font><font>on the day of the transaction (up to the maximum amount shown below).

Creation Units. </font><font> </font><font>Shares of a Fund may be redeemed by Authorized Participants only in
Creation Units at their </font><font>NAV next determined after receipt of a redemption request in proper form by the Distributor or its agent and only on a </font><font>Business Day. The Funds will not redeem shares in amounts less than Creation Units. There can be no assurance, however, </font><font>that
there will be sufficient liquidity in the secondary market at any time to permit assembly of a Creation Unit. Investors </font><font>should expect to incur brokerage and other costs in
connection with assembling a sufficient number of shares</font><font> </font><font>to constitute a </font><font>Creation Unit that could be redeemed by an Authorized Participant. Beneficial owners also may sell shares in the secondary
</font><font>market.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Partial Cash Funds generally redeem Creation Units partially for cash. However, the Funds reserve the right to distribute
</font><font>securities and other portfolio instruments in-kind as payment for Creation Units being redeemed. Please see the </font><font>Cash </font><font>Redemption
Method</font><font> section below and the following discussion summarizing the in-kind method for further information on
</font><font>redeeming Creation Units of the Funds.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Each Fund publishes the designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be
</font><font>substituted) that will be applicable to redemption requests received in proper form (as defined below) on that day (</font><font>“</font><font>Fund </font><font>Securities</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>Redemption Basket</font><font>”</font><font>), and an amount of cash (the
</font><font>“</font><font>Cash Amount,</font><font>”</font><font> as described below) in order to effect </font><font>redemptions of Creation Units of a Fund. Such Fund Securities and Cash Amount will
remain in effect until such time as the </font><font>next announced composition of the Fund Securities and Cash Amount is made available. The Fund Securities and Cash </font><font>Amount are subject to possible amendment or correction. Fund Securities received on redemption may not be identical to
</font><font>Deposit Securities that are applicable to creations of Creation Units. Procedures and requirements governing redemption </font><font>transactions are set forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time to time.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Unless cash redemptions are available or specified for a Fund, the redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit generally consist </font><font>of Fund Securities, plus the Cash Amount, which is an amount equal to the difference between the NAV of the shares being
</font><font>redeemed, as next determined after the receipt of a redemption request in proper form, and the value of Fund Securities, less </font><font>a redemption transaction fee (as described below).</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The Trust may, in its sole discretion, substitute a </font><font>“</font><font>cash in lieu</font><font>”</font><font> amount to replace any Fund Security in certain circumstances, </font><font>including: (i) when the delivery of a Fund Security to the
Authorized Participant (or to an investor on whose behalf the </font><font>Authorized Participant is acting) would be restricted under applicable securities or other local laws or due to a
trading </font><font>restriction; (ii) when the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in the disposition of the Fund </font><font>Security by the Authorized Participant due to restrictions under applicable securities or other local laws; (iii) when the delivery </font><font>of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in unfavorable tax treatment; (iv) when a Fund Security cannot
</font><font>be settled or otherwise delivered in time to facilitate an in-kind redemption; or (v) in certain other situations. The amount of </font><font>cash paid out in such cases will be equivalent to the value of the substituted security listed as a Fund Security.
</font><font>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trust may, in its sole discretion, substitute a </font><font>“</font><font>cash in lieu</font><font>”</font><font> amount to replace any Fund </font><font>Security of the Partial Cash Funds that is a TBA transaction or mortgage pass-through security. In such cases, a transaction
</font><font>fee may be charged on the cash amount paid in lieu of the TBA transaction or mortgage pass through security. In the event </font><font>that the Fund Securities have a value greater than the NAV of the shares, a compensating cash payment equal to the
</font><font>difference is required to be made by or through an Authorized Participant by the redeeming shareholder. Each Fund generally </font><font>redeems Creation Units for Fund Securities (except for the Partial Cash Funds, which generally redeem Creation Units
</font><font>partially for cash), and the iShares California Muni Bond ETF, iShares National Muni Bond ETF, iShares New York Muni Bond </font><font>ETF and iShares Short-Term National Muni Bond ETF which may substitute all or a substantial portion of the Fund Securities
</font><font>for cash, but each Fund reserves the right to utilize a cash option for redemption of Creation Units. Each Fund may, in its sole </font><font>discretion, provide such redeeming Authorized Participant a portfolio of securities that differs from the exact composition of
</font><font>the Fund Securities, but does not differ in NAV. The Redemption Basket may also be modified to minimize the Cash
</font><font>Component by redistributing the cash to the Fund Securities portion of the Redemption Basket through systematically </font><font>rounding. The rounding methodology allows position sizes of securities in the Fund Securities to be </font><font>“</font><font>rounded up,</font><font>”</font><font> while </font><font>limiting the maximum allowed percentage change in weight and share quantity of any given security in the Redemption </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

position a fund towards a forward index rebalance to reflect revisions </font><font>that account for index additions, deletions, and re-weights.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>Cash Redemption Method.</font><font>  </font><font> Although the Trust does not generally permit full cash redemptions of Creation Units of its
</font><font>funds, when partial or full cash redemptions of Creation Units are available or specified
(</font><font>e.g.,</font><font> Creation Units of the Partial </font><font>Cash Funds are generally redeemed partially for cash and the iShares California Muni Bond ETF, iShares National Muni Bond
</font><font>ETF, iShares New York Muni Bond ETF and iShares Short-Term National Muni Bond ETF which may substitute cash for all or a </font><font>substantial portion of the Fund Securities for cash), they will be effected in essentially the same manner as in-kind
</font><font>redemptions thereof. In the case of partial or full cash redemption, the Authorized Participant receives the cash equivalent of </font><font>the Fund Securities and other instruments it would otherwise receive through an in-kind redemption, plus the same Cash
</font><font>Amount to be paid to an in-kind redeemer.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Costs Associated with Redemption Transactions.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>A standard redemption transaction fee is imposed to offset transfer and other transaction costs that may be incurred by the </font><font>relevant Fund. As described above, under an ETF Services Agreement, the Funds have retained BRIL, an affiliate of BFA, to
</font><font>perform certain ETF Services. BRIL will receive from an Authorized Participant a standard transaction fee on each redemption </font><font>order, which consists of (1) the ETF Servicing Fee and (2) Custody Transaction Costs. BRIL is entitled to retain the ETF
</font><font>Servicing Fee pursuant to the ETF Services Agreement, but BRIL will reimburse any Custody. Transaction Costs to the </font><font>applicable Fund custodian according to the amounts invoiced by such custodian.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The ETF Servicing Fee is a flat fee per order regardless of the number of Creation Units being redeemed, which amount will
</font><font>vary among different Funds based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the order and the types of securities or </font><font>instruments included in a Fund’s Redemption Basket, among other variables. The actual Custody Transaction Costs vary per
</font><font>order based on the number of trades, underlying markets, and settlement locations associated with the redemption of a </font><font>Creation Unit. The following table sets forth, for each Fund, an estimate of the redemption transaction fee for a Creation Unit </font><font>based on data as of November 13, 2023 and December 1, 2023, respectively. The actual fee charged to an Authorized
</font><font>Participant in connection with a redemption order will vary over time depending on the factors discussed above, and may be </font><font>higher than the fee set forth below. </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In order to defray transaction expenses for a Fund and protect against possible shareholder dilution, if a redemption
</font><font>transaction consists solely or partially of cash, the Authorized Participant may also be required to cover (up to the maximum </font><font>amount shown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution and other costs and expenses related to the
</font><font>execution of trades resulting from such transaction (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of </font><font>transaction costs based on historical data or other inputs, at BlackRock's discretion, and may include part or all of the spread </font><font>between the expected bid and offer side of the market and anticipated market impact). However, a Fund is not obligated to
</font><font>trade identical securities to the securities identified by BlackRock in estimating these transaction and other costs and </font><font>expenses. In certain cases, BlackRock or an affiliate may determine in its discretion to deviate from the regular charge,
</font><font>subject to the maximum amounts shown below. </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>For the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF and the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, in </font><font>order
to offset certain potential market impacts related to the use of custom baskets in the fixed income market and protect </font><font>against possible shareholder dilution, if a redemption
transaction is executed solely or partially in-kind, the Authorized </font><font>Participant may be assessed a fee, payable to the Fund, which will be identical for each Creation Unit of the
applicable Fund </font><font>on the day of the transaction (up to the maximum amount shown below). The fee is an estimate based on historical data </font><font>that is indicative of market impact.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Authorized Participants will also bear the costs of transferring the Fund Securities from a Fund to their account on their order. </font><font>Certain fees/costs associated with redemption transactions may be waived in certain circumstances. Investors who use the
</font><font>services of a broker or other financial intermediary to dispose of Fund shares may be charged a fee for such services.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The following table sets forth each Fund's estimated redemption transaction based on data as of November 13, 2023 and </font><font>December 1, 2023, respectively, and maximum additional charge (as described above):</font></div> </div> <div><font> </font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div><font>As a percentage of the net asset value per Creation Unit, inclusive of the standard redemption
transaction fee.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><font>Placement of Redemption Orders.</font><font>  </font><font>Redemption requests for Creation Units of the Funds must be submitted to the </font><font>Distributor or its agent by or through an
Authorized Participant. An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable </font><font>request to redeem shares of a Fund (except for the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF and iShares
Short Treasury Bond </font><font>ETF) generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day in order to receive that day's NAV. For the iShares 0-3 </font><font>Month Treasury Bond ETF and iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF, shares of a Fund are redeemed only in creation units at a </font><font>price
based on the Fund’s NAV next determined, on any business day, of an order tendered to, and received by, the Distributor </font><font>or its agent in proper form. Generally, an order will
be implemented as of the next determined NAV, as described in the </font><font>handbook for Authorized Participants. On days when the Listing Exchange closes earlier than normal, a Fund may
require </font><font>orders to redeem Creation Units to be placed earlier that day. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible </font><font>for making arrangements for a redemption request to be made through an Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its </font><font>agent
will provide a list of current Authorized Participants upon request.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The
Authorized Participant must transmit the request for redemption in the form required by the Funds to the Distributor or </font><font>its agent in accordance with procedures set forth in the
Authorized Participant Agreement. Investors should be aware that </font><font>their particular broker may not have executed an Authorized Participant Agreement and that, therefore, requests to

<div> <div><font>Creation Units may have to be placed by the
investor's broker through an Authorized Participant who has executed an </font><font>Authorized Participant Agreement. At any time, only a limited number of broker-dealers will have an
Authorized Participant </font><font>Agreement in effect. Investors making a redemption request should be aware that such request must be in the form specified </font><font>by such Authorized Participant. Investors making a request to redeem Creation Units should allow sufficient time to permit
</font><font>proper submission of the request by an Authorized Participant and transfer of the shares to the Funds' transfer agent; such </font><font>investors should allow for the additional time that may be required to effect redemptions through their banks, brokers or
</font><font>other financial intermediaries if such intermediaries are not Authorized Participants.</font><font>
</font></div> <div> <div><font>A redemption request is considered to be in </font><font>“</font><font>proper form</font><font>”</font><font> if: (i) an Authorized Participant has transferred or caused to be </font><font>transferred to the Funds' transfer agent the Creation
Unit redeemed through the book-entry system of DTC so as to be </font><font>effective by the Listing Exchange closing time on any Business Day on which the redemption request is submitted; (ii)
a </font><font>request in form satisfactory to the applicable Fund is received by the Distributor or its agent from the Authorized Participant </font><font>on behalf of itself or another redeeming investor within the time periods specified above; and (iii) all other procedures set
</font><font>forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement are properly followed.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Upon receiving a redemption request, the Distributor or its agent shall notify the applicable Fund and the Fund's transfer </font><font>agent of such redemption request. The tender of an investor's shares for redemption and the distribution of the securities
</font><font>and/or cash included in the redemption payment made in respect of Creation Units redeemed will be made through DTC and </font><font>the relevant Authorized Participant to the Beneficial Owner thereof as recorded on the book-entry system of DTC or the DTC
</font><font>Participant through which such investor holds, as the case may be, or by such other means specified by the Authorized </font><font>Participant submitting the redemption request.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>A redeeming Authorized Participant, whether on its own account or acting on behalf of a Beneficial Owner, must maintain
</font><font>appropriate security arrangements with a qualified broker-dealer, bank or other custody providers in each jurisdiction in </font><font>which any of the portfolio securities are customarily traded, to which account such portfolio securities will be delivered.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Deliveries of redemption proceeds by each Fund are generally made within two Business Days
(</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, </font><font>“</font><font>T+2</font><font>”</font><font>) (except for the </font><font>iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF and iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF). For the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF </font><font>and
iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF, for redemption orders tendered before 12:00 p.m., Eastern time, creation units are </font><font>generally settled on a </font><font>“</font><font>T+0 basis</font><font>”</font><font> (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, on trade date) and all other
redemption orders are generally settled on a </font><font>“</font><font>T+1 basis</font><font>”</font><font>. </font><font>Each Fund reserves the right to settle
redemption transactions on a different basis, if necessary or appropriate under the </font><font>circumstances and compliant with applicable law.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>If a Fund includes a foreign investment in its basket, and if a local market holiday, or
series of consecutive holidays, or the </font><font>extended delivery cycles for transferring foreign investments to redeeming Authorized Participants prevents timely delivery of </font><font>the foreign investment in response to a redemption request, a Fund may delay delivery of the foreign investment more than
</font><font>seven days if a Fund delivers the foreign investment as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 days. Delayed </font><font>settlement may occur due to a number of different reasons, including, without limitation, settlement cycles for the underlying
</font><font>securities, unscheduled market closings, an effort to link distribution to dividend record dates and ex-dates and newly </font><font>announced holidays. For example, the redemption settlement process may be extended because of the occurrence of a </font><font>holiday in
a non-U.S. market or in the U.S. bond market that is not a holiday observed in the U.S. equity market.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>To the extent contemplated by an Authorized Participant's agreement with the Distributor or
its agent, in the event an </font><font>Authorized Participant has submitted a redemption request in proper form but is unable to transfer all or part of the Creation </font><font>Unit to be redeemed to a Fund, at or prior to the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the Business Day after the date
</font><font>of submission of such redemption request, the Distributor or its agent will accept the redemption request in reliance on the </font><font>undertaking by the Authorized Participant to deliver the missing shares as soon as possible. Such undertaking shall be
</font><font>secured by the Authorized Participant's delivery and maintenance of collateral as set forth in the handbook for Authorized </font><font>Participants. Such collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the Business Day </font><font>after the date of submission of such redemption request and shall be held by State Street and marked-to-market daily. The
</font><font>fees of State Street and any sub-custodians in respect of the delivery, maintenance and redelivery of the collateral shall be </font><font>payable by the Authorized Participant. The Authorized Participant Agreement permits the Funds to acquire shares of the </font><font>Funds
at any time and subjects the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the aggregate of the cost to </font><font>the Funds of purchasing such shares, plus the value of the
Cash Amount, and the value of the collateral together with liability </font><font>for related brokerage and other charges.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Because the portfolio securities of a Fund may
trade on exchange(s) on days that the Listing Exchange is closed or are </font><font>otherwise not Business Days for such Fund, shareholders may not be able to redeem their shares of such Fund
or purchase </font><font>or sell shares of such Fund on the Listing Exchange on days when the NAV of such a Fund could be significantly affected by </font><font>events in the relevant non-U.S. markets. </font></div> <div> <div><font>Under normal circumstances, each of the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF and iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF may </font><font>postpone
and/or suspend redemption and payment beyond one business day only as follows: (i) for any period during which </font><font>there is a non-routine closure of the Fedwire or applicable Federal
Reserve Banks; (ii) for any period during which the Listing </font><font>Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday closings); (iii) for any period during which trading on the
</font><font>Listing Exchange is suspended or restricted; (iv) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which </font><font>disposal of the shares of the Fund’s portfolio securities or determination of its net asset value is not reasonably practicable; </font><font>(v) in such other circumstance as is permitted by the SEC; (vi) for any period during which the Fund, as part of a necessary
</font><font>liquidation of the Fund, has properly postponed and/or suspended redemption of shares and payment in accordance with </font><font>federal securities laws; or (vii) on the Fund’s ex-dividend dates. Any such suspension or postponement described above will </font><font>be consistent with the Fund’s obligations under Section 22(e)of the 1940 Act.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The right of redemption may be suspended or the date of payment postponed with respect to any
Fund (other than the </font><font>iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF and iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF): (i) for any period during which the Listing </font><font>Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday closings); (ii) for any period during which trading on the
</font><font>Listing Exchange is suspended or restricted; (iii) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which </font><font>disposal of the shares of the Fund's portfolio securities or determination of its NAV is not reasonably practicable; or (iv) in </font><font>such other circumstance as is permitted by the SEC.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Custom Baskets.</font><font>
 </font><font>Creation and Redemption baskets may differ and each Fund will accept </font><font>“</font><font>custom baskets.</font><font>”</font><font> A custom basket </font><font>may include any of the following: (i) a basket that is composed of a non-representative selection of a Fund's portfolio
</font><font>holdings; (ii) a representative basket that is different from the initial basket used in transactions on the same business day; or </font><font>(iii) a basket that contains bespoke cash substitutions for a single Authorized Participant. Each Fund has adopted policies and </font><font>procedures that govern the construction and acceptance of baskets, including heightened requirements for certain types of
</font><font>custom baskets. Such policies and procedures provide the parameters for the construction and acceptance of custom
</font><font>baskets that are in the best interests of a Fund and its shareholders, establish processes for revisions to, or deviations from, </font><font>such parameters, and specify the titles and roles of the employees of BFA who are required to review each custom basket for
</font><font>compliance with those parameters. In addition, when constructing custom baskets for redemptions, the tax efficiency of a </font><font>Fund may be taken into account. The policies and procedures distinguish among different types of custom baskets that may </font><font>be
used for each Fund and impose different requirements for different types of custom baskets in order to seek to mitigate </font><font>against potential risks of conflicts and/or overreaching by
an Authorized Participant. BlackRock has established a governance </font><font>process to oversee basket compliance for the Funds, as set forth in each Fund's policies and
procedures.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Taxation on Creations and Redemptions of
Creation Units.</font><font>  </font><font> An Authorized Participant generally will recognize either gain or
</font><font>loss upon the exchange of Deposit Securities for Creation Units. This gain or loss is calculated by taking the market value of </font><font>the Creation Units purchased over the Authorized Participant’s aggregate basis in the Deposit Securities exchanged therefor. </font><font>However, the IRS may apply the wash sales rules to determine that any loss realized upon the exchange of Deposit Securities
</font><font>for Creation Units is not currently deductible. Authorized Participants should consult their own tax advisors.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Current U.S. federal income tax laws dictate that capital gain or loss realized from the
redemption of Creation Units will </font><font>generally create long-term capital gain or loss if the Authorized Participant holds the Creation Units for more than one year, </font><font>or short-term capital gain or loss if the Creation Units were held for one year or less, if the Creation Units are held as capital </font><font>assets.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>Taxes</font></div>
<div> <div><font>The following is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations
regarding the purchase, ownership and </font><font>disposition of shares of a Fund. This summary does not address all of the potential U.S. federal income tax consequences </font><font>that may be applicable to a Fund or to all categories of investors, some of which may be subject to special tax rules. Current
</font><font>and prospective shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the specific federal, state, local and </font><font>non-U.S. tax consequences of investing in a Fund. The summary is based on the laws and judicial and administrative
</font><font>interpretations thereof in effect on the date of this SAI, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Regulated Investment Company Qualifications. </font><font> </font><font>Each Fund intends to continue to qualify for and to elect treatment as a </font><font>separate RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal
Revenue Code. To qualify for treatment as a RIC, each Fund must annually </font><font>distribute at least 90% of its investment company taxable income (which includes dividends, interest and
net short-term </font><font>capital gains) and meet several other requirements. Among such other requirements are the following: (i) at least 90% of </font><font>each Fund’s annual gross income must be derived from dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans, gains </font><font>from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities or non-U.S. currencies, other income (including, but not limited to,
</font><font>gains from options, futures or forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or </font><font>currencies, and net income derived from interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, partnerships that are traded </font><font>on an established securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than a
partnership that derives at least 90% of </font><font>its income from interest, dividends, capital gains and other traditionally permitted RIC income); and (ii) at the close of each </font><font>quarter of each Fund’s taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the market value of each Fund’s total assets must be represented by </font><font>cash and cash items, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs and other securities, with such other securities
</font><font>limited for purposes of this calculation in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of the </font><font>Fund’s assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (b) not more than 25% of the </font><font>value of the Fund’s total assets may be invested in the securities of any one issuer, of two or more issuers of which 20% or </font><font>more of the voting stock is held by the Fund and that are engaged in the same or similar trades or businesses or related
</font><font>trades or businesses (other than the securities of other RICs) or the securities of one or more qualified publicly-traded </font><font>partnerships.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>A
Fund may be able to cure a failure to derive at least 90% of its income from the sources specified above or a failure to </font><font>diversify its holdings in the manner described above by
paying a tax and/or by disposing of certain assets. If, in any taxable </font><font>year, a Fund fails one of these tests and does not timely cure the failure, that Fund will be taxed in the
same manner as an </font><font>ordinary corporation and distributions to its shareholders will not be deductible by that Fund in computing its taxable </font><font>income.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Although
in general the passive loss rules of the Internal Revenue Code do not apply to RICs, such rules do apply to a RIC </font><font>with respect to items attributable to an interest in a qualified
publicly-traded partnership. A Fund’s investments in </font><font>partnerships, including in qualified publicly-traded partnerships, may result in the Fund being subject to state, local,
or non-U.S.</font><font> income, franchise or withholding tax liabilities.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Taxation of RICs. </font><font> </font><font>As a RIC, a Fund will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of its taxable investment </font><font>income and capital
gains that it distributes to its shareholders, provided that it satisfies a minimum distribution requirement. </font><font>To satisfy the minimum distribution requirement, a Fund must
distribute to its shareholders at least the sum of (i) 90% of its </font><font>“</font><font>investment company taxable
income</font><font>”</font><font>
(</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, income other than its net realized long-term capital gain over its net realized
</font><font>short-term capital loss), plus or minus certain adjustments, and (ii) 90% of its net tax-exempt income for the taxable year. A </font><font>Fund will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates on any taxable income or gains that it does not distribute to its </font><font>shareholders. If a Fund fails to qualify for any taxable year as a RIC or fails to meet the distribution requirement, all of its </font><font>taxable income will be subject to tax at regular corporate income tax rates without any deduction for distributions to
</font><font>shareholders, and such distributions generally will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends to the extent of the </font><font>Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits. In such event, distributions to individuals should be eligible to be </font><font>treated as qualified dividend income and distributions to corporate shareholders generally should be eligible for the
</font><font>dividends-received deduction. Although each Fund intends to distribute substantially all of its net investment income and its </font><font>capital gains for each taxable year, a Fund may decide to retain a portion of its income or gains if the Fund determines that
</font><font>doing so is in the interest of its shareholders. Each Fund will be subject to U.S. federal income taxation to the extent any such </font></div> </div> </div>

a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC in any year, it must pay out its earnings and </font><font>profits accumulated in that year in order to qualify again as a RIC. If a Fund fails to qualify as a
RIC for a period greater than </font><font>two taxable years, the Fund may be required to recognize any net built-in gains with respect to certain of its assets (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the </font><font>excess of the aggregate
gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to </font><font>such assets if the Fund had been liquidated) if it qualifies as a RIC in a

</table> </div> <div> <div><font>Excise Tax. </font><font> </font><font>A Fund will be subject to a 4% excise tax on certain undistributed income if it does not distribute
to its </font><font>shareholders in each calendar year at least 98% of its ordinary income for the calendar year plus at least 98.2% of its capital </font><font>gain net income for the 12 months ended October 31 of such year. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital
</font><font>gain net income retained by a Fund that is subject to corporate income tax will be considered to have been distributed by </font><font>year-end. In addition, the minimum amounts that must be distributed in any year to avoid the excise tax will be increased or
</font><font>decreased to reflect any underdistribution or overdistribution, as the case may be, from the previous year. Each Fund intends </font><font>to declare and distribute dividends and distributions in the amounts and at the times necessary to avoid the application of
</font><font>this 4% excise tax.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Taxation of U.S. Shareholders. </font><font> </font><font>Dividends and other distributions by a Fund are generally treated under the Internal Revenue </font><font>Code as received by the shareholders at the time the dividend or distribution is made. However, any dividend or capital gain
</font><font>distribution declared by a Fund in October, November or December of any calendar year and payable to shareholders of </font><font>record on a specified date in such a month shall be deemed to have been received by each shareholder on December 31 of </font><font>such
calendar year and to have been paid by the Fund not later than such December 31, provided such dividend is actually </font><font>paid by the Fund during January of the following calendar
year.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Each Fund intends to distribute annually to its shareholders
substantially all of its net tax-exempt income, investment </font><font>company taxable income and any net realized long-term capital gains in excess of net realized short-term capital losses
</font><font>(including any capital loss carryovers). However, if a Fund retains for investment an amount equal to all or a portion of its net </font><font>long-term capital gains in excess of its net short-term capital losses (including any capital loss carryovers), it will be subject </font><font>to a corporate tax (at a flat rate of 21%) on the amount retained. In that event, the Fund will report such retained amounts as </font><font>undistributed capital gains in a notice to its shareholders who (a) will be required to include in income for U.S. federal income </font><font>tax purposes, as long-term capital gains, their proportionate shares of the undistributed amount, (b) will be entitled to credit </font><font>their proportionate shares of the tax paid by the Fund on the undistributed amount against their U.S. federal income tax
</font><font>liabilities, if any, and to claim refunds to the extent their credits exceed their liabilities, if any, and (c) will be entitled to </font><font>increase their tax basis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in their shares by an amount equal to the excess of the amount
</font><font>in clause (a) over the amount in clause (b). Organizations or persons not subject to U.S. federal income tax on such capital </font><font>gains will be entitled to a refund of their </font><font>pro rata</font><font> share of such taxes paid by the Fund upon filing appropriate returns or </font><font>claims for refund with the IRS.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Distributions of net realized long-term capital gains, if any, that a Fund reports as capital
gain dividends are taxable as long-term</font><font> capital gains, whether paid in cash or in shares and regardless of how long a shareholder has held shares of the Fund. </font><font>All other dividends of a Fund (including dividends from short-term capital gains) from its current and accumulated earnings
</font><font>and profits (</font><font>“</font><font>regular
dividends</font><font>”</font><font>) are generally subject to tax as ordinary income. Long-term capital gains are eligible for
</font><font>taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds </font><font>certain threshold amounts.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>If an individual receives a regular dividend qualifying for the long-term capital gain rates
and such dividend constitutes an </font><font>“</font><font>extraordinary dividend,</font><font>”</font><font> and the individual subsequently recognizes a loss on the sale or exchange of stock in respect of </font></div>

<div> <div><font>which the extraordinary dividend was paid, then
the loss will be long-term capital loss to the extent of such extraordinary </font><font>dividend. An </font><font>“</font><font>extraordinary dividend</font><font>”</font><font> on common stock for this
purpose is generally a dividend (i) in an amount greater than </font><font>or equal to 10% of the taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share of stock, aggregating dividends with
ex-dividend </font><font>dates within an 85-day period, or (ii) in an amount greater than 20% of the taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share </font><font>of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates within a 365-day period.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Distributions in excess of a Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits will, as to each shareholder, be treated as a </font><font>tax-free return of capital to the extent of a shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund, and as a capital gain thereafter (if the </font><font>shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets). Distributions in excess of a Fund’s minimum distribution
</font><font>requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute </font><font>nontaxable returns of capital. The Fund's capital loss carryovers, if any, carried from taxable years beginning before 2011 do
</font><font>not reduce current earnings and profits, even if such carryforwards offset current year realized gains. Shareholders receiving </font><font>dividends or distributions in the form of additional shares should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as receiving </font><font>a distribution in an amount equal to the amount of money that the shareholders receiving cash dividends or distributions will
</font><font>receive and should have a cost basis in the shares received equal to such amount. No deduction would be allowed to an </font><font>investor for interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry shares of the Fund to the extent the interest
</font><font>deduction would relate to exempt-interest dividends received.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>A 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on net investment income, including, but not limited to, interest,
</font><font>dividends, and net gain from investments, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and </font><font>filing jointly), and of estates and trusts.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Investors considering buying shares just prior to a dividend or capital gain distribution should be aware that, although the
</font><font>price of shares purchased at that time may reflect the amount of the forthcoming distribution, such dividend or distribution </font><font>may nevertheless be taxable to them. If a Fund is the holder of record of any security on the record date for any dividends
</font><font>payable with respect to such security, such dividends will be included in the Fund’s gross income not as of the date received </font><font>but as of the later of (i) the date such security became ex-dividend with respect to such dividends
(</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the date on which a
</font><font>buyer of the security would not be entitled to receive the declared, but unpaid, dividends); or (ii) the date the Fund acquired </font><font>such security. Accordingly, in order to satisfy its income distribution requirements, a Fund may be required to pay dividends
</font><font>based on anticipated earnings, and shareholders may receive dividends in an earlier year than would otherwise be the case.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>In certain situations, a Fund may, for a taxable year, defer all or a portion of its net
capital loss (or if there is no net capital </font><font>loss, then any net long-term or short-term capital loss) realized after October and its late-year ordinary loss (defined as the </font><font>sum of the excess of post-October foreign currency and passive foreign investment company (</font><font>“</font><font>PFIC</font><font>”</font><font>) losses over post-October</font><font> foreign currency and PFIC gains, plus the excess of post-December ordinary losses over post-December ordinary </font><font>income) until
the next taxable year in computing its investment company taxable income and net capital gain, which will </font><font>defer the recognition of such realized losses. Such deferrals and other
rules regarding gains and losses realized after October </font><font>(or December) may affect the tax character of shareholder distributions.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Sales of Shares.</font><font>
 </font><font>Upon the sale or exchange of shares of a Fund, a shareholder will realize a taxable gain or loss equal to the </font><font>difference between the amount realized and the shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund. A redemption of shares by a Fund </font><font>will be treated as a sale for this purpose. Such gain or loss will be treated as capital gain or loss if the shares are capital assets </font><font>in the shareholder’s hands and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the shares are held for more than one year and short-term</font><font> capital gain or loss if the shares are held for one year or less. Any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed
</font><font>to the extent the shares disposed of are replaced, including replacement through the reinvesting of dividends or capital gains </font><font>distributions, or by an option, or contract to acquire substantially identical shares, within a 61-day period beginning 30 days </font><font>before and ending 30 days after the disposition of the shares. In such a case, the basis of the shares acquired will be
</font><font>increased to reflect the disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a shareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by the shareholder </font><font>for six months or less will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any
</font><font>distributions or deemed distributions of long-term capital gains received by the shareholder with respect to such share. The </font><font>Medicare contribution tax described above will apply to the sale of Fund shares.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>If a shareholder incurs a sales charge in acquiring shares of a Fund, disposes of those shares within 90 days and then, on or </font><font>before January 31 of the following calendar year, acquires shares in a mutual fund for which the otherwise applicable sales
</font><font>charge is reduced by reason of a reinvestment right (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, an exchange privilege), the original sales charge will not be taken </font><font>into account in computing gain/loss on the original
shares to the extent the subsequent sales charge is reduced. Instead, the </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>disregarded portion of the original sales charge
will be added to the tax basis of the newly acquired shares. Furthermore, the </font><font>same rule also applies to a disposition of the newly acquired shares made within 90 days of the second
acquisition. This </font><font>provision prevents a shareholder from immediately deducting the sales charge by shifting his or her investment within a </font><font>family of mutual funds.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Backup Withholding. </font><font> </font><font>In certain cases, a Fund will be required to withhold at a 24% rate and remit to the U.S. Treasury such </font><font>amounts withheld
from any distributions paid to a shareholder who: (i) has failed to provide a correct taxpayer identification </font><font>number; (ii) is subject to backup withholding by the IRS; (iii) has
failed to certify to a Fund that such shareholder is not </font><font>subject to backup withholding; or (iv) has not certified that such shareholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident
alien). </font><font>Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amount withheld may be credited against a shareholder's U.S. federal </font><font>income tax liability.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Sections 351 and 362. </font><font> </font><font>The Trust, on behalf of each Fund, has the right to reject an order for a purchase of shares of the </font><font>Fund if the purchaser
(or group of purchasers) would, upon obtaining the shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the </font><font>outstanding shares of a given Fund and if, pursuant to Sections 351 and 362 of the
Internal Revenue Code, that Fund would </font><font>have a basis in the securities different from the market value of such securities on the date of deposit. If a Fund’s basis in </font><font>such securities on the date of deposit was less than market value on such date, the Fund, upon disposition of the securities,
</font><font>would recognize more taxable gain or less taxable loss than if its basis in the securities had been equal to market value. It is </font><font>not anticipated that the Trust will exercise the right of rejection except in a case where the Trust determines that accepting
</font><font>the order could result in material adverse tax consequences to a Fund or its shareholders. The Trust also has the right to </font><font>require information necessary to determine beneficial share ownership for purposes of the 80% determination.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Tax-Exempt Interest Income.</font><font>  </font><font>Dividends paid by the Municipal Bond Funds that are properly reported as exempt-interest </font><font>dividends will not be subject to
regular federal income tax. Each Municipal Bond Fund intends to invest its assets in a manner </font><font>such that dividend distributions to its shareholders will generally be exempt from
U.S. federal income taxation. Dividends paid </font><font>by the Fund will be exempt from federal income tax (though not necessarily exempt from state and local taxation) to the </font><font>extent of the Fund’s tax-exempt interest income as long as 50% or more of the value of the Fund’s assets at the end of each </font><font>quarter is invested in state, municipal and other bonds that are excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes
</font><font>and as long as the Fund properly reports such dividends as exempt-interest dividends.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>So long as, at the close of each quarter of the taxable year of the California Fund, at least 50% of the value of the California </font><font>Fund’s total assets consists of obligations of the U.S. and of the State of California and its political subdivisions, the interest </font><font>on which is exempt from California personal income tax and California corporate income tax (</font><font>“</font><font>CA-exempt Obligations</font><font>”</font><font>), </font><font>exempt-interest dividends (i) paid by the California Fund in an amount not exceeding the interest received on such CA-exempt</font><font>
Obligations during the California Fund’s taxable year, and (ii) reported by the California Fund as exempt-interest </font><font>dividends (in a written notice mailed to the California
Fund’s shareholders) will be treated as an item of interest excludable </font><font>from income for California personal income tax purposes and corporate income tax purposes.
Exempt-interest dividends </font><font>paid to a corporate shareholder subject to California corporate franchise tax, however, will be taxable as ordinary income for </font><font>purposes of such tax. Distributions derived from interest on tax-exempt obligations issued by governmental authorities in
</font><font>states other than California or on other obligations or investments the interest on which is not exempt from California </font><font>personal income tax or corporate income tax, and distributions to shareholders derived from short-term or long-term capital
</font><font>gains, will be taxed as ordinary income for California personal and corporate income tax purposes and California corporate </font><font>franchise tax purposes. Interest on indebtedness incurred or continued by a shareholder of the California Fund to purchase or
</font><font>carry shares of the California Fund generally will not be deductible for California personal or corporate income tax purposes. </font><font>It should be noted that California law deviates from the provisions of Subchapter M of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Internal
</font><font>Revenue Code, relating to regulated investment companies in certain potentially material respects.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The foregoing is a general, abbreviated summary of certain of the provisions of California
law presently in effect that govern </font><font>the taxation of the shareholders of the California Fund. These provisions are subject to change by legislative or administrative </font><font>action, and any such change may be retroactive. Shareholders are advised to consult with their own tax advisors for more
</font><font>detailed information concerning California tax matters.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Individual shareholders of the iShares New York Muni Bond ETF will not be required to include in their gross income for New
</font><font>York State and City purposes any portion of distributions received from the Fund that are directly attributable to (i) interest </font><font>earned on tax-exempt obligations issued by New York State or any political subdivision thereof (including New York City) or
</font><font>(ii) interest earned on obligations of U.S. possessions or territories that is exempt from state taxation pursuant to federal law, </font></div> </div> </div>

<div> <div><font>provided that the Fund qualifies as a RIC and
satisfies the requirement that at least 50% of its assets at the close of each </font><font>quarter of its taxable year constitute such obligations. Distributions from the Fund that are
attributable to sources other than </font><font>those described in the preceding sentence (including interest on obligations of other states and their political subdivisions) </font><font>will generally be taxable to individual shareholders as ordinary income.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Shareholders of the iShares New York Muni Bond ETF that are subject to New York State corporation franchise tax or New </font><font>York
City general corporation tax will be required to include exempt-interest dividends paid by the Fund in their </font><font>“</font><font>entire net </font><font>income</font><font>”</font><font> for purposes of such taxes and will be required to include their shares of the Fund in their investment capital for
</font><font>purposes of such taxes. If a shareholder is subject to unincorporated business taxation by New York City, income and gains </font><font>distributed by the Fund will be subject to such taxation except to the extent such distributions are directly attributable to
</font><font>interest earned on tax-exempt obligations issued by New York State or any political subdivision thereof (including New York </font><font>City). However, shareholders of the Fund will not be subject to the unincorporated business tax imposed by New York City
</font><font>solely by reason of their ownership of shares in the Fund. Shares of the iShares New York Muni Bond ETF will not be subject </font><font>to property taxes imposed by New York State or City.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Interest on indebtedness incurred by shareholders to purchase or carry shares of New York Municipal Income generally will
</font><font>not be deductible for New York State personal income tax purposes.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Interest income on the Fund that is distributed to its shareholders will generally not be taxable to the Fund for purposes of </font><font>New York State corporation franchise tax or New York City general corporation tax.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The foregoing is a general, abbreviated summary of certain of the provisions of the tax laws of New York State and City </font><font>presently in effect as they directly govern the taxation of shareholders of the Fund. These provisions are subject to change by </font><font>legislative or administrative action, and any such change may be retroactive with respect to New York Municipal Income
</font><font>transactions. Shareholders are advised to consult with their own tax advisers for more detailed information concerning New </font><font>York State and City matters.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Taxation of Certain Derivatives.</font><font>  </font><font>A Fund’s transactions in zero coupon securities, non-U.S. currencies, forward contracts, </font><font>options and futures contracts
(including options and futures contracts on non-U.S. currencies), to the extent permitted, will </font><font>be subject to special provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (including provisions
relating to </font><font>“</font><font>hedging
transactions</font><font>”</font><font> and </font><font>“</font><font>straddles</font><font>”</font><font>) that, among other consequences, may
affect the character of gains and losses realized by the Fund (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, may </font><font>affect whether gains or losses are ordinary or capital), accelerate recognition of income to the Fund and defer Fund losses.
</font><font>These rules could therefore affect the character, amount and timing of distributions to shareholders. These provisions also </font><font>(a) will require the Fund to mark-to-market certain types of the positions in its portfolio (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, treat them as if they were closed </font><font>out at the end of each year) and (b) may cause the Fund to recognize income without
receiving cash with which to pay </font><font>dividends or make distributions in amounts necessary to satisfy the distribution requirements for avoiding income and excise </font><font>taxes. Each Fund will monitor its transactions, will make the appropriate tax elections and will make the appropriate entries in </font><font>its books and records when it acquires any zero coupon security, non-U.S. currency, forward contract, option, futures
</font><font>contract or hedged investment in order to mitigate the effect of these rules and prevent disqualification of the Fund as a RIC. </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>A Fund’s investments in so-called </font><font>“</font><font>section 1256 contracts,</font><font>”</font><font> such as regulated futures contracts, most non-U.S. currency </font><font>forward contracts traded in the interbank market and options on
most security indexes, are subject to special tax rules. All </font><font>section 1256 contracts held by the Fund at the end of its taxable year are required to be marked to their market value,
and </font><font>any unrealized gain or loss on those positions will be included in the Fund’s income as if each position had been sold for its </font><font>fair market value at the end of the taxable year. The resulting gain or loss will be combined with any gain or loss realized by </font><font>the Fund from positions in section 1256 contracts closed during the taxable year. Provided such positions were held as
</font><font>capital assets and were not part of a
</font><font>“</font><font>hedging transaction</font><font>”</font><font> nor part of a </font><font>“</font><font>straddle,</font><font>”</font><font> 60% of the resulting net gain or loss will </font><font>be
treated as long-term capital gain or loss, and 40% of such net gain or loss will be treated as short-term capital gain or </font><font>loss, regardless of the period of time the positions were
actually held by the Fund.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>As a result of entering into swap contracts, a
Fund may make or receive periodic net payments. A Fund may also make or </font><font>receive a payment when a swap is terminated prior to maturity through an assignment of the swap or other
closing </font><font>transaction. Periodic net payments will generally constitute ordinary income or deductions, while termination of a swap will </font><font>generally result in capital gain or loss (which will be a long-term capital gain or loss if the Fund has been a party to the swap </font><font>for more than one year). The cost of any payments made by the Fund on a swap transaction will be netted
</font><font>pro rata</font><font> against </font><font>both
tax exempt and taxable gross income. With respect to certain types of swaps, a Fund may be required to currently </font><font>recognize income or loss with respect to future payments on such
swaps or may elect under certain circumstances to mark </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>such swaps to market annually for tax purposes as
ordinary income or loss. Periodic net payments that would otherwise </font><font>constitute ordinary deductions but are allocable under the Internal Revenue Code to exempt-interest dividends
will not be </font><font>allowed as deductions but instead will reduce net tax-exempt income.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>Market Discount. </font><font> </font><font>Any market discount recognized on a bond is taxable as ordinary income. A market discount bond is a </font><font>bond acquired in the
secondary market at a price below redemption value or adjusted issue price if issued with original issue </font><font>discount (</font><font>“</font><font>OID</font><font>”</font><font>). To the extent a Fund does not include the market discount in income as it accrues, gain on the Fund’s </font><font>disposition
of such an obligation will be treated as ordinary income rather than capital gain to the extent of the accrued </font><font>market discount.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Non-U.S. Investments.</font><font>  </font><font>Income (including, in some cases, capital gains) received by certain of the Funds from investments
in </font><font>non-U.S. securities may be subject to withholding and other taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between </font><font>certain countries and the U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes in some cases. If more than 50% of a Fund’s total assets at </font><font>the close of its taxable year consists of securities of non-U.S. corporations, the Fund may elect for U.S. income tax purposes
</font><font>to treat non-U.S. income taxes paid by it as paid by its shareholders. A Fund may qualify for and make this election in some, </font><font>but not necessarily all, of its taxable years. If a Fund were to make an election, shareholders of the Fund would be required to </font><font>take into account an amount equal to their pro rata portions of such non-U.S. taxes in computing their taxable income and
</font><font>then treat an amount equal to those non-U.S. taxes as a U.S. federal income tax deduction or as a foreign tax credit against </font><font>their U.S. federal income taxes. Shortly after any year for which it makes such an election, a Fund will report to its
</font><font>shareholders the amount per share of such non-U.S. income tax that must be included in each shareholder’s gross income </font><font>and the amount which will be available for the deduction or credit. No deduction for non-U.S. taxes may be claimed by a
</font><font>shareholder who does not itemize deductions. Certain limitations will be imposed on the extent to which the credit (but not </font><font>the deduction) for non-U.S. taxes may be claimed.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Under Section 988 of the Internal Revenue Code, gains or losses attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the
</font><font>time a Fund accrues income or receivables or expenses or other liabilities denominated in a non-U.S. currency and the time a </font><font>Fund actually collects such income or pays such liabilities are generally treated as ordinary income or ordinary loss. In
</font><font>general, gains (and losses) realized on debt instruments will be treated as Section 988 gain (or loss) to the extent attributable </font><font>to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which the instruments are denominated. Similarly,
</font><font>gain or losses on non-U.S. currency, non-U.S. currency forward contracts, certain non-U.S. currency options or futures </font><font>contracts and the disposition of debt securities denominated in non-U.S. currency, to the extent attributable to fluctuations in </font><font>exchange rates between the acquisition and disposition dates, are also treated as ordinary income or loss unless the Fund
</font><font>were to elect otherwise.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Original Issue Discount. </font><font> </font><font>OID on tax-exempt bonds is recognized over the term of the bond and is tax-exempt to the holder </font><font>of the bond. STRIPS are
treated as newly issued debt instruments having OID. Special U.S. federal income tax rules apply to </font><font>inflation-indexed bonds. Generally, all stated interest on such bonds is taken
into income by a Fund under its regular method </font><font>of accounting for interest income. The amount of a positive inflation adjustment, which results in an increase in the
inflation-adjusted</font><font> principal amount of the bond, is treated as OID. The OID is included in a Fund’s gross income ratably during the </font><font>period ending with the maturity of the bond, under the general OID inclusion rules. The amount of a Fund’s OID in a taxable </font><font>year with respect to a bond will increase a Fund’s taxable income for such year without a corresponding receipt of cash, until </font><font>the bond matures. As a result, a Fund may need to use other sources of cash to satisfy its distributions for such year. The
</font><font>amount of negative inflation adjustment, which results in a decrease in the inflation-adjusted principal amount of the bond, </font><font>reduces the amount of interest (including stated, interest, OID, and market discount, if any) otherwise includible in a Fund’s </font><font>income with respect to the bond for the taxable year.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Reporting.</font><font>  </font><font>If
a shareholder recognizes a loss with respect to a Fund’s shares of $2 million or more for an individual </font><font>shareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate shareholder, the
shareholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement </font><font>on IRS Form 8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases exempted from this reporting requirement,
</font><font>but under current guidance, shareholders of a RIC are not exempted. The fact that a loss is reportable under these </font><font>regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer’s treatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders </font><font>should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual circumstances.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Other Taxes. </font><font> </font><font>Dividends, distributions and redemption proceeds may also be subject to additional state, local and
non-U.S. </font><font>taxes depending on each shareholder’s particular situation.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Taxation of Non-U.S.
Shareholders. </font><font> </font><font>Dividends paid by a Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are generally subject
to withholding </font><font>tax at a 30% rate or a reduced rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty to the extent derived from investment income </font><font>and short-term capital gains. Dividends paid by a Fund from net tax-exempt income or long-term capital gains are generally
</font><font>not subject to such withholding tax. In order to obtain a reduced rate of withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder will be required </font><font>to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying its entitlement to benefits under a treaty. The withholding
</font><font>tax does not apply to regular dividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who provides an IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that the </font><font>dividends are effectively connected with the non-U.S. shareholder’s conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. Instead, </font><font>the effectively connected dividends will be subject to regular U.S. income tax as if the non-U.S. shareholder were a U.S.
</font><font>shareholder. A non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively connected dividends may also be subject to additional
</font><font>“</font><font>branch </font><font>profits tax</font><font>”</font><font> imposed at a rate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S. shareholder who fails to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN,
</font><font>IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable form may be subject to backup withholding at the appropriate rate.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>Properly-reported dividends are generally exempt from U.S. federal withholding tax where they
(i) are paid in respect of a </font><font>Fund’s </font><font>“</font><font>qualified net interest income</font><font>”</font><font> (generally, a
Fund’s U.S. source interest income, other than certain contingent interest </font><font>and interest from obligations of a corporation or partnership in which a Fund is at least a 10%
shareholder or partner, </font><font>reduced by expenses that are allocable to such income); or (ii) are paid in respect of a Fund’s </font><font>“</font><font>qualified short-term capital </font><font>gains</font><font>”</font><font> (generally, the excess of a Fund’s net short-term capital gain over a Fund’s long-term capital loss for
such taxable </font><font>year). However, depending on its circumstances, a Fund may report all, some or none of its potentially eligible dividends as </font><font>such qualified net interest income or as qualified short-term capital gains and/or treat such dividends, in whole or in part, as </font><font>ineligible for this exemption from withholding. In order to qualify for this exemption from withholding, a non-U.S.
</font><font>shareholder will need to comply with applicable certification requirements relating to its non-U.S. status (including, in </font><font>general, furnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or substitute Form). In the case of shares held through an
</font><font>intermediary, the intermediary may withhold even if a Fund reports the payment as qualified net interest income or qualified </font><font>short-term capital gain. Non-U.S. shareholders should contact their intermediaries with respect to the application of these
</font><font>rules to their accounts.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Special rules may apply to a foreign shareholder receiving a Fund distribution if at least 50% of the Fund's assets consist of
</font><font>interests in U.S. real property interests, including certain REITs and U.S. real property holding corporations (as defined in the </font><font>Internal Revenue Code and Treasury regulations). Fund distributions that are attributable to gain from the disposition of a
</font><font>U.S. real property interest will be taxable as ordinary dividends and subject to withholding at a 30% or lower treaty rate if the </font><font>foreign shareholder held no more than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of
</font><font>the distribution. If the foreign shareholder held at least 5% of the Fund's shares, the distribution would be treated as income </font><font>effectively connected with a trade or business within the U.S. and the foreign shareholder would be subject to withholding
</font><font>tax at a rate of 21% and would generally be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Similar consequences would generally apply to a foreign shareholder's gain on the sale of Fund shares unless the Fund is </font><font>domestically controlled (meaning that more than 50% of the value of the Fund's shares is held by U.S. shareholders) or the
</font><font>foreign shareholder owns no more than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of </font><font>sale. Finally, a domestically controlled Fund may be required to recognize a portion of its gain on the in-kind distribution of </font><font>certain U.S. real property interests. Shareholders that are nonresident aliens or foreign entities are urged to consult their own </font><font>tax advisors concerning the particular tax consequences to them of an investment in the Fund.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The rules laid out in the previous paragraph, other than the withholding rules, will apply notwithstanding the Fund’s </font><font>participation in a wash sale transaction or its payment of a substitute dividend.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Shareholders that are nonresident aliens or foreign entities are urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning the </font><font>particular tax consequences to them of an investment in a Fund.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items paid to: (i)
</font><font>foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS </font><font>information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify </font><font>certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will
</font><font>need to: (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information including the names, </font><font>addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders; comply with due diligence
</font><font>procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts; report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. </font><font>accounts maintained; agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

These do not currently apply to managers established outside of the EU, such as BFA. Rather, non-EU managers </font><font>are only
required to comply with certain disclosure, reporting and transparency obligations of AIFMD (</font><font>“</font><font>AIFMD
Disclosure </font><font>Provisions</font><font>”</font><font>) if such

</font><font>employed in respect of the Fund. </font></div> <div> <div><font>BFA has registered the following Funds for marketing to investors in Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the U.K.:</font></div> </div>

</font><font>and do not have express contractual rights against the Fund or its service providers, except certain institutional investors that </font><font>are Authorized Participants may have certain express contractual rights with respect to the Distributor under the terms of the
</font><font>relevant Authorized Participant Agreement. Investors may have certain legal rights under federal or state law against a Fund </font><font>or its service providers. In the event that an investor considers that it may have a claim against a Fund, or against any service </font><font>provider in connection with its investment in a Fund, such investor should consult its own legal advisor.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>By contract, Authorized Participants irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State or U.S. federal </font><font>court sitting in New York City over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Authorized Participant
</font><font>Agreement. Jurisdiction over other claims, whether by investors or Authorized Participants, will turn on the facts of the </font><font>particular case and the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceeding is brought.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Introduction to
BlackRock</font><font> </font></div> <div> <div><font>BlackRock’s purpose is to help more and more people experience financial well-being. We manage assets on behalf of
</font><font>institutional and individual clients, across a full spectrum of investment strategies, asset classes, and regions. Our client base </font><font>includes pension plans, endowments, foundations, charities, official institutions, insurers, and other financial institutions, as </font><font>well as individuals around the world. As part of our fiduciary duty to our clients, we consider it one of our responsibilities to </font><font>promote sound corporate governance, as an informed, engaged shareholder on their behalf. At BlackRock, this is the
</font><font>responsibility of the Investment Stewardship team.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Philosophy on investment stewardship</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Companies are responsible for ensuring they have appropriate governance structures to serve
the interests of shareholders </font><font>and other key stakeholders. We believe that there are certain fundamental rights attached to shareholding. Companies and </font><font>their boards should be accountable to shareholders and structured with appropriate checks and balances to ensure that they
</font><font>operate in shareholders’ best interests to create sustainable value. Shareholders should have the right to vote to elect, </font><font>remove, and nominate directors, approve the appointment of the auditor, and amend the corporate charter or by-laws.
</font><font>Shareholders should be able to vote on key board decisions that are material to the protection of their investment, including </font><font>but not limited to, changes to the purpose of the business, dilution levels and pre-emptive rights, and the distribution of
</font><font>income and capital structure. In order to make informed decisions, shareholders need sufficient and timely information. In </font><font>addition, shareholder voting rights should be proportionate to their economic ownership—the principle of
</font><font>“</font><font>one share, one </font><font>vote</font><font>”</font><font> helps achieve this balance.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Consistent with these shareholder rights, BlackRock has a responsibility to monitor and provide feedback to companies in our </font><font>role as stewards of our clients’ investments. Investment stewardship is how we use our voice as an investor to promote
</font><font>sound corporate governance and business practices to help maximize long-term shareholder value for our clients, the vast </font><font>majority of whom are investing for long-term goals such as retirement. BlackRock Investment Stewardship (BIS) does this
</font><font>through engagement with management teams and/or board members on material business issues and, for those clients
</font><font>who have given us authority, through voting proxies in their best long-term financial interests.</font><font>1</font><font> We also contribute to
</font><font>consultations on public policy and private sector initiatives on industry standards, consistent with our clients’ interests as </font><font>long-term shareholders.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>BlackRock looks to companies to provide timely, accurate, and comprehensive disclosure on all material governance and
</font><font>business matters. This transparency allows shareholders to appropriately understand and assess how relevant risks and </font><font>opportunities are being effectively identified and managed. Where company reporting and disclosure is inadequate or where
</font><font>the governance approach taken may be inconsistent with durable, long-term value creation for shareholders, we will engage </font><font>with a company and/or vote in a manner that advances long-term shareholders’ interests.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>BlackRock views engagement as an important activity; engagement provides us with the opportunity to improve our </font><font>understanding of the business and of the risks and opportunities that are material to the companies in which our clients
</font><font>invest. Engagement may also inform our voting decisions. As long-term investors on behalf of clients, we seek to have regular </font><font>and continuing dialogue with executives and board directors to advance sound governance and durable business practices
</font><font>aligned with long-term value creation, as well as to understand the effectiveness of the company’s management and </font><font>oversight of material issues. Engagement is an important mechanism for providing feedback on company practices and
</font><font>disclosures, particularly where we believe they could be enhanced to support a company’s ability to deliver financial </font><font>performance. Similarly, it provides us with an opportunity to hear directly from company boards and management on how </font><font>they
believe their actions are aligned with durable, long-term value creation.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>We generally vote in support of management and boards that exhibit an approach to decision-making that is consistent with </font><font>creating durable, long-term value for shareholders. If we have concerns about a company’s approach, we may choose to
</font><font>explain our expectations to the company’s board and management. Following that engagement, we may signal through our </font><font>voting that we have outstanding concerns, generally by voting against the re-election of directors we view as having
</font><font>responsibility for an issue. We apply our regional proxy voting guidelines to achieve the outcome that is most aligned with </font><font>our clients’ long-term financial interests.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Key Themes</font><font> </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div><font>1</font></div>
<div><font>Through BlackRock Voting Choice we have, since January 2022, made proxy voting easier and more
accessible for investors in separate accounts and </font><font>certain pooled vehicles. As a result, the shares attributed to BlackRock in company share registers may be voted differently
depending on whether our </font><font>clients have authorized BIS to vote on their behalf, have authorized BIS to vote in accordance with a third party policy, or have elected to vote shares in
</font><font>accordance with their own policy. We are not able to disclose which clients have opted to exercise greater control over their voting, nor are we able to </font><font>disclose which proxy voting policies they have selected.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>We recognize that accepted standards and norms of
corporate governance can differ between markets. However, in our </font><font>experience, there are certain fundamental elements of governance practice that are intrinsic globally to a
company’s ability to </font><font>create long-term value for shareholders. These global themes are set out in this overarching set of principles (the Principles), </font><font>which are anchored in transparency and accountability. At a minimum, it is our view that companies should observe the
</font><font>accepted corporate governance standards in their domestic market and ask that, if they do not, they explain how their </font><font>approach better supports durable, long-term value creation.</font></div> <div> <div><font>These Principles cover seven key themes:</font></div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Boards and directors</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Auditors and audit-related issues</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Capital structure, mergers, asset sales, and other special transactions</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Compensation and benefits</font></div> </div> <div>
</div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Material sustainability-related risks and opportunities</font></div> </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Other corporate
governance matters and shareholder protections</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Shareholder proposals</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Our regional and market-specific </font><font>voting guidelines</font><font> explain how these Principles inform our voting decisions in relation to </font><font>specific ballot items for shareholder
meetings.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Boards and directors</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Our primary focus is on the performance of the board of directors to promote sound corporate governance. The performance </font><font>of
the board is critical to the economic success of the company and the protection of shareholders’ interests. As part of their </font><font>responsibilities, board members owe fiduciary
duties to shareholders in overseeing the strategic direction and operation of </font><font>the company. For this reason, BIS sees engaging with and the election of directors as one of our most
important and </font><font>impactful responsibilities.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>We support boards whose approach is consistent with creating durable, long-term value. This includes the effective </font><font>corporate
governance and management of material sustainability-related risks and opportunities,</font><font>2</font><font> as well as the </font><font>consideration of the company’s key constituents including their employees, clients, suppliers, and the
communities within </font><font>which they operate. The board should establish and maintain a framework of robust and effective governance mechanisms </font><font>to support its oversight of the company’s strategic aims. We look to the board to articulate the effectiveness of these
</font><font>mechanisms in overseeing the management of business risks and opportunities and the fulfillment of the company’s </font><font>purpose. Disclosure of all material issues that affect the company’s long-term strategy and ability to create value is essential </font><font>for shareholders to be able to appropriately understand and assess how risks are effectively identified, managed and
</font><font>mitigated.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Where a company has not adequately disclosed and demonstrated that they have fulfilled these responsibilities, we will
</font><font>consider voting against the re-election of directors whom we consider to have particular responsibility for the issue. We </font><font>assess director performance on a case-by-case basis and in light of each company’s circumstances, taking into consideration </font><font>our assessment of their governance, business practices that support durable, long-term value creation, and performance. In
</font><font>serving the interests of shareholders, the responsibility of the board of directors includes, but is not limited to, the following:</font></div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Establishing an appropriate corporate governance structure</font></div> </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Supporting and
overseeing management in setting long-term strategic goals and applicable measures of value-creation </font><font>and milestones that will demonstrate progress, and taking steps to address
anticipated or actual obstacles to success</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Providing oversight on the identification and management of material governance and sustainability-related risks</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div>
</div> <div> </div> <div> <div>
<hr/> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>2</font></div>
<div><font>By material sustainability-related risks and opportunities, we mean the drivers of risk and
value creation in a company’s business model that have an </font><font>environmental or social dependency or impact. Examples of environmental issues include, but are not limited to, water
use, land use, waste </font><font>management and climate risk. Examples of social issues include, but are not limited to, human capital management, impacts on the communities in </font><font>which a company operates, customer loyalty and relationships with regulators. It is our view that well-managed companies will effectively evaluate </font><font>and manage material sustainability-related risks and opportunities relevant to their businesses. Governance is the core means by which boards can </font><font>oversee the creation of durable, long-term value. Appropriate risk oversight of business-relevant and material sustainability-related considerations is a </font><font>component of a sound governance framework.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

</div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><font>There should be clear
descriptions of the role of the board and the committees of the board and how they engage with and </font><font>oversee management. Set out below are ways in which boards and directors can
demonstrate a commitment to acting in the </font><font>best long-term economic interests of all shareholders.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>We will seek to engage with the appropriate directors where we have concerns about the
performance of the company, </font><font>board, or individual directors and may signal outstanding concerns in our voting. While we consider these principles to be </font><font>globally relevant, when assessing a board’s composition and governance processes, we consider local market norms and
</font><font>regulations.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Regular accountability</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>It is our view that directors should stand for re-election on a regular basis, ideally annually. In our experience, annual re-elections</font><font> allow shareholders to reaffirm their support for board members or hold them accountable for their decisions in a </font><font>timely
manner. When board members are not re-elected annually, in our experience, it is good practice for boards to have a </font><font>rotation policy to ensure that, through a board cycle, all
directors have had their appointment re-confirmed, with a </font><font>proportion of directors being put forward for re-election at each annual general meeting.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Effective board composition</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Regular director elections also give boards the opportunity to adjust their composition in
an orderly way to reflect the </font><font>evolution of the company’s strategy and the market environment. In our view, it is beneficial for new directors to be brought </font><font>onto the board periodically to refresh the group’s thinking and in a manner that supports both continuity and appropriate </font><font>succession planning. We consider the average overall tenure of the board, where we are seeking a balance between the
</font><font>knowledge and experience of longer-serving members and the fresh perspectives of newer members. We encourage
</font><font>companies to keep under regular review the effectiveness of their board (including its size), and assess directors nominated </font><font>for election or re-election in the context of the composition of the board as a whole. This assessment should consider a
</font><font>number of factors, including the potential need to address gaps in skills, experience, independence, and diversity.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>In our view, there should be a sufficient number of independent directors, free from
conflicts of interest or undue influence </font><font>from connected parties, to ensure objectivity in the decision-making of the board and its ability to oversee management. </font><font>Common impediments to independence may include but are not limited to:</font></div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Current or recent employment at the company or subsidiary</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Being, or representing, a shareholder with a substantial shareholding in the
company</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Interlocking
directorships</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Having any other
interest, business or other relationship which could, or could reasonably be perceived to, materially </font><font>interfere with a director’s ability to act in the best interests of the
company and their shareholders</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><font>In our experience, boards are most effective at overseeing and advising management when there is a senior independent </font><font>board
leader. This director may chair the board, or, where the chair is also the CEO (or is otherwise not independent), be </font><font>designated as a lead independent director. The role of this
director is to enhance the effectiveness of the independent </font><font>members of the board through shaping the agenda, ensuring adequate information is provided to the board, and </font><font>encouraging independent director participation in board deliberations. The lead independent director or another appropriate
</font><font>director should be available to shareholders in those situations where an independent director is best placed to explain and </font><font>contextualize a company’s approach.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>When nominating new directors to the board, we
look to companies to provide sufficient information on the individual </font><font>candidates so that shareholders can assess the suitability of each individual nominee and the overall board
composition. </font><font>These disclosures should give an understanding of how the collective experience and expertise of the board aligns with the </font><font>company’s long-term strategy and business model. Highly qualified, engaged directors with professional characteristics
</font><font>relevant to a company’s business enhance the ability of the board to add value and be the voice of shareholders in board </font><font>discussions. In our view, a strong board provides a competitive advantage to a company, providing valuable oversight and
</font><font>contributing to the most important management decisions that support long-term financial performance.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>It is in this context that we are interested in diversity in the board room. We see it as a
means to promoting diversity of </font><font>thought and avoiding </font><font>“</font><font>group think</font><font>”</font><font> in the board’s exercise of its
responsibilities to advise and oversee management. It allows </font><font>boards to have deeper discussions and make more resilient decisions. We ask boards to disclose how diversity is
considered </font><font>in board composition, including professional characteristics, such as a director’s industry experience, specialist areas of </font><font>expertise and geographic location; as well as demographic characteristics such as gender, race/ethnicity and age.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>We look to understand a board’s diversity in the context of a company’s
domicile, market capitalization, business model and </font><font>strategy. Increasingly, we see leading boards adding members whose experience deepens the board’s understanding of the
</font><font>company’s customers, employees and communities. Self-identified board demographic diversity can usefully be disclosed in </font><font>aggregate, consistent with local law. We believe boards should aspire to meaningful diversity of membership, at least
</font><font>consistent with local regulatory requirements and best practices, while recognizing that building a strong, diverse board can </font><font>take time.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>This
position is based on our view that diversity of perspective and thought – in the board room, in the management team </font><font>and throughout the company – leads to better long
term economic outcomes for companies. Academic research already </font><font>reveals correlations between specific dimensions of diversity and effects on decision-making processes and
outcomes.</font><font>4</font><font> In
</font><font>our experience, greater diversity in the board room contributes to more robust discussions and more innovative and resilient </font><font>decisions. Over time, greater diversity in the board room can also promote greater diversity and resilience in the leadership
</font><font>team, and the workforce more broadly. That diversity can enable companies to develop businesses that more closely reflect </font><font>and resonate with the customers and communities they serve.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>There are matters for which the board has responsibility that may involve a conflict of interest for executives or for affiliated </font><font>directors. It is our view that objective oversight of such matters is best achieved when the board forms committees
</font><font>comprised entirely of independent directors. In many markets, these committees of the board specialize in audit, director </font><font>nominations, and compensation matters. An ad hoc committee might also be formed to decide on a special transaction,
</font><font>particularly one involving a related party, or to investigate a significant adverse event.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Sufficient capacity</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>As the role and expectations of a director are increasingly demanding, directors must be able to commit an appropriate </font><font>amount of time to board and committee matters. It is important that directors have the capacity to meet all of their
</font><font>responsibilities - including when there are unforeseen events – and therefore, they should not take on an excessive number of </font><font>roles that would impair their ability to fulfill their duties.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Auditors and audit-related issues</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>BlackRock recognizes the critical importance of financial statements, which should provide
a true and fair picture of a </font><font>company’s financial condition. Accordingly, the assumptions made by management and reviewed by the auditor in preparing </font><font>the financial statements should be reasonable and justified.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The accuracy of financial statements, inclusive of financial and non-financial information as required or permitted under
</font><font>market-specific accounting rules, is of paramount importance to BlackRock. Investors increasingly recognize that a broader </font><font>range of risks and opportunities have the potential to materially impact financial performance. Over time, we anticipate
</font><font>investors and other users of company reporting will increasingly seek to understand and scrutinize the assumptions </font><font>underlying financial statements, particularly those that pertain to the impact of the transition to a low carbon economy on a
</font><font>company’s business model and asset mix. We recognize that this is an area of evolving practice and we look to international </font><font>standards setters, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International Auditing and Assurance
</font><font>Standards Board (IAASB) to provide additional guidance to companies.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>In this context, audit committees, or equivalent,
play a vital role in a company’s financial reporting system by providing </font><font>independent oversight of the accounts, material financial and, where appropriate to the jurisdiction,
non-financial </font><font>information, internal control frameworks, and in the absence of a dedicated risk committee, Enterprise Risk Management </font><font>systems. In our view, effective audit committee oversight strengthens the quality and reliability of a company’s financial </font><font>statements and provides an important level of reassurance to shareholders.</font></div> <div> <div><font>We hold members of the audit committee or equivalent responsible for overseeing the management of the audit function. </font><font>Audit
committees or equivalent should have clearly articulated charters that set out their responsibilities and have a rotation </font><font>plan in place that allows for a periodic refreshment of
the committee membership to introduce fresh perspectives to audit </font><font>oversight. We recognize that audit committees will rely on management, internal audit and the independent auditor
in </font><font>fulfilling their responsibilities but look to committee members to demonstrate they have relevant expertise to monitor and </font><font>oversee those functions.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>We take particular note of unexplained changes in reporting methodology, cases involving significant financial restatements,
</font><font>or ad hoc notifications of material financial weakness. In this respect, audit committees should provide timely disclosure on </font><font>the remediation of Key and Critical Audit Matters identified either by the external auditor or internal audit function.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The integrity of financial statements depends on the auditor being free of any impediments
to being an effective check on </font><font>management. To that end, it is important that auditors are, and are seen to be, independent. Where an audit firm provides </font><font>services to the company in addition to the audit, the fees earned should be disclosed and explained. Audit committees </font><font>should
have in place a procedure for assessing annually the independence of the auditor and the quality of the external audit </font><font>process.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Comprehensive disclosure provides investors with a sense of the company’s long-term
operational risk management </font><font>practices and, more broadly, the quality of the board’s oversight. The audit committee or equivalent, or a dedicated risk </font><font>committee, should periodically review the company’s risk assessment and risk management policies and the significant risks </font><font>and exposures identified by management, the internal auditors or the independent accountants, and management’s steps to
</font><font>address them. In the absence of robust disclosures, we may reasonably conclude that companies are not adequately
</font><font>managing risk.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Capital structure, mergers, asset sales, and other special transactions</font><font>
</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The capital structure of a company is critical to shareholders as it
impacts the value of their investment and the priority of </font><font>their interest in the company relative to that of other equity or debt investors. Pre-emptive rights are a key protection
for </font><font>shareholders against the dilution of their interests.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Effective voting rights are basic rights of share ownership. It is our view that one vote for one share as a guiding principle
</font><font>supports effective corporate governance. Shareholders, as the residual claimants, have the strongest interest in protecting </font><font>company value, and voting rights should match economic exposure.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In principle, we disagree with the creation of a share class with equivalent economic exposure and preferential, differentiated </font><font>voting rights. In our view, this structure violates the fundamental corporate governance principle of proportionality and
</font><font>results in a concentration of power in the hands of a few shareholders, thus disenfranchising other shareholders and </font><font>amplifying any potential conflicts of interest. However, we recognize that in certain markets, at least for a period of time,
</font><font>companies may have a valid argument for listing dual classes of shares with differentiated voting rights. In our view, such </font><font>companies should review these share class structures on a regular basis or as company circumstances change.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Additionally, they should seek shareholder approval of their capital structure on a
periodic basis via a management proposal </font><font>at the company’s shareholder meeting. The proposal should give unaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to affirm the </font><font>current structure or establish mechanisms to end or phase out controlling structures at the appropriate time, while
</font><font>minimizing costs to shareholders.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In assessing mergers, asset sales, or other special transactions, BlackRock’s primary consideration is the long-term economic </font><font>interests of our clients as shareholders. Boards proposing a transaction need to clearly explain the economic and strategic
</font><font>rationale behind it. We will review a proposed transaction to determine the degree to which it can enhance long-term </font><font>shareholder value. We would prefer that proposed transactions have the unanimous support of the board and have been
</font><font>negotiated at arm’s length. We may seek reassurance from the board that executives’ and/or board members’ financial </font><font>interests in a given transaction have not adversely affected their ability to place shareholders’ interests before their own. </font><font>Where the transaction involves related parties, the recommendation to support should come from the independent directors, </font><font>a
best practice in most markets, and ideally, the terms should have been assessed through an independent appraisal process. </font><font>In addition, it is good practice that it be approved by a
separate vote of the non-conflicted parties.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>A-8</font></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>As a matter of sound governance practice,
shareholders should have a right to dispose of company shares in the open </font><font>market without unnecessary restriction. In our view, corporate mechanisms designed to limit
shareholders’ ability to sell their </font><font>shares are contrary to basic property rights. Such mechanisms can serve to protect and entrench interests other than those </font><font>of the shareholders. In our experience, shareholders are broadly capable of making decisions in their own best interests. We
</font><font>encourage any so-called </font><font>“</font><font>shareholder
rights plans</font><font>”</font><font> proposed by a board to be subject to shareholder approval upon </font><font>introduction and periodically thereafter.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Compensation and benefits</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>In most markets, one of the most important roles for a company’s board of directors
is to put in place a compensation </font><font>structure that incentivizes and rewards executives appropriately. There should be a clear link between variable pay and </font><font>operational and financial performance. Performance metrics should be stretching and aligned with a company’s strategy and </font><font>business model. BIS does not have a position on the use of sustainability-related criteria, but in our view, where companies
</font><font>choose to include them, they should be as rigorous as other financial or operational targets. Long-term incentive plans </font><font>should vest over timeframes aligned with the delivery of long-term shareholder value. Compensation committees should </font><font>guard
against contractual arrangements that would entitle executives to material compensation for early termination of their </font><font>employment. Finally, pension contributions and other deferred
compensation arrangements should be reasonable in light of </font><font>market practice.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>We are not supportive of one-off or special bonuses unrelated to company or individual performance. Where discretion has </font><font>been used by the compensation committee or its equivalent, we expect disclosure relating to how and why the discretion </font><font>was
used, and how the adjusted outcome is aligned with the interests of shareholders. We acknowledge that the use of peer </font><font>group evaluation by compensation committees can help ensure
competitive pay; however, we are concerned when the </font><font>rationale for increases in total compensation at a company is solely based on peer benchmarking rather than a rigorous </font><font>measure of outperformance. We encourage companies to clearly explain how compensation outcomes have rewarded </font><font>outperformance
against peer firms.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>We believe consideration should be given to
building claw back provisions into incentive plans such that executives would be </font><font>required to forgo rewards when they are not justified by actual performance and/or when
compensation was based on faulty </font><font>financial reporting or deceptive business practices. We also favor recoupment from any senior executive whose behavior </font><font>caused material financial harm to shareholders, material reputational risk to the company, or resulted in a criminal
</font><font>investigation, even if such actions did not ultimately result in a material restatement of past results.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Non-executive directors should be compensated in a manner that is commensurate with the
time and effort expended in </font><font>fulfilling their professional responsibilities. Additionally, these compensation arrangements should not risk compromising </font><font>directors’ independence or aligning their interests too closely with those of the management, whom they are charged with
</font><font>overseeing.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>We use third party research, in addition to our own analysis, to evaluate existing and proposed compensation structures. We
</font><font>may vote against members of the compensation committee or equivalent board members for poor compensation practices </font><font>or structures.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Material sustainability-related risks and opportunities</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>It is our view that well-managed companies will effectively evaluate and manage material sustainability-related risks and </font><font>opportunities relevant to their businesses. Appropriate oversight of sustainability considerations is a core component of
</font><font>having an effective governance framework, which supports durable, long-term value creation.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Robust disclosure is essential for investors to effectively evaluate companies’ strategy and business practices related to </font><font>material sustainability-related risks and opportunities. Given the increased understanding of material sustainability-related
</font><font>risks and opportunities and the need for better information to assess them, BlackRock advocates for continued improvement </font><font>in companies’ reporting, where necessary, and will express any concerns through our voting where a company’s actions or </font><font>disclosures are inadequate.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>BlackRock encourages companies to use the framework developed by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial </font><font>Disclosures
(TCFD) to disclose their approach to ensuring they have a sustainable business model and to supplement that </font><font>disclosure with industry-specific metrics such as those identified by
the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), </font><font>now part of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) under the International Financial Reporting Standards

<div> <div><font>(IFRS) Foundation.</font><font>5</font><font> While the TCFD framework was developed to support climate-related risk disclosure, the four
pillars of </font><font>the TCFD governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets are a useful way for companies to disclose how </font><font>they identify, assess, manage, and oversee a variety of sustainability-related risks and opportunities. SASB’s industry-specific </font><font>guidance (as identified in its materiality map) is beneficial in helping companies identify key performance indicators (KPIs)
</font><font>across various dimensions of sustainability that are considered to be financially material and decision-useful within their </font><font>industry. In particular, we encourage companies to consider reporting on nature-related factors, given the growing materiality
</font><font>of these issues for many businesses.</font><font>6</font><font> We recognize that some companies may report using different standards, which may </font><font>be required by regulation, or one of a
number of voluntary standards. In such cases, we ask that companies highlight the </font><font>metrics that are industry- or company-specific.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>Climate and other sustainability-related disclosures often require companies to collect and
aggregate data from various </font><font>internal and external sources. We recognize that the practical realities of data-collection and reporting may not line up with </font><font>financial reporting cycles and companies may require additional time after their fiscal year-end to accurately collect, analyze </font><font>and report this data to investors. To give investors time to assess the data, we encourage companies to produce climate and
</font><font>other sustainability-related disclosures sufficiently in advance of their annual meeting.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Companies may also adopt or refer to guidance on sustainable and responsible business conduct issued by supranational </font><font>organizations such as the United Nations or the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Further, industry
</font><font>initiatives on managing specific operational risks may provide useful guidance to companies on best practices and
</font><font>disclosures. Companies should disclose any relevant global climate and other sustainability-related standards adopted, the </font><font>industry initiatives in which they participate, any peer group benchmarking undertaken, and any assurance processes to help
</font><font>investors understand their approach to sustainable and responsible business practices.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Climate risk</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>It is our view that climate change has become a key factor in many companies’ long-term prospects. As such, as long-term </font><font>investors we are interested in understanding how companies may be impacted by material climate-related risks and
</font><font>opportunities – just as we seek to understand other business-relevant risks and opportunities – and how these factors are </font><font>considered within strategy in a manner consistent with the company’s business model and sector. Specifically, we look for </font><font>companies to disclose strategies they have in place that mitigate and are resilient to any material risks to their long-term
</font><font>business model associated with a range of climate-related scenarios, including a scenario in which global warming is limited </font><font>to well below 2°C, considering global ambitions to achieve a limit of
1.5°C.</font><font>7</font><font> It is, of course, up to each company to define </font><font>their own strategy: that is not the role of BlackRock or other investors.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>BIS recognizes that climate change can be challenging for many companies, as they seek to drive long-term value by
</font><font>mitigating risks and capturing opportunities. A growing number of companies, financial institutions, as well as governments, </font><font>have committed to advancing decarbonization in line with the Paris Agreement. There is growing consensus that companies </font><font>can
benefit from the more favorable macro-economic environment under an orderly, timely and equitable global energy </font><font>transition.</font><font>8</font><font> Yet the path ahead is deeply uncertain and uneven, with different parts of the economy
moving at different </font><font>speeds.</font><font>9</font><font> Many companies are asking what their role should be in contributing to an orderly and equitable transition – in
</font><font>ensuring a reliable energy supply and energy security, and in protecting the most vulnerable from energy price shocks and </font><font>economic dislocation. In this context, we encourage companies to include in their disclosure a business plan for how they
</font><font>intend to deliver long-term financial performance through a transition to global net zero carbon emissions, consistent with </font><font>their business model and sector.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>We look to companies to disclose short-, medium- and long-term targets, ideally science-based targets where these are

carbon energy sources and technologies that will be essential to decarbonizing </font><font>the global economy over time. We also recognize that continued investment in traditional energy
sources, including oil and </font><font>gas, is required to maintain an orderly and equitable transition — and that divestiture of carbon-intensive assets is unlikely to </font><font>contribute to global emissions reductions. We encourage companies to disclose how their capital allocation to various energy
</font><font>sources is consistent with their strategy.</font></div> <div> <div><font>At this stage, we view Scope 3 emissions differently from Scopes 1 and 2, given methodological complexity, regulatory
</font><font>uncertainty, concerns about double-counting, and lack of direct control by companies. While we welcome any disclosures </font><font>and commitments companies choose to make regarding Scope 3 emissions, we recognize these are provided on a good-faith </font><font>basis
as methodology develops. Our publicly available commentary provides more information on our approach to climate </font><font>risk.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Key stakeholder interests</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>In order to advance long-term shareholders’ interests, companies should consider the
interests of the various parties on </font><font>whom they depend for their success over time. It is for each company to determine their key stakeholders based on what is </font><font>material to their business and long-term financial performance. Most commonly, key stakeholders include employees, </font><font>business
partners (such as suppliers and distributors), clients and consumers, regulators, and the communities in which they </font><font>operate.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Considering the interests of key stakeholders recognizes the collective nature of long-term
value creation and the extent to </font><font>which each company’s prospects for growth are tied to its ability to foster strong sustainable relationships with and support </font><font>from those stakeholders. Companies should articulate how they address adverse impacts that could arise from their business
</font><font>practices and affect critical business relationships with their stakeholders. We encourage companies to implement, to the </font><font>extent appropriate, monitoring processes (often referred to as due diligence) to identify and mitigate potential adverse
</font><font>impacts and grievance mechanisms to remediate any actual adverse material impacts. In our view, maintaining trust within </font><font>these relationships can contribute to a company’s long-term success.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>As a long-term shareholder on behalf of our clients, we find it helpful when companies disclose how they have identified
</font><font>their key stakeholders and considered their interests in business decision-making. We are also interested to understand the </font><font>role of the board, which is well positioned to ensure that the approach taken is informed by and aligns with the company’s </font><font>strategy and purpose.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Other corporate governance matters and shareholder protections</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>It is our view that shareholders have a right to material and timely information on the financial performance and viability of </font><font>the companies in which they invest. In addition, companies should publish information on the governance structures in place
</font><font>and the rights of shareholders to influence these structures. The reporting and disclosure provided by companies help </font><font>shareholders assess whether their economic interests have been protected and the quality of the board’s oversight of
</font><font>management. We believe shareholders should have the right to vote on key corporate governance matters, including
</font><font>changes to governance mechanisms, to submit proposals to the shareholders’ meeting, and to call special meetings of </font><font>shareholders.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Corporate Form</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In our view, it is the responsibility of the board to determine the corporate form that is most appropriate given the company’s </font><font>purpose and business model.</font><font>10</font><font> Companies proposing to change their corporate form to a public benefit corporation or </font><font>similar entity should put it to a
shareholder vote if not already required to do so under applicable law. Supporting </font><font>documentation from companies or shareholder proponents proposing to alter the corporate form
should clearly articulate </font><font>how the interests of shareholders and different stakeholders would be impacted as well as the accountability and voting </font><font>mechanisms that would be available to shareholders. As a fiduciary on behalf of clients, we generally support management
</font><font>proposals if our analysis indicates that shareholders’ interests are adequately protected. Relevant shareholder proposals are </font><font>evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Shareholder proposals</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In most markets in which BlackRock invests on behalf of clients, shareholders have the right to submit proposals to be voted
</font><font>on by shareholders at a company’s annual or extraordinary meeting, as long as eligibility and procedural requirements are </font><font>met. The matters that we see put forward by shareholders address a wide range of topics, including governance reforms,
</font><font>capital management, and improvements in the management or disclosure of sustainability-related risks.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>BlackRock is subject to certain requirements under
antitrust law in the United States that place restrictions and limitations on </font><font>how BlackRock can interact with the companies in which we invest on behalf of our clients, including
our ability to submit </font><font>shareholder proposals. As noted above, we can vote, on behalf of clients who authorize us to do so, on proposals put forth by </font><font>others.</font></div> <div> <div><font>When assessing
shareholder proposals, we evaluate each proposal on its merit, with a singular focus on its implications for </font><font>long-term value creation. We consider the business and economic
relevance of the issue raised, as well as its materiality and </font><font>the urgency with which we believe it should be addressed. We take into consideration the legal effect of the proposal,
as </font><font>shareholder proposals may be advisory or legally binding depending on the jurisdiction. We would not support proposals that </font><font>we believe would result in over-reaching into the basic business decisions of the company.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Where a proposal is focused on a material governance or sustainability-related risk that we agree needs to be addressed and </font><font>the intended outcome is consistent with long-term value creation, we will look to the board and management to </font><font>demonstrate
that the company has met the intent of the request made in the shareholder proposal. Where our analysis </font><font>and/or engagement indicate an opportunity for improvement in the
company’s approach to the issue, we may support </font><font>shareholder proposals that are reasonable and not unduly prescriptive or constraining on management. Alternatively, or in
</font><font>addition, we may vote against the re-election of one or more directors if, in our assessment, the board has not responded </font><font>sufficiently or with an appropriate sense of urgency. While we may not agree with all aspects of a shareholder proponent’s </font><font>views or all facets of the proponent’s supporting statement, we may still support proposals that address material governance </font><font>or sustainability-related risks where we believe it would be helpful for shareholders to have more detailed information on how
</font><font>those risks are identified, monitored, and managed to support a company’s ability to deliver long-term financial returns. We </font><font>may also support a proposal if management is on track, but we believe that voting in favor might accelerate progress.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>BlackRock’s oversight of its investment stewardship
activities</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Oversight</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>BlackRock maintains three regional advisory committees (Stewardship Advisory Committees)
for a) the Americas; b) Europe, </font><font>the Middle East and Africa (EMEA); and c) Asia-Pacific, generally consisting of senior BlackRock investment professionals </font><font>and/or senior employees with practical boardroom experience. The regional Stewardship Advisory Committees review and </font><font>advise
on amendments to BIS proxy voting guidelines covering markets within each respective region (Guidelines). The </font><font>advisory committees do not determine voting decisions, which are the
responsibility of BIS.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In addition to the regional Stewardship Advisory
Committees, the Investment Stewardship Global Oversight Committee </font><font>(Global Committee) is a risk-focused committee, comprised of senior representatives from various BlackRock
investment </font><font>teams, a senior legal representative, the Global Head of Investment Stewardship (Global Head), and other senior executives </font><font>with relevant experience and team oversight. The Global Oversight Committee does not determine voting decisions, which </font><font>are
the responsibility of BIS.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Global Head has primary oversight of the
activities of BIS, including voting in accordance with the Guidelines, which </font><font>require the application of professional judgment and consideration of each company’s unique
circumstances. The Global </font><font>Committee reviews and approves amendments to these Principles. The Global Committee also reviews and approves </font><font>amendments to the regional Guidelines, as proposed by the regional Stewardship Advisory Committees.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>In addition, the Global Committee receives and reviews periodic reports regarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as updates on </font><font>material process issues, procedural changes, and other risk oversight considerations. The Global Committee reviews these
</font><font>reports in an oversight capacity as informed by the BIS corporate governance engagement program and the Guidelines.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>BIS carries out engagement with companies, monitors and executes proxy votes, and conducts
vote operations (including </font><font>maintaining records of votes cast) in a manner consistent with the relevant Guidelines. BIS also conducts research on </font><font>corporate governance issues and participates in industry discussions to contribute to and keep abreast of important
</font><font>developments in the corporate governance field. BIS may utilize third parties for certain of the foregoing activities and </font><font>performs oversight of those third parties. BIS may raise complicated or particularly controversial matters for internal
</font><font>discussion with the relevant investment teams and governance specialists for discussion and guidance prior to making a </font><font>voting decision.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Vote execution</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>BlackRock votes on proxy issues when our clients authorize us to do so. We offer certain
clients who prefer their holdings to </font><font>be voted consistent with specific values or views Voting Choice.</font><font>11</font><font> When BlackRock votes on behalf of our clients, we carefully </font></div> </div> </div>

<div> <div><font>consider proxies submitted to funds and other
fiduciary account(s) (Fund or Funds) for which we have voting authority. </font><font>BlackRock votes (or refrains from voting) proxies for each Fund for which we have voting authority based on
our evaluation </font><font>of the best long-term economic interests of our clients as shareholders, in the exercise of our independent business </font><font>judgment, and without regard to the relationship of the issuer of the proxy (or any shareholder proponent or dissident
</font><font>shareholder) to the Fund, the Fund’s affiliates (if any), BlackRock or BlackRock’s affiliates, or BlackRock employees (see </font><font>“</font><font>Conflicts management policies and
procedures</font><font>”</font><font>, below).</font></div> <div>
<div><font>When exercising voting rights, BlackRock will normally vote on specific proxy issues in accordance with the Guidelines for the </font><font>relevant market. The Guidelines are reviewed annually and are amended consistent with changes in the local market practice,
</font><font>as developments in corporate governance occur, or as otherwise deemed advisable by the applicable Stewardship Advisory </font><font>Committees. BIS analysts may, in the exercise of their professional judgment, conclude that the Guidelines do not cover the
</font><font>specific matter upon which a proxy vote is required or that an exception to the Guidelines would be in the best long-term </font><font>economic interests of BlackRock’s clients.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In the uncommon circumstance of there being a vote with respect to fixed income securities or the securities of privately
</font><font>held issuers, the decision generally will be made by a Fund’s portfolio managers and/or BIS based on their assessment of the </font><font>particular transactions or other matters at issue.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In certain markets, proxy voting involves logistical issues which can affect BlackRock’s ability to vote such proxies, as well as </font><font>the desirability of voting such proxies. These issues include, but are not limited to: i) untimely notice of shareholder meetings; </font><font>ii) restrictions on a foreigner’s ability to exercise votes; iii) requirements to vote proxies in person; iv)
</font><font>“</font><font>share-blocking</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>(requirements that investors who exercise their voting rights surrender the right to dispose of their
holdings for some </font><font>specified period in proximity to the shareholder meeting); v) potential difficulties in translating the proxy; vi) regulatory </font><font>constraints; and vii) requirements to provide local agents with unrestricted powers of attorney to facilitate voting
</font><font>instructions. We are not supportive of impediments to the exercise of voting rights such as share-blocking or overly </font><font>burdensome administrative requirements.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>As a consequence, BlackRock votes proxies in these situations on a </font><font>“</font><font>best-efforts</font><font>”</font><font> basis. In addition, BIS may
determine that it </font><font>is generally in the best interests of BlackRock’s clients not to vote proxies (or not to vote our full allocation) if the costs </font><font>(including but not limited to opportunity costs associated with share-blocking constraints) associated with exercising a vote
</font><font>are expected to outweigh the benefit the client would derive by voting on the proposal.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Portfolio managers have full discretion to vote the shares in the Funds they manage based on their analysis of the economic </font><font>impact of a particular ballot item on their investors. Portfolio managers may, from time to time, reach differing views on how
</font><font>best to maximize economic value with respect to a particular investment. Therefore, portfolio managers may, and sometimes </font><font>do, vote shares in the Funds under their management differently from BIS or from one another. However, because
</font><font>BlackRock’s clients are mostly long-term investors with long-term economic goals, ballots are frequently cast in a uniform </font><font>manner.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Conflicts management policies and procedures</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>BIS maintains policies and procedures that seek to prevent undue influence on
BlackRock’s proxy voting activity. Such </font><font>influence might stem from any relationship between the investee company (or any shareholder proponent or dissident </font><font>shareholder) and BlackRock, BlackRock’s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund’s affiliates, or BlackRock employees. The following are </font><font>examples of sources of perceived or potential conflicts of interest:</font></div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>BlackRock clients who may be issuers of securities or proponents of shareholder resolutions</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>

<div><font>BlackRock, Inc. board members who serve as senior executives of public companies held in Funds

<div><font>BlackRock has taken certain steps to mitigate perceived or potential conflicts including, but not limited to, the following:</font></div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Adopted the Guidelines which are designed to advance our clients’ interests in the

<div> <div><font>shareholders or shareholder
proponents are managed consistently and without regard to BlackRock’s relationship with </font><font>such parties. Clients or business partners are not given special treatment or
differentiated access to BIS. BIS prioritizes </font><font>engagements based on factors including, but not limited to, our need for additional information to make a voting </font><font>decision or our view on the likelihood that an engagement could lead to positive outcome(s) over time for the economic </font><font>value
of the company. Within the normal course of business, BIS may engage directly with BlackRock clients, business </font><font>partners and/or third parties, and/or with employees with sales,
vendor management, or business partnership roles, in </font><font>discussions regarding our approach to stewardship, general corporate governance matters, client reporting needs, </font><font>and/or to otherwise ensure that proxy-related client service levels are met</font></div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Determined to engage, in certain instances, an independent third party voting service provider to make proxy voting
</font><font>recommendations as a further safeguard to avoid potential conflicts of interest, to satisfy regulatory compliance
</font><font>requirements, or as may be otherwise required by applicable law. In such circumstances, the voting service provider </font><font>provides BlackRock with recommendations, in accordance with the Guidelines, as to how to vote such proxies. </font><font>BlackRock uses
an independent voting service provider to make proxy voting recommendations for shares of BlackRock, </font><font>Inc. and companies affiliated with BlackRock, Inc. BlackRock may also use an
independent voting service provider to </font><font>make proxy voting recommendations for:</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>public companies that include BlackRock employees on their boards of directors</font></div>
</div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>public companies
of which a BlackRock, Inc. board member serves as a senior executive or a member of </font><font>the board of directors</font></div> </div> <div> </div>
</div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>public companies that are the subject of certain transactions involving BlackRock
Funds</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>public companies
that are joint venture partners with BlackRock, and</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>public companies when legal or regulatory requirements compel BlackRock to use an independent
voting </font><font>service provider</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div><font>In selecting a voting service provider, we assess several characteristics, including but not limited to: independence, an ability </font><font>to analyze proxy issues and make recommendations in the best economic interest of our clients in accordance with the
</font><font>Guidelines, reputation for reliability and integrity, and operational capacity to accurately deliver the assigned
</font><font>recommendations in a timely manner. We may engage more than one voting service provider, in part to mitigate potential or </font><font>perceived conflicts of interest at a single voting service provider. The Global Committee appoints and reviews the
</font><font>performance of the voting service providers, generally on an annual basis.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Securities lending</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>When so authorized, BlackRock acts as a securities lending agent on behalf of Funds. Securities lending is a well-regulated </font><font>practice that contributes to capital market efficiency. It also enables funds to generate additional returns for a fund, while
</font><font>allowing fund providers to keep fund expenses lower.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>With regard to the relationship between securities lending and proxy voting, BlackRock’s approach is informed by our
</font><font>fiduciary responsibility to act in our clients’ best interests. In most cases, BlackRock anticipates that the potential long-term </font><font>value to the Fund of voting shares would be less than the potential revenue the loan may provide the Fund. However, in
</font><font>certain instances, BlackRock may determine, in its independent business judgment as a fiduciary, that the value of voting </font><font>outweighs the securities lending revenue loss to clients and would therefore recall shares to be voted in those instances.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The decision to recall securities on loan as part of BlackRock’s securities lending
program in order to vote is based on an </font><font>evaluation of various factors that include, but are not limited to, assessing potential securities lending revenue alongside the </font><font>potential long-term value to clients of voting those securities (based on the information available at the time of recall
</font><font>consideration).</font><font>12</font><font> BIS works with colleagues in the Securities Lending and Risk and Quantitative Analysis teams to evaluate </font><font>the costs and
benefits to clients of recalling shares on loan.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Periodically,
BlackRock reviews our process for determining whether to recall securities on loan in order to vote and may </font><font>modify it as necessary.</font></div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <div> <div>
<hr/> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>12</font></div>
<div><font>Recalling securities on loan can be impacted by the timing of record dates. In the United
States, for example, the record date of a shareholder meeting </font><font>typically falls before the proxy statements are released. Accordingly, it is not practicable to evaluate a proxy
statement, determine that a vote has a </font><font>material impact on a fund and recall any shares on loan in advance of the record date for the annual meeting. As a result, managers must weigh
</font><font>independent business judgement as a fiduciary, the benefit to a fund’s shareholders of recalling loaned shares in advance of an estimated record date </font><font>without knowing whether there will be a vote on matters which have a material impact on the fund (thereby forgoing potential securities lending </font><font>revenue for the fund’s shareholders) or leaving shares on loan to potentially earn revenue for the fund (thereby forgoing the opportunity to vote).</font></div> </div>

guidelines</font><font> </font></div> <div> <div><font>The issue-specific Guidelines published for each region/country in which we vote are intended to summarize BlackRock’s
</font><font>general philosophy and approach to issues that may commonly arise in the proxy voting context in each market where we </font><font>invest. The Guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. BIS applies the Guidelines on a case-by-case basis, in the context of </font><font>the individual circumstances of each company and the specific issue under review. As such, the Guidelines do not indicate
</font><font>how BIS will vote in every instance. Rather, they reflect our view about corporate governance issues generally, and provide </font><font>insight into how we typically approach issues that commonly arise on corporate ballots.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Reporting and vote transparency</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>We are committed to transparency in the stewardship work we do on behalf of clients. We inform clients about our </font><font>engagement and voting policies and activities through direct communication and through disclosure on our website. Each </font><font>year
we publish an annual report that provides a global overview of our investment stewardship engagement and voting </font><font>activities and a voting spotlight that summarizes our voting over a
proxy year.</font><font>13</font><font> Additionally, we make public our market-specific</font><font> voting guidelines for the benefit of clients and companies with whom we engage. We also publish commentaries to </font><font>share our
perspective on market developments and emerging key themes.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>At a more
granular level, we publish quarterly our vote record for each company that held a shareholder meeting during the </font><font>period, showing how we voted on each proposal and explaining any
votes against management proposals or on shareholder </font><font>proposals. For shareholder meetings where a vote might be high profile or of significant interest to clients, we may publish a
</font><font>vote bulletin after the meeting, disclosing and explaining our vote on key proposals. We also publish a quarterly list of all </font><font>companies with which we engaged and the key topics addressed in the engagement meeting.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>In this way, we help inform our clients about the work we do on their behalf in promoting the governance and business </font><font>models that support durable, long-term value creation.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

with the BlackRock Investment Stewardship Global Principles.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Introduction</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>As stewards of our clients’ investments, BlackRock believes it has a responsibility to engage with management teams and/or </font><font>board members on material business issues and, for those clients who have given us authority, to vote proxies in the best
</font><font>long-term economic interests of their assets.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The following issue-specific proxy voting guidelines (the </font><font>“</font><font>Guidelines</font><font>”</font><font>) summarize BlackRock Investment
Stewardship’s </font><font>(</font><font>“</font><font>BIS</font><font>”</font><font>) philosophy and approach to engagement and voting, as well as our view of governance best practices and the roles
</font><font>and responsibilities of boards and directors for publicly listed U.S. companies. These Guidelines are not intended to limit the </font><font>analysis of individual issues at specific companies or provide a guide to how BIS will engage and/or vote in every instance.
</font><font>They are to be applied with discretion, taking into consideration the range of issues and facts specific to the company, as well </font><font>as individual ballot items at shareholder meetings.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Voting guidelines</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>These guidelines are divided into eight key themes, which group together the issues that frequently appear on the agenda of
</font><font>shareholder meetings:</font></div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Boards and directors</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Auditors and audit-related issues</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>

</div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Material sustainability-related risks and opportunities</font></div> </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>General corporate
governance matters</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Shareholder
protections</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div><font>Boards and directors</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>An effective and well-functioning board is critical to the economic success of the company and the protection of
</font><font>shareholders’ interests, inducting the establishment of appropriate governance structures that facilitate oversight of </font><font>management and the company’s strategic initiatives. As part of their responsibilities, board members owe fiduciary duties to </font><font>shareholders in overseeing the strategic direction, operations, and risk management of the company. For this reason, BIS sees
</font><font>engagement with and the election of directors as one of our most critical responsibilities.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Disclosure of material issues that affect the company’s long-term strategy and value creation, including, when relevant, </font><font>material sustainability-related factors, is essential for shareholders to appropriately understand and assess how effectively
</font><font>the board is identifying, managing, and mitigating risks.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Where a company has not adequately demonstrated, through actions and/or disclosures, how material issues are </font><font>appropriately
identified, managed, and overseen, we will consider voting against the re-election of those directors </font><font>responsible for the oversight of such issues, as indicated below.</font></div>
</div> <div> <div><font>Independence</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>It is our view that a majority of the directors on the board should be independent to
ensure objectivity in the decision-making </font><font>of the board and its ability to oversee management. In addition, all members of audit, compensation, and </font><font>nominating/governance committees should be independent. Our view of independence may vary from listing standards.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Common impediments to independence may include:</font></div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Employment as a senior executive by the company or a subsidiary within the past five
years</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>An equity
ownership in the company in excess of 20%</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Having any other interest, business, or relationship (professional or personal) which could, or
could reasonably be </font><font>perceived to, materially interfere with the director’s ability to act in the best interests of the company and its </font><font>shareholders. We may vote against directors who we do not consider to be independent, including at controlled </font><font>companies,
when we believe oversight could be enhanced with greater independent director representation. To signal </font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>our concerns, we may also vote
against the chair of the nominating/governance committee, or where no chair exists, </font><font>the nominating/governance committee member with the longest tenure.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>Oversight role of the board</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The board should exercise appropriate oversight of management and the business activities
of the company. Where we </font><font>determine that a board has failed to do so in a way that may impede a company’s long-term value, we may vote against the </font><font>responsible committees and/or individual directors.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Common circumstances are illustrated below:</font></div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Where the board has failed to facilitate quality, independent auditing or accounting practices, we may vote against </font><font>members
of the audit committee</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Where the company
has failed to provide shareholders with adequate disclosure to conclude that appropriate strategic </font><font>consideration is given to material risk factors (including, where relevant,
sustainability factors), we may vote against </font><font>members of the responsible committee, or the most relevant director</font></div> </div> <div>
</div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Where it appears that a director has acted (at the company or at other companies) in a manner
that compromises their </font><font>ability to represent the best long-term economic interests of shareholders, we may vote against that individual</font></div> </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Where a director
has a multi-year pattern of poor attendance at combined board and applicable committee meetings, or </font><font>a director has poor attendance in a single year with no disclosed rationale, we
may vote against that individual. </font><font>Excluding exigent circumstances, BIS generally considers attendance at less than 75% of the combined board and </font><font>applicable committee meetings to be poor attendance</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Where a director serves on an excessive number of boards, which may limit their capacity to
focus on each board’s </font><font>needs, we may vote against that individual. The following identifies the maximum number of boards on which a director </font><font>may serve, before BIS considers them to be over-committed:</font><font> </font></div> </div>

</font><font>around the world. In particular, where a director maintains a Chair role of a publicly listed company in European markets, we </font><font>may consider that responsibility as equal to two board commitments, consistent with our EMEA Proxy Voting Guidelines. We
</font><font>will take the total number of board commitments across our global policies into account for director elections.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Risk oversight</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Companies should have an established process for identifying, monitoring, and managing
business and material risks. </font><font>Independent directors should have access to relevant management information and outside advice, as appropriate, to ensure </font><font>they can properly oversee risk. We encourage companies to provide transparency around risk management, mitigation, and
</font><font>reporting to the board. We are particularly interested in understanding how risk oversight processes evolve in response to </font><font>changes in corporate strategy and/or shifts in the business and related risk environment. Comprehensive disclosures provide
</font><font>investors with a sense of the company’s long-term risk management practices and, more broadly, the quality of the board’s </font><font>oversight. In the absence of robust disclosures, we may reasonably conclude that companies are not adequately managing
</font><font>risk.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Board Structure</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Classified board of directors/staggered terms</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Directors should be re-elected annually; classification of the board generally limits shareholders’ rights to regularly evaluate a </font><font>board’s performance and select directors. While we will typically support proposals requesting board de-classification, we </font><font>may make exceptions, should the board articulate an appropriate strategic rationale for a classified board structure. This may
</font><font>include when a company needs consistency and stability during a time of transition, e.g., newly public companies or </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

classified board structure may also be justified at non-operating </font><font>companies, e.g., closed-end funds or business development companies (</font><font>“</font><font>BDC</font><font>”</font><font>),</font><font>16</font><font> in certain
circumstances. However, in </font><font>these instances, boards should periodically review the rationale for a classified structure and consider when annual elections </font><font>might be more appropriate.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Without a voting mechanism to immediately address concerns about a specific director, we may choose to vote against the
</font><font>directors up for election at the time (see </font><font>“</font><font>Shareholder rights</font><font>”</font><font> for additional
detail).</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Independent
leadership</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>There are two commonly accepted structures for independent
leadership to balance the CEO role in the boardroom: 1) an </font><font>independent Chair; or 2) a Lead Independent director when the roles of Chair and CEO are combined, or when the Chair is
</font><font>otherwise not independent.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In the absence of a significant governance concern, we defer to boards to designate the most appropriate leadership
</font><font>structure to ensure adequate balance and independence.</font><font>17</font><font> However, BIS may vote against the most senior non-executive </font><font>member of the board when appropriate independence is lacking in
designated leadership roles.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In the event that the board chooses to
have a combined Chair/CEO or a non-independent Chair, we support the designation </font><font>of a Lead Independent director, with the ability to: 1) provide formal input into board meeting
agendas; 2) call meetings of </font><font>the independent directors; and 3) preside at meetings of independent directors. These roles and responsibilities should be </font><font>disclosed and easily accessible.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The following table illustrates examples</font><font>18</font><font> of responsibilities under each board leadership model:</font><font> </font></div> </div>

<div> <div><font>CEO and
management succession planning</font><font> </font></div> <div> <div><font>Companies should have a robust CEO and senior management succession plan in place at the board level that is reviewed </font><font>and
updated on a regular basis. Succession planning should cover scenarios over both the long-term, consistent with the </font><font>strategic direction of the company and identified leadership
needs over time, as well as the short-term, in the event of an </font><font>unanticipated executive departure. We encourage the company to explain their executive succession planning process,
</font><font>including where accountability lies within the boardroom for this task, without prematurely divulging sensitive information </font><font>commonly associated with this exercise.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>During a CEO transition, companies may elect for the departing CEO to maintain a role in the boardroom. We ask for
</font><font>disclosures to understand the timeframe and responsibilities of this role. In such instances, we typically look for the board to </font><font>have appropriate independent leadership structures in place. (See chart above.)</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Director</font><font> </font><font>compensation</font><font> </font><font>and</font><font> </font><font>equity</font><font> programs</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Compensation for directors should generally be structured to attract and retain directors, while also aligning their interests
</font><font>with those of shareholders. In our view, director compensation packages that are based on the company’s long-term value </font><font>creation and include some form of long-term equity compensation are more likely to meet this goal.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Board composition and effectiveness</font><font>
</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Director</font><font> </font><font>qualifications</font><font> </font><font>and</font><font> </font><font>skills</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>We encourage boards to periodically review director qualifications and skills to ensure
relevant experience and diverse </font><font>perspectives are represented in the boardroom. To this end, performance reviews and skills assessments should be </font><font>conducted by the nominating/governance committee or the Lead Independent Director. This process may include internal </font><font>board
evaluations; however, boards may also find it useful to periodically conduct an assessment with a third party. We </font><font>encourage boards to disclose their approach to evaluations,
including objectives of the evaluation; if an external party </font><font>conducts the evaluation; the frequency of the evaluations; and, whether that evaluation occurs on an individual
director </font><font>basis.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Board</font><font> </font><font>term</font><font> </font><font>limits and</font><font> </font><font>director</font><font> tenure</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Where boards find that age limits or term limits are the most efficient and objective
mechanism for ensuring periodic board </font><font>refreshment, we generally defer to the board’s determination in setting such limits. BIS will also consider the average board </font><font>tenure to evaluate processes for board renewal. We may oppose boards that appear to have an insufficient mix of short-,
</font><font>medium-, and long-tenured directors.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Board</font><font> </font><font>diversity</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>As noted above, highly qualified, engaged directors with professional characteristics relevant to a company’s business
</font><font>enhance the ability of the board to add value and be the voice of shareholders in board discussions. In our view, a strong </font><font>board provides a competitive advantage to a company, providing valuable oversight and contributing to the most important
</font><font>management decisions that support long-term financial performance.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>It is in this context that we are interested in diversity in the boardroom. We see it as a means to promoting diversity of </font><font>thought and avoiding ‘group think’ in the board’s exercise of its responsibilities to advise and oversee management. It allows </font><font>boards to have deeper discussions and make more resilient decisions. We ask boards to disclose how diversity is considered
</font><font>in board composition, including professional characteristics, such as a director’s industry experience, specialist areas of </font><font>expertise and geographic location; as well as demographic characteristics such as gender, race/ ethnicity, and age.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>We look to understand a board’s diversity in the context of a company’s
domicile, market capitalization, business model, and </font><font>strategy. Increasingly, we see leading boards adding members whose experience deepens the board’s understanding of the
</font><font>company’s customers, employees, and communities. Self- identified board demographic diversity can usefully be disclosed in </font><font>aggregate, consistent with local law. We believe boards should aspire to meaningful diversity of membership, at least
</font><font>consistent with local regulatory requirements and best practices, while recognizing that building a strong, diverse board can </font><font>take time.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>This
position is based on our view that diversity of perspective and thought—in the boardroom, in the management team </font><font>and throughout the company—leads to better long-term
economic outcomes for companies. Academic and other research </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>reveals correlations between specific dimensions
of diversity and effects on decision-making processes and outcomes.</font><font>19</font><font> In </font><font>our experience, greater diversity in the boardroom contributes to more robust discussions and more innovative and resilient
</font><font>decisions. Over time, greater diversity in the boardroom can also promote greater diversity and resilience in the leadership </font><font>team, and the workforce more broadly. That diversity can enable companies to develop businesses that more closely reflect
</font><font>and resonate with the customers and communities they serve.</font></div> <div> <div><font>In the U.S., we believe that boards should aspire to at least 30% diversity of
membership,</font><font>20</font><font> and we encourage large </font><font>companies, such as those in the S&amp;P 500, to lead in achieving this standard. In our view, an informative indicator of diversity </font><font>for such companies is having at least two women and a director who identifies as a member of an underrepresented group.</font><font>21</font><font> </font><font>We
recognize that it may take time and that companies with smaller market capitalizations and in certain sectors may face </font><font>more challenges in pursuing diversity. Among these smaller
companies, we look for the presence of diversity and take into </font><font>consideration the progress that companies are making.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>In order to help investors understand overall diversity, we look to boards to
disclose:</font></div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>How diversity, including demographic factors and professional characteristics, is considered in board composition, given </font><font>the
company’s long-term strategy and business model</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>How directors’ professional characteristics, which may include domain expertise such as finance or technology, and
</font><font>sector- or market-specific experience, are complementary and link to the company’s long-term strategy</font></div> </div> <div> </div>
</div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>The process by which candidates for board positions are identified, including whether
professional firms or other </font><font>resources outside of incumbent directors’ networks are engaged to identify and/or assess candidates, and whether a </font><font>diverse slate of nominees is considered for all available board nominations</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div>
<div> <div><font>To the extent that, based on our assessment of corporate disclosures, a company has not
adequately explained their </font><font>approach to diversity in their board composition, we may vote against members of the nominating/governance committee. </font><font>Our publicly available commentary provides more information on our approach to board diversity.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Board</font><font>
</font><font>size</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>We typically defer to the board in setting the appropriate size and believe that directors are generally in the best position to </font><font>assess the optimal board size to ensure effectiveness. However, we may vote against the appropriate committees and/or
</font><font>individual directors if, in our view, the board is ineffective in its oversight, either because it is too small to allow for the </font><font>necessary range of skills and experience or too large to function efficiently.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Board responsiveness and shareholder rights</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Shareholder rights</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Where we determine that a board has not acted in the best interests of the company’s
shareholders, or takes action to </font><font>unreasonably limit shareholder rights, we may vote against the appropriate committees and/or individual directors. Common </font><font>circumstances are illustrated below:</font></div> </div> <div> <div>

<div> <div><font>particular concern may not be
subject to election in the year that the concern arises. In such situations, we may register </font><font>our concern by voting against the most relevant director(s) up for
election.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Responsiveness to
shareholders</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>A board should be engaged and responsive to the
company’s shareholders, including acknowledging voting outcomes for </font><font>director elections, compensation, shareholder proposals, and other ballot items. Where we determine that a
board has not </font><font>substantially addressed shareholder concerns that we deem material to the business, we may vote against the responsible </font><font>committees and/or individual directors. Common circumstances are illustrated below:</font></div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>The Independent Chair or Lead Independent Director, members of the nominating/governance committee, and/or the </font><font>longest
tenured director(s), where we observe a lack of board responsiveness to shareholders, evidence of board </font><font>entrenchment, and/or failure to plan for adequate board member
succession</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>The chair of the
nominating/governance committee, or where no chair exists, the nominating/governance committee </font><font>member with the longest tenure, where board member(s) at the most recent election of
directors have received against </font><font>votes from more than 25% of shares voted, and the board has not taken appropriate action to respond to shareholder </font><font>concerns. This may not apply in cases where BIS did not support the initial vote against such board member(s)</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>The Independent Chair or Lead Independent Director and/or members of the nominating/governance
committee, </font><font>where a board fails to consider shareholder proposals that (1) receive substantial support, and (2) in our view, have a </font><font>material impact on the business, shareholder rights, or the potential for long-term value creation</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Majority vote requirements</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Directors should generally be elected by a majority of the shares voted. We will normally
support proposals seeking to </font><font>introduce bylaws requiring a majority vote standard for director elections. Majority vote standards generally assist in ensuring </font><font>that directors who are not broadly supported by shareholders are not elected to serve as their representatives. As a best
</font><font>practice, companies with either a majority vote standard or a plurality vote standard should adopt a resignation policy for </font><font>directors who do not receive support from at least a majority of votes cast. Where the company already has a sufficiently
</font><font>robust majority voting process in place, we may not support a shareholder proposal seeking an alternative mechanism.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>We note that majority voting may not be appropriate in all circumstances, for example, in
the context of a contested election, </font><font>or for majority-controlled companies or those with concentrated ownership structures.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Cumulative voting</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>As stated above, a majority vote standard is generally in the best long-term interests of
shareholders, as it ensures director </font><font>accountability through the requirement to be elected by more than half of the votes cast. As such, we will generally oppose </font><font>proposals requesting the adoption of cumulative voting, which may disproportionately aggregate votes on certain issues or
</font><font>director candidates.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Auditors and audit-related issues</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>BIS recognizes the critical importance of financial statements to provide a complete and accurate portrayal of a company’s </font><font>financial condition. Consistent with our approach to voting on directors, we seek to hold the audit committee of the board
</font><font>responsible for overseeing the management of the independent auditor and the internal audit function at a company.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>We may vote against the audit committee members where the board has failed to facilitate
quality, independent auditing. We </font><font>look to public disclosures for insight into the scope of the audit committee responsibilities, including an overview of audit </font><font>committee processes, issues on the audit committee agenda, and key decisions taken by the audit committee. We take
</font><font>particular note of cases involving significant financial restatements or material weakness disclosures, and we look for timely </font><font>disclosure and remediation of accounting irregularities.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The integrity of financial statements depends on the auditor effectively fulfilling its role. To that end, we favor an independent </font><font>auditor. In addition, to the extent that an auditor fails to reasonably identify and address issues that eventually lead to a
</font><font>significant financial restatement, or the audit firm has violated standards of practice, we may also vote against ratification.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>From time to time, shareholder proposals may be presented to promote auditor independence
or the rotation of audit firms. </font><font>We may support these proposals when they are consistent with our views as described above.</font><font> </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>Capital
structure proposals</font><font> </font></div> <div> <div><font>Equal voting rights</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In our view, shareholders should be entitled to voting rights in proportion to their economic interests. In addition, companies </font><font>that have implemented dual or multiple class share structures should review these structures on a regular basis, or as
</font><font>company circumstances change. Companies with multiple share classes should receive shareholder approval of their capital </font><font>structure on a periodic basis via a management proposal on the company’s proxy. The proposal should give unaffiliated
</font><font>shareholders the opportunity to affirm the current structure or establish mechanisms to end or phase out controlling </font><font>structures at the appropriate time, while minimizing costs to shareholders. Where companies are unwilling to voluntarily
</font><font>implement </font><font>“</font><font>one share, one
vote</font><font>”</font><font> within a specified timeframe, or are unresponsive to shareholder feedback for change over </font><font>time, we generally support shareholder proposals to recapitalize stock into a single voting class.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Blank check preferred stock</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>We frequently oppose proposals requesting authorization of a class of preferred stock with unspecified voting, conversion, </font><font>dividend distribution, and other rights (</font><font>“</font><font>blank
check</font><font>”</font><font> preferred stock) because they may serve as a transfer of authority from </font><font>shareholders to the board and as a possible entrenchment device. We generally view the board’s discretion to establish
</font><font>voting rights on a when-issued basis as a potential anti-takeover device, as it affords the board the ability to place a block of </font><font>stock with an investor sympathetic to management, thereby foiling a takeover bid without a shareholder vote.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Nonetheless, we may support the proposal where the company:</font></div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Appears to have a legitimate financing motive for requesting blank check authority</font></div>
</div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Has committed
publicly that blank check preferred shares will not be used for anti-takeover purposes</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Has a history of using blank check preferred stock for financings</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Has blank check preferred stock previously outstanding such that an increase would not
necessarily provide further anti-</font><font>takeover protection but may provide greater financing flexibility</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Increase in authorized common shares</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>BIS will evaluate requests to increase authorized shares on a case-by-case basis, in
conjunction with industry-specific norms </font><font>and potential dilution, as well as a company’s history with respect to the use of its common shares.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Increase or issuance of preferred stock</font></div>
</div> <div> <div><font>We generally support proposals to increase or issue preferred stock in cases where
the company specifies the voting, </font><font>dividend, conversion, and other rights of such stock and where the terms of the preferred stock appear reasonable.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Stock splits</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>We generally support stock splits that are not likely to negatively affect the ability to
trade shares or the economic value of a </font><font>share. We generally support reverse stock splits that are designed to avoid delisting or to facilitate trading in the stock, where </font><font>the reverse split will not have a negative impact on share value (e.g., one class is reduced while others remain at pre-split
</font><font>levels). In the event of a proposal for a reverse split that would not proportionately reduce the company’s authorized stock, </font><font>we apply the same analysis we would use for a proposal to increase authorized stock.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Mergers, acquisitions, transactions, and other special situations</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Mergers, acquisitions, and transactions</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In assessing mergers, acquisitions, or other transactions – including business combinations involving Special Purpose
</font><font>Acquisition Companies (</font><font>“</font><font>SPACs</font><font>”</font><font>) – BIS’ primary consideration is the long-term economic interests of our clients as </font><font>shareholders. Boards should clearly explain the economic and strategic rationale for any proposed transactions or material
</font><font>changes to the business. We will review a proposed transaction to determine the degree to which it has the potential to </font><font>enhance long-term shareholder value. While mergers, acquisitions, asset sales, business combinations, and other special
</font><font>transaction proposals vary widely in scope and substance, we closely examine certain salient features in our analyses, such </font><font>as:</font></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>The degree to
which the proposed transaction represents a premium to the company’s trading price. We consider the </font><font>share price over multiple time periods prior to the date of the merger
announcement. We may consider comparable </font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

approval and arm’s-length negotiations are preferred. We will consider whether the transaction </font><font>involves a dissenting board or does not appear to be the result of an
arm’s-length bidding process. We may also consider </font><font>whether executive and/or board members’ financial interests appear likely to affect their ability to place
shareholders’ </font><font>interests before their own, as well as measures taken to address conflicts of interest</font></div> </div> <div> </div>
</div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>We prefer transaction proposals that include the fairness opinion of a reputable financial
advisor assessing the value of </font><font>the transaction to shareholders in comparison to recent similar transactions</font></div> </div> <div> </div>
</div> <div> <div><font>Contested director elections and special
situations</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Contested elections and other special situations</font><font>22</font><font> are assessed on a case-by-case basis. We evaluate a number of factors, </font><font>which may include: the qualifications and past performance of the dissident and management candidates; the validity of the
</font><font>concerns identified by the dissident; the viability of both the dissident’s and management’s plans; the ownership stake and </font><font>holding period of the dissident; the likelihood that the dissident’s strategy will produce the desired change; and whether the </font><font>dissident represents the best option for enhancing long-term shareholder value.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>We will evaluate the actions that the company has taken to limit shareholders’ ability to exercise the right to nominate </font><font>dissident director candidates, including those actions taken absent the immediate threat of a contested situation. BIS may
</font><font>take voting action against directors (up to and including the full board) where those actions are viewed as egregiously </font><font>infringing on shareholder rights.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>We will consider a variety of possible voting outcomes in contested situations, including the ability to support a mix of
</font><font>management and dissident nominees.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Poison pill plans</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Where a poison pill is put to a shareholder vote by management, our policy is to examine these plans individually. Although
</font><font>we have historically opposed most plans, we may support plans that include a reasonable </font><font>“</font><font>qualifying offer clause.</font><font>”</font><font> Such </font><font>clauses typically require shareholder ratification of the pill and stipulate a sunset provision whereby the pill expires unless it is </font><font>renewed. These clauses also tend to specify that an all-cash bid for all shares that includes a fairness opinion and evidence of </font><font>financing does not trigger the pill, but forces either a special meeting at which the offer is put to a shareholder vote or
</font><font>requires the board to seek the written consent of shareholders, where shareholders could rescind the pill at their discretion. </font><font>We may also support a pill where it is the only effective method for protecting tax or other economic benefits that may be
</font><font>associated with limiting the ownership changes of individual shareholders. Lastly, we look for shareholder approval of poison </font><font>pill plans within one year of adoption of implementation.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Reimbursement of expenses for successful shareholder campaigns</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>We generally do not support shareholder proposals seeking the reimbursement of proxy contest expenses, even in situations </font><font>where we support the shareholder campaign. Introducing the possibility of such reimbursement may incentivize disruptive </font><font>and
unnecessary shareholder campaigns.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Executive compensation</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>A company’s board of directors should put in place a compensation structure that balances incentivizing, rewarding, and </font><font>retaining executives appropriately across a wide range of business outcomes. This structure should be aligned with
</font><font>shareholder interests, particularly the generation of sustainable, long-term value.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The compensation committee should carefully consider the specific circumstances of the company and the key individuals </font><font>the board is focused on incentivizing. We encourage companies to ensure that their compensation plans incorporate
</font><font>appropriate and rigorous performance metrics, consistent with corporate strategy and market practice. Performance-based </font><font>compensation should include metrics that are relevant to the business and stated strategy and/or risk mitigation efforts.
</font><font>Goals, and the processes used to set these goals, should be clearly articulated and appropriately rigorous. We use third party </font></div> </div> </div> <div>

<div><font>Special situations are broadly defined as events that are non-routine and differ from the
normal course of business for a company’s shareholder </font><font>meeting, involving a solicitation other than by management with respect to the exercise of voting rights in a manner
inconsistent with management’s </font><font>recommendation. These may include instances where shareholders nominate director candidates, oppose the view of management and/or the board
</font><font>on mergers, acquisitions, or other transactions, etc.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>research, in addition to our own analysis, to
evaluate existing and proposed compensation structures. We hold members of </font><font>the compensation committee, or equivalent board members, accountable for poor compensation practices
and/or </font><font>structures.</font></div> <div> <div><font>There should be a clear link between variable pay and company performance that drives sustained value creation for our
</font><font>clients as shareholders. Where compensation structures provide for a
front-loaded</font><font>23</font><font> award, we look for appropriate </font><font>structures (including vesting and/or holding periods) that motivate sustained performance for shareholders over a number </font><font>of
years. We generally do not favor programs focused on awards that require performance levels to be met and maintained </font><font>for a relatively short time period for payouts to be earned,
unless there are extended vesting and/or holding requirements.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Compensation structures should generally drive outcomes that align the pay of the executives with performance of the </font><font>company and the value received by shareholders. When evaluating performance, we examine both executive teams’ efforts,
</font><font>as well as outcomes realized by shareholders. Payouts to executives should reflect both the executive’s contributions to the </font><font>company’s ongoing success, as well as exogenous factors that impacted shareholder value. Where discretion has been used
</font><font>by the compensation committee, we look for disclosures relating to how and why the discretion was used and how the </font><font>adjusted outcome is aligned with the interests of shareholders. While we believe special
awards</font><font>24</font><font> should be used sparingly, </font><font>we acknowledge that there may be instances when such awards are appropriate. When evaluating these awards, we consider </font><font>a
variety of factors, including the magnitude and structure of the award, the scope of award recipients, the alignment of the </font><font>grant with shareholder value, and the company’s
historical use of such awards, in addition to other company-specific </font><font>circumstances.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>We acknowledge that the use of peer group evaluation by compensation committees can help calibrate competitive pay; </font><font>however, we are concerned when the rationale for increases in total compensation is solely based on peer benchmarking.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>We support incentive plans that foster the sustainable achievement of results – both
financial and non-financial – consistent </font><font>with the company’s strategic initiatives. Compensation committees should guard against contractual arrangements that </font><font>would entitle executives to material compensation for early termination of their contract. Finally, pension contributions and
</font><font>other deferred compensation arrangements should be reasonable in light of market practices. Our publicly available </font><font>commentary provides more information on our approach to executive compensation.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Where executive compensation appears excessive relative to the performance of the company and/or compensation paid by </font><font>peers, or where an equity compensation plan is not aligned with shareholders’ interests, we may vote against members of
</font><font>the compensation committee.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>“</font><font>Say on Pay</font><font>”</font><font> advisory resolutions</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>In cases where there is a </font><font>“</font><font>Say on Pay</font><font>”</font><font> vote, BIS will respond to the proposal as informed by our evaluation of compensation </font><font>practices at that particular company
and in a manner that appropriately addresses the specific question posed to </font><font>shareholders. Where we conclude that a company has failed to align pay with performance, we will vote
against the </font><font>management compensation proposal and relevant compensation committee members.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Frequency of
</font><font>“</font><font>Say on Pay</font><font>”</font><font> advisory resolutions</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>BIS will generally support annual advisory votes on executive compensation. It is our view
that shareholders should have the </font><font>opportunity to express feedback on annual incentive programs and changes to long-term compensation before multiple </font><font>cycles are issued. Where a company has failed to implement a </font><font>“</font><font>Say on Pay</font><font>”</font><font> advisory vote within the frequency
period that </font><font>received the most support from shareholders or a </font><font>“</font><font>Say on Pay</font><font>”</font><font> resolution is omitted without
explanation, BIS may vote </font><font>against members of the compensation committee.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Clawback proposals</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>We generally favor prompt recoupment from any senior executive whose compensation was based on faulty financial </font><font>reporting or deceptive business practices. We also favor prompt recoupment from any senior executive whose behavior </font><font>caused
material financial harm to shareholders, material reputational risk to the company, or resulted in a criminal </font><font>proceeding, even if such actions did not ultimately result in a
material restatement of past results. This includes, but is not </font><font>limited to, settlement agreements arising from such behavior and paid for directly by the company. We typically
support </font><font>shareholder proposals on these matters unless the company already has a robust clawback policy that sufficiently addresses </font><font>our concerns.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>Employee stock
purchase plans</font></div> <div> <div><font>Employee stock purchase plans (</font><font>“</font><font>ESPP</font><font>”</font><font>) are an important part of a company’s overall human capital management strategy </font><font>and can provide performance
incentives to help align employees’ interests with those of shareholders. The most common </font><font>form of ESPP qualifies for favorable tax treatment under Section 423 of the Internal
Revenue Code. We will typically support </font><font>qualified ESPP proposals.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Equity compensation plans</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>BIS supports equity plans that align the economic interests of directors, managers, and other employees with those of </font><font>shareholders. Boards should establish policies prohibiting the use of equity awards in a manner that could disrupt the
</font><font>intended alignment with shareholder interests, such as the excessive pledging or heading of stock. We may support
</font><font>shareholder proposals requesting the establishment of such policies.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Our evaluation of equity compensation plans is based on a company’s executive pay and performance relative to peers and </font><font>whether the plan plays a significant role in a pay-for-performance disconnect. We generally oppose plans that contain
</font><font>“</font><font>evergreen</font><font>”</font><font> provisions, which allow for automatic annual increases of shares available for grant without requiring further </font><font>shareholder
approval; we note that the aggregate impacts of such increases are difficult to predict and may lead to significant </font><font>dilution. We also generally oppose plans that allow for
repricing without shareholder approval. We may oppose plans that </font><font>provide for the acceleration of vesting of equity awards even in situations where an actual change of control may
not occur. </font><font>We encourage companies to structure their change of control provisions to require the termination of the covered employee </font><font>before acceleration or special payments are triggered (commonly referred to as </font><font>“</font><font>double trigger</font><font>”</font><font> change of control </font><font>provisions).</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Golden parachutes</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>We generally view golden parachutes as encouragement to management to consider transactions that might be beneficial to
</font><font>shareholders. However, a large potential payout under a golden parachute arrangement also presents the risk of motivating a </font><font>management team to support a sub-optimal sale price for a company.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>When determining whether to support or oppose an advisory vote on a golden parachute plan, BIS may consider several </font><font>factors,
including:</font></div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Whether we determine that the triggering event is in the best interests of shareholders</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Whether management attempted to maximize shareholder value in the triggering event</font></div>
</div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>The percentage of
total premium or transaction value that will be transferred to the management team, rather than </font><font>shareholders, as a result of the golden parachute payment</font></div> </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>•</font></div> <div><font>Whether
excessively large excise tax gross-up payments are part of the pay-out</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>

<div> <div><font>There may be legitimate instances where underwater options create an overhang on a

company’s executive pension plans do not contain excessive </font><font>benefits beyond what is offered under employee- wide plans.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Material sustainability-related risks and
opportunities</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>It is our view that well-run companies, where
appropriate, effectively evaluate and manage material sustainability-related </font><font>risks and opportunities</font><font>25</font><font> as a core component of their long-term value creation for shareholder and business
strategy. At the </font><font>board level, appropriate governance structures and responsibilities allow for effective oversight of the strategic </font><font>implementation of material sustainability issues.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>When assessing how to vote – including on the election of directors and relevant shareholder proposals – robust disclosures </font><font>are essential for investors to understand, where appropriate, how companies are integrating material sustainability risks and
</font><font>opportunities across their business and strategic, long-term planning. Where a company has failed to appropriately provide </font><font>robust disclosures and evidence of effective business practices, BIS may express concerns through our engagement and </font><font>voting.
As part of this consideration, we encourage companies to produce sustainability-related disclosures sufficiently in </font><font>advance of their annual meeting so that the disclosures can be
considered in relevant vote decisions.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>We encourage disclosures aligned
with the reporting framework developed by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial </font><font>Disclosures (TCFD), supported by industry-specific metrics, such as those identified by the
Sustainability Accounting </font><font>Standards Board (SASB), now part of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) under the International Financial </font><font>Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation.</font><font>26</font><font> While the TCFD framework was developed to support climate-related risk </font><font>disclosures, the four pillars of the TCFD –
governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets – are a useful way </font><font>for companies to disclose how they identify, assess, manage, and oversee a variety of
sustainability-related risks and </font><font>opportunities. SASB’s</font><font>27</font><font> industry-specific metrics are beneficial in helping companies identify key performance indicators </font><font>(</font><font>“</font><font>KPIs</font><font>”</font><font>) across various dimensions of sustainability that are considered to be financially material. We recognize that some
</font><font>companies may report using different standards, which may be required by regulation, or one of a number of private </font><font>standards. In such cases, we ask that companies highlight the metrics that are industry- or company-specific.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>We look to companies to:</font></div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Disclose the identification, assessment, management, and oversight of material sustainability-
related risks and </font><font>opportunities in accordance with the four pillars of TCFD</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>•</font></div>
<div><font>Publish material, investor-relevant, industry-specific metrics and rigorous targets, aligned
with SASB (ISSB) or </font><font>comparable sustainability reporting standards</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Companies should also disclose any material supranational standards adopted, the industry
initiatives in which they </font><font>participate, any peer group benchmarking undertaken, and any assurance processes to help investors understand their </font><font>approach to sustainable and responsible business conduct.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Climate risk</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>
<div> <hr/> </div> <div>
<div> <div><font>25</font></div>
<div><font>By material sustainability-related risks and opportunities, we mean the drivers of risk and
value creation in a company’s business model that have an </font><font>environmental or social dependency or impact. Examples of environmental issues include, but are not limited to, water
use, land use, waste </font><font>management, and climate risk. Examples of social issues include, but are not limited to, human capital management, impacts on the communities in </font><font>which a company operates, customer loyalty, and relationships with regulators. It is our view that well-run companies will effectively evaluate and </font><font>manage material sustainability-related risks and opportunities relevant to their businesses. Governance is the core means by which boards can </font><font>oversee the creation of durable, long-term value. Appropriate risk oversight of business-relevant and material sustainability-related considerations is a </font><font>component of a sound governance framework.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div>
<div><font>26</font></div>
<div><font>The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation announced in November 2021
the formation of an International Sustainability </font><font>Standards Board (ISSB) to develop a comprehensive global baseline of high-quality sustainability disclosure standards to meet
investors’ information </font><font>needs. SASB standards will over time be adapted to ISSB standards but are the reference reporting tool in the meantime.</font></div> </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>27</font></div> <div><font>The ISSB has committed to build upon the SASB standards, which identify material, sustainability-related disclosures across sectors. SASB Standards </font><font>can be used to provide a baseline of investor-focused sustainability disclosure and to implement the principles-based framework recommended by </font><font>the TCFD, which is also incorporated into the ISSB’s Climate Exposure Draft. Similarly, SASB Standards enable robust implementation of the </font><font>Integrated Reporting Framework, providing the comparability sought by investors.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>It is our view that climate change has become a
key factor in many companies’ long-term prospects. As such, as long-term </font><font>investors, we are interested in understanding how companies may be impacted by material
climate-related risks and </font><font>opportunities—just as we seek to understand other business-relevant risks and opportunities—and how these factors are </font><font>considered within their strategy in a manner that is consistent with the company’s business model and sector. Specifically, </font><font>we look for companies to disclose strategies that they have in place that mitigate and are resilient to any material risks to
</font><font>their long-term business model associated with a range of climate-related scenarios, including a scenario in which global </font><font>warming is limited to well below 2°C, and considering global ambitions to achieve a limit of 1.5°C.</font><font>28</font><font> It is, of course, up to
</font><font>each company to define their own strategy: that is not the role of BlackRock or other investors.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>BIS recognizes that climate change can be challenging for many companies, as they seek to drive long-term value by </font><font>mitigating risks and capturing opportunities. A growing number of companies, financial institutions, as well as governments,
</font><font>have committed to advancing decarbonization in line with the Paris Agreement. There is growing consensus that companies </font><font>can benefit from the more favorable macro-economic environment under an orderly, timely, and equitable global energy
</font><font>transition.</font><font>29</font><font> Yet,
 the path ahead is deeply uncertain and uneven, with different parts of the economy moving at different </font><font>speeds.</font><font>30</font><font> Many companies are asking what their role should be in contributing to an orderly and
equitable transition—in </font><font>ensuring a reliable energy supply and energy security and in protecting the most vulnerable from energy price shocks and </font><font>economic dislocation. In this context, we encourage companies to include in their disclosures a business plan for how they
</font><font>intend to deliver long-term financial performance through a transition to global net zero carbon emissions, consistent with </font><font>their business model and sector.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>We look to companies to disclose short-, medium-, and long-term targets, ideally science-based targets where these are
</font><font>available for their sector, for Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reductions and to demonstrate how their </font><font>targets are consistent with the long-term economic interests of their shareholders. Many companies have an opportunity to
</font><font>use and contribute to the development of low carbon energy sources and technologies that will be essential to decarbonizing </font><font>the global economy over time. We also recognize that continued investment in traditional energy sources, including oil and
</font><font>gas, is required to maintain an orderly and equitable transition—and that divestiture of carbon-intensive assets is unlikely to </font><font>contribute to global emissions reductions. We encourage companies to disclose how their capital allocation to various energy
</font><font>sources is consistent with their strategy.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>At this stage, we view Scope 3 emissions differently from Scopes 1 and 2, given methodological complexity, regulatory
</font><font>uncertainty, concerns about double-counting, and lack of direct control by companies. While we welcome any disclosures </font><font>and commitments companies choose to make regarding Scope 3 emissions, we recognize that these are provided on a good-faith</font><font>
basis as methodology develops. Our publicly available commentary provides more information on our approach to </font><font>climate risk and the global energy transition.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Natural capital</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The management of nature-related factors is increasingly a core component of some
companies’ ability to generate </font><font>sustainable, long-term financial returns for shareholders, particularly where a company’s strategy is heavily reliant on the </font><font>availably of natural capital, or whose supply chains are exposed to locations with nature-related risks. We look for such
</font><font>companies to disclose</font><font>31</font><font> how they consider their reliance and use of natural capital, including appropriate risk oversight and </font><font>relevant metrics and
targets, to understand how these factors are integrated into strategy. We will evaluate these disclosures </font><font>to inform our view of how a company is managing material nature-related
risks and opportunities, as well as in our </font><font>assessment of relevant shareholder proposals. Our publicly available commentary provides more information on our </font><font>approach to natural capital.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Key stakeholder interests</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In order to deliver long-term value for shareholders, companies should also consider the interests of their key stakeholders.
</font><font>While stakeholder groups may vary across industries, they are likely to include employees; business partners (such as </font><font>suppliers and distributors); clients and consumers; government and regulators; and the constituents of the communities in
</font><font>which a company operates. Companies that build strong relationships with their key stakeholders are more likely to meet </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div><font>The global aspiration to achieve a net-zero global economy by 2050 is reflective of aggregated
efforts; governments representing over 90% of GDP </font><font>have committed to move to net-zero over the coming decades. In determining how to vote on behalf of clients who have authorized us
to do so, we </font><font>look to companies only to address issues within their control and do not anticipate that they will address matters that are the domain of public policy.</font></div>
</div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><font>29</font></div> <div><font>For example, BlackRock’s Capital Markets Assumptions anticipate 25 points of cumulative economic gains over a 20-year period in an orderly </font><font>transition as compared to the alternative. This better macro environment will support better economic growth, financial stability, job growth, </font><font>productivity, as well as ecosystem stability and health outcomes.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>their own strategic objectives, while poor
relationships may create adverse impacts that expose a company to legal, </font><font>regulatory, operational, and reputational risks.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>Companies should effectively oversee and mitigate material risks related to stakeholders
with appropriate due diligence </font><font>processes and board oversight. Where we determine that company is not appropriately considering their key stakeholder </font><font>interests in a way that poses material financial risk to the company and its shareholders, we may vote against relevant
</font><font>directors or support shareholder proposals related to these topics. Our publicly available commentary provides more </font><font>information on our approach.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Conversely, we note that some shareholder proposals seek to address topics that are clearly within the purview of certain
</font><font>stakeholders. For example, we recognize that topics around taxation and tax reporting are within the domain of local, state, </font><font>and federal authorities. BIS will generally not support these proposals.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Human capital management</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>A company’s approach to human capital management (</font><font>“</font><font>HCM</font><font>”</font><font>) is a critical factor in fostering an
inclusive, diverse, and </font><font>engaged workforce, which contributes to business continuity, innovation, and long-term value creation. Consequently, we </font><font>ask companies to demonstrate a robust approach to HCM and provide shareholders with disclosures to understand how </font><font>their
approach aligns with their stated strategy and business model.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Clear
and consistent disclosures on these matters are critical for investors to make an informed assessment of a company’s </font><font>HCM practices. Companies should disclose the steps they
are taking to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion; job categories </font><font>and workforce demographics; and their responses to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s
EEO-1 Survey. </font><font>Where we believe a company’s disclosures or practices fall short relative to the market or peers, or we are unable to ascertain </font><font>the board and management’s effectiveness in overseeing related risks and opportunities, we may vote against members of
</font><font>the appropriate committee or support relevant shareholder proposals. Our publicly available commentary provides more </font><font>information on our approach to HCM.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Corporate political activities</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Companies may engage in certain political activities, within legal and regulatory limits, in order to support public policy
</font><font>matters material to the companies’ long-term strategies. These activities can also create risks, including: the potential for </font><font>allegations of corruption; certain reputational risks; and risks that arise from the complex legal, regulatory, and compliance
</font><font>considerations associated with corporate political spending and lobbying activity. Companies that engage in political </font><font>activities should develop and maintain robust processes to guide these activities and mitigate risks, including board
</font><font>oversight.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>When depend on companies to provide accessible and clear disclosures so that investors can easily understand how their
</font><font>political activities support their long-term strategy, including on stated public policy priorities. When presented with </font><font>shareholder proposals requesting increased disclosure on corporate political activities, BIS will evaluate publicly available
</font><font>information to consider how a company’s lobbying and political activities may impact the company. We will also evaluate </font><font>whether there is general consistency between a company’s stated positions on policy matters material to their strategy and </font><font>the material positions taken by significant industry groups of which they are a member. We may decide to support a
</font><font>shareholder proposal requesting additional disclosures if we identify a material inconsistency or feel that further transparency </font><font>may clarify how the company’s political activities support its long-term strategy. Our publicly available commentary provides </font><font>more information on our approach to corporate political activities.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>General corporate governance matters</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>IPO governance</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Boards should disclose how the corporate governance structures adopted upon a company’s initial public offering
(</font><font>“</font><font>IPO</font><font>”</font><font>) are </font><font>in shareholders’ best long-term interests. We also ask boards to conduct a regular review of corporate
governance and </font><font>control structures, such that boards might evolve foundational corporate governance structures as company circumstances </font><font>change, without undue costs and disruption to shareholders. In our letter on unequal voting structures, we articulate our
</font><font>view that </font><font>“</font><font>one vote for one
share</font><font>”</font><font> is the preferred structure for publicly-traded companies. We also recognize the potential </font><font>benefits of dual class shares to newly public companies as they establish themselves; however, these structures should have
</font><font>a specific and limited duration. We will generally engage new companies on topics such as classified boards and
</font><font>supermajority vote provisions to amend bylaws, as we think that such arrangements may not be in the best interests of </font><font>shareholders over the long-term.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>We may apply a one-year grace period for the
application of certain director-related guidelines (including, but not limited to, </font><font>responsibilities on other public company boards and board composition concerns), during which we
ask boards to take steps </font><font>to bring corporate governance standards in line with our policies.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>Further, if a company qualifies as an emerging growth company (an </font><font>“</font><font>EGC</font><font>”</font><font>) under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups
Act of </font><font>2012 (the </font><font>“</font><font>JOBS Act</font><font>”</font><font>), we will give consideration to the NYSE and NASDAQ governance exemptions granted under the JOBS </font><font>Act for the duration such a company is categorized as an EGC. An EGC should have an independent audit committee by the </font><font>first
anniversary of its IPO, with our standard approach to voting on auditors and audit-related issues applicable in full for an </font><font>EGC on the first anniversary of its IPO.</font></div>

<div> <div><font>Proposals to change a corporation’s form, including those to convert to a public

interests of </font><font>shareholders would be augmented or adversely affected with the change to a PBC. These disclosures should also include the </font><font>accountability and voting mechanisms that would be available to shareholders. We generally support management proposals </font><font>to
convert to a PBC if our analysis indicates that shareholders’ interests are adequately protected. Corporate form </font><font>shareholder proposals are evaluated on a case-by-case
basis.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Exclusive forum
provisions</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>BIS generally supports proposals to seek exclusive forum for

against the </font><font>Independent Chair or Lead Independent director and members of the nominating/governance committee.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Reincorporation</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>We will evaluate the economic and strategic rationale behind the company’s proposal
to reincorporate on a case-by-case </font><font>basis. In all instances, we will evaluate the changes to shareholder protections under the new charter/articles/bylaws to </font><font>assess whether the move increases or decreases shareholder protections. Where we find that shareholder protections are
</font><font>diminished, we may support reincorporation if we determine that the overall benefits outweigh the diminished rights.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Multi-jurisdictional companies</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Where a company is listed on multiple exchanges or incorporated in a country different from
their primary listing, we will </font><font>seek to apply the most relevant market guideline(s) to our analysis of the company’s governance structure and specific </font><font>proposals on the shareholder meeting agenda. In doing so, we typically consider the governance standards of the company’s </font><font>primary listing, the market standards by which the company governs themselves, and the market context of each specific
</font><font>proposal on the agenda. If the relevant standards are silent on the issue under consideration, we will use our professional </font><font>judgment as to what voting outcome would best protect the long-term economic interests of investors. Companies should
</font><font>disclose the rationale for their selection of primary listing, country of incorporation, and choice of governance structures, </font><font>particularly where there is conflict between relevant market governance practices.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Adjourn meeting to solicit additional votes</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>We generally support such proposals unless the agenda contains items that we judge to be
detrimental to shareholders’ best </font><font>long-term economic interests.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Bundled proposals</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Shareholders should have the opportunity to review substantial governance changes individually without having to accept </font><font>bundled proposals. Where several measures are grouped into one proposal, BIS may reject certain positive changes when </font><font>linked
with proposals that generally contradict or impede the rights and economic interests of shareholders.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Other business</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>We oppose voting on matters where we are not given the opportunity to review and understand those measures and carry </font><font>out an

charter/articles/bylaws</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Shareholders should have the right to vote on
key corporate governance matters, including changes to governance </font><font>mechanisms and amendments to the charter/articles/bylaws. We may vote against certain directors where changes to

</font><font>“</font><font>Director elections</font><font>”</font><font>). In cases where a board’s unilateral adoption of changes </font><font>to the charter/articles/bylaws promotes cost and

corporate governance </font><font>structure.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>When voting on a management or shareholder proposal to make changes to the charter/articles/bylaws, we will consider in </font><font>part
the company’s and/or proponent’s publicly stated rationale for the changes; the company’s governance profile and </font><font>history; relevant jurisdictional laws; and
situational or contextual circumstances which may have motivated the proposed </font><font>changes, among other factors. We will typically support amendments to the charter/articles/bylaws
where the benefits to </font><font>shareholders outweigh the costs of failing to make such changes</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Proxy access</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>It is our view that long-term shareholders should have the opportunity, when necessary and under reasonable conditions, to </font><font>nominate directors on the company’s proxy card.</font><font>32</font><font> Securing the right of shareholders to nominate directors without </font><font>engaging in a control contest can enhance
shareholders’ ability to meaningfully participate in the director election process, </font><font>encourage board attention to shareholder interests, and provide shareholders an effective
means of directing that attention </font><font>where it is lacking. Proxy access mechanisms should provide shareholders with a reasonable opportunity to use this right </font><font>without stipulating overly restrictive or onerous parameters for use, and also provide assurances that the mechanism will not
</font><font>be subject to abuse by short-term investors, investors without a substantial investment in the company, or investors seeking </font><font>to take control of the board.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In general, we support market-standardized proxy access proposals, which allow a shareholder (or group of up to 20
</font><font>shareholders) holding three percent of a company’s outstanding shares for at least three years the right to nominate the </font><font>greater of up to two directors or 20% of the board. Where a standardized proxy access provision exists, we will generally
</font><font>oppose shareholder proposals requesting outlier thresholds.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Right to act by written consent</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>In exceptional circumstances and with sufficiently broad support, shareholders should have the opportunity to raise issues of
</font><font>substantial importance without having to wait for management to schedule a meeting. Accordingly, shareholders should </font><font>have the right to solicit votes by written consent provided that: 1) there are reasonable requirements to initiate the consent
</font><font>solicitation process (in order to avoid the waste of corporate resources in addressing narrowly supported interests); and 2) </font><font>shareholders receive a minimum of 50% of outstanding shares to effectuate the action by written consent.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>We may oppose shareholder proposals requesting the right to act by written consent in cases where the proposal is </font><font>structured for the benefit of a dominant shareholder to the exclusion of others, or if the proposal is written to discourage the </font><font>board from incorporating appropriate mechanisms to avoid the waste of corporate resources when establishing a right to act
</font><font>by written consent. Additionally, we may oppose shareholder proposals requesting the right to act by written consent if the </font><font>company already provides a shareholder right to call a special meeting that offers shareholders a reasonable opportunity to
</font><font>raise issues of substantial importance without having to wait for management to schedule a meeting.</font></div> </div>

the opportunity to raise issues of </font><font>substantial importance without having to wait for management to schedule a meeting. Accordingly, shareholders should </font><font>have the right to call a special meeting in cases where a reasonably high proportion of shareholders (typically a minimum of
</font><font>15% but no higher than 25%) are required to agree to such a meeting before it is called. However, we may oppose this right </font><font>in cases where the proposal is structured for the benefit of a dominant shareholder, or where a lower threshold may lead to
</font><font>an ineffective use of corporate resources. We generally think that a right to act via written consent is not a sufficient </font><font>alternative to the right to call a special meeting.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Appendix B – Description of Fixed-Income
Ratings</font></div> <div> <div><font>A rating is generally assigned to a fixed-income security at the time of
issuance by a credit rating agency designated as a </font><font>NRSRO by the SEC. While NRSROs may from time to time revise such ratings, they undertake no obligation to do so, and the </font><font>ratings given to securities at issuance do not necessarily represent ratings which would be given to these securities on a
</font><font>particular subsequent date.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>NRSROs may rate specific investments (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, bonds), issuers (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, corporations, governments and financial institutions) </font><font>and/or programs (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, commercial
paper programs). However, certain types of investments may not be rated by NRSROs, </font><font>such as certain government/sovereign obligations, US agency securities, commercial paper, time
deposits at financial </font><font>institutions, and derivative instruments such as credit default swaps. For these types of investments, as well as US Treasury </font><font>securities (some of which are not rated), where a NRSRO has not rated the specific investment but has rated the investment’s </font><font>issuer, program, financial institution or underlying reference asset, BFA may consider the investment to have the same </font><font>NRSRO
rating as its issuer, program, financial institution or underlying reference asset, as applicable. In the case of municipal </font><font>securities, where one NRSRO provides multiple ratings
for the same security (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, </font><font>“</font><font>underlying,</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>“</font><font>insured</font><font>”</font><font> and/or </font><font>“</font><font>enhanced</font><font>”</font><font> </font><font>ratings), BFA may consider the security to have the highest of the multiple ratings.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>New issue securities (regardless of type) may not be rated by a NRSRO at the time of their initial offering. Preliminary </font><font>prospectuses or term sheets for new issue securities may include an expected rating for the security (as determined by the
</font><font>underwriter and/or issuer) or a NRSRO rating for the issuer of the security. If applicable, when deciding whether to purchase </font><font>a new issue security that has not yet been rated by a NRSRO, BFA may attribute an expected rating to the security based on:
</font><font>(i) the expected rating of the security set forth in the preliminary prospectus or term sheet for the security; (ii) the NRSRO’s </font><font>rating for the issuer of the security set forth in the preliminary prospectus or term sheet for the security; or (iii) with respect </font><font>to asset-backed securities, the rating of a prior issuance having a similar structure or the same sponsor.</font><font>
</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Where the investment objective of a Fund is to track the performance of
an index that includes credit ratings eligibility criteria </font><font>as part of its index methodology, a Fund may purchase any security within the index, such security having been determined
</font><font>by the index provider as meeting its credit ratings eligibility criteria. The credit ratings practices of an index provider may </font><font>differ from BlackRock’s practices, as described above. Further, a Fund may invest, directly or indirectly, in securities that are </font><font>not rated by a rating agency or securities with a credit rating that differs from the credit rating specified in its index
</font><font>methodology in various circumstances, including where a security is downgraded but not yet removed from an index,
</font><font>following the removal of a security from an index prior to its sale by the Fund or as a result of a corporate action or </font><font>restructuring affecting an issuer of a security held by a Fund.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Fixed-income securities which are unrated may expose the investor to risks with respect to capacity to pay interest or repay
</font><font>principal which are similar to the risks of lower-rated speculative bonds. Evaluation of these securities is dependent on the </font><font>investment adviser’s judgment, analysis and experience in the evaluation of such securities.</font><font>
</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Investors should note that the assignment of a rating to a security by
an NRSRO may not reflect the effect of recent </font><font>developments on the issuer’s ability to make interest and principal payments or on the likelihood of default.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Securities deemed to be high yield are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s and below BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The descriptions below relate to general long-term and short-term obligations of an
issuer.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Moody’s Ratings</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Long-Term Obligations</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Aaa:</font><font>
Obligations rated Aaa are judged to be of the highest quality, subject to the lowest level of credit risk.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Aa:</font><font> Obligations rated Aa are judged to be of high quality and are subject to very low credit risk.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>A:</font><font> Obligations rated A are judged to be upper-medium grade and are subject to low credit risk.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Baa:</font><font> Obligations rated Baa are judged to be medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk and as such
may possess </font><font>certain speculative characteristics.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Ba:</font><font> Obligations rated Ba are judged to be speculative and are subject to substantial credit risk.</font><font>
</font></div> <div> <div><font>B:</font><font> Obligations rated B are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Caa:</font><font> Obligations rated Caa are judged to be speculative, of poor
standing and are subject to very high credit risk.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Ca:</font><font> Obligations rated Ca are highly speculative and are likely in, or
very near, default, with some prospect of recovery of </font><font>principal and interest.</font><font> </font></div>
</div> <div>
<div><font>C:</font><font> Obligations rated C are the lowest rated and are typically in
default, with little prospect for recovery of principal or interest.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Note:</font><font> Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2 and 3 in each generic rating classification from Aa through
Caa. The </font><font>modifier 1 indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range</font><font> ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the lower end of that generic rating category.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Absence of Rating:</font><font> Where no rating has been assigned or where a rating
has been withdrawn, it may be for reasons </font><font>unrelated to the creditworthiness of the issue.</font><font>
</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Should no rating be assigned, the reason may be one of the
following:</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>1. An application was not received or accepted.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>2. The issue or issuer belongs to a group of securities or entities that are not rated as a
matter of policy.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>3. There is a lack of essential data pertaining to the
issue or issuer.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>4. The issue was privately placed, in which case the rating is not published in Moody’s publications.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Withdrawal may occur if new and material circumstances arise, the effects of which preclude satisfactory analysis; if there is </font><font>no longer available reasonable up-to-date data to permit a judgment to be formed; if a bond is called for redemption; or for
</font><font>other reasons.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Short-Term Obligations</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Moody’s short-term debt ratings are opinions of the ability of issuers to honor short-term financial obligations, generally with </font><font>an original maturity not exceeding thirteen months.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Moody's employs the following designations to indicate the relative repayment ability of rated issuers:</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>P-1: </font><font>Issuers (or supporting institutions) rated Prime-1 have a superior
ability to repay short-term debt obligations.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>P-2:
</font><font>Issuers (or supporting institutions) rated Prime-2 have a strong ability to repay short-term debt obligations.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>P-3:
</font><font>Issuers (or supporting institutions) rated Prime-3 have an acceptable ability to repay short-term obligations.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>NP:
</font><font>Issuers (or supporting institutions) rated Not Prime do not fall within any of the Prime rating categories.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>US Municipal Short-Term Debt Obligations</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>There are three rating categories for short-term municipal obligations that are considered
investment-grade and are </font><font>designated as Municipal Investment Grade (MIG). In addition, those short-term obligations that are of speculative quality are </font><font>designated SG, or speculative grade. MIG ratings expire at the maturity of the obligation.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>MIG 1:</font><font> This designation denotes superior credit quality. Excellent
protection is afforded by established cash flows, highly </font><font>reliable liquidity support, or demonstrated broad-based access to the market for refinancing.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>MIG 2:</font><font>
This designation denotes strong credit quality. Margins of protection are ample, although not as large as in the </font><font>preceding group.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>MIG 3:</font><font>
This designation denotes acceptable credit quality. Liquidity and cash-flow protection may be narrow, and market </font><font>access for refinancing is likely to be less
well-established.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><font>B-2</font></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Long-Term Obligations</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>AAA:</font><font> An
obligation rated AAA has the highest rating assigned by S&amp;P Global Ratings. The obligor’s capacity to meet its </font><font>financial commitment on the obligation is extremely
strong.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>AA:</font><font> An obligation rated AA differs from the highest-rated obligations only to a small degree. The
obligor’s capacity to meet </font><font>its financial commitment is very strong.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>A:</font><font> An
obligation rated A is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic </font><font>conditions than obligations in higher-rated categories. However, the
obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on </font><font>the obligation is still strong.</font><font>
</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>BBB:</font><font> An obligation rated BBB exhibits adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic conditions or changing
</font><font>circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the </font><font>obligation.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>BB; B; CCC; CC; and C:</font><font> Obligations rated BB, B, CCC, CC, and C are
regarded as having significant speculative characteristics. </font><font>BB indicates the least degree of speculation and C the highest. While such obligations will likely have some quality and
</font><font>protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>BB:</font><font> An obligation rated BB is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues. However, it
faces major ongoing </font><font>uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions which could lead to the obligor’s inadequate </font><font>capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.</font><font> </font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>B:</font><font> An
obligation rated B is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated BB, but the obligor currently has the </font><font>capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.
Adverse business, financial, or economic conditions will likely </font><font>impair the obligor’s capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>CCC:</font><font> An obligation rated CCC is currently vulnerable to nonpayment, and is dependent upon favorable
business, financial, </font><font>and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. In the event of adverse </font><font>business, financial, or economic conditions, the obligor is not likely to have the capacity to meet its financial commitment on </font><font>the obligation.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>CC:</font><font> An obligation rated CC is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment.
The CC rating is used when a default has not yet </font><font>occurred, but S&amp;P Global Ratings expects default to be a virtual certainty, regardless of the anticipated time to
default.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>C:</font><font> An obligation rated C is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment, and the obligation is expected to have lower relative
</font><font>seniority or lower ultimate recovery compared to obligations that are rated higher.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>D:</font><font> An obligation rated D is in default or in breach of an imputed
promise. For non-hybrid capital instruments, the D rating </font><font>category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due, unless S&amp;P Global Ratings believes that
</font><font>such payments will be made within five business days in the absence of a stated grace period or within the earlier of the </font><font>stated grace period or 30 calendar days. The D rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking
</font><font>of similar action and where default on an obligation is a virtual certainty, for example due to automatic stay provisions. An </font><font>obligation's rating is lowered to D if it is subject to a distressed exchange offer.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>NR:</font><font> NR indicates no rating has been requested, or that there is
insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that S&amp;P </font><font>Global Ratings does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Note:</font><font>
The ratings from AA to CCC may be modified by the addition of a plus (+) or minus (-) sign to show relative standing </font><font>within the major rating categories.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Short-Term Obligations</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>A-1: </font><font>A short-term obligation rated A-1 is rated in the highest category by S&amp;P Global Ratings. The obligor's capacity to meet
</font><font>its financial commitment on the obligation is strong. Within this category, certain obligations are designated with a plus sign </font><font>(+). This indicates that the obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on these obligations is extremely strong.</font></div>
<div> <div><font>A-2: </font><font>A
short-term obligation rated A-2 is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and </font><font>economic conditions than obligations in higher rating
categories. However, the obligor's capacity to meet its financial </font><font>commitment on the obligation is satisfactory.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>A-3: </font><font>A
short-term obligation rated A-3 exhibits adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic conditions or </font><font>changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened
capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on </font><font>the obligation.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>B: </font><font>A short-term obligation rated B is regarded as vulnerable and has
significant speculative characteristics. The obligor </font><font>currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitments; however, it faces major ongoing uncertainties which could lead
</font><font>to the obligor's inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitments.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>C: </font><font>A short-term obligation rated C is currently vulnerable to nonpayment
and is dependent upon favorable business, </font><font>financial, and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>D: </font><font>A
short-term obligation rated D is in default or in breach of an imputed promise. For non-hybrid capital instruments, the D </font><font>rating category is used when payments on an obligation are
not made on the date due, unless S&amp;P Global Ratings believes </font><font>that such payments will be made within any stated grace period. However, any stated grace period longer than five
business </font><font>days will be treated as five business days. The D rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking </font><font>of a similar action and where default on an obligation is a virtual certainty, for example due to automatic stay provisions. An </font><font>obligation's rating is lowered to D if it is subject to a distressed exchange offer.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Municipal Short-Term Obligations</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>An S&amp;P U.S. municipal note rating reflects S&amp;P Global Ratings opinion about the liquidity factors and market access risks </font><font>unique to the notes. Notes due in three years or less will likely receive a note rating. Notes with an original maturity of more </font><font>than three years will most likely receive a long-term debt rating.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>SP-1:</font><font> Strong capacity to pay principal and interest. An issue determined to possess a very strong capacity
to pay debt service </font><font>is given a plus (+) designation.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>SP-2:</font><font> Satisfactory capacity to pay principal and interest, with some vulnerability to adverse financial and
economic changes </font><font>over the term of the notes.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>SP-3:</font><font> Speculative capacity to pay principal and interest.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Fitch Ratings</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Long-Term Obligations</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>AAA:</font><font>
Highest credit quality. AAA ratings denote the lowest expectation of credit risk. They are assigned only in cases of </font><font>exceptionally strong capacity for payment of financial
commitments. This capacity is highly unlikely to be adversely affected </font><font>by foreseeable events.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>AA:</font><font> Very high credit quality. AA ratings denote expectations of very low
credit risk. They indicate very strong capacity for </font><font>payment of financial commitments. This capacity is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>A:</font><font> High
credit quality. A ratings denote expectations of low credit risk. The capacity for payment of financial commitments is </font><font>considered strong. This capacity may, nevertheless, be more
vulnerable to adverse business or economic conditions than is </font><font>the case for higher ratings.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>BBB:</font><font> Good credit quality. BBB ratings indicate that expectations of
credit risk are currently low. The capacity for payment of </font><font>financial commitments is considered adequate but adverse business or economic conditions are more likely to impair this
</font><font>capacity.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>BB:</font><font> Speculative. BB ratings indicate an elevated vulnerability to credit risk, particularly in the event of adverse changes in
</font><font>business or economic conditions over time; however, business or financial alternatives may be available to allow financial </font><font>commitments to be met.</font></div> <div> <div><font>B:</font><font> Highly speculative. B ratings indicate that material credit risk is present.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>CCC:</font><font>
Substantial credit risk. CCC ratings indicate that substantial credit risk is present.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>CC:</font><font> Very high levels of credit risk. CC ratings indicate very high levels of credit risk.</font><font> </font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>C:</font><font> Exceptionally high levels of credit risk. C indicates exceptionally high levels of credit
risk.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Defaulted obligations typically are not assigned RD or D ratings,
but are instead rated in the B to C rating categories, </font><font>depending upon their recovery prospects and other relevant characteristics. This approach better aligns obligations that have
</font><font>comparable overall expected loss but varying vulnerability to default and loss.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Note: The modifiers </font><font>“</font><font>+</font><font>”</font><font> or </font><font>“</font><font>-</font><font>”</font><font> may be appended to a rating to denote relative status within major rating categories. Such </font><font>suffixes are not added to the AAA obligation rating category, or to corporate finance obligation ratings in the categories </font><font>below CCC.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The subscript 'emr' is appended to a rating to denote embedded market risk which is beyond the scope of the rating. The </font><font>designation is intended to make clear that the rating solely addresses the counterparty risk of the issuing bank. It is not meant </font><font>to indicate any limitation in the analysis of the counterparty risk, which in all other respects follows published Fitch criteria for </font><font>analyzing the issuing financial institution. Fitch does not rate these instruments where the principal is to any degree subject to </font><font>market risk.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Short-Term Obligations (Corporate and Public Finance)</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>A short-term issuer or obligation rating is based in all cases on the short-term vulnerability to default of the rated entity or </font><font>security stream and relates to the capacity to meet financial obligations in accordance with the documentation governing the
</font><font>relevant obligation. Short-Term Ratings are assigned to obligations whose initial maturity is viewed as
</font><font>“</font><font>short-term</font><font>”</font><font> based on </font><font>market convention. Typically, this means up to 13 months for corporate, sovereign, and structured obligations, and
up to 36 </font><font>months for obligations in U.S. public finance markets.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>F1:</font><font> Highest short-term credit quality. Indicates the strongest intrinsic capacity for timely payment of
financial commitments; </font><font>may have an added </font><font>“</font><font>+</font><font>”</font><font> to denote any exceptionally strong credit
feature.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>F2:</font><font> Good short-term credit quality. Good intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>F3:</font><font> Fair short-term credit quality. The intrinsic capacity for timely
payment of financial commitments is adequate.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>B:</font><font> Speculative short-term credit quality. Minimal capacity for timely payment of financial commitments, plus heightened
</font><font>vulnerability to near term adverse changes in financial and economic conditions.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>C:</font><font> High short-term default risk. Default is a real
possibility.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>RD:</font><font> Restricted default. Indicates an entity that has defaulted on one or more of its financial commitments, although it
</font><font>continues to meet other financial obligations. Typically applicable to entity ratings only.</font></div> </div> <div>
