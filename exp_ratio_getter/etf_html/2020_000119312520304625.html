(“Moody’s”), Standard &amp; Poor’s<font size="1"><sup>®</sup></font> Global Ratings, a subsidiary of S&amp;P Global (“S&amp;P Global Ratings”) and Fitch Ratings, Inc.
(“Fitch”) are considered. Securities in the Underlying Index must be rated high yield (below <font>BBB-</font> by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch, or below Baa3 by Moody’s) using the middle rating from
Moody’s, S&amp;P Global Ratings, and Fitch. When a rating from only two agencies is available, the lower of the two agencies’ ratings is used. When a rating from only one agency is available, that rating is used to determine eligibility in
the Underlying Index. Securities that are rated below investment grade are commonly referred to as “junk bonds.” MSCI excludes companies with an ESG controversy score of less than three (3) or an ESG rating below BB. To determine if
companies are involved in very severe business controversies, MSCI assesses the possible negative environmental, social, and/or governance impact of a company’s operations or products on a scale from zero to ten, with zero being the most severe
controversy rating. To determine ESG ratings, MSCI rates the ESG characteristics of securities on a scale of “CCC” (lowest) to “AAA” (highest). MSCI then evaluates a company’s risks and opportunities in relation to ESG Key
Issues (e.g., carbon emissions). Each company is scored on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 being the highest, for each Key Issue before being provided an ESG rating based on average Key Issue score. MSCI ESG Research also excludes securities of
companies involved in adult entertainment, alcohol, gambling, tobacco, genetically modified organisms, controversial weapons, nuclear weapons, civilian </font></p>

firearms, conventional weapons, palm oil, <font>for-profit</font> prisons, predatory lending, and nuclear power based on revenue or percentage of revenue thresholds for
certain categories (e.g. $500 million or 50%) and categorical exclusions for others (e.g. nuclear weapons). MSCI ESG Research screens companies with involvement to fossil fuels by excluding the securities of any company in the Bloomberg
Class 3 energy sector (i.e., corporate issuers in the energy sector include both independent and integrated exploration and production companies, as well as midstream oil field services, and refining companies) and all companies with an
industry tie to fossil fuels such as thermal coal, oil and gas—in particular, reserve ownership, related revenues and power generation </font></p>

MSCI ESG Research excludes companies involved in very serious business controversies. MSCI ESG Research defines a controversy as an instance or ongoing situation in which company operations and/or products allegedly have a negative environmental,
social and/or governance impact. Each controversy case is assessed for the severity of its impact on society. MSCI ESG Research excludes companies involved in very severe business controversies by assessing the possible negative environmental,
social, and/or governance impact of a company’s operations or products on a scale from zero to ten, with zero being the most severe controversy rating (the “MSCI Controversies Score”). Only securities of companies with a MSCI
Controversies Score of three or higher are eligible for inclusion in the Underlying Index. </font></p> <p><font size="2">If you have any questions, please call <font><font>1-800-iShares</font></font> <font><font><font>(1-800-474-2737).</font></font></font> </font></p>
