<div>The iShares Core 5-10 Year USD Bond ETF (the
“Fund”) seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of U.S. dollar-denominated bonds that are rated either investment-grade or high yield with remaining effective maturities between five and ten years.</div>
<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you
will incur if you own shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides that BFA will pay
all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage
commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses. The Fund may incur “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses.” Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses reflect the Fund's <font>pro
rata</font> share of the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies. The impact of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses is included in the total returns of the Fund. Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses are not included in the
calculation of the ratio of expenses to average net assets shown in the <font>Financial Highlights</font> section of the Fund's prospectus (the “Prospectus”). BFA, the investment adviser to the Fund, has
contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees in an amount equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any, attributable to investments by the Fund in other registered investment companies advised by BFA or its affiliates,
through February 28, 2021. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to February 28, 2021 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA.</div>
<div>You may also incur usual and customary brokerage commissions
and other charges when buying or selling shares of the Fund, which are not reflected in the Example that follows:</div> <div>

periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund’s operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions, your costs would

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund may pay
transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in
a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 481% of the average
value of its portfolio.</font></div> <div>Principal Investment
Strategies</div> <div>The Fund seeks to track the investment results
of the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Universal 5-10 Year Index (the “Underlying Index”), which measures the performance of U.S. dollar-denominated taxable bonds that are rated either investment-grade or high yield (as determined by Bloomberg
Index Services Limited (the “Index Provider” or “Bloomberg”)) with remaining effective maturities between five and ten years. The Underlying Index includes U.S. Treasury bonds, government-related bonds (i.e., U.S. and
non-U.S. agencies, sovereign, quasi-sovereign, supranational and local</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>authority debt), investment-grade and high yield U.S. corporate bonds,
mortgage-backed pass-through securities (“MBS”), commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”), asset-backed securities (“ABS”), Eurodollar bonds (<font>i.e.</font>, U.S.
dollar-denominated bonds issued by foreign issuers outside the U.S.), bonds registered with the SEC or exempt from registration at the time of issuance, or offered pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933
Act”) with or without registration rights (“Rule 144A Bonds”) and emerging market bonds. The Underlying Index is a subset of the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Universal Index.</div>
<div>As of February 28, 2019, a significant portion of the
Underlying Index is represented by securitized and corporate securities, MBS and treasury securities. A significant portion of the Underlying Index is comprised of MBS that include 20-year and 30-year mortgages. These MBS are included in the
Underlying Index because their effective duration has historically been more consistent with the duration of non-callable 5-10 year bonds due to prepayments. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time. The securities in

<div>Underlying Index must be denominated in U.S. dollars and non-convertible.
Excluded from the Underlying Index are tax- exempt municipal securities, coupon issues that have been stripped from bonds, structured notes, private placements (excluding Rule 144A Bonds) and inflation-linked bonds.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover
low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to that of an applicable underlying index. The securities
selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability, duration, maturity, credit ratings and
yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying Index.</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its assets in
the component securities of the Underlying Index and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates
(“BlackRock Cash Funds”), as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. From time to time when conditions warrant, however, the Fund may invest at
least 80% of its assets in the component securities of the Underlying Index and may invest up to 20% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of BlackRock Cash Funds, as well as in
securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of
the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by Bloomberg, which is
independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to

limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities), repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities, and securities of state or municipal governments and their political subdivisions are

<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share
(“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or other asset
classes.</font></div> <div>Assets Under Management (AUM) Risk<font>.</font><font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of the Prospectus, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a specific period
of time to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</font><font> </font><font>can be no assurance that any such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of
the Fund would be maintained at</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Shareholder Information</font><font> section of the Prospectus)
may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other
Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units (as defined in the </font><font>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</font><font> section of the
Prospectus), Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting.</font></div>
<div>Call Risk<font>. </font><font>During periods of falling interest rates, an issuer of a callable bond held by the Fund may “call” or repay the security before its stated maturity, and the Fund may have to reinvest the
proceeds in securities with lower yields, which would result in a decline in the Fund's income, or in securities with greater risks or with other less favorable features.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
investments are concentrated in the securities of a particular sovereign entity or entities, in a particular country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class.</font></div> </div>

 Table of Contents </a> </div> <div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Credit Risk<font>.</font><font> Debt issuers and other counterparties may be unable or unwilling to make timely interest and/or principal payments when due or otherwise honor their obligations. Changes in an issuer’s credit
rating or the market’s perception of an issuer’s creditworthiness may also adversely affect the value of the Fund’s investment in that issuer. The degree of credit risk depends on an issuer's or counterparty's financial condition
and on the terms of an obligation.</font></div> <div>Cyber Security
Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, and other service providers, the Index Provider,
market makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions and negatively impact the Fund’s business operations, potentially resulting in financial losses to the Fund and
its shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the
cyber security plans and systems of the Fund’s service providers, the Index Provider, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>Extension Risk. <font>During periods of rising interest rates, certain debt obligations may be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated and the value of those securities may fall sharply, resulting in a
decline in the Fund’s income and potentially in the value of the Fund’s investments.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Geographic Risk<font>.</font><font> A natural disaster could occur in a geographic region in which the Fund invests, which could adversely affect the economy or the business operations of companies in the specific geographic region,
causing an adverse impact on the Fund's investments in the affected region.</font></div>
<div>High Portfolio Turnover Risk.<font> High portfolio turnover (considered by the Fund to mean higher than 100% annually) may result in increased transaction costs to the Fund, including brokerage commissions, dealer mark-ups and other
transaction costs on the sale of the securities and on reinvestment in other securities.</font></div>
<div>High Yield Securities Risk. <font>Securities that are rated below investment-grade (commonly referred to as “junk bonds,” which may include those bonds rated below “BBB-” by Standard &amp; Poor's<sup>®</sup> Global Ratings, a subsidiary of S&amp;P Global (“S&amp;P Global Ratings”) and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (“Fitch”) or
“Baa3” by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody's”)), or are unrated, may be deemed speculative, may involve greater levels of risk than higher-rated securities of similar maturity and may be more likely to
default.</font></div> <div>Income Risk. <font>The Fund's income may decline if interest rates fall. This decline in income can occur because the Fund may subsequently invest in lower-yielding bonds as bonds in its portfolio mature, are near
maturity or are called, bonds in the Underlying Index are substituted, or the Fund otherwise needs to purchase additional bonds.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its</font></div> </div>

<div>investment objective. Market disruptions and regulatory restrictions could
have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of the Underlying Index in accordance with its
methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders.</div>
<div>Interest Rate Risk<font>.</font><font> An increase in interest rates may cause the value of securities held by the Fund to decline, may lead to heightened volatility in the fixed-income markets and may adversely affect the liquidity of
certain fixed-income investments. The historically low interest rate environment, together with recent modest rate increases, heightens the risks associated with rising interest rates.</font></div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure.The Fund may be adversely affected if an issuer of underlying securities held by the Fund
is unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may cause the value of the securities to decline.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>longer periods during more prolonged market downturns.</div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruptions in
the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund’s service providers,
counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible
risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Prepayment Risk.<font> During periods of falling interest rates, issuers of certain debt obligations may repay principal prior to the security’s maturity, which may cause the Fund to have to reinvest in securities with
lower yields or higher risk of default, resulting in a decline in the Fund’s income or return potential.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the

<div>have an adverse effect on the securities to which the Fund has exposure.</div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax
consequences for the Fund.</font></div> <div>Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Some countries and regions in which the Fund invests have experienced security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents
involving a country's or region's security may cause uncertainty in its markets and may adversely affect its economy and the Fund's investments.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the Fund's
valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund's NAV), differences in transaction costs, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of distributions, the requirements to
maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>of capital gains to shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs
to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees
and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not.</div>
<div>U.S. Agency Debt Risk.<font> The Fund invests in unsecured bonds or debentures issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or one of its agencies or sponsored entities. Certain debt issuances by U.S. government agencies or
sponsored entities, including, among others, the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”), the Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLB”), and the
Tennessee Valley Authority (“TVA”), are backed only by the general creditworthiness and reputation of the U.S. government agency or sponsored entity and not the full faith and credit of the U.S. government and, as a result, subject to
additional credit risk. To the extent that the U.S. government has provided support to a U.S. agency or sponsored entity in the past, there can be no assurance that the U.S. government will provide support in the future if it is not obligated to do
so. Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) securities and certain foreign government debt issuances guaranteed by the U.S. government are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.</font></div>
<div>U.S. Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities Risk. <font>The Fund invests in MBS issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or one of its agencies or</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>sponsored entities, some of which may not be backed by the full faith and
credit of the U.S. government. MBS represent interests in “pools” of mortgages and are subject to interest rate, prepayment, and extension risk. MBS react differently to changes in interest rates than other bonds, and the prices of MBS
may reflect adverse economic and market conditions. Small movements in interest rates (both increases and decreases) may quickly and significantly reduce the value of certain MBS. MBS are also subject to the risk of default on the underlying
mortgage loans, particularly during periods of economic downturn. Default or bankruptcy of a counterparty to a to-be-announced (“TBA”) transaction would expose the Fund to possible losses.</div>
<div>U.S. Treasury Obligations Risk. <font>U.S. Treasury obligations may differ from other securities in their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and other characteristics and may provide relatively lower returns than those of other
securities. Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial condition or credit rating of the U.S. government may cause the value of the</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Fund's U.S. Treasury obligations to decline.</div>
<div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or other asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index,
particularly for securities or other assets that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. In addition, the value of the securities or other
assets in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund's shares. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund is holding
fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s ability to value
investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund are listed on
a national securities exchange. Most investors will buy and sell shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer. The price of Fund shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a
price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund will only issue or redeem shares that have been aggregated into blocks of 100,000 shares or multiples thereof (“Creation Units”) to Authorized Participants who
have entered into agreements with the Fund's distributor. The Fund generally will issue or redeem Creation Units in return for a designated portfolio of securities (and an amount of cash) that the Fund specifies each day.<br/> </div> </div>

<div>More Information About the Fund</div>
<div>This Prospectus contains important information about investing
in the Fund. Please read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund
are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”). The market price for a share of the Fund may be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</div>
<div>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly-traded
securities. The Fund is designed to track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other instruments intended to track a market index.
Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at NAV solely by Authorized Participants and
only in Creation Unit increments. Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market prices that change throughout the day.</div>
<div>The Fund invests in a particular segment of the securities
markets and seeks to track the performance of a securities index that may not be representative of the market as a whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. Accordingly, an investment in the Fund should
not constitute a complete investment program.</div> <div>An index is
a financial calculation, based on a grouping of financial instruments, and is not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons,
including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency valuations, asset valuations, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's
use of representative sampling or from legal restrictions (such as diversification requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments
to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise determined by BFA, any such change or adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment.
Therefore, the Underlying Index performance shown for periods prior to the effective date of any such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect such change or adjustment.</div>
<div>“Tracking error” is the divergence of the
performance (return) of the Fund's portfolio from that of the Underlying Index. BFA expects that, over time, the Fund’s tracking error will not exceed 5%. Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected to
have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. “Replication” is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in</div> </div> <div type="Block"> </div>

<div>substantially all of the securities in its underlying index in approximately
the same proportions as in the underlying index.</div> <div>Under
continuous listing standards adopted by the Fund's listing exchange, the Fund is required to confirm on an ongoing basis that the components of the Underlying Index satisfy the applicable listing requirements. In the event that the Underlying Index
does not comply with the applicable listing requirements, the Fund is required to rectify such non-compliance by requesting that the Index Provider modify the Underlying Index, adopting a new underlying index, or obtaining relief from the SEC.
Failure to rectify such non-compliance may result in the Fund being delisted by the listing exchange.</div>
<div>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or any of its affiliates.</div>
<div>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be
changed without shareholder approval.</div> <div>A Further
Discussion of Principal Risks</div> <div>The Fund is subject to
various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate
the significance of any particular risk factor. You could lose all or part of your investment in the Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> The
securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund’s portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries, groups of industries,
markets, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a number of factors including,
among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that invest in different asset
classes.</font></div> <div>Assets Under Management (AUM) Risk.<font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a specific period
of time to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</font> <font>can be no assurance that any such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could
negatively impact the Fund.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant
Concentration Risk. <font>Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on
an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed
with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at</font></div> </div>

<div>a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting.
Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened because ETFs, such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that are less widely traded often involve greater settlement and
operational issues and capital costs for Authorized Participants, which may limit the availability of Authorized Participants.</div>
<div>Call Risk.<font> During periods of
falling interest rates, an issuer of a callable bond held by the Fund may “call” or repay the security before its stated maturity, and the Fund may have to reinvest the proceeds in securities with lower yields, which would result in a
decline in the Fund’s income, or in securities with greater risks or with other less favorable features.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund
may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities of a
particular sovereign entity or entities, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class. The Fund may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of those securities, may experience increased
price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting those securities than a fund that does not concentrate its investments.</font></div>
<div>Credit Risk.<font> Credit risk is the
risk that the issuer or guarantor of a debt instrument or the counterparty to a derivatives contract, repurchase agreement or loan of portfolio securities will be unable or unwilling to make its timely interest and/or principal payments when due or
otherwise honor its obligations. There are varying degrees of credit risk, depending on an issuer’s or counterparty’s financial condition and on the terms of an obligation, which may be reflected in the issuer’s or
counterparty’s credit rating. There is the chance that the Fund’s portfolio holdings will have their credit ratings downgraded or will default (</font><font>i.e., </font><font>fail to make scheduled interest or principal payments), or that the market’s perception of an issuer’s creditworthiness may worsen, potentially reducing the Fund’s income level or share
price.</font></div> <div>Cyber Security Risk.<font> With the increased use of technologies such as the internet to conduct business, the Fund, Authorized Participants, service providers and the relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information
security and related “cyber” risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of cyber security risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, which could result in material adverse
consequences for such issuers and may cause the Fund’s investment in such portfolio companies to lose value. Unlike many other types of risks faced by the Fund, these risks typically are not covered by insurance. In general, cyber incidents
can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, through “hacking” or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyber-attacks may also be carried out in
a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, efforts to make network
services unavailable to intended users). Cyber</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>security failures by or breaches of the systems of the Fund’s adviser,
distributor and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index and benchmark providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which
the Fund invests, have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s ability to calculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential trading information,
impediments to trading, submission of erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund or its service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties,
reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyber-attacks may render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, and other data integral to the
functioning of the Fund inaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund in order to resolve or prevent cyber incidents in the future. While the Fund has established business continuity plans in the event of,
and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber-attacks, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified and that prevention and remediation efforts will not be
successful. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cyber security plans and systems put in place by service providers to the Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, market makers or Authorized Participants. The Fund and its
shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result.</div>
<div>Extension Risk. <font>During periods
of rising interest rates, certain debt obligations may be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated and the value of those securities may fall sharply, resulting in a decline in the Fund’s income and potentially in the
value of the Fund’s investments.</font></div> <div>Geographic
Risk.<font> Some of the companies in which the Fund invests are located in parts of the world that have historically been prone to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, droughts, floods,
hurricanes or tsunamis, and are economically sensitive to environmental events. Any such event may adversely impact the economies of these geographic areas or business operations of companies in these geographic areas, causing an adverse impact on
the value of the Fund.</font></div> <div>High Portfolio Turnover Risk.
<font>High portfolio turnover (considered by the Fund to mean higher than 100% annually) may result in increased transaction costs to the Fund, including brokerage commissions, dealer mark-ups and other transaction costs
on the sale of the securities and on reinvestment in other securities. These effects of higher than normal portfolio turnover may adversely affect Fund performance.</font></div>
<div>High Yield Securities Risk.<font>
Securities that are rated below investment-grade (commonly referred to as “junk bonds,” which may include those bonds rated below “BBB-” by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch, or “Baa3” by Moody’s), or are
unrated, may be deemed speculative, may involve greater levels of risk than higher-rated securities of similar maturity and may be more likely to default.</font></div>

high yield securities are subject to extreme price fluctuations. Adverse changes in an issuer’s industry and general economic conditions may have a greater impact on the prices of high yield securities than on other higher rated fixed-income

 </td>
<td>High yield
securities may be less liquid than higher rated fixed-income securities, even under normal economic conditions. There are fewer dealers in the high yield securities market, and there may be significant differences in the prices quoted for high yield
securities by the dealers. Because high yield securities may be less liquid than higher rated fixed-income securities, judgment may play a greater role in valuing certain of the Fund’s securities than is the case with securities trading in a
more liquid market. </td></tr>

 Fund may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms with a defaulting issuer. </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>Income Risk.<font> The Fund’s
income may decline if interest rates fall. This decline in income can occur because the Fund may subsequently invest in lower-yielding bonds as bonds in its portfolio mature, are near maturity or are called, bonds in the Underlying Index are
substituted, or the Fund otherwise needs to purchase additional bonds. The Index Provider’s substitution of bonds in the Underlying Index may occur, for example, when the time to maturity for the bond no longer matches the Underlying
Index’s stated maturity guidelines.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk.<font> The Fund
seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any agents that may act
on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to achieve,
neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in
line with the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider</font></div> </div>

<div>to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee against the Index
Provider’s or any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for
a period of time or at all, particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or managers. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to
such constituents and would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its shareholders. Shareholders should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors
will be kept by the Fund and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.</div>
<div>Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index Provider or its
agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying Index in order, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances its portfolio to
attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Unscheduled
rebalances to the Underlying Index may expose the Fund to additional tracking error risk, which is the risk that the Fund's returns may not track those of the Underlying Index. Therefore, errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the
Index Provider or its agents to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the Fund.</div>
<div>Interest Rate Risk.<font> As interest
rates rise, the value of a fixed-income security held by the Fund is likely to decrease. Securities with longer durations tend to be more sensitive to interest rate changes, usually making their prices more volatile than those of securities with
shorter durations. A measure investors commonly use to determine this sensitivity is called duration. Generally, the longer the duration of a particular fixed-income security, the greater its price sensitivity to interest rates. To the extent the
Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in fixed-income securities with longer duration, rising interest rates may cause the value of the Fund’s investments to decline significantly, which may adversely affect the value of the Fund.
An increase in interest rates may lead to heightened volatility in the fixed-income markets and adversely affect certain fixed-income investments. In addition, decreases in fixed-income dealer market-making capacity may lead to lower trading volume,
heightened volatility, wider bid-ask spreads, and less transparent pricing in certain fixed-income markets.</font></div>
<div>The historically low interest rate environment in recent years
was created in part by the world’s major central banks keeping their overnight policy interest rates at, near or below zero percent and implementing monetary policy facilities, such as asset purchase programs, to anchor longer-term interest
rates below historical levels. Certain central banks have since increased their short-term policy rates and begun phasing out, or “tapering,” facilities and may continue to do so in the future. The</div> </div>

<div>timing, magnitude, and effect of such policy changes on various markets is
uncertain, and changes in monetary policy may adversely affect the value of the Fund’s investments.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk. <font>The performance of
the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. The Fund may be adversely affected if an issuer of underlying securities held by the Fund is unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due.
Any issuer of these securities may perform poorly, causing the value of its securities to decline. Poor performance may be caused by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, expiration of patent protection,
disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages, corporate restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or other factors. Changes to the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may cause
the value of the securities to decline. An issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk. <font>Because BFA
uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities not included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that BFA’s investment strategy,
the implementation of which is subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk.<font> The Fund could
lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Market risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future values of financial instruments and may be influenced by
price, currency and interest rate movements. It represents the potential loss the Fund may suffer through holding financial instruments in the face of market movements or uncertainty. The value of a security or other asset may decline due to
changes in general market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the issuer of the security or other asset, or factors that affect a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market,
industry, group of industries, sector or asset class. During a general market downturn, multiple asset classes may be negatively affected. Fixed-income securities with short-term maturities are generally less sensitive to such changes than are
fixed-income securities with longer-term maturities. Changes in market conditions and interest rates generally do not have the same impact on all types of securities and instruments.</font></div>
<div>Market Trading Risk</div>
<div>Absence of Active Market.<font>
Although shares of the Fund are listed for trading on one or more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized Participants.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Secondary Listings.
<font>The Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made available to non-U.S.
investors through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s shares will continue to trade on any such stock</font></div> </div>

<div>exchange or in any market or that the Fund’s shares will continue to
meet the requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's shares may be less actively traded in certain markets than in others, and investors are subject to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of
the market where they or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to investors who trade Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market hours may not be available to investors who trade in other
markets, which may result in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</div>
<div>Secondary Market Trading Risk.<font>
Shares of the Fund may trade in the secondary market at times when the Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more significant premiums or discounts than might be
experienced at times when the Fund accepts purchase and redemption orders.</font></div>
<div>Secondary market trading in Fund shares may be halted by a
stock exchange because of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund shares on a stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to “circuit
breaker” rules on the stock exchange or market.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed
on a stock exchange, may be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price decreases associated with being sold short.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV.<font> Shares of the Fund trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of the Fund is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in the market value
of the Fund’s holdings. The trading price of the Fund's shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours based on both market supply of and demand for Fund shares and the underlying value of the Fund's portfolio holdings or NAV. As
a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s shares may deviate significantly from NAV during periods of market volatility, including during periods of significant redemption requests or other unusual market conditions. </font><font>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</font><font>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in
Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund are not likely to be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and
sometimes at premiums to, their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely that the Fund’s shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the Fund’s next calculated NAV, exchange
prices are not expected to correlate exactly with the Fund's NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at market makers, Authorized
Participants, or other market participants, and during periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the Fund that differ significantly from its NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing to create or
redeem Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>such shares or its underlying investments, which may contribute to the
Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</div>
<div>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.<font> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage commission
and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread”; that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the “bid” price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund
shares (the “ask” price). The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume and market liquidity and wider if the Fund
has less trading volume and market liquidity. In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because of the costs inherent in buying
or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a brokerage
account.</font></div> <div>Operational Risk.<font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund’s service providers, counterparties or
other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be
inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk.<font> The
Fund is not actively managed and may be affected by a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in securities included in, or representative of, the Underlying Index, regardless of their investment merits.
BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Prepayment Risk. <font>During periods
of falling interest rates, issuers of certain debt obligations may repay principal prior to the security’s maturity, which may cause the Fund to have to reinvest in securities with lower yields or higher risk of default, resulting in a decline
in the Fund’s income or return potential. Also, if a security subject to prepayment had been purchased at a premium, the value of the premium would be lost in the event of prepayment.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the U.S.<font> A
decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations and/or an economic recession in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed on U.S. exchanges. Proposed and adopted policy and legislative
changes in the U.S. are changing many aspects of financial and other regulation and may have a significant effect on the U.S. markets generally, as well as on the value of certain securities. In addition, a continued rise in the U.S. public debt
level or U.S. austerity measures may adversely affect U.S. economic growth and the securities to which the Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>The U.S. has developed increasingly strained relations with a
number of foreign</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>countries. If these relations were to worsen, it could adversely affect U.S.
issuers as well as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also experienced increased internal unrest and discord. If this trend were to continue, it may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and many of the issuers in
which the Fund invests.</div> <div>Securities Lending Risk.<font> The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The
Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the
Fund. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., the Fund's securities lending agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments for dividends when managing the Fund's securities lending program.</font></div>
<div>Security Risk. <font>Some geographic
areas in which the Fund invests have experienced acts of terrorism and strained international relations due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense concerns and other security concerns. These situations may cause uncertainty in the
markets of these geographic areas and may adversely affect their economies.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk.<font> The Fund
may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s
portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the Fund's valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the
Fund's NAV), differences in transaction costs, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of distributions, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions
carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of
increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not.</font></div>
<div>U.S. Agency Debt Risk.<font> The
Fund invests in unsecured bonds or debentures issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or one of its agencies or sponsored entities. These debt issuances or guarantees help finance U.S. governmental policies and public missions, but may be backed
only by the general creditworthiness and reputation of the U.S. government agency or government sponsored entity and not the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. For example, debt issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and FHLB provides
financing, credit, and/or liquidity to the housing and mortgage markets, and is not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. In addition, debt issued by the TVA, which provides electricity generation and flood control in parts of
the Southeast region, and the Federal Farm Credit Banks, which provide credit and related services to the agricultural sector, is not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Ginnie Mae securities and certain foreign</font></div>

<div>government debt issuances guaranteed by the U.S. government, including certain
issuances by Iraq and Israel, are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.</div>
<div>Bonds or debentures that do not carry the backing of the full
faith and credit of the U.S. government are subject to more credit risk than securities that are supported by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. If a U.S. government agency or sponsored entity that is the issuer of securities in which
the Fund invests is unable to meet its obligations or ceases to exist and no plan is made for repayment of securities, the performance of the Fund will be adversely impacted. There can be no assurance that the U.S. government would provide financial
support to any of these U.S. governmental agencies or sponsored entities if it is not obligated to do so. In 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed under the conservatorship of the U.S. government, which provided financial support to the U.S.
government-sponsored entities. However, there can be no assurance that such past U.S. government support will result in support in the future.</div>
<div>Any actual or potential disruption to a U.S. government agency
or sponsored entity, or the financial condition or credit of the U.S. government, could cause the value of U.S. agency debt to decline. In 2011, S&amp;P Global Ratings downgraded U.S. Treasury securities from AAA rating to AA+ rating. A further
downgrade of the ratings of U.S. government debt obligations, which are often used as a benchmark for other borrowing arrangements, could result in higher interest rates for individual and corporate borrowers, cause disruptions in the international
bond markets and have a substantial negative effect on the U.S. economy. A downgrade of U.S. Treasury securities from another ratings agency or a further downgrade below AA+ rating by S&amp;P Global Ratings may cause the value of the Fund’s
U.S. Treasury obligations to decline.</div> <div>U.S. Agency
Mortgage-Backed Securities Risk. <font>The Fund invests in securities backed by pools of mortgages issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or one of its agencies or sponsored entities, including Fannie Mae, Freddie
Mac or Ginnie Mae. While securities guaranteed by Ginnie Mae are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, and
there can be no assurance that the U.S. government would provide financial support to its agencies or sponsored entities where it is not obligated to do so. Any actual or potential disruption to these agencies or sponsored, or the financial
condition or credit of the U.S. government, could cause the value of MBS held by the Fund to decline.</font></div>
<div>MBS represent interests in “pools” of mortgages
and, due to the nature of these loans they represent, are subject to prepayment and extension risk. Prepayment risk is the risk that, during periods of falling interest rates, an issuer of mortgages and other fixed-income securities may be able to
repay principal prior to the security’s maturity. This may cause the Fund to have to reinvest in securities with a lower yield or higher risk of default, resulting in a decline in the Fund’s income or return potential.</div>
<div>MBS are also subject to extension risk, which is the risk that
when interest rates rise, certain MBS will be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated and the value of those securities may fall sharply, resulting in a decline in income and potentially in the value of the investment.</div>

<div>Because of prepayment and extension risks, MBS react
differently to changes in interest rates than other bonds. Small movements in interest rates (both increases and decreases) may quickly and significantly reduce the value of certain MBS. These securities are also subject to the risk of default on
the underlying mortgage loans, particularly during periods of economic downturn.</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to obtain exposure to the fixed-rate portion of
U.S. agency mortgage-pass through securities primarily through TBA securities, or TBA transactions. TBAs refer to a commonly used mechanism for the forward settlement of U.S. agency MBS, and not to a separate type of MBS. Default or bankruptcy of a
counterparty to a TBA transaction would expose the Fund to possible losses because of adverse market action, expenses or delays in connection with the purchase or sale of the pools of mortgage pass-through securities specified in the TBA
transaction.</div> <div>The Fund intends to invest cash pending
settlement of TBA transactions in money market instruments, repurchase agreements, or other high quality, liquid short-term instruments, including money market funds advised by BFA. The Fund will pay its <font>pro
rata</font> share of fees and expenses of any money market fund that it may invest in, in addition to the Fund’s own fees and expenses.</div>
<div>U.S. Treasury Obligations Risk.
<font>U.S. Treasury obligations may differ from other securities in their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and other characteristics. Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial condition or credit
rating of the U.S. government may cause the value of the Fund's U.S. Treasury obligations to decline. On August 5, 2011, S&amp;P Global Ratings downgraded U.S. Treasury securities from AAA rating to AA+ rating. A further downgrade of the ratings of
U.S. government debt obligations, which are often used as a benchmark for other borrowing arrangements, could result in higher interest rates for individual and corporate borrowers, cause disruptions in the international bond markets and have a
substantial negative effect on the U.S. economy. A downgrade of U.S. Treasury securities from another ratings agency or a further downgrade below AA+ rating by S&amp;P Global Ratings may cause the value of the Fund’s U.S. Treasury obligations
to decline.</font></div> <div>Valuation Risk.<font> The price the Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or other asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for
securities or other assets that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. Because non-U.S. stock exchanges may be open on days when the Fund does
not price its shares, the value of the securities or other assets in the Fund’s portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s shares. Authorized Participants who
purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a
different valuation methodology. The Fund’s ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</font></div> </div>

<div>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</div>
<div>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated
with its investments and investment strategies. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Close-out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.<font> Regulations adopted by global prudential regulators that are now in effect require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global systemically important banking organizations to include contractual restrictions
on close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards and other derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities
lending agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution proceedings and prohibit the Fund from exercising default rights due to
a receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. These requirements may increase credit risk and other risks to the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Custody Risk.<font> Custody risk
refers to the risks inherent in the process of clearing and settling trades, as well as the holding of securities by local banks, agents and depositories. Low trading volumes and volatile prices in less developed markets may make trades harder to
complete and settle, and governments or trade groups may compel local agents to hold securities in designated depositories that may not be subject to independent evaluation. Local agents are held only to the standards of care of their local markets.
In general, the less developed a country’s securities markets are, the higher the degree of custody risk.</font></div>
<div>Financials Sector Risk.<font>
Companies in the financials sector of an economy are subject to extensive governmental regulation and intervention, which may adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge, the amount of capital they must maintain
and, potentially, their size. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law. Governmental regulation may change frequently and may have significant adverse
consequences for companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by such regulation. Recently enacted legislation in the U.S. has relaxed capital requirements and other regulatory burdens on certain U.S. banks. While the effect of
the legislation may benefit certain companies in the financials sector, increased risk taking by affected banks may also result in greater overall risk in the financials sector. The impact of changes in capital requirements, or recent or future
regulation in various countries, on any individual financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. Certain risks may impact the value of investments in the financials sector more severely than those of investments
outside this sector, including the risks associated with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage. Companies in the financials sector may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and loan losses, decreases in the
availability of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades and adverse conditions in other related markets. Insurance companies, in particular, may be subject to severe price competition and/or rate regulation, which may have an adverse
impact on their profitability. The financials sector is particularly sensitive to fluctuations in interest</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>rates. The financials sector is also a target for cyber-attacks, and may
experience technology malfunctions and disruptions. In recent years, cyber-attacks and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector and have reportedly caused losses to companies in this sector, which may
negatively impact the Fund.</div> <div>Illiquid Investments Risk. <font>The Fund may invest up to an aggregate amount of 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market
conditions in seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the investment. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid investments may reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be
unable to transact at advantageous times or prices. An investment may be illiquid due to, among other things, the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a market in securities or instruments or the lack of an active
market for such securities or instruments. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or instruments with substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have increased exposure to the risks associated with illiquid investments.
Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, particularly during periods of market turmoil. There can be no assurance that a security or instrument that is deemed to be liquid when purchased will continue to be liquid for as
long as it is held by the Fund, and any security or instrument held by the Fund may be deemed an illiquid investment pursuant to the Fund’s Liquidity Program. Illiquid investments may be harder to value, especially in changing markets.
Although the Fund primarily seeks to redeem shares of the Fund on an in-kind basis, if the Fund is forced to sell underlying investments at reduced prices or under unfavorable conditions to meet redemption requests or for other cash needs, the Fund
may suffer a loss. This may be magnified in a rising interest rate environment or other circumstances where redemptions from the Fund may be greater than normal. Other market participants may be attempting to liquidate holdings at the same time as
the Fund, causing increased supply of the Fund’s underlying investments in the market and contributing to illiquid investments risk and downward pricing pressure. During periods of market volatility, liquidity in the market for the
Fund’s shares may be impacted by the liquidity in the market for the underlying securities or instruments held by the Fund, which could lead to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to the Fund’s NAV.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Issuers Risk<font>. The Fund
may invest in U.S. dollar-denominated bonds of non-U.S. corporations. Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers have different risks from securities issued by U.S. issuers. These risks include differences in accounting, auditing and financial reporting
standards, the possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation, adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations, political instability which could affect U.S. investments in non-U.S. countries, uncertainties of transnational
litigation, and potential restrictions on the flow of international capital, including the possible seizure or nationalization of the securities issued by non-U.S. issuers held by the Fund. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject to less governmental
regulation than U.S. issuers. Moreover, individual non-U.S. economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy in such respects as growth</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>of gross domestic product, rate of inflation, capital reinvestment, resource
self-sufficiency and balance of payment positions. Unfavorable political, economic or governmental developments in non-U.S. countries could affect the payment of a security’s principal and interest. Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may
also be less liquid than, and more difficult to value than, securities of U.S. issuers. In addition, the value of these securities may fluctuate due to changes in the exchange rate of the issuer’s local currency against the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>Privatization Risk.<font> Some
countries in which the Fund invests have privatized, or have begun the process of privatizing, certain entities and industries. Newly privatized companies may face strong competition from government-sponsored competitors that have not been
privatized. In some instances, investors in newly privatized entities have suffered losses due to the inability of the newly privatized entities to adjust quickly to a competitive environment or changing regulatory and legal standards or, in some
cases, due to re-nationalization of such privatized entities. There is no assurance that similar losses will not recur.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. <font>Investment in developed country issuers may subject the Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and other risks associated with developed countries.</font> <font>Developed
countries generally tend to rely on services sectors (</font><font>e.g.,</font><font> the financial services sector) as the primary means of economic growth. A prolonged
slowdown in one or more services sectors is likely to have a negative impact on economies of certain developed countries, although economies of individual developed countries can be impacted by slowdowns in other sectors. In the past, certain
developed countries have been targets of terrorism, and some geographic areas in which the Fund invests have experienced strained international relations due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense concerns and other security
concerns. These situations may cause uncertainty in the financial markets in these countries or geographic areas and may adversely affect the performance of the issuers to which the Fund has exposure. Heavy regulation of certain markets, including
labor and product markets, may have an adverse effect on certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause prolonged periods of recession. Many developed countries are heavily indebted and face rising healthcare and
retirement expenses. In addition, price fluctuations of certain commodities and regulations impacting the import of commodities may negatively affect developed country economies.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets.<font> Investments in emerging market issuers are subject to a greater risk of loss than investments in issuers located or operating in more developed markets. This is due to, among other things, the potential for greater
market volatility, lower trading volume, higher levels of inflation, political and economic instability, greater risk of a market shutdown and more governmental limitations on foreign investments in emerging market countries than are typically found
in more developed markets. Moreover, emerging markets often have less uniformity in accounting and reporting requirements, less reliable securities valuations and greater risks associated with custody of securities than developed markets. In
addition, emerging markets often have greater risk of capital controls through such measures as taxes or interest rate control than developed markets. Certain emerging market</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>countries may also lack the infrastructure necessary to attract large amounts
of foreign trade and investment. Local securities markets in emerging market countries may trade a small number of securities and may be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings
difficult or impossible at times. Settlement procedures in emerging market countries are frequently less developed and reliable than those in the U.S. (and other developed countries). In addition, significant delays may occur in certain markets in
registering the transfer of securities. Settlement or registration problems may make it more difficult for the Fund to value its portfolio securities and could cause the Fund to miss attractive investment opportunities.</div>
<div>Investing in emerging market countries involves a higher risk
of loss due to expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and on repatriation of capital invested in certain emerging market countries.</div>
<div>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.<font>
If certain aggregate and/or fund-level ownership thresholds are reached either through transactions undertaken by BFA, its affiliates or the Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions or actions by an issuer or regulator, the ability of BFA
and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to purchase or dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make
investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant threshold limits, and such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the Fund’s portfolio holdings compared to the performance of the
Underlying Index. This may increase the risk of the Fund being underinvested to the Underlying Index and increase the risk of tracking error.</font></div>
<div>For example, in certain circumstances where the Fund invests in
securities issued by companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or international markets, or is subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or invests in certain futures or other derivative
transactions, there may be limits on the aggregate and/or fund-level amount invested or voted by BFA and its affiliates for their proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Fund) that may not be exceeded without the grant of a
license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if exceeded, may cause BFA and its affiliates, the Fund or other client accounts to suffer disadvantages or business restrictions.</div>
<div>Portfolio Holdings Information</div>
<div>A description of the Trust's policies and procedures with
respect to the disclosure of the Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Fund's Statement of Additional Information (“SAI”). The top holdings of the Fund can be found at www.iShares.com. Fund fact sheets provide information

<div>program for the Fund and manages the investment of the Fund’s assets. In
managing the Fund, BFA may draw upon the research and expertise of its asset management affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment
strategists and other investment specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</div>
<div>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and
the Trust (entered into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio
securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of the Trustees who are not “interested
persons” of the Trust).</div> <div>For its investment advisory
services to the Fund, BFA is paid a management fee from the Fund based on a percentage of the Fund’s average daily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.06%. BFA has contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees in an amount
equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any, attributable to investments by the Fund in other registered investment companies advised by BFA, or its affiliates, through February 28, 2021. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to
February 28, 2021 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA. In addition, BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses in order to limit total annual fund operating expenses (excluding Acquired Fund Fees and
Expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any time.</div>
<div>BFA is located at 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.
It is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”). As of March 31, 2019, BFA and its affiliates provided investment advisory services for assets in excess of $6.52 trillion. BFA and its affiliates trade and
invest for their own accounts in the actual securities and types of securities in which the Fund may also invest, which may affect the price of such securities.</div>
<div>A discussion regarding the basis for the approval by the
Trust's Board of Trustees (the “Board”) of the Investment Advisory Agreement with BFA is available in the Fund's semi-annual report for the period ended August 31.</div>
<div>Portfolio Managers.<font> James Mauro
and Scott Radell are primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund. Each Portfolio Manager is responsible for various functions related to portfolio management, including, but not limited to, investing cash inflows, coordinating
with members of his portfolio management team to focus on certain asset classes, implementing investment strategy, researching and reviewing investment strategy and overseeing members of his portfolio management team that have more limited
responsibilities.</font></div> <div>James Mauro has been employed by
BFA or its affiliates as a portfolio manager since 2011. Prior to that, Mr. Mauro was a Vice President at State Street Global Advisors. Mr. Mauro has been a Portfolio Manager of the Fund since 2016.</div> </div>

<div>Conflicts of Interest. <font>The
investment activities of BFA and its affiliates (including BlackRock and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Affiliates”)) and their directors, officers and employees and of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (which, through a
subsidiary, has a significant economic interest in BlackRock) and its subsidiaries (each with The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., an “Entity” and collectively, the “Entities”) in the management of, or their interest in,
their own accounts and other accounts they manage, may present conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA, its Affiliates and the Entities provide investment management services to other funds and discretionary
managed accounts that may follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA, its Affiliates and the Entities are involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management activities and may engage in the ordinary
course of business in activities in which their interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or one or more Affiliates or Entities act, or may act, as an investor, investment banker, research provider,
investment manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, adviser, market maker, trader, prime broker, lender, index provider, agent and/or principal, and have other direct and indirect interests in
securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other instruments in which the Fund may directly or indirectly invest. Thus, it is likely that the Fund will have multiple business relationships with and will invest in, engage in transactions
with, make voting decisions with respect to, or obtain services from, entities for which an Affiliate or an Entity performs or seeks to perform investment banking or other services. Specifically, the Fund may invest in securities of, or engage in
other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate or an Entity has developed or is trying to develop investment banking relationships or in which an Affiliate or an Entity has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The
Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which an Affiliate or an Entity provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of such issuances. The Fund also may invest
in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate or an Entity provides or may in the future provide research coverage. An Affiliate or an Entity may have business relationships with, and purchase or distribute
or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, and may receive compensation for such services. The Fund may also make brokerage and other
payments to Entities in</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>connection with the Fund's portfolio investment transactions. BFA or one or
more Affiliates or Entities may engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment objectives similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for transactions in the same types of securities, currencies
and other instruments as the Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end investment companies (which may include investment companies that are affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”)). The trading activities of BFA and these Affiliates or Entities are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly by the Fund and may result
in BFA or an Affiliate or an Entity having positions in certain securities that are senior or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities that are owned by the Fund.</div>
<div>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to
share any investment opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an
Affiliate and of other accounts managed by an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The
opposite result is also possible.</div> <div>In addition, the Fund
may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an Affiliate or an Entity or its or their directors, officers or employees or other clients have an adverse interest. Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or
managed by BFA, its Affiliates or Entities may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or by BFA, its Affiliates or Entities or their directors, officers or employees, may have the effect of diluting or otherwise
disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund's activities may be limited because of regulatory
restrictions applicable to BFA, one or more Affiliates or Entities and/or their internal policies designed to comply with such restrictions.</div>
<div>Under a securities lending program approved by the Board, the
Fund has retained BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., an Affiliate of BFA, to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent that the Fund participates in the securities lending program. For these services, the securities
lending agent will receive a fee from the Fund, including a fee based on the returns earned on the Fund’s investment of the cash received as collateral for the loaned securities. In addition, one or more Affiliates or Entities may be among the
entities to which the Fund may lend its portfolio securities under the securities lending program.</div>
<div>The activities of BFA, its Affiliates and Entities and their
respective directors, officers or employees, may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA has adopted policies and procedures designed to address these potential conflicts of interest. See
the SAI for further information.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Additional shareholder information, including how to buy and
sell shares of the Fund, is available free of charge by calling toll-free: 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or visiting our website at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>Buying and Selling Shares.<font>
Shares of the Fund may be acquired or redeemed directly from the Fund only in Creation Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section below)
may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a Creation Unit.</font></div>
<div>Shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange
for trading during the trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of other publicly-traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or
otherwise in the secondary market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol “IMTB.”</div>
<div>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary
market involves two types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may
be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread,” that is, any difference between the bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over
time for shares of the Fund based on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading volume and market liquidity (which
is often the case for funds that are newly launched or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity or illiquidity of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller funds or in
instances of significant volatility of the underlying securities.</div>
<div>The Board has adopted a policy of not monitoring for frequent
purchases and redemptions of Fund shares (“frequent trading”) that appear to attempt to take advantage of a potential arbitrage opportunity presented by a lag between a change in the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities after
the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities and the reflection of that change in the Fund’s NAV (“market timing”), because the Fund sells and redeems its shares directly through transactions that are
in-kind and/or for cash, subject to the conditions described below under <font>Creations and Redemptions</font>. The Board has not adopted a policy of monitoring for other frequent trading activity because shares of the
Fund are listed for trading on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are
listed is open for trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays (or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day,
Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s listing exchange is NYSE Arca.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act restricts investments by
investment companies, including foreign investment companies, in the securities of other investment companies. Registered investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund beyond the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to certain
terms and conditions set forth in SEC rules or in an SEC exemptive order issued to the Trust. In order for a registered investment company to invest in shares of the Fund beyond the limitations of Section 12(d)(1) pursuant to the exemptive relief
obtained by the Trust, the registered investment company must enter into an agreement with the Trust. Foreign investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund only up to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to any applicable SEC
no-action relief.</div> <div>Book Entry.<font> Shares of the Fund are held in book-entry form, which means that no stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee is the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all
outstanding shares of the Fund.</font></div> <div>Investors owning
shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as shown on the records of DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing
corporations and other institutions that directly or indirectly maintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your
name, and you are not considered a registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other
securities that you hold in book-entry or “street name” form.</div>
<div>Share Prices.<font> The trading
prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as the supply of and demand for ETF shares and underlying securities held by the Fund, economic
conditions and other factors. Information regarding the intraday value of shares of the Fund, also known as the “indicative optimized portfolio value” (“IOPV”), is disseminated every 15 seconds throughout each trading day by
the national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed or by market data vendors or other information providers. The IOPV is based on the current market value of the securities or other assets and/or cash required to be deposited in
exchange for a Creation Unit. The IOPV does not necessarily reflect the precise composition of the current portfolio of securities or other assets held by the Fund at a particular point in time or the best possible valuation of the current
portfolio. Therefore, the IOPV should not be viewed as a “real-time” update of the Fund's NAV, which is computed only once a day. The IOPV is generally determined by using both current market quotations and price quotations obtained from
broker-dealers and other market intermediaries that may trade in the portfolio securities or other assets held by the Fund. The quotations of certain Fund holdings may not be updated during U.S. trading hours if such holdings do not trade in the
U.S. The Fund is not involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or dissemination of the IOPV and makes no representation or warranty as to its accuracy.</font></div>

<div>on each day that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of
closing, provided that (i) any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers
and (ii) U.S. fixed-income assets may be valued as of the announced closing time for trading in fixed-income instruments in a particular market or exchange. The NAV of the Fund is calculated by dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (<font>i.e.</font>, the value of its total assets less total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally rounded to the nearest cent.</div>
<div>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities
held by the Fund are determined pursuant to valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board.</div>
<div>The Fund values fixed-income portfolio securities using last
available bid prices or current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated prices) supplied by the Fund's approved independent third-party pricing services, each in accordance with valuation policies and procedures approved
by the Board. Pricing services may use matrix pricing or valuation models that utilize certain inputs and assumptions to derive values. Pricing services generally value fixed-income securities assuming orderly transactions of an institutional round
lot size, but the Fund may hold or transact in such securities in smaller odd lot sizes. Odd lots often trade at lower prices than institutional round lots. An amortized cost method of valuation may be used with respect to debt obligations with
sixty days or less remaining to maturity unless BFA determines in good faith that such method does not represent fair value.</div>
<div>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities, U.S. government
securities, money market instruments and certain fixed-income securities is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of business on the NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are
determined as of such times.</div> <div>When market quotations are
not readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, the Fund’s investments are valued at fair value. Fair value determinations are made by BFA in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board. BFA may conclude that a
market quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its lack of trading or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent price quotations
or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is
listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is available. A “significant event” is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s
assets or liabilities, that the event is likely to cause a material change to the closing market price of one or more assets or liabilities held by the Fund. Non-U.S. securities whose values are affected by volatility that occurs in the local
markets or in related or highly correlated assets (<font>e.g.,</font> American Depositary Receipts, Global Depositary Receipts or substantially identical ETFs) on a trading day after the close of non-U.S. securities
markets may be fair valued.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div><br/> Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the
value of an asset or liability. The fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length
transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been sold during the period in which
the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn,
could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the performance of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Dividends and Distributions</div>
<div>General Policies.<font> Dividends
from net investment income, if any, generally are declared and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make distributions on a more
frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company or to avoid imposition of
income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</font></div>
<div>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are
distributed on a <font>pro rata</font> basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds received
from the Fund.</div> <div>Dividend Reinvestment Service.<font> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend
distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If
this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in the secondary market.</font></div>
<div>Taxes.<font> As with any investment,
you should consider how your investment in shares of the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general information, based on current law. There is no guarantee that shares of the Fund will receive certain
regulatory or accounting treatment. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Unless your investment in Fund shares is made through a
tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund
shares.</div> <div>Taxes on Distributions.<font> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income, including distributions of income from securities lending and distributions out of the Fund's net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as

<div>Fund's distributions of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net
short-term capital losses are taxable as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the shares. Long-term capital gains are eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether
their income exceeds certain threshold amounts. Distributions from the Fund are subject to a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax on “net investment income,” for individuals with incomes exceeding $200,000 ($250,000 if married and
filing jointly) and of estates and trusts. In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal income tax for the year when they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on December 31 of the prior
year.</div> <div>You may lose the ability to use foreign tax credits
passed through by the Fund if your Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending agreement.</div>
<div>If the Fund's distributions exceed current and accumulated
earnings and profits, all or a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum distribution requirements, but not in excess of
the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder's cost basis and will result
in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the shareholder holds
shares of the Fund as capital assets.</div> <div>Dividends, interest
and capital gains earned by the Fund with respect to securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to withholding, capital gains and other taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the U.S. may reduce
or eliminate such taxes. If more than 50% of the total assets of the Fund at the close of a year consists of non-U.S. stocks or securities (generally, for this purpose, depositary receipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S. companies are treated
as “non-U.S.”), generally the Fund may “pass through” to you certain non-U.S. income taxes (including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund. This means that you would be considered to have received as an additional dividend
your share of such non-U.S. taxes, but you may be entitled to either a corresponding tax deduction in calculating your taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations, a credit in calculating your U.S. federal income tax.</div>
<div>For purposes of foreign tax credits for U.S. shareholders of
the Fund, foreign capital gains taxes may not produce associated foreign source income, limiting the availability of such credits for U.S. persons.</div>
<div>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if
you are a non-U.S. entity (other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) will generally be subject to a 30% U.S.
federal withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate applies provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital gains or upon the sale
or other disposition of shares of the Fund.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on
U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items paid to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) information
regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will need
to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders; comply with due diligence procedures
with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts; report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account holders
who fail to provide the required information; and determine certain other information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local
revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership,
unless certain exceptions apply.</div> <div>If you are a resident or
a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup withholding at a 24% rate will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</div>
<div>Taxes When Shares are Sold.<font>
Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares held for one
year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to
such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from capital gain dividends, are included in “net investment income” for purposes of the 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned
above.</font></div> <div>The foregoing discussion summarizes some of
the consequences under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and sales of shares. Certain states and
localities may exempt from tax distributions attributable to interest from U.S. federal government obligations. Consult your personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund under all applicable tax
laws.</div> <div>Creations and Redemptions.<font> Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the Fund are “created” at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in block-size Creation Units of 100,000 shares or multiples thereof.
Each “creator” or authorized participant (an “Authorized Participant”) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, BlackRock Investments, LLC (the “Distributor”), an affiliate of BFA.</font></div>

<div>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the
Distributor and the Fund, generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) (“Deposit
Securities”) and a specified amount of cash approximating the holdings of the Fund in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. To the extent practicable, the composition of such portfolio generally corresponds <font>pro rata </font>to the holdings of the Fund. However, creation baskets will generally correspond to the price and yield performance of the Fund. The Fund may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units partially or
solely for cash.</div> <div>Similarly, shares can be redeemed only
in Creation Units, generally for a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) held by the Fund (“Fund Securities”) and a specified amount of cash. <font>Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by the Fund.</font></div>
<div>The prices at which creations and redemptions occur are based
on the next calculation of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under the authorized participant agreement.</div>
<div>The Deposit Securities required for purchase of a Creation Unit
may be different than the Fund Securities the Fund will deliver upon redemption of Fund shares. The Deposit Securities and Fund Securities, as applicable, in connection with a purchase or redemption of a Creation Unit, generally will correspond <font>pro rata</font>, to the extent practicable, to the securities held by the Fund.</div>
<div>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation
Units with the Fund. Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</div>
<div>In the event of a system failure or other interruption,
including disruptions at market makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at all, or the Fund may not be able to place or
change orders.</div> <div>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind
transactions, the Fund intends to comply with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any securities accepted for deposit and any
securities used to satisfy redemption requests will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the 1933 Act. Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a “qualified institutional buyer,” as such term is
defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</div>
<div>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is
either a member of the Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations.
Information about the procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</div>

<div>be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some
activities on their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the
1933 Act. Any determination of whether one is an underwriter must take into account all the relevant facts and circumstances of each particular case.</div>
<div>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not
“underwriters” but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and thus dealing with shares that are part of an “unsold allotment” within the meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the
1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is
available only with respect to transactions on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>Costs Associated with Creations and Redemptions.<font> Authorized Participants are charged standard creation and redemption transaction fees to offset transfer and other transaction costs associated with the issuance and redemption of Creation Units. The standard creation
and redemption transaction fees are set forth in the table below. The standard creation transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant creates a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number
of Creation Units purchased by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Similarly, the standard redemption transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant redeems a Creation Unit, and
is the same regardless of the number of Creation Units redeemed by the Authorized Participant on the applicable business day. Creations and redemptions for cash (when cash creations and redemptions (in whole or in part) are available or specified)
are also subject to an additional charge (up to the maximum amounts shown in the table below). This charge is intended to compensate for brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, price movement and other costs and expenses related to cash
transactions (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to acquire or dispose of Fund shares may pay fees for such
services.</font></div> <div>The following table shows, as of March

<div>Distribution</div>
<div>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the
Fund on an agency basis. The Distributor does not maintain a secondary market in shares of the Fund. The Distributor has no role in determining the policies of the Fund or the securities that are purchased or sold by the Fund. The
Distributor’s principal address is 1 University Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</div>
<div>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers,
registered investment advisers, banks or other intermediaries (together, “intermediaries”) related to marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and
reporting systems, data provision services, or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may be significant to the intermediary,
are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type are sometimes referred to as
revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other financial incentives it is
eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the Fund or other
iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such
payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</font></div>

investment in the Fund, assuming reinvestment of all dividends and distributions. This information has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, whose report is included, along with the Fund's financial statements, in the Fund's Annual Report

<div>Supplemental Information</div>
<div>I. Premium/Discount Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents information about the
differences between the daily market price on secondary markets for shares of the Fund and the Fund’s NAV. NAV is the price at which the Fund issues and redeems shares. It is calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing
mutual fund shares. The price used to calculate market returns (“Market Price”) of the Fund generally is determined using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary securities exchange on which shares of the
Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund’s NAV is calculated. The Fund’s Market Price may be at, above or below its NAV. The NAV of the Fund will fluctuate with changes in the value of its portfolio holdings. The Market
Price of the Fund will fluctuate in accordance with changes in its NAV, as well as market supply and demand.</div>
<div>Premiums or discounts are the differences (expressed as a
percentage) between the NAV and Market Price of the Fund on a given day, generally at the time the NAV is calculated. A premium is the amount that the Fund is trading above the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV. A discount is the
amount that the Fund is trading below the reported NAV, expressed as a percentage of the NAV.</div>
<div>The following information shows the frequency of distributions
of premiums and discounts for the Fund for each full calendar quarter of 2018 and the first calendar quarter of 2019.</div>
<div>Each line in the table shows the number of trading days in
which the Fund traded within the premium/discount range indicated. Premium/discount ranges with no trading days are omitted. The number of trading days in each premium/discount range is also shown as a percentage of the total number of trading days
in the period covered by the table. All data presented here represents past performance, which cannot be used to predict future results.</div> <div>

<div>II. Total Return Information</div>
<div>The table that follows presents information about the total
returns of the Fund and the Underlying Index as of the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019.</div>
<div>“Average Annual Total Returns” represents the
average annual change in value of an investment over the periods indicated. “Cumulative Total Returns” represents the total change in value of an investment over the periods indicated.</div>
<div>The Fund’s NAV is the value of one share of the Fund as
calculated in accordance with the standard formula for valuing mutual fund shares. The NAV return is based on the NAV of the Fund and the market return is based on the Market Price of the Fund. Market Price generally is determined by using the
midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest ask on the primary stock exchange on which shares of the Fund are listed for trading, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated. Since shares of the Fund did not trade in the secondary market
until after the Fund's inception, for the period from inception to the first day of secondary market trading in shares of the Fund, the NAV of the Fund is used as a proxy for the Market Price to calculate market returns. Market and NAV returns
assume that dividends and capital gain distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at Market Price and NAV, respectively.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, that is not an investment product and that tracks a specified financial market or sector. Unlike the Fund, the Underlying Index does not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore does not incur the expenses
incurred by the Fund. These expenses negatively impact the performance of the Fund. Also, market returns do not include brokerage commissions and other charges that may be payable on secondary market transactions. If brokerage commissions were
included, market returns would be lower. The returns shown in the following table do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on Fund distributions or the redemption or sale of Fund shares. The investment return and principal
value of shares of the Fund will vary with changes in market conditions. Shares of the Fund may be worth more or less than their original cost when they are redeemed or sold in the market. The Fund’s past performance is no guarantee of future
results.</div> <div>Performance as of February 28, 2019</div>

<div>Each Fund is managed by BlackRock Fund Advisors
(“BFA”), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc., and generally seeks to track the investment results of the specific benchmark index identified in the applicable Prospectus for that Fund (each, an “Underlying
Index”).</div> <div>Each Fund offers and issues shares at
their net asset value per share (“NAV”) only in aggregations of a specified number of shares (each, a “Creation Unit”), generally in exchange for a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities
for which cash may be substituted) included in its Underlying Index (the “Deposit Securities”), together with the deposit of a specified cash payment (the “Cash Component”). Shares of the Funds are listed for trading on
national securities exchanges such as Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (“Cboe BZX”), The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC (“NASDAQ”) or NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”) (each a “Listing Exchange”). Shares of each Fund are
traded in the secondary market and elsewhere at market prices that may be at, above or below the Fund's NAV. Shares are redeemable only in Creation Units by Authorized Participants (as defined in the <font>Portfolio
Holdings Information</font> section of this SAI), and, generally, in exchange for portfolio securities and a Cash Amount (as defined in the <font>Redemption of Creation Units</font> section of this SAI). Creation Units
typically are a specified number of shares, generally ranging from 50,000 to 100,000 shares or multiples thereof.</div>
<div>The Trust reserves the right to permit or require that
creations and redemptions of shares are effected fully or partially in cash and reserves the right to permit or require the substitution of Deposit Securities in lieu of cash. Shares may be issued in advance of receipt of Deposit Securities, subject
to various conditions, including a requirement that the Authorized Participant maintain with the Trust a cash deposit equal to at least 105% and up to 122%, which percentage BFA may change from time to time, of the market value of the omitted
Deposit Securities. The Trust may use such cash deposit at any time to purchase Deposit Securities. See the <font>Creation and Redemption of Creation Units</font> section of this SAI. Transaction fees and other costs
associated with creations or redemptions that include a cash portion may be higher than the transaction fees and other costs associated with in-kind creations or redemptions. In all cases, conditions with respect to creations and redemptions of
shares and fees will be limited in accordance with the requirements of SEC rules and regulations applicable to management investment companies offering redeemable securities.</div>
<div>Exchange Listing and Trading</div>
<div>A discussion of exchange listing and trading matters
associated with an investment in each Fund is contained in the <font>Shareholder Information</font> section of each Fund's Prospectus. The discussion below supplements, and should be read in conjunction with, that section
of the applicable Prospectus.</div> <div>Shares of each Fund are
listed for trading, and trade throughout the day, on the applicable Listing Exchange and in other secondary markets. Shares of certain Funds may also be listed on certain non-U.S. exchanges. There can be no assurance that the requirements of the
Listing Exchange necessary to maintain the listing of shares of any Fund will continue to be met. The Listing Exchange may, but is not required to, remove the shares of a Fund from listing if, among other things: (i) following the initial 12-month
period beginning upon the commencement of trading of Fund shares, there are fewer than 50 record and/or beneficial owners of shares of a Fund for 30 or more consecutive trading days, (ii) the value of the Underlying Index on which a Fund is based is
no longer calculated or available, or (iii) any other event shall occur or condition shall exist that, in the opinion of the Listing Exchange, makes further dealings on the Listing Exchange inadvisable. The Listing Exchange will also remove shares
of a Fund from listing and trading upon termination of such Fund or in the event a Fund does not comply with the continuous listing standards of the Listing Exchange, as described in the Fund’s Prospectus.</div>
<div>As in the case of other publicly-traded securities, when you
buy or sell shares of a Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission determined by that broker, as well as other charges.</div>
<div>In order to provide additional information regarding the
indicative value of shares of the Funds, the Listing Exchange or a market data vendor disseminates information every 15 seconds through the facilities of the Consolidated Tape Association, or through other widely disseminated means, an updated
indicative optimized portfolio value (“IOPV”) for the Funds as calculated by an information provider or market data vendor. The Trust is not involved in or responsible for any aspect of the calculation or dissemination of the IOPV and
makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy of the IOPV.</div>
<div>An IOPV has a fixed-income securities component and a cash
component. The fixed-income securities values included in an IOPV are the values of the Deposit Securities for a Fund. While the IOPV reflects the current value of the Deposit Securities required to be deposited in connection with the purchase of a
Creation Unit, it does not necessarily reflect the precise composition of the current portfolio of securities held by the Fund at a particular point in time because the current portfolio</div> </div>

 Table of Contents </a> </div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>of the Fund may include securities that are not a part of the current Deposit
Securities. Therefore, a Fund’s IOPV disseminated during the Listing Exchange trading hours should not be viewed as a real-time update of the Fund’s NAV, which is calculated only once a day.</div>
<div>The cash component included in an IOPV consists of estimated
accrued interest, dividends and other income, less expenses. If applicable, each IOPV also reflects changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the applicable currency.</div>
<div>The Trust reserves the right to adjust the share prices of the
Funds in the future to maintain convenient trading ranges for investors. Any adjustments would be accomplished through stock splits or reverse stock splits, which would have no effect on the net assets of the Funds or an investor's equity interest
in the Funds.</div> <div>Investment Strategies and Risks</div>
<div>Each Fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing
primarily in both fixed-income securities that comprise its relevant Underlying Index and in investments that provide substantially similar exposure to securities in the Underlying Index. Each Fund operates as an index fund and is not actively
managed. Adverse performance of a security in a Fund’s portfolio will ordinarily not result in the elimination of the security from the Fund’s portfolio.</div>
<div>Each Fund engages in representative sampling, which is
investing in a sample of securities selected by BFA to have a collective investment profile similar to that of the Fund's Underlying Index. Securities selected have aggregate investment characteristics (based on market capitalization and industry
weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as yield, credit rating, maturity and duration) and liquidity measures similar to those of the Fund’s Underlying Index. A fund that uses representative sampling generally does not hold all of the
securities that are in its underlying index.</div> <div>Although
the Funds do not seek leveraged returns, certain instruments used by the Funds may have a leveraging effect as described below.</div>
<div>Each of the iShares 1-3 Year Treasury Bond ETF, iShares 3-7
Year Treasury Bond ETF, iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF, iShares 10-20 Year Treasury Bond ETF, iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF and iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF (the “Treasury Bond Funds”) generally invests at least 90% of its
assets in the bonds of its Underlying Index and at least 95% of its assets in U.S. government bonds. Each Treasury Bond Fund may invest up to 10% of its assets in U.S. government bonds not included in its Underlying Index, but which BFA believes
will help the Treasury Bond Fund track its Underlying Index. For example, a Treasury Bond Fund may invest in bonds not included in its Underlying Index in order to reflect changes in the relevant Underlying Index (such as reconstitutions, additions
and deletions). Each Treasury Bond Fund also may invest up to 5% of its assets in repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government obligations and in cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its
affiliates (“BlackRock Cash Funds”).</div> <div>Each of
the iShares Broad USD Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares Government/Credit Bond ETF, iShares Intermediate Government/Credit Bond ETF, iShares Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond ETF and iShares Short-Term Corporate Bond ETF generally invests

<div>deletions). Each of the iShares California Muni Bond ETF and iShares New York
Muni Bond ETF generally holds municipal bond securities issued by its respective state and local municipalities whose interest payments are exempt from U.S. federal and state income tax, the federal alternative minimum tax (“AMT”), and
the federal Medicare contribution tax of 3.8% on “net investment income.” Each of the iShares National Muni Bond ETF and iShares Short-Term National Muni Bond ETF will generally hold municipal bond securities issued by state and local
municipalities whose interest payments are exempt from U.S. federal income tax, the federal AMT, and the federal Medicare contribution tax of 3.8% on “net investment income.” In addition, each Municipal Bond Fund intends to invest any
cash assets in one or more affiliated municipal money market funds, which may be advised by BFA or its affiliates.</div>
<div>Asset-Backed Securities Risk.<font>
 Asset-backed securities (“ABS”) represent interests in “pools” of assets, including consumer loans or receivables held in trust. ABS are “pass-through” securities, meaning that principal and interest
payments, net of expenses, made by the borrower on the underlying assets are passed through to the Fund. ABS, like traditional fixed-income securities, are subject to credit, interest rate, call, prepayment, extension, valuation and illiquidity
risk. Because of call, prepayment, and extension risk, however, ABS react differently to changes in interest rates than other bonds. Small movements in interest rates (both increases and decreases) may quickly and significantly reduce the value of
certain ABS. The price paid by the Fund for its ABS, the yield the Fund expects to receive from such securities and the average life of such securities are based on a number of factors, including the anticipated rate of prepayment of the underlying
assets. During periods of difficulty in the credit markets, ABS may decline in value and become less liquid, more volatile, and more difficult to value.</font></div>
<div>The nature of the assets and the servicing of those assets may
subject ABS to additional risks in comparison to mortgage-backed securities. For instance, certain ABS generally do not have the benefit of a security interest in collateral that is comparable in quality to mortgage-backed assets. The value of the
collateral may also be insufficient to cover the principal amount of the obligation. Other ABS, such as those backed by credit card receivables, do not have the benefit of a security interest in collateral at all. Moreover, the values of ABS may be
substantially dependent on the servicing of the underlying asset pools, and are therefore subject to risks associated with the negligence or malfeasance by their servicers and to the credit risk of their servicers.</div>
<div>ABS are often not backed by the full faith and credit of the
U.S. government and are subject to risk of default on the underlying asset, particularly during periods of economic downturn.</div>
<div>Bonds.<font>   Each Fund
invests a substantial portion of its assets in U.S. dollar-denominated bonds. A bond is an interest-bearing security issued by a U.S. or non-U.S. company, or U.S. or non-U.S. governmental unit. The issuer of a bond has a contractual obligation to
pay interest at a stated rate on specific dates and to repay principal (the bond’s face value) periodically or on a specified maturity date. Bonds generally are used by corporations and governments to borrow money from investors.</font></div>
<div>An issuer may have the right to redeem or “call” a
bond before maturity, in which case a fund may have to reinvest the proceeds at lower market rates. Similarly, a fund may have to reinvest interest income or payments received when bonds mature, sometimes at lower market rates. Most bonds bear
interest income at a “coupon” rate that is fixed for the life of the bond. The value of a fixed-rate bond usually rises when market interest rates fall, and falls when market interest rates rise. Accordingly, a fixed-rate bond’s
yield (income as a percent of the bond’s current value) may differ from its coupon rate as its value rises or falls. When an investor purchases a fixed-rate bond at a price that is greater than its face value, the investor is purchasing the
bond at a premium. Conversely, when an investor purchases a fixed-rate bond at a price that is less than its face value, the investor is purchasing the bond at a discount. Fixed-rate bonds that are purchased at a discount pay less current income
than securities with comparable yields that are purchased at face value, with the result that prices for such fixed-rate securities can be more volatile than prices for such securities that are purchased at face value. Other types of bonds bear
interest at an interest rate that is adjusted periodically. Interest rates on “floating rate” or “variable rate” bonds may be higher or lower than current market rates for fixed-rate bonds of comparable quality with similar
final maturities. Because of their adjustable interest rates, the value of “floating rate” or “variable rate” bonds fluctuates much less in response to market interest rate movements than the value of fixed-rate bonds, but
their value may decline if their interest rates do not rise as much, or as quickly, as interest rates in general. Each Fund may treat some of these bonds as having a shorter maturity for purposes of calculating the weighted average maturity of its
investment portfolio. Generally, prices of higher quality issues tend to fluctuate less with changes in market interest rates than prices of lower quality issues and prices of longer maturity issues tend to fluctuate more than prices of shorter
maturity issues. Bonds may be senior or subordinated obligations. Senior obligations generally have the first claim on a corporation’s earnings and assets and, in the event of</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>liquidation, are paid before subordinated obligations. Bonds may be unsecured
(backed only by the issuer’s general creditworthiness) or secured (backed by specified collateral).</div>
<div>Borrowing. <font> Each Fund may
borrow for temporary or emergency purposes, including to meet payments due from redemptions or to facilitate the settlement of securities or other transactions. Under normal market conditions, any borrowing by a Fund will not exceed 10% of the
Fund’s net assets; however, each Fund generally does not intend to borrow money.</font></div>
<div>The purchase of securities while borrowings are outstanding
may have the effect of leveraging a Fund. The incurrence of leverage increases a Fund’s exposure to risk, and borrowed funds are subject to interest costs that will reduce net income. Purchasing securities while borrowings are outstanding
creates special risks, such as the potential for greater volatility in the net asset value of Fund shares and in the yield on a Fund’s portfolio. In addition, the interest expenses from borrowings may exceed the income generated by a
Fund’s portfolio and, therefore, the amount available (if any) for distribution to shareholders as dividends may be reduced. BFA may determine to maintain outstanding borrowings if it expects that the benefits to a Fund’s shareholders
will outweigh the current reduced return.</div> <div>Certain types
of borrowings by a Fund must be made from a bank or may result in a Fund being subject to covenants in credit agreements relating to asset coverage, portfolio composition requirements and other matters. It is not anticipated that observance of such
covenants would impede BFA’s management of a Fund’s portfolio in accordance with a Fund’s investment objectives and policies. However, a breach of any such covenants not cured within the specified cure period may result in
acceleration of outstanding indebtedness and require a Fund to dispose of portfolio investments at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so.</div>
<div>Brady Bonds. <font> Certain of
the Funds may invest in Brady bonds. Brady bonds are securities created through the exchange of existing commercial bank loans to public and private entities in certain emerging markets for new bonds in connection with debt restructurings. Brady
bonds have been issued since 1989. In light of the history of defaults of countries issuing Brady bonds on their commercial bank loans, investments in Brady bonds may be viewed as speculative and subject to the same risks as emerging market
securities. Brady bonds may be fully or partially collateralized or uncollateralized, are issued in U.S. dollars and are actively traded in over-the-counter (“OTC”) secondary markets. Incomplete collateralization of interest or principal
payment obligations results in increased credit risk. U.S. dollar-denominated collateralized Brady bonds, which may be either fixed-rate or floating rate bonds, are generally collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities.</font></div>
<div>Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities Risk. <font> The commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) in which the Fund invests may be issued by entities, such as banks, mortgage lenders or other institutions. These entities are not backed by the full
faith and credit of the U.S. government, and there can be no assurance that the U.S. government would provide financial support to its agencies or instrumentalities where it is not obligated to do so.</font></div>
<div>CMBS depend on cash flows generated by underlying commercial
real-estate loans, receivables or other assets, and can be significantly affected by changes in interest rates, the availability of information concerning the underlying assets and their structure, and the creditworthiness of the originators of the
underlying assets.</div> <div>Due to the nature of the loans they
represent, CMBS are subject to a greater degree of prepayment and extension risk than many other forms of fixed-income securities. Small movements in interest rates (both increases and decreases) may quickly and significantly reduce the value of
certain CMBS. Certain CMBS are issued in several classes with different levels of yield and credit protection. The Fund’s investments in CMBS with several classes may be in the lower classes that have greater risks than the higher classes,
including greater interest rate, credit, prepayment and extension risks.</div>
<div>In addition, the value of CMBS may be adversely affected by
regulatory or tax changes. CMBS issued by non-government entities may offer higher yields than those issued by government entities, but also may be subject to greater volatility than government issues. In the recent past, the market for CMBS has
experienced volatility and reduced liquidity.</div> <div>Corporate
Bonds.<font>  Each Fund (other than the Treasury Bond Funds and the Municipal Bond Funds) may invest in investment-grade and/or high yield corporate bonds. High yield corporate bonds may be deemed speculative and
more volatile than higher rated securities of similar maturity. The investment return of corporate bonds reflects interest earned on the security and changes in the market value of the security. The market value of a corporate bond may be affected

<div>A fund classified as “diversified” under the 1940
Act may not purchase securities of an issuer (other than (i) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities and (ii) securities of other investment companies) if, with respect to 75% of its total assets,
(a) more than 5% of the fund’s total assets would be invested in securities of that issuer or (b) the fund would hold more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of that issuer. With respect to the remaining 25% of its total assets, the
fund may invest more than 5% of its assets in one issuer. Under the 1940 Act, a fund cannot change its classification from diversified to non-diversified without shareholder approval.</div>
<div> A “non-diversified” fund is a fund that is
not limited by the 1940 Act with regard to the percentage of its assets that may be invested in the securities of a single issuer. The securities of a particular issuer (or securities of issuers in particular industries) may constitute a significant
percentage of the underlying index of such a fund and, consequently, the fund’s investment portfolio. This may adversely affect a fund’s performance or subject the fund’s shares to greater price volatility than that experienced by
more diversified investment companies.</div> <div>Each Fund
(whether diversified or non-diversified) intends to maintain the required level of diversification and otherwise conduct its operations so as to qualify as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) for purposes of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”), and to relieve the Fund of any liability for U.S. federal income tax to</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>the extent that its earnings are distributed to shareholders, provided that
the Fund satisfies a minimum distribution requirement. Compliance with the diversification requirements of the Internal Revenue Code may limit the investment flexibility of certain Funds and may make it less likely that the Funds will meet their
respective investment objectives.</div> <div>Futures, Options on
Futures and Securities Options.<font>  Futures contracts, options on futures and securities options may be used by a Fund to simulate investment in its Underlying Index, to facilitate trading or to reduce transaction
costs. Each Fund may enter into futures contracts and options on futures that are traded on a U.S. or non-U.S. futures exchange. Each Fund will not use futures, options on futures or securities options for speculative purposes. Each Fund intends to
use futures and options on futures in accordance with Rule 4.5 of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) promulgated under the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”). BFA, with respect to certain Funds, has claimed an
exclusion from the definition of the term “commodity pool operator” in accordance with Rule 4.5 so that BFA, with respect to such Funds, is not subject to registration or regulation as a commodity pool operator under the CEA. See the
</font><font>Regulation Regarding Derivatives </font><font>section of this SAI for more information.</font></div>
<div>Futures contracts provide for the future sale by one party and
purchase by another party of a specified amount of a specific instrument or index at a specified future time and at a specified price. Stock index contracts are based on investments that reflect the market value of common stock of the firms included
in the investments. Each Fund may enter into futures contracts to purchase securities indexes when BFA anticipates purchasing the underlying securities and believes prices will rise before the purchase will be made. Upon entering into a futures
contract, a Fund will be required to deposit with the broker an amount of cash or cash equivalents known as “initial margin,” which is similar to a performance bond or good faith deposit on the contract and is returned to the Fund upon
termination of the futures contract if all contractual obligations have been satisfied. Subsequent payments, known as “variation margin,” will be made to and from the broker daily as the price of the instrument or index underlying the
futures contract fluctuates, making the long and short positions in the futures contract more or less valuable, a process known as “marking-to-market.” At any time prior to the expiration of a futures contract, each Fund may elect to
close the position by taking an opposite position, which will operate to terminate the Fund’s existing position in the contract. To the extent required by law, each Fund will segregate liquid assets in an amount equal to its delivery
obligations under the futures contracts. An option on a futures contract, as contrasted with a direct investment in such a contract, gives the purchaser the right, but no obligation, in return for the premium paid, to assume a position in the
underlying futures contract at a specified exercise price at any time prior to the expiration date of the option. Upon exercise of an option, the delivery of the futures position by the writer of the option to the holder of the option will be
accompanied by delivery of the accumulated balance in the writer’s futures margin account that represents the amount by which the market price of the futures contract exceeds (in the case of a call) or is less than (in the case of a put) the
exercise price of the option on the futures contract. The potential for loss related to the purchase of an option on a futures contract is limited to the premium paid for the option plus transaction costs. Because the value of the option is fixed at
the point of sale, there are no daily cash payments by the purchaser to reflect changes in the value of the underlying contract; however, the value of the option changes daily and that change would be reflected in the NAV of each Fund. The potential
for loss related to writing call options is unlimited. The potential for loss related to writing put options is limited to the agreed-upon price per share, also known as the “strike price,” less the premium received from writing the put.
Certain of the Funds may purchase and write put and call options on futures contracts that are traded on an exchange as a hedge against changes in value of their portfolio securities or in anticipation of the purchase of securities, and may enter
into closing transactions with respect to such options to terminate existing positions. There is no guarantee that such closing transactions can be effected.</div>
<div>Securities options may be used by a Fund to obtain access to
securities in its Underlying Index or to dispose of securities in its Underlying Index at favorable prices, to invest cash in a securities index that offers similar exposure to that provided by its Underlying Index or otherwise to achieve the
Fund’s objective of tracking its Underlying Index. A call option gives a holder the right to purchase a specific security at a specified price (“exercise price”) within a specified period of time. A put option gives a holder
the right to sell a specific security at an exercise price within a specified period of time. The initial purchaser of a call option pays the “writer” a premium, which is paid at the time of purchase and is retained by the writer whether
or not such option is exercised. Each Fund may purchase put options to hedge its portfolio against the risk of a decline in the market value of securities held and may purchase call options to hedge against an increase in the price of securities it
is committed to purchase. Each Fund may write put and call options along with a long position in options to increase its ability to hedge against a change in the market value of the securities it holds or is committed to purchase. Each Fund may
purchase or sell securities options on a U.S. or non-U.S. securities exchange or in the OTC market through a transaction with a dealer. Options on a securities index are typically settled on a net basis based on the appreciation or depreciation of
the index level over the strike price. Options on single name securities may be cash- or physically-settled, depending upon the market in which they are traded. Options may be structured so as to be exercisable only on certain dates or on a daily
basis. Options may also be</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>structured to have conditions to exercise
(<font>i.e.</font>, “Knock-in Events”) or conditions that trigger termination (<font>i.e.</font>, “Knock-out Events”). Investments in futures contracts and other
investments that contain leverage may require each Fund to maintain liquid assets in an amount equal to its delivery obligations under these contracts and other investments. Generally, each Fund maintains an amount of liquid assets equal to its
obligations relative to the position involved, adjusted daily on a marked-to-market basis. With respect to futures contracts that are contractually required to “cash-settle,” each Fund maintains liquid assets in an amount at least equal
to the Fund’s daily marked-to-market obligation (<font>i.e.</font>, each Fund’s daily net liability, if any), rather than the contracts’ notional value (<font>i.e.</font>, the
value of the underlying asset). By maintaining assets equal to its net obligation under cash-settled futures contracts, each Fund may employ leverage to a greater extent than if the Fund were required to set aside assets equal to the futures
contracts’ full notional value. Each Fund bases its asset maintenance policies on methods permitted by the SEC and its staff and may modify these policies in the future to comply with any changes in the guidance articulated from time to time
by the SEC or its staff. Changes in SEC guidance regarding the use of derivatives by registered investment companies may adversely impact a Fund’s ability to invest in futures, options or other derivatives or make investments in such
instruments more expensive.</div> <div>High Yield Securities.<font>  Certain Funds may invest in non-investment grade securities. Non-investment grade or “high yield” fixed-income or convertible securities, commonly known to investors as “junk bonds” or
“high yield bonds,” are generally debt securities that are rated below investment grade by one or more of the major rating agencies or are unrated securities that BFA believes are of comparable quality. While generally providing greater
income and opportunity for gain, non-investment grade debt securities may be subject to greater risks than securities that have higher credit ratings, including a high risk of default, and their yields will fluctuate over time. High yield securities
will generally be in the lower rating categories of recognized rating agencies (rated below Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.

credit rating of a high yield security does not necessarily address its market value risk, and ratings may from time to time change, positively or negatively, to reflect developments regarding the issuer’s financial condition. High yield
securities are considered to be speculative with respect to the capacity of the issuer to timely repay principal and pay interest in accordance with the terms of the obligation and may have more credit risk than higher rated securities.</font></div>
<div>The major risks of high yield bond investments include the
following:</div> <div>

<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>High yield bonds may be
issued by less creditworthy issuers. These securities are vulnerable to adverse changes in the issuer’s industry or to general economic conditions. Issuers of high yield bonds may be unable to meet their interest or principal payment
obligations because of an economic downturn, specific issuer developments or the unavailability of additional financing. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>The issuers of high yield
bonds may have a larger amount of outstanding debt relative to their assets than issuers of investment grade bonds. If the issuer experiences financial stress, it may be unable to meet its debt obligations. The issuer’s ability to pay its debt
obligations also may be lessened by specific issuer developments, or the unavailability of additional financing. Issuers of high yield securities are often in the growth stage of their development and/or involved in a reorganization or takeover.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>High yield bonds are
frequently ranked junior to claims by other creditors. If the issuer cannot meet its obligations, the senior obligations are generally paid off before the junior obligations, which will potentially limit a Fund’s ability to fully recover
principal, to receive interest payments when senior securities are in default or to receive restructuring benefits paid to holders of more senior classes of debt. Thus, investors in high yield securities frequently have a lower degree of protection
with respect to principal and interest payments than do investors in higher rated securities. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>High yield bonds frequently
have redemption features that permit an issuer to repurchase the security from a Fund before it matures. If an issuer redeems the high yield bonds, a Fund may have to invest the proceeds in bonds with lower yields and may lose income. </td></tr>

<td>The secondary markets for
high yield securities are not as liquid as the secondary markets for higher rated securities. The secondary markets for high yield securities are concentrated in relatively few market makers and participants in the markets are mostly institutional
investors, including insurance companies, banks, other financial institutions and mutual funds. In addition, the trading volume for high yield securities is generally lower than that for higher rated securities and the secondary markets could
contract under adverse market or economic conditions independent of any specific adverse changes in the condition of a particular issuer. Under certain economic and/or market conditions, a Fund may have difficulty disposing of certain high yield
securities due to the limited number of investors in that sector of the market. An illiquid secondary market may adversely affect the market price of the high yield security, which may result in increased difficulty selling the particular issue and
obtaining accurate market quotations on the issue when valuing a Fund’s assets. Market quotations on high yield securities are available only from a limited number of dealers, and such quotations may not be the actual prices available for a
purchase or sale. When the secondary market for high yield securities becomes more illiquid, or in the absence of readily available market quotations for such securities, the relative lack of reliable objective data makes it more difficult to value
such securities, and judgment plays a more important role in determining such valuations. </td></tr>

yield bond markets may react strongly to adverse news about an issuer or the economy, or to the perception or expectation of adverse news, whether or not it is based on fundamental analysis. Additionally, prices for high yield securities may be
affected by legislative and regulatory developments. These developments could adversely affect a Fund’s net asset value and investment practices, the secondary market for high yield securities, the financial condition of issuers of these
securities and the value and liquidity of outstanding high yield securities, especially in a thinly traded market. For example, federal legislation requiring the divestiture by federally insured savings and loan associations of their investments in
high yield bonds and limiting the deductibility of interest by certain corporate issuers of high yield bonds adversely affected the market in the past. </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>Lending Portfolio Securities.<font>
 Each Fund may lend portfolio securities to certain borrowers that BFA determines to be creditworthy, including borrowers affiliated with BFA. The borrowers provide collateral that is maintained in an amount at least equal to the current market
value of the securities loaned. No securities loan shall be made on behalf of a Fund if, as a result, the aggregate value of all securities loaned by the particular Fund exceeds one-third of the value of such Fund's total assets (including the value
of the collateral received). A Fund may terminate a loan at any time and obtain the return of the securities loaned. Each Fund receives, by way of substitute payment, the value of any interest or cash or non-cash distributions paid on the loaned
securities that it would have received if the securities were not on loan.</font></div>
<div>With respect to loans that are collateralized by cash, the
borrower may be entitled to receive a fee based on the amount of cash collateral. The Funds are typically compensated by the difference between the amount earned on the reinvestment of cash collateral and the fee paid to the borrower. In the case of
collateral other than cash, a Fund is typically compensated by a fee paid by the borrower equal to a percentage of the market value of the loaned securities. Any cash collateral may be reinvested in certain short-term instruments either directly on
behalf of each lending Fund or through one or more joint accounts or money market funds, including those affiliated with BFA; such investments are subject to investment risk.</div>
<div>Each Fund conducts its securities lending pursuant to an
exemptive order from the SEC permitting it to lend portfolio securities to borrowers affiliated with the Fund and to retain an affiliate of the Fund to act as securities lending agent. To the extent that a Fund engages in securities lending,
BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) acts as securities lending agent for the Fund, subject to the overall supervision of BFA. BTC administers the lending program in accordance with guidelines approved by the Trust's Board
of Trustees (the “Board,” the trustees of which are the “Trustees”).</div>
<div>Securities lending involves exposure to certain risks,
including operational risk (<font>i.e.,</font> the risk of losses resulting from problems in the settlement and accounting process), “gap” risk (<font>i.e.,</font> the risk of a
mismatch between the return on cash collateral reinvestments and the fees a Fund has agreed to pay a borrower), and credit, legal, counterparty and market risk. If a securities lending counterparty were to default, a Fund would be subject to the
risk of a possible delay in receiving collateral or in recovering the loaned securities, or to a possible loss of rights in the collateral. In the event a borrower does not return a Fund’s securities as agreed, the Fund may experience losses
if the proceeds received from liquidating the collateral do not at least equal the value of the loaned security at the time the collateral is liquidated, plus the transaction costs incurred in</div> </div>

consequences for a Fund. A Fund could lose money if its short-term investment of the collateral declines in value over the period of the loan. Substitute payments received by a Fund representing dividends paid on securities loaned out by the Fund
will not be considered qualified dividend income. BTC will take into account the tax effects on shareholders caused by this difference in connection with a Fund’s securities lending program. Substitute payments received on tax-exempt
securities loaned out will not be tax-exempt income.</div>
<div>Liquidity Risk Management.<font>
 Rule 22e-4 under the Investment Company Act (the “Liquidity Rule”) requires open-end funds, including exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) such as the Funds, to establish a liquidity risk management program (the
“Liquidity Program”) and enhance disclosures regarding fund liquidity. As required by the Liquidity Rule, the Funds have implemented a Liquidity Program, and the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees of the Funds, has
appointed BFA as the liquidity risk program administrator of the Liquidity Program. Under the Liquidity Program, BFA assesses, manages, and periodically reviews each Fund’s liquidity risk and classifies each investment held by a Fund as a
“highly liquid investment,”</font><font> “moderately liquid investment,”</font><font> “less liquid investment” or “illiquid investment.” The
Liquidity Rule defines “liquidity risk” as the risk that a Fund could not meet requests to redeem shares issued by a Fund without significant dilution of the remaining investors’ interest in a Fund. The liquidity of a Fund's
portfolio investments is determined based on relevant market, trading and investment-specific considerations under the Liquidity Program. There are exclusions from certain portions of the liquidity risk management program requirements for
“in-kind” ETFs, as defined in the Liquidity Rule. To the extent that an investment is deemed to be an illiquid investment or a less liquid investment, a Fund can expect to be exposed to greater liquidity risk.</font></div>
<div>Municipal Insurance. <font> A
municipal security may be covered by insurance that guarantees the bond’s scheduled payment of interest and repayment of principal. This type of insurance may be obtained by either (i) the issuer at the time the bond is issued (primary market
insurance), or (ii) another party after the bond has been issued (secondary market insurance).</font></div>
<div>Both primary and secondary market insurance guarantee timely
and scheduled repayment of all principal and payment of all interest on a municipal security in the event of default by the issuer, and cover a municipal security to its maturity, enhancing its credit quality and value.</div>
<div>Municipal security insurance does not insure against market
fluctuations or fluctuations in each of the Municipal Bond Funds' share price. In addition, a municipal security insurance policy will not cover: (i) repayment of a municipal security before maturity (redemption), (ii) nonpayment of principal or
interest caused by negligence or bankruptcy of the paying agent, or (iii) prepayment or payment of an acceleration premium (except for a mandatory sinking fund redemption) or any other provision of a bond indenture that advances the maturity of the
bond. A mandatory sinking fund redemption may be a provision of a municipal security issue whereby part of the municipal security issue may be retired before maturity.</div>
<div>Because a significant portion of the municipal securities
issued and outstanding are insured by a small number of insurance companies, an event involving one or more of these insurance companies could have a significant adverse effect on the value of the securities insured by that insurance company and on
the municipal markets as a whole.</div> <div>Certain significant
providers of insurance for municipal securities have recently incurred significant losses as a result of exposure to sub-prime mortgages and other lower credit quality investments that have experienced recent defaults or otherwise suffered extreme
credit deterioration. As a result, such losses have reduced the insurers’ capital and called into question their continued ability to perform their obligations under such insurance if they are called upon to do so in the future. While an
insured municipal security will typically be deemed to have the rating of its insurer, if the insurer of a municipal security suffers a downgrade in its credit rating or if the market discounts the value of the insurance provided by the insurer, the
value of the municipal security would be more, if not entirely, dependent on the rating of the municipal security independent of insurance.</div>
<div>Municipal Securities.
<font> Certain of the Funds may invest in municipal securities, the interest payments of which are subject to U.S. federal income tax. Certain of the Funds invest in securities issued in the U.S. market by U.S.
states and territories, municipalities and other political subdivisions, agencies, authorities and instrumentalities of states and multi-state agencies or authorities. The municipal securities which the Funds may purchase include general obligation
bonds and limited obligation bonds (or revenue bonds), including industrial development bonds issued pursuant to former U.S. federal tax law. General obligation bonds are obligations involving the credit of an issuer possessing taxing power and are
payable from such issuer’s general revenues and not from any particular source. Limited obligation bonds are payable only from the revenues derived from a particular facility or class of facilities or, in some cases, from the proceeds of a
special excise or other specific revenue source. Industrial development bonds generally are also revenue bonds and thus are not payable from the issuer’s</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>general revenues. The credit and quality of industrial development bonds are
usually related to the credit of the corporate user of the facilities. Payment of interest on and repayment of principal of such bonds is the responsibility of the corporate user (and/or any guarantor). The Funds may invest in private activity
bonds, which are bonds issued by or on behalf of public authorities to obtain funds to provide privately operated housing facilities, airport, mass transit or port facilities, sewage disposal, solid waste disposal or hazardous waste treatment or
disposal facilities and certain local facilities for water supply, gas or electricity. Other types of private activity bonds, the proceeds of which are used for the construction, equipment, repair or improvement of privately operated industrial or
commercial facilities, may constitute municipal securities, although the current U.S. federal tax laws place substantial limitations on the size of such issues.</div>
<div>Certain of the Funds may invest in municipal lease
obligations, including certificates of participation (“COPs”) issued by government authorities or entities to finance the acquisition or construction of equipment, land and/or facilities. The COPs represent participations in a lease, an
installment purchase contract, or a conditional sales contract relating to equipment, land or facilities. As a result of their structure, COPs are generally not subject to constitutional debt limitations or other statutory requirements that may
apply to other municipal securities. Municipal governments may not be obligated to make lease or installment purchase payments in connection with COPs, and, in such circumstances, the COP will be secured only by the leased property. If the issuer of
a COP does not fulfill its payment obligation, it may be difficult to sell the property and the proceeds of a sale may not cover the Fund’s loss. Municipal lease obligations may be less liquid than conventional municipal bonds, but otherwise
have the same general risk characteristics as other municipal securities.</div>
<div>Municipal notes are shorter-term municipal debt obligations.
They may provide interim financing in anticipation of tax collection, receipt of grants, bond sales or revenue receipts. If there is a shortfall in the anticipated proceeds, repayment on a municipal note may be delayed or the note may not be fully
repaid, and the Funds may lose money.</div> <div>Municipal
commercial paper is generally unsecured and issued to meet short-term financing needs. The lack of security presents some risk of loss to the Funds since, in the event of an issuer’s bankruptcy, unsecured creditors are repaid only out of the
assets, if any, that remain after secured creditors are repaid.</div>
<div>Tender option bonds are synthetic floating rate or variable
rate securities issued when long-term bonds are purchased in the primary or secondary market and then deposited into a trust. Custodial receipts are then issued to investors, such as the Funds, evidencing ownership interests in the trust. The
remarketing agent for the trust sets a floating or variable rate on typically a weekly basis. The sponsor of a highly leveraged tender option bond trust generally will retain a liquidity provider to purchase the short-term floating rate interests at
their original purchase price upon the occurrence of certain specified events. However, the liquidity provider may not be required to purchase the floating rate interests upon the occurrence of certain other events, for example, the downgrading of
the municipal bonds owned by the tender option bond trust below investment-grade or certain events that indicate the issuer of the bonds may be entering bankruptcy. The general effect of these provisions is to pass to the holders of the floating
rate interests the most severe credit risks associated with the municipal bonds owned by the tender option bond trust and to leave with the liquidity provider the interest rate risk (subject to a cap) and certain other risks associated with the
municipal bonds. Tender option bonds may be considered derivatives, and may expose the Funds to the same risks as investments in derivatives, as well as risks associated with leverage, especially the risk of increased volatility. To the extent the
Funds invest in tender option bonds, they also are exposed to credit risk associated with the liquidity provider retained by the sponsor of a tender bond option trust.</div>
<div>Variable rate demand obligations (“VRDOs”) are
tax-exempt obligations that contain a floating or variable interest rate adjustment formula and a right of demand on the part of the holder thereof to receive payment of the unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest upon a short notice period
not to exceed seven days. There is the possibility that because of default or insolvency the demand feature of VRDOs may not be honored. The interest rates are adjustable at intervals (ranging from daily to up to one year) to some prevailing market
rate for similar investments, such adjustment formula being calculated to maintain the market rate of the VRDOs at approximately the par value of the VRDOs on the adjustment date. The adjustments typically are based upon the Public Securities
Association Index or some other appropriate interest rate adjustment index.</div>
<div>Because of the interest rate adjustment formula, VRDOs are not
comparable to fixed-rate securities. During periods of declining interest rates, a Fund’s yield on a VRDO will decrease and its shareholders will forego the opportunity for capital appreciation. During periods of rising interest rates,
however, a Fund’s yield on a VRDO will increase and its shareholders will have a reduced risk of capital depreciation.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>The market for municipal bonds may be less liquid than for
taxable bonds. This means that it may be harder to buy and sell municipal securities, especially on short notice, than non-municipal securities. In addition, the municipal securities market is generally characterized as a buy and hold investment
strategy. As a result, the accessibility of municipal securities in the market is generally greater closer to the original date of issue of the securities and lessens as the securities move further away from such issuance date.</div>
<div>Some longer-term municipal securities give the investor the
right to “put” or sell the security at par (face value) within a specified number of days following the investor's request - usually one to seven days. This demand feature enhances a security's liquidity by shortening its effective
maturity and enables it to trade at a price equal to or very close to par. If a demand feature terminates prior to being exercised, a Fund would hold the longer-term security, which could experience substantially more volatility.</div>
<div>Municipal securities are subject to credit and market risk.
Generally, prices of higher quality issues tend to fluctuate more with changes in market interest rates than prices of lower quality issues and prices of longer maturity issues tend to fluctuate more than prices of shorter maturity issues.</div>
<div>Prices and yields on municipal securities are dependent on a
variety of factors, including general money-market conditions, the financial condition of the issuer, general conditions of the municipal security market, the size of a particular offering, the maturity of the obligation and the rating of the issue.
A number of these factors, including the ratings of particular issues, are subject to change from time to time. Information about the financial condition of an issuer of municipal securities may not be as extensive as that which is made available by
corporations whose securities are publicly-traded. As a result, municipal securities may be more difficult to value than securities of public corporations.</div>
<div>Obligations of issuers of municipal securities are subject to
insolvency concerns and, unlike obligations of corporate issuers, may not be subject to resolution in the event of insolvency or default through a bankruptcy proceeding. The U.S. Congress or state legislatures may seek to extend the time for payment
of principal or interest, or both, or to impose other constraints upon enforcement of such obligations. In addition, municipal securities are subject to the risk that their tax treatment could be changed, thereby affecting the value of outstanding
municipal securities. There is also the possibility that as a result of litigation or other conditions, such as passing of a referendum, the power or ability of issuers to meet their obligations for the payment of interest and principal on their
municipal securities may be materially affected or their obligations may be found to be invalid or unenforceable. Such litigation or conditions may from time to time have the effect of introducing uncertainties in the market for municipal securities
or certain segments thereof, or of materially affecting the credit risk with respect to particular bonds. Adverse economic, business, legal or political developments might affect all or a substantial portion of a Fund’s municipal securities in
the same manner.</div> <div>Non-U.S. Securities. <font> Certain of the Funds will invest in certain obligations or securities of non-U.S. issuers. An issuer of a security may be deemed to be located in a particular country if: (i) the principal trading market for the
security is in such country, (ii) the issuer is organized under the laws of such country, (iii) the issuer derives at least 50% of its revenues or profits from such country or has at least 50% of its assets situated in such country or, (iv) the
issuer is the government of the particular country.</font></div>

(“Restricted Securities”). Rule 144A Bonds and Restricted Securities are not publicly-traded and are subject to a variety of restrictions, which limit a purchaser's ability to acquire or resell such securities. Accordingly, the liquidity
of the market for specific Rule 144A Bonds and Restricted Securities may vary. Delay or difficulty in selling such securities may result in a loss to a Fund.</font></div>
<div>Ratings. <font> An
investment-grade rating generally means the security or issuer is rated investment-grade by one or more of Moody’s, S&amp;P Global Ratings, Fitch, or another credit rating agency designated as a nationally recognized statistical rating
organization by the SEC, or is unrated but considered to be of equivalent quality by BFA. Generally, bonds rated Baa3 or above</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

capacity to meet financial commitments.</div> <div>Subsequent to
purchase by a Fund, a rated security may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below an investment-grade rating. Bonds rated lower than Baa3 by Moody’s or BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings or Fitch are considered below investment-grade
quality and are obligations of issuers that are generally considered predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal according to the terms of the obligation and, therefore, carry greater
investment risk, including the possibility of issuer default and bankruptcy and increased market price volatility. Such lower-rated securities are commonly referred to as “junk bonds” and are subject to a substantial degree of credit
risk. Please see Appendix B of this SAI for a description of each rating category of Moody's, S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch and BFA's treatment of investments that are not rated by any of the rating agencies.</div>
<div>Regulation Regarding Derivatives.<font>  The CFTC subjects advisers to registered investment companies to regulation by the CFTC if a fund that is advised by the adviser either (i) invests, directly or indirectly, more than a prescribed level of its
liquidation value in CFTC-regulated futures, options and swaps (“CFTC Derivatives”), or (ii) markets itself as providing investment exposure to such instruments. The CFTC also subjects advisers to registered investment companies to
regulation by the CFTC if the registered investment company invests in one or more commodity pools. To the extent a Fund uses CFTC Derivatives, it intends to do so below such prescribed levels and intends not to market itself as a “commodity
pool” or a vehicle for trading such instruments.</font></div>
<div>BFA has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term
“commodity pool operator” under the CEA pursuant to Rule 4.5 under the CEA with respect to each of the Funds. BFA is not, therefore, subject to registration or regulation as a “commodity pool operator” under the CEA with
respect to the Funds.</div> <div>Derivative contracts, including,
without limitation, swaps, currency forwards, and non-deliverable forwards, are subject to regulation under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) in the U.S. and under comparable regimes in
Europe, Asia and other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Swaps, non-deliverable forwards and certain other derivatives traded in the over-the-counter (“OTC”) market are subject to variation margin requirements, and initial margining requirements
will be phased in through 2020. Implementation of the margining and other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding clearing, mandatory trading, reporting and documentation of swaps and other derivatives have impacted and may continue to impact the
costs to a Fund of trading these instruments and, as a result, may affect returns to investors in a Fund.</div>
<div>As a result of regulatory requirements under the 1940 Act,
each Fund is required to maintain an amount of liquid assets, accrued on a daily basis, having an aggregate value at least equal to the value of a Fund’s obligations under the applicable derivatives contract. To the extent that derivatives
contracts are settled on a physical basis, a Fund will generally be required to maintain an amount of liquid assets equal to the notional value of the contract. On the other hand, in connection with derivatives contracts that are performed on a net
basis, a Fund will generally be required to maintain liquid assets, accrued daily, equal only to the accrued excess, if any, of a Fund’s obligations over those of its counterparty under the contract. Accordingly, reliance by a Fund on
physically-settled derivatives contracts may adversely impact investors by requiring a Fund to set aside a greater amount of liquid assets than would generally be required if a Fund were relying on cash-settled derivatives contracts.</div>
<div>The iShares Core 5-10 Year USD Bond ETF, iShares Core 10+ Year
USD Bond ETF, iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF, iShares ESG U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF, iShares ESG USD Corporate Bond ETF, iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF, iShares Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond ETF, iShares MBS ETF and iShares
Short-Term Corporate Bond ETF (the “No-Action Letter Funds”) may also have investments in “underlying funds” (and such underlying funds themselves may invest in underlying funds) not advised by BFA (the term “underlying
fund” for purposes of the no-action letter referenced below may include, but is not limited to, certain securitized vehicles, mortgage or international real estate investment trusts, business development companies, investment companies that
may invest in CFTC Derivatives, or in any of the foregoing), and therefore may be viewed by the CFTC as commodity pools. BFA has no transparency into the holdings of these underlying funds because they are not advised by BFA. To address this issue
of lack of transparency, the CFTC staff issued a no-action letter on November 29, 2012 permitting the adviser of a fund that invests in such underlying funds and that would otherwise have filed a claim of exclusion pursuant to CFTC Rule 4.5 to delay
registration as a “commodity pool operator” until six months from the date on which the CFTC issues additional guidance on the treatment of CFTC Derivatives held by underlying funds. BFA, the adviser of the No-Action Letter Funds, has
filed a claim with the CFTC for such Funds to rely on this no-action</div> </div> <div type="Block">

regulation as a “commodity pool operator” under the CEA in respect of such Funds.</div>
<div>Repurchase Agreements.<font>  A
repurchase agreement is an instrument under which the purchaser (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, a Fund) acquires a security and the seller agrees, at the time of the sale, to
repurchase the security at a mutually agreed-upon time and price, thereby determining the yield during the purchaser’s holding period. Repurchase agreements may be construed to be collateralized loans by the purchaser to the seller secured by
the securities transferred to the purchaser. If a repurchase agreement is construed to be a collateralized loan, the underlying securities will not be considered to be owned by a Fund but only to constitute collateral for the seller’s
obligation to pay the repurchase price, and, in the event of a default by the seller, the Fund may suffer time delays and incur costs or losses in connection with the disposition of the collateral.</font></div>
<div>In any repurchase transaction, the collateral for a repurchase
agreement may include: (i) cash items; (ii) obligations issued by the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities; or (iii) obligations that, at the time the repurchase agreement is entered into, are determined to (A) have exceptionally
strong capacity to meet their financial obligations and (B) are sufficiently liquid such that they can be sold at approximately their carrying value in the ordinary course of business within seven days.</div>
<div>Repurchase agreements pose certain risks for a Fund that
utilizes them. Such risks are not unique to the Funds, but are inherent in repurchase agreements. The Funds seek to minimize such risks, but because of the inherent legal uncertainties involved in repurchase agreements, such risks cannot be
eliminated. Lower quality collateral and collateral with a longer maturity may be subject to greater price fluctuations than higher quality collateral and collateral with a shorter maturity. If the repurchase agreement counterparty were to default,
lower quality collateral may be more difficult to liquidate than higher quality collateral. Should the counterparty default and the amount of collateral not be sufficient to cover the counterparty’s repurchase obligation, a Fund would likely
retain the status of an unsecured creditor of the counterparty (<font>i.e.</font>, the position a Fund would normally be in if it were to hold, pursuant to its investment policies, other unsecured debt securities of the
defaulting counterparty) with respect to the amount of the shortfall. As an unsecured creditor, a Fund would be at risk of losing some or all of the principal and income involved in the transaction.</div>
<div>Reverse Repurchase Agreements.<font>
 Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities with an agreement to repurchase the securities at an agreed-upon price, date and interest payment and have the characteristics of borrowing. Generally, the effect of such
transactions is that a Fund can recover all or most of the cash invested in the portfolio securities involved during the term of the reverse repurchase agreement, while in many cases the Fund is able to keep some of the interest income associated
with those securities. Such transactions are advantageous only if a Fund has an opportunity to earn a rate of interest on the cash derived from these transactions that is greater than the interest cost of obtaining the same amount of cash.
Opportunities to realize earnings from the use of the proceeds equal to or greater than the interest required to be paid may not always be available, and a Fund intends to use the reverse repurchase technique only when BFA believes it will be
advantageous to the Fund. The use of reverse repurchase agreements may exaggerate any increase or decrease in the value of a Fund’s assets. A Fund’s exposure to reverse repurchase agreements will be covered by liquid assets having a
value equal to or greater than the Fund’s obligations under such commitments. The use of reverse repurchase agreements is a form of leverage, and the proceeds obtained by a Fund through reverse repurchase agreements may be invested in
additional securities.</font></div> <div>Securities of Investment
Companies. <font> Each Fund may invest in the securities of other investment companies (including money market funds) to the extent permitted by law, regulation, exemptive order or SEC staff guidance. Under the 1940
Act, a fund’s investment in investment companies is limited to, subject to certain exceptions, (i) 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of any one investment company, (ii) 5% of the fund’s total assets with respect to any one
investment company, and (iii) 10% of the fund’s total assets with respect to investment companies in the aggregate. To the extent allowed by law or regulation, the Funds intend from time to time to invest their assets in securities of
investment companies, including, but not limited to, money market funds, including those advised by BFA or otherwise affiliated with BFA, in excess of the limits discussed above. Other investment companies in which a Fund invests can be expected to
incur fees and expenses for operations, such as investment advisory and administration fees, which would be in addition to those incurred by a Fund. Pursuant to guidance issued by the SEC staff, fees and expenses of money market funds used for cash
collateral received in connection with loans of securities are not treated as acquired fund fees and expenses, which reflect a Fund’s </font><font>pro rata
</font><font>share of the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies (as disclosed in the Prospectus, as applicable).  The iShares National Muni Bond ETF may invest in shares of other
iShares funds that provide substantially similar exposure to the securities in its Underlying Index. BFA will not charge advisory fees on that portion of the iShares National Muni Bond</font></div> </div>

that portion of the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF's assets invested in shares of other registered investment companies advised by BFA, or its affiliates.</div>
<div>Short-Term Instruments and Temporary Investments.<font>   Each Fund may invest in short-term instruments, including variable rate demand notes, short-term municipal securities, short-term municipal money market funds and money market instruments, on an ongoing basis to
provide liquidity or for other reasons. Money market instruments are generally short-term investments that may include, but are not limited to: (i) shares of money market funds (including those advised by BFA or otherwise affiliated with BFA); (ii)
obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities (including government-sponsored enterprises); (iii) negotiable certificates of deposit, bankers’ acceptances, fixed-time deposits and other obligations
of U.S. and non-U.S. banks (including non-U.S. branches) and similar institutions; (iv) commercial paper rated, at the date of purchase, “Prime-1” by Moody's, “F-1” by Fitch or “A-1” by S&amp;P Global Ratings, or
if unrated, of comparable quality as determined by BFA; (v) non-convertible corporate debt securities (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, bonds and debentures) with remaining
maturities at the date of purchase of not more than 397 days and that have been determined to present minimal credit risks, in accordance with the requirements set forth in Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act; (vi) repurchase agreements; and (vii)
short-term U.S. dollar-denominated obligations of non-U.S. banks (including U.S. branches) that, in the opinion of BFA, are of comparable quality to obligations of U.S. banks that may be purchased by a Fund. Any of these instruments may be purchased
on a current or forward-settled basis. Time deposits are non-negotiable deposits maintained in banking institutions for specified periods of time at stated interest rates. Bankers’ acceptances are time drafts drawn on commercial banks by
borrowers, usually in connection with international transactions.</font></div>
<div>Sovereign and Quasi-Sovereign Obligations. <font> Certain of the Funds may invest in sovereign and quasi-sovereign obligations. An investment in sovereign debt obligations involves special risks not present in corporate debt obligations. Sovereign debt includes
securities issued or guaranteed by a foreign sovereign government. Quasi-sovereign debt includes securities issued or guaranteed by an entity affiliated with or backed by a sovereign government. Quasi-sovereign debt obligations are typically less
liquid and less standardized than sovereign debt obligations. The issuer of the sovereign debt that controls the repayment of the debt may be unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due, and a Fund may have limited recourse in the
event of a default. Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial condition or credit rating of a non-U.S. government may cause the value of a sovereign debt to decline. During periods of economic uncertainty, the market prices of sovereign
debt obligations may be more volatile than prices of U.S. debt obligations, which may affect a Fund's NAV. In the past, certain emerging market countries have encountered difficulties in servicing their debt obligations, withheld payments of
principal and interest and declared moratoria on the payment of principal and interest on their sovereign debts. Several sovereign issuers have experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about rising government debt levels, including
Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. In the past, sovereign issuers have also defaulted on their debt obligations, including Russia, Argentina, Indonesia and Uruguay.</font></div>
<div>A sovereign debtor's willingness or ability to repay principal
and pay interest in a timely manner may be affected by, among other factors, its cash flow situation, the extent of its non-U.S. currency reserves, the availability of sufficient foreign exchange, the relative size of the debt service burden, the
sovereign debtor's policy toward principal international lenders and local political constraints. Sovereign debtors may also be dependent on expected disbursements from foreign governments, multilateral agencies and other entities to reduce
principal and interest arrears on their debt. The failure of a sovereign debtor to implement economic reforms, achieve specified levels of economic performance or repay principal or interest when due may result in the cancellation of third-party
commitments to lend funds to the sovereign debtor, which may further impair such debtor's ability or willingness to service its debts. Quasi-sovereign debt obligations are typically less liquid and less standardized than government debt.</div>
<div>Swap Agreements.<font>  Swap
agreements are contracts between parties in which one party agrees to make periodic payments to the other party based on a pre-determined underlying investment or notional amount. In return, the other party agrees to make periodic payments to the
first party based on the return (or differential in rates of return) earned or realized on the underlying investment or notional amount. Swap agreements will usually be performed on a net basis, with a Fund receiving or paying only the net amount of
the two payments. The net amount of the excess, if any, of a Fund’s obligations over its entitlements with respect to each swap is accrued on a daily basis, and an amount of liquid assets having an aggregate value at least equal to the accrued
excess will be maintained by the Fund.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Certain of the Funds may enter into swap agreements, including
currency swaps, interest rate swaps and index swaps. The use of swaps is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio security transactions. These transactions
generally do not involve the delivery of securities or other underlying assets.</div>
<div>U.S. Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities Risk.<font>  Certain of the Funds invest in securities backed by pools of mortgages issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or one of its agencies or sponsored entities, including Government National Mortgage Association
(“Ginnie Mae”), Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”), and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”). The market for mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) has been
adversely affected by the value of those MBS held and/or issued by these agencies and sponsored entities. If a U.S. government agency or sponsored entity issues securities in which certain of the Funds invest and such issuer is unable to meet its
obligations or ceases to exist, and no plan is made for the repayment of securities, the performance of certain of the Funds will be adversely impacted.</font></div>
<div>Ginnie Mae<font>. Established in
1968, Ginnie Mae is a wholly owned U.S. government corporation within the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Ginnie Mae is authorized to guarantee, with the backing of the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, the timely
payment of principal and interest on securities issued by the institutions approved by Ginnie Mae (such as savings and loan institutions, commercial banks and mortgage banks), and backed by pools of mortgages insured by the Federal Housing
Administration or guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Ginnie Mae securities also are supported by the authority of Ginnie Mae to borrow funds from the U.S. Treasury Department to make payments under its guarantee. Any actual or
potential disruption to Ginnie Mae, or the financial condition or credit of the U.S. government, could cause the value of Ginnie Mae securities to decline. In 2011, S&amp;P Global Ratings downgraded U.S. Treasury securities from AAA rating to AA+
rating. A further downgrade of the ratings of U.S. government debt obligations, which are often used as a benchmark for other borrowing arrangements, could result in higher interest rates for individual and corporate borrowers, cause disruptions in
the international bond markets and have a substantial negative effect on the U.S. economy. A downgrade of U.S. Treasury securities from another ratings agency or a further downgrade below AA+ rating by S&amp;P Global Ratings may cause the value of
Ginnie Mae securities to decline.</font></div> <div>Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac<font>. Fannie Mae was established as a federal agency in 1938 and in 1968 was chartered by Congress as a private shareholder-owned company. Securities issued by Fannie Mae are guaranteed as to timely payment of
principal and interest by Fannie Mae. The securities are not backed by or entitled to the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, but are supported by the right of Fannie Mae to borrow from the U.S. Treasury Department.</font></div>
<div>Freddie Mac is a stockholder-owned corporation chartered by
Congress in 1970. Securities issued by Freddie Mac entitle the holder to timely payment of interests, which is guaranteed by Freddie Mac. Freddie Mac also guarantees either ultimate collection or timely payment of all principal payments. While
Freddie Mac generally does not guarantee timely payment of principal, Freddie Mac may remit the amount due on account of its guarantee of ultimate payment of principal at any time after default on an underlying mortgage, but in no event later than
one year after it becomes payable. The securities are not backed by or entitled to the full faith and credit of the U.S. government or by any Federal Home Loan Banks, but are supported by the right of Freddie Mac to borrow from the U.S. Treasury
Department.</div> <div>In 2008, the Federal Housing Finance Agency
(“FHFA”) placed each of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into government conservatorship in an effort to provide stability in the financial markets and put the government-sponsored entities in sound and solvent condition. In addition, the U.S.
Treasury Department agreed to provide Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac up to $100 billion of capital each on an as needed basis to ensure that they continue to provide liquidity to the housing and mortgage markets.</div>
<div>Mortgage-Backed Securities<font>.
MBS issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or one of its agencies or sponsored entities, such as Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac, represent interests in pools of mortgages in which payments of both principal and interest on the
securities are generally made monthly, in effect “passing through” the payments made by borrowers on the mortgage loans that underlie the securities (net of any fees paid to the issuer or guarantor of the securities). MBS differ from
other forms of debt securities, which normally provide for periodic payment of interest in fixed amounts with principal payments at maturity or specified call dates, while a MBS payments provide a combination of interest and principal throughout the
a bond’s term. As further described below, MBS may be structured as pass-through securities or collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”).</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>MBS are subject to the general risks associated with investing
in real estate securities; that is, they may lose value if the value of the underlying real estate to which a pool of mortgages relates declines. In addition, investments in MBS involve certain specific risks. These risks include the failure of a
party to meet its commitments under the related operative documents, adverse interest rate changes and the effects of prepayments on mortgage cash flows. The value of MBS, like that of traditional fixed-income securities, typically increases when
interest rates fall and decreases when interest rates rise. However, MBS differ from traditional fixed-income securities because of their potential for prepayment without penalty. The price paid by a Fund for its MBS, the yield a Fund expects to
receive from such securities and the weighted average life of the securities are based on a number of factors, including the anticipated rate of prepayment of the underlying mortgages. In a period of declining interest rates, borrowers may prepay
the underlying mortgages more quickly than anticipated, thereby reducing the yield to maturity and the average life of the MBS. Moreover, when a Fund reinvests the proceeds of a prepayment in these circumstances, it will likely receive a rate of
interest that is lower than the rate on the security that was prepaid.</div>
<div>To the extent that a Fund purchases MBS at a premium, mortgage
foreclosures and principal prepayments may result in a loss to the extent of the premium paid. If a Fund buys such securities at a discount, both scheduled payments of principal and unscheduled prepayments will increase current and total returns and
will accelerate the recognition of income, which, when distributed to shareholders, will be taxable as ordinary income. In a period of rising interest rates, prepayments of the underlying mortgages may occur at a slower than expected rate, creating
maturity extension risk. This particular risk may effectively change a security that was considered short- or intermediate-term at the time of purchase into a long-term security. Since the value of long-term securities generally fluctuates more
widely in response to changes in interest rates than that of shorter-term securities, maturity extension risk could increase the inherent volatility of a Fund. Under certain interest rate and prepayment scenarios, a Fund may fail to recoup fully its
investment in MBS notwithstanding any direct or indirect U.S. governmental or agency guarantee.</div>
<div>Mortgage Pass-Through Securities<font>. Some MBS, such as U.S. agency mortgage pass-through securities, represent a right to receive principal and interest payments collected on a pool of mortgages, which are passed through to security holders. In the basic
mortgage pass-through structure, mortgages with similar issuer, term and coupon characteristics are collected and aggregated into a “pool” consisting of multiple mortgage loans. The pool is assigned a CUSIP number and undivided interests
in the pool are traded and sold as pass-through securities. The holder of the security is entitled to a pro rata share of principal and interest payments (including unscheduled prepayments) from the pool of mortgage loans.</font></div>
<div>An investment in a specific pool of mortgage pass-through
securities requires an analysis of the specific prepayment risk of mortgages within the covered pool (since mortgagors typically have the option to prepay their loans). The level of prepayments on a pool of MBS is difficult to predict and can impact
the subsequent cash flows, value and yield of the mortgage pool. In addition, when trading specific mortgage pools, precise execution, delivery and settlement arrangements must be negotiated for each transaction.</div>
<div>To-Be-Announced Securities<font>. A
Fund may seek to gain exposure to U.S. agency mortgage pass-through securities by investing in TBA securities. “TBAs” refer to a commonly used mechanism for the forward settlement of U.S. agency MBS, and not to a separate type of MBS.
Most transactions in fixed-rate MBS occur through the use of TBA transactions. TBA transactions generally are conducted in accordance with widely-accepted guidelines which establish commonly observed terms and conditions for execution, settlement,
and delivery. In a TBA transaction, the buyer and seller decide on general trade parameters, such as the issuing agency, settlement date, par amount, and price. The actual mortgage pools delivered generally are determined two days prior to
settlement date. Certain of the Funds may regularly enter into TBA agreements and “roll over” such agreements prior to the settlement date stipulated in such agreements. This type of TBA transaction is sometimes known as a “TBA
roll.” In a TBA roll, such Funds generally will sell the obligation to purchase the pools stipulated in the TBA agreement prior to the stipulated settlement date and will enter into a new TBA agreement for future delivery of pools of MBS. In
addition, certain of the Funds may enter into TBA agreements and settle such transactions on the stipulated settlement date by accepting actual receipt or delivery of the pools of MBS stipulated in the TBA agreement.</font></div>
<div>Certain of the Funds may invest cash pending settlement of TBA
transactions in money market instruments, repurchase agreements, or other high quality, liquid short-term instruments, including money market funds advised by BFA. Each such Fund will pay its <font>pro rata</font> share of
fees and expenses of any money market fund that it may invest in, in addition to such Fund’s own fees and expenses.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Collateralized Mortgage Obligations<font>. U.S. agency MBS may also be structured in the form of collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”). CMOs are created by dividing the principal and interest payments collected on a pool of mortgages into
several revenue streams (“tranches”) with different priority rights to portions of the underlying mortgage payments. Certain CMO tranches may represent a right to receive interest only (“IOs”), principal only
(“POs”), or an amount that remains after floating-rate tranches are paid (an “inverse floater”). These securities are frequently referred to as “mortgage derivatives” and may be extremely sensitive to changes in
interest rates. Interest rates on inverse floaters, for example, vary inversely with a short-term floating rate (which may be reset periodically). Interest rates on inverse floaters will decrease when short-term rates increase and will increase when
short-term rates decrease. These securities have the effect of providing a degree of investment leverage. In response to changes in market interest rates or other market conditions, the value of an inverse floater may increase or decrease at a
multiple of the increase or decrease in the value of the underlying securities. If a Fund invests in CMO tranches issued by U.S. government agencies or sponsored entities and interest rates move in a manner not anticipated by Fund management, it is
possible that such a Fund could lose all or substantially all of its investment. Certain CMOs in which certain of the Funds may invest may also provide a degree of investment leverage, which could cause such a Fund to lose all or substantially all
of its investment.</font></div> <div>U.S. Government Obligations. <font> Certain of the Funds may invest in various types of U.S. government obligations. U.S. government obligations are a type of bond and include securities issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S.
government, its agencies or instrumentalities. Payment of principal and interest on U.S. government obligations (i) may be backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. or (ii) may be backed solely by the issuing or guaranteeing agency or
instrumentality itself (as with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Federal Home Loan Bank notes). In the latter case, each Fund must look principally to the agency or instrumentality issuing or guaranteeing the obligation for ultimate repayment, which
agency or instrumentality may be privately owned. There can be no assurance that the U.S. government would provide financial support to its agencies or instrumentalities where it is not obligated to do so. As a general matter, the value of debt
instruments, including U.S. government obligations, declines when market interest rates increase and rises when market interest rates decrease. Certain types of U.S. government obligations are subject to fluctuations in yield or value due to their
structure or contract terms.</font></div> <div>U.S.-Registered and
Restricted Securities of Non-U.S. Issuers.<font>  The Funds (other than the iShares Agency Bond ETF, iShares MBS ETF, Municipal Bond Funds and Treasury Bond Funds) may invest in U.S.-registered, U.S.
dollar-denominated bonds of non-U.S. governments, agencies, supranational entities and corporate issuers. The iShares Broad USD Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares Core 5-10 Year USD Bond ETF, iShares Core 10+ Year USD Bond ETF, iShares
Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF, iShares ESG 1-5 Year Corporate Bond ETF, iShares ESG U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF, iShares ESG USD Corporate Bond ETF, iShares Government/Credit Bond ETF, iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF, iShares iBoxx $
Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares Intermediate Government/Credit Bond ETF, iShares Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond ETF, iShares Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF and iShares Short-Term Corporate Bond ETF may invest in Restricted Securities
issued by non-U.S. issuers. Investing in U.S.-registered, U.S. dollar-denominated bonds or Restricted Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers involves some risks and considerations not typically associated with investing in U.S. issuers. These include
differences in accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards; the possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation; adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations; political instability, which could affect U.S.
investments in foreign countries; and potential restrictions of the flow of international capital. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject to less governmental regulation than U.S. issuers. In addition, the risk that the issuer may fail to meet its
obligations on these securities may be affected by fluctuations in non-U.S. currency exchange rates between the issuer's local currency and the U.S. dollar. Moreover, individual non-U.S. economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S.
economy in such respects as growth of gross domestic product (“GDP”), rate of inflation, capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency and balance of payment positions.</font></div>
<div>Future Developments.<font>  The
Board may, in the future, authorize each Fund to invest in securities contracts and investments other than those listed in this SAI and in the applicable Prospectus, provided they are consistent with each Fund's investment objective and do not

<div>General Considerations and Risks</div>
<div>A discussion of some of the principal risks associated with an

<div>general, and other factors that affect the market. The order of the below
risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Agency Debt Risk.<font>
 Certain of the Funds may invest in unsecured bonds or debentures issued by U.S. government agencies, including Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Bonds or debentures issued by U.S. government agencies, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are
generally backed only by the general creditworthiness and reputation of the government agency issuing the bond or debenture and are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Ginnie Mae securities are generally backed by the
full faith and credit of the U.S. government.</font></div>
<div>Some government agencies, including Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac, purchase and guarantee residential mortgages and form MBS that they issue to the market. These agencies also hold their own MBS as well as those of other institutions with funding from the agency debentures they issue. Recent events in the
markets for MBS have adversely affected the value of those MBS held and/or issued by these agencies.</div>
<div>Borrowing Risk.
<font> Borrowing may exaggerate changes in the net asset value of Fund shares and in the return on a Fund’s portfolio. Borrowing will cause a Fund to incur interest expense and other fees. The costs of
borrowing may reduce a Fund’s return. Borrowing may cause a Fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations.</font></div>
<div>Call Risk. <font> During
periods of falling interest rates, an issuer of a callable bond held by certain Funds may “call” or repay the security before its stated maturity, and a Fund may have to reinvest the proceeds in securities with lower yields, which would
result in a decline in the Fund's income, or in securities with greater risks or with other less favorable features.</font></div>
<div>Custody Risk. <font> Custody
risk refers to the risks inherent in the process of clearing and settling trades and to the holding of securities, cash and other assets by local banks, agents and depositories. Low trading volumes and volatile prices in less developed markets make
trades harder to complete and settle, and governments or trade groups may compel local agents to hold securities in designated depositories that may not be subject to independent evaluation. Local agents are held only to the standards of care of
their local markets, and thus may be subject to limited or no government oversight. Communications between the U.S. and emerging market countries may be unreliable, increasing the risk of delayed settlements or losses of security certificates. In
general, the less developed a country’s securities market is, the greater the likelihood of custody problems. Practices in relation to the settlement of securities transactions in emerging markets involve higher risks than those in developed
markets, in part because of the use of brokers and counterparties that are often less well capitalized, and custody and registration of assets in some countries may be unreliable. The possibility of fraud, negligence or undue influence being exerted
by the issuer or refusal to recognize ownership exists in some emerging markets, and, along with other factors, could result in ownership registration being lost. In addition, the laws of certain countries may put limits on a Fund’s ability to
recover its assets if a foreign bank or depository or issuer of a security or an agent of any of the foregoing goes bankrupt. A Fund would absorb any loss resulting from such custody problems and may have no successful claim for
compensation.</font></div> <div>Extension Risk. <font> During periods of rising interest rates, certain debt obligations may be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated and the value of those securities may fall sharply, resulting in a decline in
a Fund’s income and potentially in the value of a Fund’s investments.</font></div>
<div>Illiquid Investments Risk.<font>
 Each Fund may invest up to an aggregate amount of 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that a Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven
calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the investment. The liquidity of an investment will be determined based on relevant market, trading and investment specific considerations as set out in the Liquidity Program
as required by the Liquidity Rule. Illiquid investments may trade at a discount to comparable, more liquid investments and a Fund may not be able to dispose of illiquid investments in a timely fashion or at their expected prices. If illiquid
investments exceed 15% of a Fund’s net assets, the Liquidity Rule and the Liquidity Program will require that certain remedial actions be taken.</font></div>
<div>Issuer Insolvency Risk.<font>
 Each Fund's potential exposure to financially or operationally troubled issuers involves a high degree of credit and market risk, which may be heightened during an economic downturn or recession. Should an issuer of securities held by a Fund
become involved in a bankruptcy proceeding, reorganization or financial restructuring, a wide variety of considerations make an evaluation of the outcome of a Fund’s exposure to the issuer uncertain.</font></div> </div>

<div>During the period of a bankruptcy proceeding, reorganization
or financial restructuring, it is unlikely that each Fund will receive any interest payments on the securities of the issuer. Each Fund will be subject to significant uncertainty as to whether the reorganization or restructuring will be completed,
and each Fund may bear certain extraordinary expenses to protect and recover its investment. Each Fund will also be subject to significant uncertainty as to when and in what manner and for what value the obligations evidenced by the securities of
the issuer held by each Fund will eventually be satisfied. Even if a plan of reorganization or restructuring is adopted with respect to the securities of the issuer held by each Fund, there can be no assurance that the securities or other assets
received by each Fund in connection with such plan of reorganization or restructuring will not have a lower value or income potential than may have been anticipated or no value. A Fund may be unable to enforce its claims or rights in any collateral
or may have its claims or security interest in any collateral challenged, disallowed or subordinated to the claims or security interests of other creditors. In addition, amendments to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or other relevant laws could alter the
expected outcome or introduce greater uncertainty regarding the outcome of each Fund’s securities holdings in the issuer. In a bankruptcy proceeding, a reorganization or restructuring, the securities of the issuer held by each Fund could be
re-characterized or each Fund may receive different securities or other assets, including equity securities. These types of equity securities include, but are not limited to: common stock; preferred stock (including convertible preferred stock);
bonds, notes and debentures convertible into common or preferred stock; stock purchase warrants and rights; equity interests in trusts; and depositary receipts. Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their value may be more volatile
than those of other asset classes. Holders of equity securities are subject to more risk than holders of debt securities because the status of equity holders is subordinate to debtholders in an issuer's capital structure. The value of equity
securities received by each Fund could decline if the financial condition of the issuer deteriorates or if overall market and economic conditions, or conditions within the issuer’s region or industry, deteriorate. Equity securities received by
a Fund through a bankruptcy proceeding, reorganization or restructuring of an issuer would not be component securities of a Fund’s Underlying Index, which could subject a Fund to additional tracking error risk.</div>
<div>To the extent that each Fund receives other assets in
connection with a bankruptcy proceeding, reorganization or financial restructuring, each Fund may also be subject to additional risks associated with the assets received. One example of assets that each Fund could receive is an interest in one or
more loans made to the issuer as part of a workout agreed to by a consortium of lienholders and creditors of the issuer. Each Fund may receive such interests in loans to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act.</div>
<div>Securities or other assets received in a reorganization or
restructuring typically entail a higher degree of risk than investments in securities of issuers that have not undergone a reorganization or restructuring and may be subject to heavy selling or downward pricing pressure after completion of the
reorganization or restructuring. The post-reorganization/restructuring assets and securities may also be illiquid and difficult to sell or value. If each Fund participates in negotiations with respect to a plan of reorganization or restructuring
with respect to securities of the issuer held by each Fund, each Fund also may be restricted from disposing such securities for a period of time. If each Fund becomes involved in such proceedings, each Fund may have more active participation in the
affairs of the issuer than that assumed generally by an investor.</div>
<div>Municipal Market Disruption Risk. <font> The value of municipal securities may be affected by uncertainties in the municipal market related to legislation or litigation involving the taxation of municipal securities or the rights of municipal securities
holders in the event of a bankruptcy. Proposals to restrict or eliminate the U.S. federal income tax exemption for interest on municipal securities are introduced before the U.S. Congress from time to time. Proposals also may be introduced before
state legislatures that would affect the state tax treatment of a municipal fund’s distributions. If such proposals were enacted, the availability of municipal securities and the value of a Municipal Bond Fund’s holdings would be
affected, and the Trustees would reevaluate the Fund’s investment objective and policies. Municipal bankruptcies are relatively rare, and certain provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code governing such bankruptcies are unclear and remain
untested. Further, the application of state law to municipal issuers could produce varying results among the states or among municipal securities issuers within a state. These legal uncertainties could affect the municipal securities market
generally, certain specific segments of the market, or the relative credit quality of particular securities. Any of these effects could have a significant impact on the prices of some or all of the municipal securities held by a Municipal Bond
Fund.</font></div> <div>Operational Risk.<font>  BFA and a Fund's other service providers may experience disruptions or operating errors such as processing errors or human errors, inadequate or failed internal or external processes, or systems or technology
failures, that could negatively impact the Funds. While service providers are required to have appropriate operational risk management policies and procedures, their methods of operational risk management may differ from a Fund’s in the
setting of priorities, the personnel and resources available or the effectiveness of relevant controls. BFA, through its monitoring and oversight of service providers, seeks to ensure that service providers take appropriate precautions to avoid and
mitigate risks that could</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>lead to disruptions and operating errors. However, it is not possible for BFA
or the other Fund service providers to identify all of the operational risks that may affect a Fund or to develop processes and controls to completely eliminate or mitigate their occurrence or effects.</div>
<div>Prepayment Risk. <font> During
periods of falling interest rates, issuers of certain debt obligations may repay principal prior to the security’s maturity, which may cause a Fund to have to reinvest in securities with lower yields or higher risk of default, resulting in a
decline in the Fund’s income or return potential. Also, if a security subject to prepayment had been purchased at a premium, the value of the premium would be lost in the event of prepayment.</font></div>
<div>Repurchase Agreement Risk.
<font> A repurchase agreement is an instrument under which the purchaser (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, a Fund) acquires a security and the
seller agrees, at the time of the sale, to repurchase the security at a mutually agreed upon time and price. Repurchase agreements may be construed to be collateralized loans by the purchaser to the seller secured by the securities transferred to
the purchaser. If a repurchase agreement is construed to be a collateralized loan, the underlying securities will not be considered to be owned by a Fund but only to constitute collateral for the seller’s obligation to pay the repurchase
price. If the seller defaults on its obligation under the agreement, a Fund may suffer delays and incur costs or lose money in exercising its rights under the agreement. If the seller fails to repurchase the security and the market value of the
security declines, a Fund may lose money.</font></div> <div>Risk of
Derivatives. <font> A derivative is a financial contract, the value of which depends on, or is derived from, the value of an underlying asset, such as a security, a commodity (such as gold or silver), a currency or
an index (a measure of value or rates, such as the S&amp;P 500 or the prime lending rate). Each Fund may invest in variable rate demand notes and obligations, and tender option bonds, which may be considered derivatives. Compared to conventional
securities, derivatives can be more sensitive to changes in interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in market prices and thus a Fund's losses may be greater if it invests in derivatives than if it invests only in conventional securities.
Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligations. Derivatives generally involve the incurrence of leverage. To address such leverage and to
prevent a Fund from being deemed to have issued senior securities as a result of an investment in derivatives, such Fund will segregate liquid assets equal to its obligations under the derivatives throughout the life of the investment.</font></div>
<div>When a derivative is used as a hedge against a position that a
Fund holds or is committed to purchase, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate
gains, and in some cases, hedging can cause losses that are not offset by gains, and the Fund will recognize losses on both the investment and the hedge. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and the underlying
security, and there can be no assurance that a Fund’s hedging transactions, which entail additional transaction costs, will be effective.</div>
<div>Risk of Futures and Options on Futures Transactions.<font>  There are several risks accompanying the utilization of futures contracts and options on futures contracts. A position in futures contracts and options on futures contracts may be closed only on the exchange on
which the contract was made (or a linked exchange). While each Fund plans to utilize futures contracts only if an active market exists for such contracts, there is no guarantee that a liquid market will exist for the contract at a specified time.
Furthermore, because, by definition, futures contracts project price levels in the future and not current levels of valuation, market circumstances may result in a discrepancy between the price of the bond index future and the movement in the
relevant Underlying Index. In the event of adverse price movements, a Fund would continue to be required to make daily cash payments to maintain its required margin. In such situations, if a Fund has insufficient cash, it may have to sell portfolio
securities to meet daily margin requirements at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. In addition, a Fund may be required to deliver the instruments underlying the futures contracts it has sold.</font></div>
<div>The risk of loss in trading futures contracts or uncovered
call options in some strategies (<font>e.g.</font>, selling uncovered bond index futures contracts) is potentially unlimited. Each Fund does not plan to use futures and options contracts in this way. The risk of a futures
position may still be large as traditionally measured due to the low margin deposits required. In many cases, a relatively small price movement in a futures contract may result in immediate and substantial loss or gain to the investor relative to
the size of a required margin deposit. Each Fund, however, intends to utilize futures and options contracts in a manner designed to limit its risk exposure to levels comparable to a direct investment in the types of bonds in which it invests.</div>
<div>Utilization of futures and options on futures by a Fund
involves the risk of imperfect or even negative correlation to its Underlying Index if the index underlying the futures contract differs from the Underlying Index. There is also the risk of loss</div> </div>

<div>by a Fund of margin deposits in the event of bankruptcy of a broker with whom
a Fund has an open position in the futures contract or option. The purchase of put or call options will be based upon predictions by BFA as to anticipated trends, which predictions could prove to be incorrect.</div>
<div>Because the futures market generally imposes less burdensome
margin requirements than the securities market, an increased amount of participation by speculators in the futures market could result in price fluctuations. Certain financial futures exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures
contract prices during a single trading day. The daily limit establishes the maximum amount by which the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day's settlement price at the end of a trading session. Once the daily
limit has been reached in a particular type of contract, no trades may be made on that day at a price beyond that limit. It is possible that futures contract prices could move to the daily limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no
trading, thereby preventing prompt liquidation of futures positions and subjecting each Fund to substantial losses. In the event of adverse price movements, each Fund would be required to make daily cash payments of variation margin.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Non-U.S. Agency Debt Securities. <font> Certain of the Funds invest in uncollateralized bonds issued by agencies, subdivisions or instrumentalities of foreign governments. Bonds issued by these foreign government agencies, subdivisions or
instrumentalities are generally backed only by the creditworthiness and reputation of the entities issuing the bonds and may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the foreign government. Moreover, a foreign government that explicitly
provides its full faith and credit to a particular entity may be, due to changed circumstances, unable or unwilling to actually provide that support. If a non-U.S. agency is unable to meet its obligations, the performance of a Fund will be adversely
impacted. A non-U.S. agency’s operations and financial condition are influenced by the foreign government’s economic and other policies. Changes to the financial condition or credit rating of a foreign government may cause the value of
debt issued by that particular foreign government’s agencies, subdivisions or instrumentalities to decline. During periods of economic uncertainty, the trading of non-U.S. agency bonds may be less liquid while market prices may be more
volatile than prices of U.S. agency bonds. Additional risks associated with non-U.S. agency investing include differences in accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards, adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations,
political instability, which could affect U.S. investments in foreign countries and cause restrictions on the flow of international capital.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Non-U.S. Debt Securities. <font> Certain of the Funds may invest in non-U.S. debt securities as determined by the respective index provider. An investment in a Fund involves risks associated with investing in a portfolio of debt securities
traded on foreign exchanges and OTC in the respective countries covered by a Fund. These risks typically include market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic and political developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in
bond prices. Investing in a fund whose portfolio contains securities of non-U.S. issuers involves certain risks and considerations not typically associated with investing in the securities of U.S. issuers. These risks include securities markets that
may lack sufficient liquidity or may be less efficient; generally greater price volatility; less publicly available information about issuers; the imposition of withholding or other taxes; the imposition of restrictions on the expatriation of funds
or other assets of a Fund; higher transaction and custody costs; delays and risks attendant in settlement procedures; difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations; lower liquidity and significantly smaller market capitalization of most non-U.S.
securities markets; different accounting and disclosure standards; lower levels of regulation of the securities markets; more substantial government interference with the economy; higher rates of inflation; greater social, economic, and political
uncertainty; the risk of nationalization or expropriation of assets; and different bankruptcy and insolvency regimes which may stay or prevent recovery in the event of an issuer’s default. </font></div>
<div>Russia Sanctions. <font>The U.S.
and the Economic and Monetary Union (the “EMU”) of the European Union (the “EU”), along with the regulatory bodies of a number of countries including Japan, Australia, Norway, Switzerland and Canada (collectively,
“Sanctioning Bodies”), have imposed economic sanctions, which consist of prohibiting certain securities trades, prohibiting certain private transactions in the energy sector, asset freezes and prohibition of all business, against certain
Russian individuals and Russian corporate entities. The Sanctioning Bodies could also institute broader sanctions on Russia. These sanctions, or even the threat of further sanctions, may result in the decline of the value and liquidity of Russian
securities, a weakening of the ruble or other adverse consequences to the Russian economy. These sanctions could also result in the immediate freeze of Russian securities and/or funds invested in prohibited assets, impairing the ability of a Fund to
buy, sell, receive or deliver those securities and/or assets. Additional sanctions against Russia have been, and may in the future be, imposed by the U.S. or other countries.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

 Table of Contents </a> </div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>The sanctions against certain Russian issuers include
prohibitions on transacting in or dealing in issuances of debt or equity of such issuers. Compliance with each of these sanctions may impair the ability of a Fund to buy, sell, hold, receive or deliver the affected securities or other securities of
such issuers. If it becomes impracticable or unlawful for a Fund to hold securities subject to, or otherwise affected by, sanctions (collectively, “affected securities”), or if deemed appropriate by BFA, a Fund may prohibit in-kind
deposits of the affected securities in connection with creation transactions and instead require a cash deposit, which may also increase a Fund's transaction costs. A Fund may also be legally required to freeze assets in a blocked account.</div>
<div>Also, if an affected security is included in a Fund's
Underlying Index, a Fund may, where practicable, seek to eliminate its holdings of the affected security by employing or augmenting its representative sampling strategy to seek to track the investment results of its Underlying Index. The use of (or
increased use of) a representative sampling strategy may increase a Fund’s tracking error risk. If the affected securities constitute a significant percentage of the Underlying Index, a Fund may not be able to effectively implement a
representative sampling strategy, which may result in significant tracking error between a Fund’s performance and the performance of its Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Current or future sanctions may result in Russia taking
counter measures or retaliatory actions, which may further impair the value and liquidity of Russian securities. These retaliatory measures may include the immediate freeze of Russian assets held by a Fund. In the event of such a freeze of any Fund
assets, including depositary receipts, a Fund may need to liquidate non-restricted assets in order to satisfy any Fund redemption orders. The liquidation of Fund assets during this time may also result in a Fund receiving substantially lower prices
for its securities.</div> <div>These sanctions may also lead to
changes in a Fund’s Underlying Index. A Fund’s index provider may remove securities from its Underlying Index or implement caps on the securities of certain issuers that have been subject to recent economic sanctions. In such an event,
it is expected that a Fund will rebalance its portfolio to bring it in line with its Underlying Index as a result of any such changes, which may result in transaction costs and increased tracking error. These sanctions, the volatility that may
result in the trading markets for Russian securities and the possibility that Russia may impose investment or currency controls on investors may cause a Fund to invest in, or increase a Fund’s investments in, depositary receipts that represent
the securities of its Underlying Index. These investments may result in increased transaction costs and increased tracking error.</div>
<div>Risk of Swap Agreements.<font>
 The risk of loss with respect to swaps is generally limited to the net amount of payments that a Fund is contractually obligated to make. Swap agreements are subject to the risk that the swap counterparty will default on its obligations. If
such a default occurs, a Fund will have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the transaction. However, such remedies may be subject to bankruptcy and insolvency laws, which could affect such Fund’s rights as a creditor
(</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, a Fund may not receive the net amount of payments that it is contractually entitled to receive).</font></div>
<div>A Fund is required to post and collect variation margin
(comprised of specified liquid securities subject to haircuts) in connection with trading of OTC swaps. Implementation of regulations requiring posting of initial margin is being phased in through 2020. These requirements may raise the costs for a
Fund’s investment in swaps.</div> <div>Securities Lending Risk.
<font> A Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that a Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at
all. A Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences
for a Fund.</font></div> <div>Special Considerations Regarding
Investments in California Municipal Securities</div> <div>Following
is a brief summary of some of the factors that may affect the financial condition of the State of California (referred to herein as the “State” or “California”) and its political subdivisions. The summary is neither a
complete nor a comprehensive description of these factors or an analysis of financial conditions and may not be indicative of the financial condition of issuers of obligations or any particular projects financed with the proceeds of such
obligations. Many factors not included in the summary, such as the national economy, changes in federal tax law as well as federal policies related to trade, health care and immigration, social and environmental policies and conditions, developments
in municipal bankruptcies and the national and international markets for products produced in California, could have an adverse impact on the financial condition of California and its political subdivisions. It is not possible to predict whether and
to what extent those factors may affect the financial condition of California and its political subdivisions.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>The following summary is updated once per calendar year –
generally during the second calendar quarter – based upon the most recent publicly available budget documents and offering statements relating to public debt offerings of the State and is not otherwise updated during the year. Neither the Fund
nor its legal counsel has independently verified all of the information contained in such statements and documents. The information provided below is intended only as a general summary and is subject to change rapidly, substantially, and without
notice, and the inclusion of such information herein shall not create any implication that there has been no change in the affairs of the State or issuers therein since the date of its preparation.</div>
<div>Overview</div>
<div>The State continues to experience near historically low
unemployment numbers. As of April 2019, the State’s unemployment rate was preliminarily estimated to be 4.3 percent, approximately 0.7 percent higher than the national average of 3.6 percent but representing one of the lowest monthly
unemployment rates for the State since the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics began reporting such numbers in 1976.</div>
<div>California’s budget position continues to be strong.
Although the State has faced serious budgetary problems in the past resulting from structural imbalances, the State significantly improved its general fiscal condition with the approval by the voters in November 2012 of a personal income tax
increase and a sales tax increase (collectively known as “Proposition 30”). In November 2016, voters approved an extension of the Proposition 30 personal income tax increase until December 31, 2030, but the sales tax increase expired on
December 31, 2016. See “The State Budget — Proposition 30 and Proposition 55” below. Despite significant budgetary improvements during the last several years, there remain a number of budget risks that threaten the financial
condition of the State’s Treasury General Fund (the “General Fund”). These risks include the threat of recession, potentially unfavorable changes to federal policies, the uncertain impact of changes in federal tax law and trade
policy, and significant unfunded liabilities of the State’s two main retirement systems. See “State and Local Pension and Post-Retirement Liabilities” below.</div>
<div>The State’s fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on
June 30 of the following year. The annual budget is proposed by the Governor by January 10 of each year for the next fiscal year (the “Governor’s Budget”). State law also requires the Governor to update the Governor’s Budget
projections and budgetary proposals by May 14 of each year (the “May Revision”). The Governor is required to sign the budget by the start of the fiscal year on July 1.</div>
<div>The State’s General Fund budget has achieved structural
balance for the last several fiscal years, while also building up historic levels of reserves. The May Revision to the 2019-20 Governor’s Budget projects a Special Fund for Economic Uncertainties (“SFEU”) balance of approximately
$4.8 billion as of June 30, 2019 and an SFEU balance of approximately $1.6 billion as of June 30, 2020 if proposed budget solutions are adopted. See “Status of State General Fund; 2019-20 Governor’s Budget and May Revision” below.
The May Revision to the 2019-20 Governor’s Budget projects a Budget Stabilization Account (the “BSA”) – a fund established to build a stronger “rainy day” reserve – balance of $16.5 billion by June 30, 2020
and $18.7 billion by June 30, 2023. The BSA funding levels reflect the Governor’s interpretation of a constitutional amendment approved in November 2014 that was intended to strengthen the BSA (“Proposition 2”), such that prior
optional deposits into the BSA did not count toward the 10 percent of General Fund revenues level required by Proposition 2, and higher balances in such fund are permissible. See “The State Budget” and “Status of State General
Fund; 2019-20 Governor’s Budget and May Revision” below.</div>
<div>Many local governments in the State continue to face budget
constraints due to limited taxing powers, among other factors. Unfunded pension and other post-retirement liabilities also weigh heavily upon the State as well as many local governments, and have been the principal cause of several well-publicized
municipal bankruptcy filings.</div> <div>Economic Factors</div>
<div>California is by far the most populous state in the nation;
indeed, California is almost 40 percent larger than Texas, the second-ranked state, according to the most recent population estimates released by the United States Census Bureau. The January 2019 estimate of the State’s population is 39.9
million, which represents just over 12 percent of the total United States population.</div>
<div>California’s economy, the largest among the 50 states
and one of the largest and most diverse in the world, has major components in high technology, trade, entertainment, agriculture, manufacturing, government, tourism, construction and services. The relative proportion of the various components of the
California economy closely resembles the make-up of the</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>national economy. California’s real gross domestic product increased by
3.0 percent in 2017, and totaled $2.7 trillion at current prices, making California the fifth largest economy in the world. Prior to 2017, the last time the State was the world’s fifth largest economy was in 2002.</div>
<div>State total personal income has made substantial gains since
the end of the financial crisis in 2009, during which the State experienced the first decline in total personal income on a year-over-year basis since 1938. From 2009 through 2017, State total personal income grew by an average annual rate of
approximately 5.0%. As of April 2019, the State projected personal income to grow by more than 5 percent in 2018 and 2019, followed by more modest growth of 4.3 percent on average through 2022.</div>
<div>The expiration of the Proposition 30 sales tax increase and
increased percentages diverted to local governments due to realignment have reduced the amount of sales tax available to the State’s General Fund. See “The State Budget — Proposition 30 and Proposition 55,” and “Local
Governments—Realigning Services to Local Governments” below. Nevertheless, sales and use taxes remain a principal source of General Fund revenues. See “Recent Financial Results” below for a discussion of the percentage of
State General Fund revenues that are derived from sales and use taxes. Total taxable transactions for the State were estimated at $649 billion for 2016 by the California State Board of Equalization, an increase of 2.4 percent over the prior year. As
of January 2019, the State Department of Finance projected taxable sales to grow by 5.7 percent in 2018, 5.7 percent in 2019 and 2.9 percent in 2020. Annual taxable sale transactions for the State for 2017 and 2018 are not yet finalized by the
California State Board of Equalization but, in January 2019, the Department of Finance estimated $717 billion in taxable sales for 2018, $758 billion in 2019 and $779 billion in 2020.</div>
<div>The statewide median home price for existing single-family
homes fell to a low of approximately $300,000 in calendar year 2011. In February 2019, the statewide median home price was $534,140, which was an increase of 2.2 percent from a year earlier and well above the statewide median home price for calendar
year 2016 of $501,560. This statewide median home price still remains lower than the pre-recession peak median price of $594,530. Nevertheless, the Department of Finance reported in December 2017 that the gap between U.S. and California home prices
has widened from 7 percent in 1970 to more than 120 percent in October 2017.</div>
<div>Residential building permitting, which suffered a long, steady
decline from calendar years 2006 through 2009, has increased steadily, from 44,762 in 2010 (approximately $13.7 billion valuation) to approximately 114,370 (based on preliminary numbers) in 2018 (approximately $36.0 billion valuation), reflecting an
annual growth rate of approximately 12.4 percent in valuation, but still down from a pre-recession figure of 164,187 (approximately $38.2 billion valuation) in 2006.</div>
<div>After slowing sharply in 2009, nonresidential construction
increased steadily over the past several years, from a total valuation of approximately $11.2 billion in 2010 to $32.0 billion in 2018, based on preliminary numbers, reflecting an average annual growth rate of approximately 14 percent in valuation
and surpassing the pre-recession high of $22.5 billion in 2007.</div>
<div>Constitutional Limitations on Taxes, Other Charges,
Appropriations and General Fund Revenues</div> <div>Over the years,
a number of constitutional amendments have been enacted, often through voter initiatives, which have increased the difficulty of raising State taxes or restricted the use of General Fund revenues. Some of the most significant of these approved
constitutional amendments are described below. Because of the complex nature of these initiatives and the ambiguities and possible inconsistencies in their terms, it is not possible to predict with certainty the impact on California debt obligations
or on the ability of the State or local governments to pay debt service on such California debt obligations. Further initiatives or legislative changes in laws or the California Constitution may also affect the ability of the State or local
governments to repay their obligations.</div> <div>Limitation on
Property Taxes.<font> Certain California debt obligations may be obligations of local government issuers that rely in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, on
</font><font>ad valorem</font><font> property taxes as a source of revenue. The taxing powers of California local governments are limited by Article XIIIA of the California
Constitution (“Article XIIIA”), enacted by the voters in 1978 and commonly known as “Proposition 13.” Briefly, Article XIIIA limits the rate of </font><font>ad valorem</font><font> property taxes to 1 percent of the full cash value of real property and generally restricts the reassessment of property to 2 percent per year, except upon new construction or change of ownership
(subject to a number of exemptions).</font></div> <div>Local
government taxing entities, however, may raise <font>ad valorem</font> taxes above the 1 percent limit to pay debt service on voter-approved bonded indebtedness.</div> </div>

 Table of Contents </a> </div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Under Article XIIIA, the basic 1 percent <font>ad valorem</font> tax levy is applied against the assessed value of property as of the owner’s date of acquisition (or as of March 1, 1975, if acquired earlier), subject to certain adjustments. This system has
resulted in widely varying amounts of tax on similarly situated properties. Several lawsuits were filed challenging the acquisition-based assessment system of Proposition 13, but it was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1992.</div>
<div>For further discussion on Proposition 13, see “Local
Governments — Constitutional and Statutory Limitations on Local Government” below. For further discussion on voter approval requirements under Article XIIIA, see “— Voter Requirements for Taxes and Fees” below.</div>
<div>Limitations on Other Taxes, Fees and Charges.<font> On November 5, 1996, the voters of the State approved Proposition 218, called the “Right to Vote on Taxes Act.” Proposition 218 added Article XIIIC (“Article XIIIC”) and Article
XIIID (“Article XIIID”) to the State Constitution, each of which contains a number of provisions affecting the ability of local governments to levy and collect both existing and future taxes, assessments, fees and charges.</font></div>
<div>Article XIIIC requires that all new or increased local taxes
be submitted to the voters before they become effective. Proposition 26, discussed below under the caption entitled “— Voter Requirements for Taxes and Fees,” amended Article XIIIC by adding an expansive definition of
“taxes” to include many regulatory fees currently imposed by the State and its municipalities. Taxes for general governmental purposes require a majority vote and taxes for specific purposes require a two-thirds vote.</div>
<div>Article XIIID contains several provisions making it generally
more difficult for local governments to levy and maintain “assessments” for municipal services and programs. Article XIIID also contains several provisions affecting “fees” and “charges,” defined for purposes of
Article XIIID to mean “any levy other than an <font>ad valorem</font> tax, a special tax, or an assessment, imposed by a local government upon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property ownership, including
a user fee or charge for a property related service.” All new and existing property related fees and charges must conform to requirements prohibiting, among other things, fees and charges that generate revenues exceeding the funds required to
provide the property related service or are used for unrelated purposes. Article XIIID imposes notice, hearing and protest procedures for levying or increasing property related fees and charges, and, except for fees or charges for sewer, water and
refuse collection services (or fees for electrical and gas service, which are not treated as “property related” for purposes of Article XIIID), no property related fee or charge may be imposed or increased without majority approval by
the property owners subject to the fee or charge or, at the option of the local government, two-thirds voter approval by the electorate residing in the affected area.</div>
<div>In addition to the provisions described above, Article XIIIC
removes limitations on the initiative power in matters of local taxes, assessments, fees and charges. Consequently, local voters, by future initiative, could repeal, reduce or prohibit the future imposition or increase of any local tax, assessment,
fee or charge. It is unclear how this right of local initiative may be used in cases where taxes or charges have been or will be specifically pledged to secure debt issues.</div>
<div>Limitations on the State’s Ability to Transfer Funds from
Local Governments.<font> On November 2, 2010, voters in the State approved Proposition 22, a Constitutional initiative. Proposition 22, known as the “Local Taxpayer, Public Safety, and
Transportation Protection Act of 2010,” eliminated or reduced the State’s authority to (i) temporarily shift property taxes from cities, counties and special districts to schools, (ii) use vehicle license fee revenues to reimburse local
governments for State-mandated costs (the State will have to use other revenues to reimburse local governments), (iii) redirect property tax increment from redevelopment agencies (which have since been dissolved, see “Obligations of Other
Issuers—Tax Increment and the Dissolution of Redevelopment Agencies” below) to any other local government, (iv) use State fuel tax revenues to pay debt service on State transportation bonds, or (v) borrow or change the distribution of
State fuel tax revenues.</font></div> <div>Voter Requirements for
Taxes and Fees.<font> Proposition 26, known as the “Supermajority Vote to Pass New Taxes and Fees Act” was approved by State voters on November 2, 2010. Proposition 26 amended provisions of
Article XIIIA and Article XIIIC governing the imposition of taxes. Proposition 26 requires a two-thirds supermajority vote in the California State Legislature (the “State Legislature”) prior to the imposition of any change in State
statute which results in any taxpayer paying a higher tax. This requirement eliminated the prior practice that allowed, via majority vote, one tax to be increased if another tax is lowered by an equivalent amount. Furthermore, any increase in a fee
beyond the amount needed to provide the specific service or benefit is deemed a “tax,” and thus would require two-thirds vote of any governmental units for passage. As noted, Proposition 26 requires taxes for general governmental
purposes to be approved by a majority vote and taxes for specific purposes to be approved by a two-thirds vote. Proposition 26 applied retroactively to any measures passed on or after January 1, 2010.</font></div> </div>

<div>Appropriations Limits.<font> The State and its local governments are subject to an annual “appropriations limit” imposed by Article XIIIB of the California Constitution (“Article XIIIB”), enacted by the
voters in 1979 and significantly amended by Propositions 98 and 111 in 1988 and 1990, respectively. Article XIIIB prohibits the State or any covered local government from spending “appropriations subject to limitation” in excess of the
appropriations limit imposed. “Appropriations subject to limitation” are authorizations to spend “proceeds of taxes,” which consist of tax revenues and certain other funds, including proceeds from regulatory licenses, user
charges or other fees, to the extent that such proceeds exceed the cost of providing the product or service, but “proceeds of taxes” exclude most State subventions to local governments. No limit is imposed on appropriations of funds
which are not “proceeds of taxes,” such as reasonable user charges or fees, and certain other non-tax funds, including bond proceeds.</font></div>
<div>Among the expenditures not included in the Article XIIIB
appropriations limit are (i) the debt service cost of bonds issued or authorized prior to January 1, 1979, or subsequently authorized by the voters, (ii) appropriations to comply with mandates of courts or the federal government, (iii)
appropriations for certain capital outlay projects, (iv) appropriations by the State of post-1989 increases in gasoline taxes and vehicle weight fees, and (v) appropriations made in certain cases of emergency.</div>
<div>The appropriations limit for each year is adjusted annually to
reflect changes in cost of living and population, and any transfers of service responsibilities between government units.</div>
<div>“Excess” revenues are measured over a two year
cycle. Local governments must return any excess to taxpayers by rate reductions. The State must refund 50 percent of any excess, with the other 50 percent paid to schools and community colleges.</div>
<div>With more liberal annual adjustment factors since 1988, and
depressed revenues in the early 1990s because of a recession, few governments have been operating near their spending limits, but this condition may change over time. Local governments may by majority voter approval exceed their spending limits for
up to four years. The 2019-20 Governor’s Budget projected the State would be approximately $4.3 billion, $4.9 billion and $7.5 billion under its limit in fiscal years 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20, respectively.</div>
<div>Dedication of General Fund Revenues to Schools.<font> The single largest portion of the State budget is support for K-12 public schools and community college districts (collectively, “K-14 schools”). Proposition 98, an initiative measure
adopted originally in 1988, mandates that a set percentage of General Fund revenues be spent for K-14 schools, with the balance of school funding provided by a share of local property taxes. Proposition 98 is extremely complex, and results in
significant fiscal problems when, General Fund revenues fall short of the projections on which the original appropriations to schools were made. For further discussion regarding Proposition 98, see “Proposition 98 and K-14 Funding”
below.</font></div> <div>Obligations of the State</div>
<div>The State has always paid when due the principal of and
interest on its general obligation bonds, general obligation commercial paper notes, lease-revenue obligations and short-term obligations, including revenue anticipation notes and revenue anticipation warrants. The State Constitution prohibits the
creation of general obligation indebtedness of the State unless a bond measure is approved by a majority of the electorate voting at a general election or a direct primary.</div>
<div>Capital Facilities Financing.<font> The State builds and acquires capital facilities primarily through the use of general obligation bonds and lease-purchase borrowing. Under the State Constitution, debt service on outstanding general
obligation bonds is the second charge to the General Fund after support of the public school system and public institutions of higher education. New general obligation bonds, lease revenue bonds and other General Fund-supported debt are authorized
by the voters and/or the State Legislature with lease revenue bonds generally authorized by the State Legislature. As of January 1, 2019, the State had approximately $82.0 billion of outstanding general obligation bonds and lease revenue bonds
payable principally from the State’s General Fund or from lease payments paid from the operating budget of the respective lessees, the operating budgets of which are primarily, but not exclusively, derived from the General Fund. This
outstanding debt consists of approximately $73.1 billion of general obligation bonds and approximately $8.9 billion of lease revenue bonds. Moreover, as of January 1, 2019, the State had approximately $37.1 billion of authorized and unissued General
Fund-supported general obligation bonds and $6.4 billion of authorized but unissued lease revenue bonds.</font></div>
<div>As of April 2019, debt service on General Fund-supported
general obligation bonds and lease-revenue debt is estimated to equal approximately 5.9 percent of General Fund revenues in fiscal year 2018-19 and 5.7 percent of General Fund revenues in fiscal year 2019-20. These amounts fluctuate as assumptions
for future debt issuance and revenue projections are updated</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>from time to time. This debt service cost is calculated based on the amount
of debt service to be paid without adjusting for reimbursement from various special funds and subsidy payments from the federal government for taxable “Build America Bonds.” Including those estimated offsets would reduce debt service on
General Fund-supported general obligation bonds and lease-revenue debt to approximately 4.5 percent of General Fund revenues in fiscal year 2018-19 and 4.0 percent of General Fund revenues in fiscal year 2019-20.</div>
<div>Future Bond Issuance Plans.<font> The amount of outstanding General Fund-supported debt, primarily general obligation bonds, may increase in coming years given the amount of authorized and unissued General Fund-supported bonds the
State can issue. See “— Capital Facilities Financing” above. Based upon estimates from the Department of Finance in April 2019, approximately $5.4 billion of such obligations will be issued in fiscal year 2019-20 (consisting of
approximately $4.2 billion of new money general obligation bonds and approximately $1.2 billion of lease revenue bonds). However, the exact amount that may be issued will depend on market conditions, overall budget constraints and other factors. The
State also issues refunding bonds as markets warrant.</font></div>
<div>Cash Management.<font> As part of its cash management program, the State has regularly issued short-term obligations to meet cash flow needs. External borrowing is typically done with revenue anticipation notes that are
payable later in the fiscal year in which they are issued. However, the State has not issued revenue anticipation notes since fiscal year 2014-15 and is not expected to issue revenue anticipation notes in fiscal year 2018-19 or 2019-20.</font></div>
<div>The State is also authorized under certain circumstances to
issue revenue anticipation warrants that are payable in the succeeding fiscal year, as well as registered refunding warrants issued to refund revenue anticipation warrants. The State has issued revenue anticipation warrants to bridge short-term cash
flow shortages in five years since 1992. From time to time, the State Legislature has deferred various payments due under State statute, in order to more closely align the State’s revenues with its expenditures. This technique has been used in
past budgets, in order to reduce the State’s need for external borrowing to bridge any cash flow deficit. Further, State law gives the State Controller some flexibility to delay payments to various payees, including State vendors, when the
State Controller foresees a relatively short-term cash flow shortage. In addition, the State issued IOUs in lieu of cash payments in July and August 2009, the second such issuance since the 1930s.</div>
<div>Obligations of State Agencies</div>
<div>A number of State agencies and authorities issue obligations
secured or payable from specified revenue streams. These obligations are not payable from the General Fund and carry different ratings than the State’s general obligation bonds. None of these revenue bonds are backed by the State’s faith
and credit or taxing power. As of January 1, 2019, the various State revenue bond financing programs had approximately $35.0 billion in outstanding bonds and the various State financing authorities had approximately $31.9 billion of outstanding
revenue bonds. The Regents of the University of California has been one of the largest issuers of revenue bonds in recent years, with approximately $19.7 billion of outstanding revenue bonds secured by certain revenues of the University of
California, as of January 1, 2019. Other State agencies and authorities with significant bond programs include the State Department of Water Resources, which had approximately $5.7 billion of outstanding revenue bonds secured by power and water
users, and the California Housing Finance Agency, which had approximately $1.3 billion of outstanding revenue bonds secured by mortgage loans made for single-family and multi-family housing units, as of January 1, 2019.</div>
<div>Recent Financial Results</div>
<div>Historically, the principal sources of General Fund revenues
are personal income tax, sales and use tax and corporation tax. Based on the most recent figures provided in the May Revision to the 2019-20 Governor’s Budget, these sources are expected to contribute approximately 71.1 percent, 18.9 percent
and 9.2 percent, respectively, of total General Fund revenues and transfers in fiscal year 2019-20.</div>
<div>The State’s personal income tax structure is highly
progressive with rates ranging from 1 percent to 12.3 percent. For the 2017 tax year, the State reported that the top one percent of income earners paid over 47 percent of personal income taxes. This percentage has been greater than 40 percent for
13 of the last 14 years. The personal income tax was made even more progressive with the passage of Proposition 30, which imposed additional taxes on earnings over $250,000, resulting in an income tax of 12.3 percent on earnings over $1 million. In
November 2016 the voters in the State approved an extension of this portion of Proposition 30 through the end of calendar year 2030. A large portion of personal income tax receipts is derived from capital gains realizations and stock option income.
These revenue sources can be particularly volatile. For example, over the last 10 years, capital gains tax receipts accounted for a high of 11.3 percent of General Fund revenues and</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>transfers in fiscal year 2017-18 and a low of 3.4 percent in fiscal year
2009-10. As of April 2019, capital gains tax receipts were forecast by the State to be 11.1% of General Fund revenues in fiscal year 2018-19 and 9.7% in fiscal year 2019-20.</div>
<div>Along with personal income taxes, sales and use taxes and
corporation taxes are subject to economic fluctuations as well, and were adversely affected during the financial crisis that ended in 2009. However, total personal income taxes, sales and use taxes and corporation taxes have grown steadily since
2009, from $87.0 billion in fiscal year 2009-10 to an estimated $138.2 billion in fiscal year 2018-19 according to the May Revision to the 2019-20 Governor’s Budget, reflecting an average annual growth rate of approximately 5.3 percent.
Moreover, compared to the rest of the nation, California relies less on the property tax as a source of revenues, because of Proposition 13. See “Constitutional Limitations on Taxes, Other Charges, Appropriations and General Fund Revenues
– Limitation on Property Taxes” above.</div> <div>The
State is required to maintain the SFEU, derived from General Fund revenues, as a reserve to meet cash needs of the General Fund, but the SFEU is required to be replenished as soon as sufficient revenues are available. Year-end balances in the SFEU
are included for financial reporting purposes in the General Fund balance. As of June 30, 2011 and 2012, recurring cash flow shortfalls resulted in SFEU deficits of approximately $3.9 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. SFEU balances have
improved with higher than expected capital gains revenue in recent years. The May Revision to the 2019-20 Governor’s Budget projected an SFEU balance of approximately $4.8 billion as of June 30, 2019 and an SFEU balance of approximately $1.6
billion as of June 30, 2020 if proposed budget solutions are adopted. See “Status of State General Fund; 2019-20 Governor’s Budget and May Revision” below. Overall, the State’s combined discretionary and mandatory budget
reserves are proposed to grow to almost $19.5 billion which is about 13.6% of estimated 2019-20 State General Fund revenues. The 2019-20 Governor’s Budget also proposes to pay down accumulated debts and liabilities to counter the potential
fiscal impact of federal policy changes on California and the potential end of an economic expansion that has surpassed historical averages.</div>
<div>Since 2011, every State budget has been enacted in a timely
manner, in accordance with the process whereby the Governor’s proposed budget is revised and finalized according to the schedule outlined below (the “Budget Act”). See “The State Budget— Overview” and
“Status of State General Fund; 2019-20 Governor’s Budget and May Revision<font>”</font><font> </font>below.</div>
<div>Proposition 98 and K-14 Funding</div>
<div>Throughout the 1980s, State spending increased rapidly as the
State population and economy also grew rapidly. Such spending included increased spending for many assistance programs to local governments, which were constrained by Proposition 13 and other laws. The largest State assistance program is to local
public school districts. In 1988, the voters of the State approved Proposition 98, a combined initiative constitutional amendment and statute, which (subject to suspension by a two-thirds vote of the State Legislature and the Governor) guarantees
local public school districts and community college districts a minimum share of General Fund revenues (the “Proposition 98 Guarantee”). The Proposition 98 Guarantee is calculated each fiscal year using one of three “tests”
that apply under varying fiscal and economic conditions. For fiscal year 2018-19, the Proposition 98 Guarantee is expected to be $78.1 billion, of which $54.4 billion is payable from the General Fund. For fiscal year 2019-20, the Proposition 98
Guarantee is expected to be $81.1 billion, of which $55.9 billion is payable from the General Fund. The remainder of the Proposition 98 Guarantee is funded by local property taxes. The 2019-20 May Revision to the Governor’s Budget Proposition
98 Guarantee level for fiscal year 2019-20 is an increase of $3 billion over the fiscal year 2018-19 level. The 2019-20 Governor’s Budget provided that just over 40 percent of General Fund revenues in fiscal years 2018-19 and 2019-20 will be
directed to K-14 programs covered by the Proposition 98 Guarantee. For further information on the limitations on General Fund revenues imposed by Proposition 98, see “Constitutional Limitations on Taxes, Other Charges, Appropriations and
General Fund Revenues — Dedication of General Fund Revenues to Schools” above.</div>
<div>State and Local Pension and Post-Retirement Liabilities</div>
<div>State. <font>The
financial condition of the State and its localities is also subject to pension and other post-retirement benefit risks.</font></div>
<div><font>Pension</font><font>. The pension funds managed by the State’s retirement systems, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (“CalPERS”) and the California State Teachers’ Retirement System
(“CalSTRS”), sustained significant investment losses during the financial crisis and currently have substantial unfunded liabilities which will require increased contributions from the General Fund in future years. Fiscal year 2018-19
General Fund contributions to CalPERS and CalSTRS are estimated (as of April 2019) to be approximately $3.6 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively. Fiscal year 2019-20 General Fund contributions to CalPERS and CalSTRS are estimated (as of April
2019) to be approximately $3.9 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively. The combined contributions (including contributions for California State University (“CSU”)) represent approximately 4.5 percent</font></div> </div>

<div>of all General Fund expenditures for fiscal year 2018-19 and approximately
4.9 percent of all General Fund expenditures for fiscal year 2019-20. In addition to the combined contributions, the State will also be making a one-time $3.0 billion supplemental payment to CalPERS in fiscal year 2018-19. The 2019-20
Governor’s Budget estimates that this $3.0 billion supplemental contribution will result in savings of $7.2 billion over the next three decades, assuming actuarial and investment assumptions are realized. Similarly, the State will also be
making a $3.0 billion supplemental payment to CalSTRS in fiscal year 2018-19. The 2019-20 Governor’s Budget estimates that this $3.0 billion supplemental payment will result in savings of $6.9 billion over the next three decades, based on
current CalSTRS actuarial assumptions. The 2019-20 Governor’s Budget also dedicates all of the Proposition 2 debt payments, $1.8 billion, toward paying down unfunded retiree health and pension liabilities. See “The State Budget –
Balanced Budget Amendment (Proposition 58 and Proposition 2)” below.</div>
<div>The recent economic recession called into question the
reliability of assumed rates of return used to determine actuarial unfunded pension liabilities. For actuarial valuations prior to June 30, 2011, CalPERS and CalSTRS had used an assumed 7.75 percent rate of return to calculate their respective
unfunded liabilities. The investment earnings assumptions were lowered to 7.50 percent for both funds commencing for actuarial valuations dated June 30, 2011. These assumption changes resulted in significant increases in unfunded liability. The
assumption changes for CalPERS also increased retirement contributions for many local governments which contract with CalPERS to manage their pension programs. In December 2016 the CalPERS Board voted to lower the investment earnings assumptions for
2017-18 to 7.375%, for 2018-19 to 7.25% and for 2019-20 to 7.0%. In February 2017, the CalSTRS Board lowered its investment return assumption to 7.25% for the June 30, 2016 actuarial valuation and 7.0% for the June 30, 2017 actuarial valuation.
These assumption changes will result in additional increases of unfunded liabilities for the systems. In February 2018, CalPERS adopted revisions to its actuarial authorization policy which will be applied to amortizations of gains, losses and
actuarial surplus experienced after June 30, 2019 and will affect contributions starting in fiscal year 2020-21.</div>
<div>The most recent CalPERS and CalSTRS investment returns have
varied widely and their respective 10-year time weighted average returns are below even the lower assumed rates of return adopted by their Boards.</div> <div>

<div>In April 2013, CalPERS approved new actuarial policies that
are aimed at returning the CalPERS system to fully-funded status within 30 years. These new policies include a rate-smoothing method with a 30-year fixed amortization period for gains and losses (rather than the current 30-year rolling amortization
method). CalPERS delayed the implementation of the new policy until fiscal year 2015-16 for the State, schools and all public agencies. In February 2014, the CalPERS Board approved new demographic assumptions that take into account increased life
expectancies (2.1 years for men; 1.6 years for women) and to fully phase in the resulting increased costs to the State (of approximately $1.2 billion per year) within 3 years. All of these policies have or are projected to increase required State
and local contributions to CalPERS. See “—Local” below for a discussion of steps taken to eliminate the current CalSTRS unfunded liability.</div>
<div><font>OPEB</font><font>. The State also provides other post-employment health care and dental benefits to its employees and certain of their spouses and dependents (hereinafter referred to as “OPEB”), which benefits utilize a
“pay-as-you-go” funding policy. General Fund contributions to OPEB (as of April 2019) were estimated to be approximately $2.3 billion of total General Fund expenditures for fiscal year 2018-19 and approximately $2.5 billion of total
General Fund expenditures for fiscal year 2019-20 (or approximately 1.6 percent of General Fund expenditures in fiscal year 2018-19 and 1.7 percent of General Fund expenditures in fiscal year 2019-20).</font></div>
<div>The State’s most recent OPEB actuarial accrued liability
report estimated an approximately $91.0 billion unfunded actuarial accrued liability as of June 30, 2017 (compared to $76.7 billion estimated as of June 30, 2016). Government Accounting Standards Board (“GASB”) Statements 74 and 75, each
of which affects OPEB financial reporting, were issued in June 2015. As a result, there is an increased focus on OPEB liability as GASB Statement No. 74 became effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2016 and GASB Statement No. 75 became
effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2017. In January 2016, the State Controller noted that, if OPEB funding is left unchanged, the OPEB actuarial accrued liability could rise to more than $100 billion by fiscal year 2020-21 and to
more than $300 billion by fiscal year 2047-48. Statutory language passed as part of the 2015-16 Budget Act, which proposed prefunding the entire unfunded liability by fiscal year 2044-45, contained the framework designed to support the elimination
of the unfunded OPEB actuarial accrued liability through the use of a prefunding trust fund to pay for future retiree health benefits. As of April 2019, the State had approximately $1.1 billion set aside in the prefunding trust fund. By the end of
fiscal year 2018-19, the State projected the trust fund balance will approach $1.6 billion in assets.</div>
<div><font>General</font><font>. In the future the State may be forced to significantly increase its pension fund and post-retirement benefit contributions, reducing discretionary funds available for other State programs. In addition, the State’s
credit ratings may be adversely affected if the State does not reduce or manage these unfunded liabilities. See “Bond Ratings” below.</font></div>
<div>Local. <font>Many
local governments in the State, many of which are current members of CalPERS, face similar and, in many cases, more severe issues relating to unfunded pension and post-retirement benefit (“OPEB”) liabilities. The credit ratings, and even
the solvency, of these local governments may be at risk in the future if these liabilities are not appropriately addressed through wage concessions and restructuring of benefits. Cities are particularly at risk because one of their primary missions
is safety, and safety personnel labor and retirement benefit costs are significantly greater than labor and retirement costs of general municipal employees. Three cities – Vallejo, Stockton and San Bernardino – entered bankruptcy under
Chapter 9 of the Federal bankruptcy code, largely as a result of escalating labor cost and unfunded pension and post-retirement liabilities. All three of these cities have agreements with CalPERS to administer their pension obligations, and their
respective obligations to CalPERS were a significant reason for their insolvency. Other cities (including some that contract with CalPERS) and counties have expressed public concerns about their ability to meet their unfunded pension and other
post-retirement liabilities, and a willingness to entertain bankruptcy as an option to resolve their fiscal problems. One federal bankruptcy judge stated that obligations to CalPERS could be adjusted in federal bankruptcy proceedings; however, the
plan of adjustment in those proceedings was confirmed without reducing such obligations to CalPERS. Any definitive ruling that allowed obligations to CalPERS to be adjusted downward might encourage other financially-stressed municipalities to
explore a Chapter 9 bankruptcy. There can be no assurance that the fiscal stress and cash pressures currently facing certain of the State’s localities will not continue or become more difficult, particularly if the economic recovery
falters.</font></div> <div>School districts in the State are
required to make contributions to CalSTRS for their teachers and staff. In June 2014, the Governor signed Chapter 47, Statutes of 2014 (“AB 1469”), which increased statutorily required contributions to CalSTRS from the State, school
districts, and teachers beginning July 1, 2014. The AB 1469 funding plan includes additional increases in contribution rates for the State, school districts, and teachers over the next several years in order to eliminate the current CalSTRS unfunded
liability by 2045-46. The increased funding requirements imposed upon local school districts will continue to increase through fiscal year 2020-21 and may have an adverse effect on their financial condition.</div> </div>

<div>State Law Regarding Pensions and Pension Reform. <font>California courts have been largely supportive of the vested or earned pension rights of State and local employees. Thus, pension reform efforts have been focused largely on limitations on future
benefits for new employees, bringing limited, if any, immediate financial relief. Both constitutional initiatives and State legislation have been circulated or proposed attempting to reform the State’s pension systems on a State and local
basis.</font></div> <div>In September 2012, the Governor signed
into law a comprehensive pension reform package affecting State and local government known as California Public Employees’ Pension Reform Act of 2013 (“PEPRA”), which became effective January 1, 2013. PEPRA implements lower
defined-benefit formulas with higher retirement ages for new State employees hired on or after January 1, 2013, and includes provisions to increase employee contributions. The State Legislature passed and the Governor signed AB 1469 in June 2014 to
increase required State contributions to CalSTRS. See “— Local” above. OPEB costs were not addressed in PEPRA; however, the State has disclosed that the higher retirement ages included in PEPRA will reduce OPEB liabilities in the
long term.</div> <div>The Legislative Analyst’s
Office’s (the “LAO”) analysis of PEPRA concluded that the legislation would have little or no immediate effect on State finances. However, in a 2012 actuarial analysis of PEPRA, CalPERS projected total savings to the State of
between $10.3 billion and $12.6 billion over the next 30 years due primarily to increased employee contributions and, as the workforce turns over, lower benefit formulas that will gradually reduce normal costs. Total savings to the State and local
governments combined are projected to be between $40 billion and $60 billion over the next 30 years. See also “State and Local Pension and Post-Retirement Liabilities—State” (above) for discussion of supplemental payments to be
made to CalPERs and CalSTRS in fiscal years 2018-19 and 2019-20.</div>
<div>The State Budget</div>
<div>Overview<font>. </font><font>The State’s fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30 of the following year. The annual budget is proposed by the Governor by January 10 of each year for the next fiscal year. Under State
law, the Governor’s Budget cannot provide for projected expenditures in excess of projected revenues for the ensuing fiscal year. State law also requires the Governor to update the Governor’s Budget projections and budgetary proposals by
May 14 of each year (the “May Revision”). The May Revision is generally the basis for final negotiations between the Governor and the State Legislature to reach agreement on appropriations and other legislation to fund State government
and thus finalizing the Budget Act for upcoming fiscal year. The budget must be balanced, as required by Proposition 58 (discussed below) and pursuant to Proposition 25, enacted on November 2, 2010, must be approved by a majority (instead of
two-thirds, under prior law) of each house of the State Legislature. State law requires the Governor to sign the budget by the start of the fiscal year on July 1, a requirement that, prior to Proposition 25’s enactment, had only been met 12
times in the preceding three decades. Following enactment of Proposition 25, the Legislature has approved and the Governor has signed Budget Acts before the start of each such fiscal year.</font></div>
<div>Constraints on the Budget Process. <font>Recent State Constitutional amendments approved by State voters have affected the budget process. Several such amendments are described below.</font></div>
<div>Balanced Budget Amendment (Proposition 58 and Proposition
2).</div> <div><font>Proposition
58</font>. <font>On March 2, 2004, voters approved Proposition 58, a constitutional amendment called the “Balanced Budget Amendment” that requires the State to enact a balanced budget and establish a special
reserve and restricts future borrowing to cover fiscal year-end deficits. As a result of the provisions requiring the enactment of a balanced budget and restricting borrowing, the State would in some cases have to take more immediate actions to
correct budgetary shortfalls. Proposition 58 requires the State Legislature to pass a balanced budget and provides for mid-year adjustments in the event that the budget falls out of balance and the Governor calls a special legislative session to
address the shortfall. The balanced budget determination is made by subtracting expenditures from all available resources, including prior-year balances.</font></div>
<div>Under Proposition 58, if the Governor determines that the
State is facing substantial revenue shortfalls or spending increases, the Governor is authorized to declare a fiscal emergency. The Governor would then be required to propose legislation to address the emergency and call the State Legislature into
special session for that purpose. If the State Legislature fails to pass and send to the Governor legislation to address the fiscal emergency within 45 days, the State Legislature would be prohibited from acting on any other bills or adjourning in
joint recess until such legislation is passed.</div>
<div>Proposition 58 also established the BSA, a special reserve
account funded by annual transfers of specified amounts from the General Fund, unless suspended or reduced by the Governor or until a specified maximum amount has been deposited. Until</div> </div>

<div>the 2014-15 Budget Act, the Governor had suspended the annual transfer of
money from the General Fund to the BSA every year since 2007. Proposition 2 intended to strengthen the BSA by, among other things, basing deposits on when capital gains revenues rise above 8 percent, creating a Proposition 98 reserve and doubling
the maximum size of the BSA from 5 percent to 10 percent of General Fund revenues. Funding for the BSA is estimated by the May Revision to the 2019-20 Governor’s Budget to be approximately $14.4 billion as of June 30, 2019 and approximately
$16.5 billion as of June 30, 2020 (including supplemental transfers to the BSA in excess of requirements). Certain other provisions of Proposition 58 relating to the BSA were replaced by the provisions of Proposition 2. See “—Proposition
2” below.</div> <div>Proposition 58 also prohibits certain
future borrowing to cover fiscal year-end deficits. This restriction applies to general obligation bonds, revenue bonds, and certain other forms of long-term borrowing. The restriction does not apply to certain other types of borrowing, such as
short-term borrowing to cover cash shortfalls in the General Fund (including revenue anticipation notes or revenue anticipation warrants currently used by the State), or inter-fund borrowings.</div>
<div><font>Proposition 2</font><font>. In addition to the provisions described above, other provisions of Proposition 58 relating to the BSA were replaced by the provisions of Proposition 2. Proposition 2 requires that 1.5 percent of annual General Fund
revenues be deposited each year into the BSA until the BSA balance reaches an amount equal to 10 percent of General Fund revenues. Proposition 2 also requires that half of the revenues that otherwise would have been deposited into the BSA through
fiscal year 2030-31 be used for supplemental payments to pay down long-term liabilities. After fiscal year 2030-31, the revenues that otherwise would have been deposited into the BSA may be used for either supplemental debt payments or savings.
Proposition 2 further requires that withdrawal of funds from the BSA be only for a disaster or if spending remains at or below the highest level of spending from the prior three years. Proposition 2 limits the maximum amount that could be withdrawn
in the first year of a recession to half of the BSA’s balance. It also requires the State to provide a multiyear budget forecast to help better manage the State’s longer term finances and to create a Proposition 98 reserve, whereby
spikes in funding are to be saved for future years to smooth school spending and minimize future cuts.</font></div>
<div><font>State-Local Fiscal
Relations</font>.<font> </font><font>The enactment of Proposition 1A in November 2004 (“Proposition 1A of 2004”) and Proposition 22, or the “Local Taxpayer, Public Safety, and
Transportation Protection Act of 2010”, in November 2010 (“Proposition 22”), significantly changed the fiscal relationship between the State and local governments by severely limiting the State’s access to local funding
sources.</font></div> <div>Specifically, Proposition 1A of 2004
amended the State Constitution to, among other things, reduce the State’s access to property tax, sales tax and vehicle license fee revenues raised by local governments. Proposition 1A of 2004 also prohibits the State from mandating activities
on cities, counties or special districts without providing funding to comply with the mandates. If the State does not provide funding for the activity that has been mandated, the requirement to abide by the mandate is suspended.</div>
<div>In addition, Proposition 22 prohibits the State Legislature
from, among other things, (i) taking or reallocating money raised by local governments for local purposes, (ii) making changes in the allocation of property taxes among local governments designed to aid State finances, (iii) using State fuel tax
revenues to pay debt service on State transportation bonds, (iv) borrowing or changing the distribution of State fuel tax revenues, and (v) using vehicle licensing fee revenues to reimburse local governments for State-mandated costs. The inability
of the State to borrow or redirect funds from these sources, as it did during the State’s financial crisis in fiscal years 2008-09 and 2009-10, will reduce the State’s flexibility in reaching budget solutions in the future. On the other
hand, both Proposition 1A of 2004 and Proposition 22 made the allocation of revenues to local jurisdictions more predictable.</div>
<div><font>Proposition 30 and
Proposition 55</font>. <font>On November 6, 2012, voters approved “The Schools and Local Public Safety Protection Act of 2012” (“Proposition 30”), which provided temporary increases in personal
income tax rates for high-income taxpayers and a temporary increase in the State’s sales tax rate. A portion of the tax increases has been and will be used to pay for the State’s Proposition 98 school funding obligations. See
“Proposition 98 and K-14 Funding” above. The sales tax portion of Proposition 30 expired on December 31, 2016. In November 2016, voters approved Proposition 55 which extended the personal income tax portion of Proposition 30 until
December 31, 2030.</font></div> <div>The 2019-20 Governor’s
Budget projects that revenue from the personal income tax increase in Proposition 30/55 will be $8.7 billion in fiscal year 2018-19, $8.6 billion in fiscal year 2019-20, $8.7 billion in fiscal year 2020-21, $8.9 billion in 2021-22 and $9.3 billion
in 2022-23. The 2019-20 Governor’s Budget assumed the continuation of existing federal fiscal policies and accounts for changes in federal tax law adopted in December 2017.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Health Care Reform. <font>The federal Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”) may continue to result in a significant net increase of General Fund program costs. The federal administration and leaders in Congress continue to
consider and propose numerous changes to health and human services programs. Many of the proposals could have far-reaching impacts on health care in California with significant impacts to Medicaid (Medi-Cal in California). Medi-Cal is a federal
program that provides comprehensive health care to nearly 13.5 million Californians.</font></div>
<div>A complete repeal of the ACA, without a companion replacement
program, would not only affect millions of Californians’ health benefits, the State and local health care delivery systems; such a repeal would also disrupt the private insurance market in California. The potential economic impacts of any
repeal or replacement of the ACA as proposed by the Trump Administration are unpredictable and may have an adverse overall fiscal impact on the State and its instrumentalities. The actual fiscal impact will depend on final enacted legislation, if
any, and may also be materially affected by policy choices made by the State to address any proposed or enacted federal legislation. Congress has attempted multiple times to repeal the ACA and consequently drop health care coverage for millions of
Californians. The State previously noted that such actions, if successful, would have cost the General Fund tens of billions of dollars annually—more than doubling the cost of Medi-Cal when fully implemented.</div>
<div>It is not clear whether any of these federal proposals will
ultimately be approved or when they would take effect. As such, the 2019-20 Governor’s Budget continues to reflect existing State and federal law and includes a statewide requirement for California residents to obtain comprehensive health care
coverage or pay a penalty consistent with the federal penalties originally outlined under the ACA. The State continues to implement the ACA through the State’s insurance exchange (Covered California) and through the two-part (mandatory and
optional) expansion of Medi-Cal. As of January 1, 2019, California is responsible for 6 percent of these costs, with California’s contribution generally increasing each fiscal year if the ACA is not repealed, until fiscal year 2020-21, when
the State will pay 10 percent of the total costs. The State’s estimated share of the costs of the optional expansion was approximately $15 billion ($1.5 billion from the General Fund) for fiscal year 2017-18. By fiscal year 2020-21, the
General Fund share for the optional expansion is projected to be $2.6 billion.</div>
<div>The ACA also required individuals to buy health insurance or
pay a tax penalty as an incentive for younger and healthier people to sign up for health care and make coverage more affordable. Covered California, the State’s health insurance marketplace, has provided individual health insurance through
private plans supported by federally funded tax subsidies and products for individuals and small businesses since 2014. It is a self-sustaining entity funded through fees assessed on the participating health plans. The federal tax reform bill,
passed in December 2017, eliminated penalties for the individual mandate starting in 2019. The State individual mandate is expected to prevent increases to the State’s uninsured rate but penalty revenues from the State individual mandate are
currently unknown and the 2019-20 Governor’s Budget does not assume any fiscal impacts in fiscal year 2019-20.</div>
<div>The net impact of the ACA on the General Fund continues to
depend on a variety of factors, including the nature and extent of any repeal or replacement, levels of individual and employer participation, changes in insurance premiums, and expected savings from the reform as beneficiaries in current State-only
programs receive coverage through Medi-Cal or Covered California. <font>Status of State General Fund; 2019-20 Governor’s Budget and May Revision</font>On January 10, 2019, the Governor proposed a budget for fiscal
year 2019-20 (the “2019-20 Governor’s Budget”) and on May 9, 2019 released the May Revision to the 2019-20 Governor’s Budget. The 2019-20 Governor’s Budget had projected a healthy one-time surplus for the State while
also warning of uncertain times because of federal policies, rising costs and the global political and economic climate. The May Revision to the 2019-20 Governor’s Budget projected short-term revenues of $3.2 billion above the 2019-20
Governor’s Budget; however, most of the increased revenues are constitutionally obligated to reserves, debt repayment and the Proposition 98 Guarantee. The May Revision to the 2019-20 Governor’s Budget also projects total general fund
revenues and transfers of $143.8 billion for fiscal year 2019-20, authorizes expenditures of $147 billion, and projects that the State will end the 2019-20 fiscal year with total available general fund reserves of $19.5 billion, including
approximately $1.6 billion in the SFEU, $16.5 billion in the BSA, $900 million in the Safety Net Reserve Fund and approximately $400 million in the Public School System Stabilization Account. The May Revision to the 2019-20 Governor’s Budget
proposes to make a deposit of $2.2 billion to the BSA (also known as the State’s “rainy day fund”). A recent opinion by the California Office of Legislative Counsel concluded that supplemental payments to the BSA made in prior
fiscal years do not count towards calculating its constitutional maximum of 10% which means that the BSA will be funded in excess of its constitutional maximum and could reach a funding level of $18.7 billion in fiscal year 2022-23. However, the
State’s revenue sources, in particular its progressive income tax, may result in volatile swings in revenue. The May Revision to the 2019-20 Governor’s Budget noted that even a moderate recession could result in revenue declines of
nearly $70 billion and a budget deficit of $40 billion over three years.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>LAO Overview of the May Revision to the 2019-20 Governor’s
Budget<font>. </font><font>In its report on the May Revision to the 2019-20 Governor’s Budget, the LAO observed that the State has the capacity to pay for the
Governor’s May Revision proposals and still have an operating surplus—which could be available to respond to unanticipated cost increases, to build additional reserves, or make additional commitments. The LAO observed that although the
Governor proposed to “sunset” four major categories of program expenditures (such as provider rate increases in Medi-Cal), the LAO did not think such action would be necessary to balance the budget in future fiscal years through 2022-23.
However, the LAO also noted that the May Revision to the 2019-20 Governor’s Budget proposed allocating more funding, in dollar terms, to new ongoing spending commitments and much less of surplus revenue, in both dollar and percentage terms, to
building discretionary reserves. Specifically, the Governor proposed new ongoing spending of $3.4 billion (growing to $4.4 billion upon full implementation), compared to recent levels of $300 million and $1.3 billion in 2016-17 and
2018-19.</font></div> <div>Future Budgets</div>
<div>The State’s ability to balance its budget going forward
may be affected by budget pressures, including particularly potential significant increases in required State contributions to pension funds or other post-employment benefits, health care costs, the impact of federal tax legislation and other
federal policies, increased debt service payments and potential adverse decisions in litigation.</div>
<div>Pending Litigation</div>
<div>There are currently numerous legal proceedings pending against
the State, that if determined adversely against the State, could affect the State’s expenditures, and in some cases, its revenues and cash flow. Information regarding some of the more significant litigation pending against the State would
ordinarily be included in various public documents issued by the State, such as the official statements prepared in connection with the issuance of general obligation bonds of California. See “Additional Information” below for
information on how to obtain such official statements.</div>
<div>Bond Ratings</div>
<div>As of May 21, 2019, the following ratings for the
State’s general obligation bonds have been received from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”), S&amp;P Global Ratings, a Standard &amp; Poor’s Financial Services LLC business (“S&amp;P”) and

<div>Periodic reports on revenues and/or expenditures during the
fiscal year are issued by the Administration, the State Controller’s Office and the LAO. The Department of Finance issues a monthly bulletin, which reports the most recent revenue receipts as reported by State departments, comparing those
receipts to budget projections. The State Controller issues a monthly report on General Fund cash receipts and disbursements. These reports are normally released on the 10<sup>th</sup> day of every calendar month for the period ended on the last day of the prior month. The Administration also formally updates its budget projections three
times during each fiscal year — in January, May and at the time of budget enactment. Currently, many of these bulletins and reports are available on the State’s investor relations website
(<font>www.buycaliforniabonds.com</font>) or on the internet at websites maintained by the agencies and by contacting the agencies at their offices in Sacramento, California. Investors are cautioned that interim financial
information is not necessarily indicative of results for a fiscal year.</div>

primary units of local government in California are the 58 counties, which range in population from approximately 1,200 in Alpine County to approximately 10 million in Los Angeles County.</font></div>
<div>Counties are responsible for the provision of many basic
services, including indigent health care, welfare, jails, and public safety in unincorporated areas. As of July 1, 2011, the California League of Cities reported that there are 482 incorporated cities in California and thousands of special districts
formed for education, utilities, and other services.</div> <div>To
the extent the State is constrained by its obligation to schools under Proposition 98, or other fiscal considerations, the absolute level (or the rate of growth) of State assistance to local governments may be affected. Any such reductions in State
aid could compound the serious fiscal constraints already experienced by many local governments, particularly counties and schools.</div>
<div>Many local governments are also facing substantial increases
in pension liabilities and health care costs for retirees, as a result of generous retirements benefits granted during prior economic boom times. For more information regarding pension liabilities, see “State and Local Pension and
Post-Retirement Liabilities” above. At the same time that local governments are facing rising labor and benefit costs, local governments are limited in their ability to levy and raise property taxes and other forms of taxes, fees or
assessments, due to State Constitutional as well as (in some cases) local initiatives. In the case of school districts, contributions to CalSTRS are determined by the State legislature, and the State has enacted legislation to</div> </div>

these factors, local governments may increasingly be forced to cut local services to address budget shortfalls or to take even more drastic actions, such as a bankruptcy filing.</div>
<div>Constitutional and Statutory Limitations on Local Government.<font> The fiscal condition of local governments was changed when Proposition 13, which added Article XIIIA to the State Constitution, was approved by California voters in 1978. Proposition 13 reduced and
limited the future growth of property taxes and limited the ability of local governments to impose “special taxes” (those devoted to a specific purpose) without two-thirds voter approval. Although Proposition 13 limited property tax
growth rates, it also has had a smoothing effect on property tax revenues, ensuring greater stability in annual revenues than existed before Proposition 13 passed. For further information on Proposition 13, see “Constitutional Limitations on
Taxes, Other Charges, Appropriations and General Fund Revenues — Limitation on Property Taxes” above.</font></div>
<div>Proposition 218, another constitutional amendment enacted by
initiative in 1996, further limited the ability of local governments to raise taxes, fees, and other exactions. See “Constitutional Limitations on Taxes, Other Charges, Appropriations and General Fund Revenues — Limitations on Other
Taxes, Fees and Charges” above. Proposition 62, a statutory initiative adopted by the voters on November 4, 1986, includes limitations on the ability of local governments to raise taxes that are similar to those included in the later
constitutional amendments of Proposition 218.</div> <div>In the
aftermath of Proposition 13, the State provided aid to local governments from the General Fund to make up some of the loss of property tax moneys, including assuming principal responsibility for funding K-12 schools and community colleges. During
the recession of the early 1990s, the State Legislature reduced the post-Proposition 13 aid to local government entities other than K-12 schools and community colleges by requiring cities and counties to transfer some of their property tax revenues
to school districts. However, the State Legislature also provided additional funding sources, such as sales taxes, and reduced certain mandates for local services funded by cities and counties.</div>
<div>Beginning in 2000, and in part caused by the “internet
bubble,” the State was faced with increasing financial stress and began to divert local revenue resources, including sales tax, vehicle license fees and redevelopment moneys, to the State coffers. The 2004-05 Budget Act, related legislation
and the enactment of Proposition 1A of 2004 and Proposition 22 dramatically changed the State-local fiscal relationship.</div>
<div>Proposition 1A of 2004 amended the State Constitution to,
among other things, reduce the State Legislature’s authority over local government revenue sources by placing restrictions on the State’s access to local governments’ property, sales, and vehicle license fee revenues as of November
3, 2004. Proposition 22 supersedes Proposition 1A of 2004 and completely prohibits any future borrowing by the State from local government funds, and generally prohibits the State Legislature from making changes in local government funding sources.
For further discussion regarding Proposition 22 and Proposition 1A of 2004, see “The State Budget — Constraints on the Budget Process — State-Local Fiscal Relations” above.</div>
<div>Realigning Services to Local Governments.<font> Commencing with the 2011-12 Budget Act, the State implemented a realignment plan to shift certain State program costs to counties and provided a comparable amount of funds to support these new county
commitments. Under the realignment plan, ongoing funds for such programs after fiscal year 2010-11 are required to be, provided to counties for court security, corrections and public safety, mental health services, substance abuse treatment, child
welfare programs, adult protective services, and CalWORKS. However, State transfers do not cover all the costs of such programs. Consequently, local governments, particularly counties, have borne an increased part of the financial burden of
providing program services, including the risks of cost overruns, revenue declines and insufficient revenue growth. The State reported in August 2018 that, during fiscal year 2018-19, it expected to transfer approximately $7.4 billion in sales tax
revenues and $700 million in vehicle license fee revenue to local governments under the realignment plan. However, General Fund savings have been over $2.0 billion annually from the realigned programs beginning in fiscal year 2011-12. As of April
2019, the State estimates savings of $2.4 billion in fiscal year 2018-19 and $3.1 billion in fiscal year 2019-20 from the realignment plan.</font></div>
<div>Obligations of Other Issuers</div>
<div>Other Issuers of California Debt Obligations.<font> There are a number of State agencies, instrumentalities and political subdivisions of the State that issue municipal obligations, some of which may be conduit revenue obligations payable from payments
from private borrowers. These entities are subject to various economic risks and uncertainties, and the credit quality of the securities issued by them may vary considerably from the credit quality of obligations backed by the full
faith</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>and credit of the State. For example, assessment bonds may be adversely
affected by a general decline in real estate values or a slowdown in real estate sales activity.</div>
<div>California Long-Term Lease Obligations.<font> Based on a series of court decisions, certain long-term lease obligations, though typically payable from the General Fund or a municipality, are not considered “indebtedness” requiring
voter approval. Such leases, however, are subject to “abatement” in the event the facility being leased is unavailable for beneficial use and occupancy by the municipality during the term of the lease. Abatement is not a default, and
there may be no remedies available to the holders of the certificates evidencing the lease obligation in the event abatement occurs. The most common cases of abatement are failure to complete construction of the facility before the end of the period
during which lease payments have been capitalized and uninsured casualty losses to the facility (e.g., due to earthquake). In the event abatement occurs with respect to a lease obligation, lease payments may be interrupted (if all available
insurance proceeds and reserves are exhausted) and the certificates may not be paid when due. Further, lease obligations may represent executory contracts which could be rejected in a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 9 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code. In recent bankruptcy proceedings involving the City of Stockton, the confirmed plan of adjustment included the discharge of lease obligations at significant discounts from their face value.</font></div>
<div>Statutory Lien Securing General Obligation Bonds<font>. Certain local governments, particularly school districts, issue general obligation bonds secured by </font><font>ad valorem</font><font> property taxes. Effective January 1, 2016 provisions were added to the California Education Code and the California Government Code to provide that general obligation bonds issued and sold by local
governments in California are secured by a statutory lien on the </font><font>ad valorem</font><font> property taxes levied and collected to pay the principal and interest on
such general obligation bonds. A statutory lien provides bondholders with a security interest in </font><font>ad valorem</font><font> property taxes intended to survive a
bankruptcy of the local government. It is unclear whether these provisions apply to bonds issued prior to the effective date.</font></div>
<div>Tax Increment and the Dissolution of Redevelopment Agencies.<font> Until 2011, local redevelopment agencies throughout the State issued “tax allocation” bonds or similar obligations secured by the increase in assessed valuation of a redevelopment project
area after the start of redevelopment activity. Throughout the years, redevelopment agencies issued billions of dollars of tax allocation bonds. In addition, the State has regularly borrowed or appropriated redevelopment tax increments to address
its budget shortfalls.</font></div> <div>In December 2011, the
State Supreme Court upheld the validity of legislation, enacted earlier in 2011, that eliminated redevelopment agencies (as well as the issuance of tax allocation bonds) in the State. On February 1, 2012, all redevelopment agencies in California
were dissolved and the process of unwinding their financial affairs began.</div>
<div>The legislation dissolving redevelopment agencies preserved
the pledge of tax increment revenues to the payment of tax allocation bonds or tax allocation supported obligations. In addition, the passage of “clean-up” legislation has clarified many outstanding issues relating to the implementation
of the legislation, and in particular the mechanics of assuring the payment of outstanding tax allocation obligations.</div>
<div>Many local governments (largely cities) with redevelopment
agencies subsidized their general fund operations through the use of tax increment revenues. Consequently, the dissolution of redevelopment agencies and the reallocation of tax increment revenue to other taxing entities has resulted in additional
fiscal stress for many of these local governments. Over time, however, the elimination of redevelopment agencies and the redirection of tax increment revenues to local governments will provide additional discretionary revenues to the State as well
as the local governments.</div> <div>Other Considerations.<font> The repayment of industrial development securities or single family mortgage revenue bonds secured by real property may be affected by California laws limiting foreclosure rights of creditors. Under
California law, mortgage loans secured by single family homes can be prepaid at any time without penalty, except in the first five years of the loan, and subject to limits on the size of the penalty. Such prepayments may affect the ability of the
issuer of single family mortgage bonds to repay the bonds. Securities backed by health care and hospital revenues may be affected by changes in State regulations governing cost reimbursements to health care providers under Medi-Cal (the
State’s Medicaid program), including risks related to the policy of awarding exclusive contracts to certain hospitals. See “Obligations of State Agencies” and “Obligations of Other Issuers — Other Issuers of California
Debt Obligations” above.</font></div> <div>Other Factors</div>

<div>Earthquake Risk.<font> Substantially all of California is within an active geologic region subject to major seismic activity. Northern California in 1989 and Southern California in 1994 experienced major earthquakes causing
billions of dollars in damages. The federal government provided more than $13 billion in aid for both earthquakes, and neither event has had any long-term negative economic impact. Any obligation in the California Fund could be affected by an
interruption of revenues because of damaged facilities, or, consequently, income tax deductions for casualty losses or property tax assessment reductions. Compensatory financial assistance could be constrained by the inability of (i) an issuer to
have obtained earthquake insurance coverage; (ii) an insurer to perform on its contracts of insurance in the event of widespread losses; or (iii) the federal or State government to appropriate sufficient funds within their respective budget
limitations.</font></div> <div>Climate Change. <font>The future fiscal impact of climate change on the State is difficult to predict but could be significant. In May 2009, the California Climate Change Center released a study, for informational purposes
only, which was funded by various State agencies and the California Ocean Protection Council. The study posited that increases in sea level will be a significant consequence of climate change over the next century. The study evaluated the
population, infrastructure, and property at risk from projected sea-level rise </font><font>if no actions are taken to protect the coast</font><font>. The study concluded that
significant property in the State is at risk of flooding from 100-year flood events and estimated that the replacement value of this property would total nearly $100 billion (in 2000 dollars). Since this study was released, several municipalities in
the State have conducted assessments of climate change vulnerability specific to their areas. These more specific local assessments of risks and potential mitigation strategies may be publicly available. A wide range of critical infrastructure in
the State, such as roads, airports, hospitals, schools, emergency facilities, wastewater treatment plants, power plants, and wetlands is vulnerable to varying degrees depending on location and the feasibility of mitigation strategies.</font></div>
<div>Flooding and Subsidence. <font>California’s water management infrastructure consists of a complex system of dams, reservoirs, canals, pipes, pumping facilities. As of 2018, the American Society of Civil Engineers Report Card
for California Infrastructure identified 678 of California’s 1,476 regulated dams as “high-hazard”, meaning that their failure or mis-operation will probably cause loss of human life and significant economic losses. Long-term
subsidence, or sinking, poses serious and challenging concerns for California’s water managers, putting water management and flood control infrastructure, including aqueducts, levees, bridges and roads at risk. Vast sections of the San Joaquin
Valley have subsided as much as 28 feet since the 1920s. The failure of high hazard dams or other critical flood control infrastructure could materially impact the operations or finances of the State or its local governments.</font></div>
<div>Wildfires<font>.</font><font> In recent years, California has experienced a number of catastrophic wildfires, with some of the largest, deadliest, and most damaging fires in State history occurring in 2018. The State has expended,
and expects to continue to expend, billions of dollars in recovery efforts and debris removal. The 2019-20 Governor’s Budget assumes that the federal government will reimburse 75 percent of eligible costs of the November 2018 wildfires and
estimates that after federal reimbursement, the State’s share of those costs alone will be $923.1 million. The 2019-20 Governor’s Budget also assumes the State will waive the local share of debris removal costs and backfill
wildfire-related property tax revenue losses for several counties, cities and special districts impacted by wildfires in the past four years, totaling in the low tens of millions of dollars.</font></div>
<div>Cybersecurity Risks<font> — The State, like many other large public and private entities, relies on a large and complex technology environment to conduct its operations. As a recipient and provider of personal, private,
or sensitive information, the State is subject to multiple cyber threats including, but not limited to, hacking, viruses, malware and other attacks on computer and other sensitive digital networks and systems. Entities or individuals may attempt to
gain unauthorized access to the State’s digital systems for the purposes of misappropriating assets or information or causing operational disruption and damage. In 2017 the State established a statewide security operations center to protect
against malicious activity targeting critical technology infrastructure. Local governments in the State have experienced similar threats and taken similar measures, however, no assurances can be given that the efforts to manage cyber threats and
attacks will be successful or that any such attack will not materially impact the operations or finances of the State or its local governments.</font></div>

<div>statements and other information. Neither the Fund nor its legal counsel has
independently verified all of the information contained in such statements and documents. The information provided below is intended only as a general summary and is subject to change rapidly, substantially, and without notice, and the inclusion of
such information herein shall not create any implication that there has been no change in the affairs of the State or issuers therein since the date of its preparation.</div>
<div>The State, some of its agencies, instrumentalities and public
authorities and certain of its municipalities have sometimes faced serious financial difficulties that could have an adverse effect on the sources of payment for or the market value of the New York municipal bonds in which the Fund invests.</div>
<div>New York City</div>
<div>General<font>. The City, with an
estimated population of approximately 8.6 million, is an international center of business and culture. Its non-manufacturing economy is broadly based, with the banking, securities, insurance, technology, information, publishing, fashion, design,
retailing, education and health care industries accounting for a significant portion of the City’s total employment earnings. Additionally, the City is a leading tourist destination. Manufacturing activity in the City is conducted primarily in
apparel and printing.</font></div> <div>For each of the 1981
through 2018 fiscal years, the City’s General Fund had an operating surplus, before discretionary and other transfers, and achieved balanced operating results as reported in accordance with then applicable generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”), after discretionary and other transfers and except for the application of Governmental Accounting Standards Board (“GASB”) Statement No. 49 (“GASB 49”), as described below. City fiscal years
end on June 30 and are referred to by the calendar year in which they end. The City has been required to close substantial gaps between forecast revenues and forecast expenditures in order to maintain balanced operating results. There can be no
assurance that the City will continue to maintain balanced operating results as required by State law without proposed tax or other revenue increases or reductions in City services or entitlement programs, which could adversely affect the
City’s economic base.</div> <div>As required by the New York
State Financial Emergency Act For The City of New York (the “Financial Emergency Act” or the “Act”) and the New York City Charter (the “City Charter”), the City prepares a four-year annual financial plan, which is
reviewed and revised on a quarterly basis and which includes the City’s capital, revenue and expense projections and outlines proposed gap-closing programs for years with projected budget gaps. The City’s current financial plan projects
budget balance in the 2019 and 2020 fiscal years in accordance with GAAP except for the application of GASB 49. In 2010, the Financial Emergency Act was amended to waive the budgetary impact of GASB 49 by enabling the City to continue to finance
with bond proceeds certain pollution remediation costs. The City’s current financial plan projects budget gaps for the 2021 through 2023 fiscal years. A pattern of current year balance and projected future year budget gaps has been consistent
through the entire period since 1982, during which the City has achieved an excess of revenues over expenditures, before discretionary transfers, for each fiscal year. The City is required to submit its financial plans to the New York State
Financial Control Board (the “Control Board”).</div>
<div>For its normal operations, the City depends on aid from the
State both to enable the City to balance its budget and to meet its cash requirements. There can be no assurance that there will not be delays or reductions in State aid to the City from amounts currently projected; that State budgets for future
State fiscal years will be adopted by the April 1 statutory deadline, or interim appropriations will be enacted; or that any such reductions or delays will not have adverse effects on the City’s cash flow or expenditures. In addition, the City
has made various assumptions with respect to federal aid. Future federal actions or inactions could have adverse effects on the City’s cash flow or revenues.</div>
<div>The Mayor is responsible for preparing the City’s
financial plan which relates to the City and certain entities that receive funds from the City. The financial plan is modified quarterly. The City’s projections set forth in the financial plan are based on various assumptions and contingencies
which are uncertain and which may not materialize. Such assumptions and contingencies include the condition of the international, national, regional and local economies, the provision of State and federal aid, the impact on City revenues and
expenditures of any future federal or State legislation and policies affecting the City and the cost of pension structures and healthcare.</div>
<div>Implementation of the financial plan is dependent on the
City’s ability to market successfully its bonds and notes. Implementation of the financial plan is also dependent upon the ability to market the securities of other financing entities including the New York City Municipal Water Finance
Authority (the “Water Authority”) and the New York City Transitional Finance Authority (“TFA”). The success of projected public sales of City, Water Authority, TFA and other bonds and notes will</div> </div>

<div>be subject to prevailing market conditions. Future developments in the
financial markets generally, as well as future developments concerning the City, and public discussion of such developments, may affect the market for outstanding City general obligation bonds and notes.</div>
<div>The City Comptroller and other agencies and public officials,
from time to time, issue reports and make public statements which, among other things, state that projected revenues and expenditures may be different from those forecast in the City’s financial plans.</div>
<div>City Financial Plan<font>. For the
2018 fiscal year, the City’s General Fund had a total surplus of $4.581 billion, before discretionary and other transfers, and achieved balanced operating results in accordance with GAAP, except for the application of GASB 49 as described
above, after discretionary and other transfers. The 2018 fiscal year is the thirty-eighth consecutive year that the City has achieved balanced operating results when reported in accordance with GAAP, except for the application of GASB
49.</font></div> <div>On June 14, 2018, the City submitted to the
Control Board the financial plan for the 2019 through 2022 fiscal years (the “June Financial Plan”), which was consistent with the City’s capital and expense budgets as adopted for the 2019 fiscal year. On November 8, 2018, the
City submitted to the Control Board a modification to the June Financial Plan (as so modified, the “November Financial Plan”). On February 7, 2019, the Mayor released his preliminary budget for the 2020 fiscal year and the City submitted
to the Control Board a modification to the financial plan for the 2019 through 2023 fiscal years (as so modified, the “Financial Plan”).</div>
<div>The Financial Plan projects revenues and expenses for the 2019
and 2020 fiscal years balanced in accordance with GAAP, except for the application of GASB 49, and projects gaps of approximately $3.52 billion, $2.94 billion and $3.3 billion in fiscal years 2021 through 2023, respectively. The June Financial Plan
had projected revenues and expenses for the 2019 fiscal year balanced in accordance with GAAP, except for the application of GASB 49, and had projected gaps of approximately $3.26 billion, $2.89 billion and $2.29 billion in fiscal years 2020 through
2022, respectively.</div> <div>The Financial Plan reflects, since
the June Financial Plan, increases in projected net revenues of $1.08 billion, $554 million and $420 million in fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2022, respectively, and a decrease in projected net revenues of $7 million in fiscal year 2021. Changes in
projected revenues include: (i) increases in real property tax revenues of $76 million, $234 million, $198 million and $448 million in fiscal years 2019 through 2022, respectively; (ii) increases in personal income tax revenues of $67 million, $24
million and $12 million in fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2022, respectively, and a decrease in personal income tax revenues of $81 million in fiscal year 2021; (iii) increases in business tax revenues of $90 million, $3 million and $76 million in
fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2022, respectively, and a decrease in business tax revenues of $21 million in fiscal year 2021; (iv) increases in sales tax revenues of $47 million and $2 million in fiscal years 2019 and 2020, respectively, and decreases
in sales tax revenues of $52 million and $39 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2022, respectively; (v) increases in real estate transaction tax revenues of $228 million and $15 million in fiscal years 2019 and 2020, respectively, and decreases in
real estate transaction tax revenues of $33 million and $51 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2022, respectively; (vi) a decrease in State School Tax Relief Program (“STAR Program”) revenues of $4 million in fiscal year 2019; (vii)
increases in hotel tax revenues of $15 million, $31 million, $14 million and $13 million in fiscal years 2019 through 2022, respectively; and (viii) an increase in other tax revenues of $85 million in fiscal year 2019 and decreases in other tax
revenues of $20 million, $20 million and $25 million in fiscal years 2020 through 2022, respectively. Changes in projected revenues also include (i) an increase in tax audit revenues of $275 million in fiscal year 2020; and (ii) a net increase in
other revenues of $471 million in fiscal year 2019 and net decreases in other revenues of $10 million, $12 million and $14 million in fiscal years 2020 through 2022, respectively.</div>
<div>The Financial Plan also reflects, since the June Financial
Plan, a decrease in projected net expenditures of $2.09 billion in fiscal year 2019 and increases in projected net expenditures of $463 million, $620 million and $1.07 billion in fiscal years 2020 through 2022, respectively. Changes in projected
expenditures include: (i) increases in agency expenses of $253 million, $344 million, $284 million and $321 million in fiscal years 2019 through 2022, respectively; (ii) increases in the labor reserve of $227 million, $704 million, $967 million and
$1.44 billion in fiscal years 2019 through 2022, respectively; (iii) decreases in pension contributions of $50 million, $92 million and $151 million in fiscal years 2020 through 2022, respectively, primarily as a result of strong investment earnings
in fiscal year 2018; (iv) a decrease in the general reserve of $825 million in fiscal year 2019; (v) a decrease in the capital stabilization reserve of $250 million in fiscal year 2019; and (vi) a decrease of $400 million in fiscal year 2019
reflecting a re-estimate of prior years’ expenses and receivables.</div>
<div>Changes in projected net expenditures also include decreases
in net expenditures of $1.1 billion, $535 million, $539 million and $540 million in fiscal years 2019 through 2022, respectively, to be achieved as a result of the Citywide Savings Program</div> </div>

<div>(which includes increases in tax revenue of $1 million, $3 million, $1
million and $1 million in fiscal years 2019 through 2022, respectively, and increases in miscellaneous revenue of $298 million, $55 million, $27 million and $27 million in fiscal years 2019 through 2022, respectively, that are not reflected within
the revenue changes described above). The Citywide Savings Program also reflects $372 million from New York City Health and Hospitals (“NYCHH”) to satisfy an outstanding payment due to the City from prior fiscal years. Concurrent with
the release of the Financial Plan on February 7, 2019, the Mayor announced an additional agency savings program to be implemented with the release of the Executive Budget and Financial Plan modification in April 2019. Such agency savings program is
expected to reflect reductions in expenditures or increases in revenues with a net total impact of $750 million in fiscal years 2019 and 2020.</div>
<div>The Financial Plan reflects, since the June Financial Plan,
provision for $3.17 billion for the prepayment in fiscal year 2019 of fiscal year 2020 expenses and an expenditure reduction of $3.17 billion in fiscal year 2020.</div>
<div>The Financial Plan also reflects recent contract settlements
with District Council 37 of AFSCME (“DC 37”) and the United Federation of Teachers (“UFT”) (which, together, represent approximately 62% of the City’s workforce) and the application of the pattern increases established
in those settlements to the entire workforce over a 43-month contract period. The pattern framework provides for a 2% wage increase on the first month of the contract, a 2.25% wage increase on the 13th month, and a 3% wage increase on the 26th
month. The pattern also provides funding equivalent to 0.25% of wages to be used to fund benefit items. The DC 37 Settlement covers the period from September 26, 2017 through May 25, 2021. The UFT Settlement covers the period from February 14, 2019
through September 13, 2022. Such settlements also include health insurance savings as part of a new Municipal Labor Committee (“MLC”) agreement, in addition to those previously agreed upon, which are contractually enforceable through
arbitration.</div> <div>The Financial Plan reflects funding for the
NYC Care program, which ensures that primary and specialty care is available to all uninsured City residents within the NYCHH, of $25 million in fiscal year 2020, $75 million in fiscal year 2021, and $100 million in each of fiscal years 2022 and
2023.</div> <div>The Financial Plan reflects the cost of the Fair
Fares Program, which provides reduced fares to low income subway and bus riders, in fiscal years 2019 and 2020, but does not currently reflect funding beyond fiscal year 2020. It is expected that funding sources for the continuation of the program
will be identified in coordination with the City Council.</div>
<div>On January 31, 2019, New York City Housing Authority
(“NYCHA”), the City and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) entered into an agreement relating to lead-based paint and other health and safety concerns in NYCHA’s properties, pursuant to which
additional City funding will be provided to NYCHA and a federal monitor will be appointed to oversee NYCHA. Pursuant to the agreement, the 2019-2023 Capital Commitment Plan (defined herein) reflects $1.2 billion in additional City capital funds,
with an additional $1 billion in City capital funds reflected in the remaining years of the Preliminary Ten Year Capital Strategy for fiscal years 2020 through 2029. NYCHA has announced that it may be out of compliance with federal requirements
beyond the regulations concerning lead-based paint and other health and safety concerns that were the subject of such agreement. NYCHA has estimated the total cost of its outstanding repairs at approximately $32 billion.</div>
<div>The Financial Plan does not reflect the impact of an
adjustment to the number of New York City Employees’ Retirement System (“NYCERS”) members resulting from a previous calculation error, which is expected to increase the City’s required pension contribution by $156 million
annually in fiscal years 2019 through 2022. The Financial Plan also does not reflect the cost of changes to pension assumptions and methods proposed by the City Actuary following draft recommendations by an independent actuarial consultant. Such
recommended changes have been accepted by NYCERS and, if accepted by all five pension systems, would result in increased pension contributions by the City of $30 million annually. The Financial Plan includes reserves of $100 million in each of
fiscal years 2019 and 2020 and $400 million in each of fiscal years 2021 through 2023, which would be available to cover such increased pension contributions.</div>
<div>On April 1, 2019, the State legislature passed the State
fiscal year 2020 budget (the “State 2020 Budget”). The State 2020 Budget is expected to be signed by the Governor and be enacted into law. The Financial Plan does not include certain costs to the City reflected in the State 2020 Budget
including (i) school aid which is $25 million, $111 million, $204 million and $155 million lower than assumed in the Financial Plan in fiscal years 2020 through 2023, respectively; (ii) decreased funding of $63 million in fiscal year 2019 and $125
million in each of fiscal years 2020 through 2023 for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Family Assistance Program; (iii) decreases in the General Public Health Work reimbursement of $59 million in each of fiscal years 2020 through 2023; (iv)
election reform mandates that could result in total costs to the City of at least $140 million in fiscal year 2020 and $120 million in each year thereafter, which would be partially offset by a Statewide allocation of</div> </div>

<div>$24.7 million per year, a portion of which would be made available to the
City; and (v) a $23 million City matching contribution to the Hudson River Park Trust not currently reflected in the 2019-2023 Capital Commitment Plan. The Financial Plan also does not reflect potential Medicaid cuts, up to $190 million Statewide in
each of State fiscal years 2020 and 2021, authorized, but not required, by the State 2020 Budget. The City’s share of the Medicaid budget is estimated to be one sixth of the State-wide share. It is not known whether such cuts will be made and
if so, in what amounts.</div> <div>The State 2020 Budget also
includes legislation authorizing cuts of up to 1% to local assistance payments if the State Budget Director reasonably anticipates a year end shortfall of $500 million or more in the State general fund. Upon such determination, the State Budget
Director’s proposed cuts would be subject to approval of the State legislature, which would have 30 days to propose its own cuts.</div>
<div>The State 2020 Budget also includes enactment of congestion
tolling for vehicles entering a designated congestion zone in Manhattan below 60th Street, with a start date no earlier than December 31, 2020, the revenues from which will be directed to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (“MTA”)
for transit improvements. Details of the plan, including pricing and the start date, have yet to be determined. In addition, the State 2020 Budget includes legislation authorizing the imposition of sales tax on certain additional internet sales and
providing that sales tax revenues in the amount of $127.5 million in State fiscal year 2020 (reflecting the portion of the year in which it is effective) and $170 million in State fiscal year 2021 and thereafter increasing by one percent per year,
will be directed to the MTA for transit improvements. Revenues from such additional sales tax are currently estimated to be approximately $170 million per year and are in addition to existing sales taxes attributable to certain other internet
transactions. The State 2020 Budget also includes legislation increasing real estate transfer taxes on properties valued at more than $2 million, which will also be directed to the MTA for transit improvements.</div>
<div>Although the Financial Plan reflects the projected direct
impact to City tax revenues of the Federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) which, among other provisions, lowered corporate and personal income tax rates and limited the deductibility of state and local taxes and mortgage
interest, it does not reflect the indirect impacts of the TCJA. Such indirect impacts include the effect of State legislation which, among other things, increases the opportunities for charitable contributions, and provides an option to employers to
shift to an employer compensation tax and reduce State personal income taxes, the effect of which is uncertain at this time. In addition, local legislation has been introduced in the City Council that would establish a City-operated charity to which
taxpayers could contribute in exchange for a credit against property taxes, with the intent of permitting those taxpayers to deduct those contributions from federal income tax. Money received by the charity would be used for City operations. The
State has passed legislation permitting municipalities to create charitable funds allowing a local property tax credit of 95% of the contribution. The Internal Revenue Service has issued proposed rules that would make such credits ineligible for
federal tax deductions in most cases.</div> <div>The Financial Plan
does not reflect future increases in the charter school per-pupil tuition rate, which if not offset by changes to State education aid to the City that occur each year during the State budget process, are preliminarily estimated to cost the City $119
million in fiscal year 2020, $281 million in fiscal year 2021, $478 million in fiscal year 2022, and $758 million in fiscal year 2023. These figures are based on preliminary data. Final figures that would determine the actual costs to the City will
not be finalized until the time of the State budget process for the applicable year.</div>
<div>The Preliminary Ten Year Capital Strategy covering fiscal
years 2020-2029 was released on February 7, 2019, reflecting a total cost of $104.1 billion. Among many other projects, the Preliminary Ten Year Capital Strategy reflects $2 billion for the reconstruction of the Brooklyn Queens Expressway Triple
Cantilever reconstruction project and $1.1 billion (including amounts in fiscal year 2019) for the replacement of the Rikers Island jails complex with a system of borough based jails. The ultimate cost of such projects is uncertain at this time but
is expected to be significantly higher than amounts currently provided in the Preliminary Ten Year Capital Strategy.</div>
<div>The Financial Plan assumes that the City’s direct costs
(including costs of New York City Health and Hospitals (“NYCHH”) and NYCHA) as a result of Superstorm Sandy (“Sandy”) will largely be paid from non- City sources, primarily the federal government.</div>
<div>The City receives significant funding from the federal
government for community development, social services, education and other purposes pursuant to various federal programs. The federal government has made and discussed a number of proposals which would lead to reductions in existing federal spending
programs, including Medicaid, the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, reduction of funding for housing, including public housing, and changes to regulations affecting numerous industries in the City, including the financial services industry. The
TCJA and other federal actions and proposed legislation could also affect the State budget and economy, which could have an impact on the City. It is not possible at this</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>time to predict the form such proposals will ultimately take and, when taken
as a whole, the effect they will have on the City’s economy and the Financial Plan.</div>
<div>From time to time, the City Comptroller, the Control Board
staff, the Office of the State Deputy Comptroller for the City of New York (“OSDC”), the Independent Budget Office (“IBO”) and others issue reports and make public statements regarding the City’s financial condition,
commenting on, among other matters, the City’s financial plans, projected revenues and expenditures and actions by the City to eliminate projected operating deficits. It is reasonable to expect that reports and statements will continue to be
issued and may contain different perspectives on the City’s budget and economy and may engender public comment. For information on reports issued on the Financial Plan by the City Comptroller and others reviewing, commenting on and identifying
various risks therein, see “Certain Reports” herein.</div>
<div>Job Growth<font>. The City is a
leading center for the banking and securities industry, life insurance, communications, fashion design, health care, education, technology, information services, hospitality and retail fields. Over the past two decades the City has experienced a
number of business cycles. From 1992 to 2000, the City added 456,500 private sector jobs (growth of 17%). From 2000 to 2003, the City lost 173,200 private sector jobs (decline of 5%). From 2003 to 2008, the City added 257,600 private sector jobs
(growth of 9%). From 2008 to 2009, the City lost 103,100 private sector jobs (decline of 3%). From 2009 to 2018, the City added 818,400 private sector jobs (growth of 26%). All such changes are based on average annual employment levels through and
including the years referenced.</font></div> <div>As of February
2019, total employment in the City was 4,569,400 compared to 4,493,000 in February 2018, an increase of approximately 1.7% based on data provided by the New York State Department of Labor, which is not seasonally adjusted.</div>
<div>Assumptions<font>. Financial Plan is
based on numerous assumptions, including the condition of the City’s and the region’s economies and the concomitant receipt of economically sensitive tax revenues in the amounts projected. The Financial Plan is subject to various other
uncertainties and contingencies relating to, among other factors, the extent, if any, to which wage increases for City employees exceed the annual wage costs assumed; realization of projected earnings for pension fund assets and current assumptions
with respect to wages for City employees affecting the City’s required pension fund contributions; the willingness and ability of the State to provide the aid contemplated by the Financial Plan and to take various other actions to assist the
City; the ability of NYCHH and other such entities to maintain balanced budgets; the willingness of the federal government to provide the amount of federal aid contemplated in the Financial Plan; the impact on City revenues and expenditures of
federal and State legislation affecting Medicare or other entitlement programs; adoption of the City’s budgets by the City Council in substantially the forms submitted by the Mayor; the ability of the City to implement cost reduction
initiatives, and the success with which the City controls expenditures; the impact of conditions in the real estate market on real estate tax revenues; and the ability of the City and other financing entities to market their securities successfully
in the public credit markets. Certain of these assumptions are reviewed in reports issued by the City Comptroller and other public officials. See “Certain Reports” herein.</font></div>
<div>The projections and assumptions contained in the Financial
Plan are subject to revision, which may be substantial. No assurance can be given that these estimates and projections, which include actions the City expects will be taken but are not within the City’s control, will be realized.</div>
<div>Real Estate Tax<font>. Projections
of real estate tax revenues are based on a number of assumptions, including, among others, assumptions relating to the tax rate, the assessed valuation of the City’s taxable real estate, the delinquency rate, debt service needs, a reserve for
uncollectible taxes and the operating limit.</font></div>
<div>Projections of real estate tax revenues include net revenues
from the sale of real property tax liens of $50 million in fiscal year 2019 and $80 million in each of fiscal years 2020 through 2023. Projections of real estate tax revenues include the effects of the STAR Program which will reduce the real estate
tax revenues by an estimated $181 million in fiscal year 2018. Projections of real estate tax revenues reflect the estimated cost of extending the current tax reduction for owners of cooperative and condominium apartments amounting to $581 million,
$577 million, $606 million, $631 million and $657 million in fiscal years 2019 through 2023, respectively.</div>
<div>The delinquency rate was 1.4% in fiscal year 2014, 1.6% in
fiscal year 2015, 1.4% in fiscal year 2016,1.3% in fiscal year 2017 and 1.2% in fiscal year 2018. The Financial Plan projects delinquency rates of 1.3% in fiscal year 2019 and 1.8% in each of fiscal years 2020 through 2023, respectively, and 1.9% in
fiscal year 2022.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>On April 24, 2017, a lawsuit was filed challenging the
City’s real property tax system and valuation methodology. The action alleges that the City’s real property tax system violates the State and federal constitutions as well as the Fair Housing Act. The action further alleges the valuation
methodology as mandated by certain provisions of the State Real Property Tax Law results in a disparity and inequality in the amount of taxes paid by black and Hispanic Class 1 property owners and renters. The City plans to mount a vigorous defense
against all claims made in the action.</div> <div>Other Taxes<font>. The Financial Plan reflects the following assumptions regarding projected baseline revenues from Other Taxes: (i) with respect to the personal income tax, revenue declines in fiscal year 2019 reflecting a return to
more typical levels after the high growth in fiscal year 2018 reflecting the impact of changes in State law, stronger than expected bonus growth and continued employment and wage gains, and growth in fiscal years 2020 through 2023 reflecting steady
economic growth; (ii) with respect to the business corporation tax, strong growth in fiscal year 2019 supported by healthy levels of corporate profits in part the result of additional corporate investments propagated from the Federal business tax
cuts, a decline in growth in fiscal year 2020 reflecting a decline in Wall Street profitability and a slowing economy, weak growth for fiscal years 2021 through 2023 reflecting a slowdown in corporate profits; (iii) with respect to the
unincorporated business income tax, growth declines in fiscal year 2019 following the strong growth seen the prior year (the result of the repatriation of non-qualified deferred compensation and taxpayer behavior in response to the TCJA), growth
rebounds for fiscal years 2020 following the prior year’s growth decline; and mild growth in fiscal years 2021 through fiscal year 2023 reflecting steady economic growth; (iv) with respect to the sales tax, moderate growth in fiscal year 2019
reflecting employment gains, wage growth and tourist consumption reduced by the payment to the State of $150 million in sales tax otherwise payable to the City in order to provide the State with the benefit of savings from the refinancing of debt by
STAR Corp., moderate growth continues in fiscal year 2020 reflecting employment gains and wage growth, continued healthy levels of tourist consumption, as well as the lack of payment of sales tax to the State relating to STAR Corp. (payments to the
State will conclude in fiscal year 2019); and modest growth in fiscal years 2021 through 2023 reflecting steady economic growth; (v) with respect to real property transfer tax, growth in 2019 reflecting strength in large commercial transactions,
decline in 2020 as the volume of large commercial transactions drops from the high levels seen in the prior years; growth in fiscal years 2021 through 2023 reflecting steady economic growth; (vi) with respect to mortgage recording tax, growth in
2019 mirroring strength in large commercial transaction activity, decline in 2020 as the volume of large commercial transactions drops; growth in fiscal years 2021 through 2023 reflecting steady economic growth; and (vii) with respect to the
commercial rent tax, growth in 2019 reflecting employment gains, decline in 2020 reflecting a recently enacted tax program that increased the base rent subject to tax providing relief for tax payers; growth in fiscal years 2021 through 2023, as the
local office market improves with employment gains.</font></div>
<div>Intergovernmental Aid<font>. For its
normal operations, the City depends on aid from the State both to enable the City to balance its budget and to meet its cash requirements. There can be no assurance that there will not be delays or reductions in State aid to the City from amounts
currently projected; that State budgets for future State fiscal years will be adopted by the April 1 statutory deadline, or interim appropriations will be enacted; or that any such reductions or delays will not have adverse effects on the
City’s cash flow or expenditures. In addition, the City has made various assumptions with respect to federal aid. Future federal actions or inactions could have adverse effects on the City’s cash flow or revenues.</font></div>
<div>Personal Service Costs and Other Post-Employment Benefits<font>. The Financial Plan projects that the authorized number of City-funded full-time and full-time equivalent employees will increase from an estimated level of 280,333 as of June 30, 2019 to an estimated level of 281,120
by June 30, 2023</font></div> <div>Other Fringe Benefits includes
$2.486 billion, $2.626 billion, $2.718 billion, $2.856 billion and $3.010 billion in fiscal years 2019 through 2023, respectively, for post-employment benefits other than pensions (“OPEB”) expenditures for current retirees, which costs
are currently paid by the City on a pay-as-you-go basis.</div>
<div>The Financial Plan reflects recent contract settlements with
DC 37 and the UFT (which, together, represent approximately 62% of the City’s workforce) and the application of the pattern increases established in those settlements to the entire workforce over a 43-month contract period. The pattern
framework provides for a 2% wage increase on the first month of the contract, a 2.25% wage increase on the 13th month, and a 3% wage increase on the 26th month. The pattern also provides funding equivalent to 0.25% of wages to be used to fund
benefit items. The DC 37 Settlement covers the period from September 26, 2017 through May 25, 2021. The UFT Settlement covers the period from February 14, 2019 through September 13, 2022. Such settlements also include health insurance savings as
part of a new Municipal Labor Committee (“MLC”) agreement (the “MLC Agreement”), in addition to those previously agreed upon. Negotiations with unsettled unions are ongoing. The PBA has filed for arbitration with the City
over new contract terms.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>The amounts in the Financial Plan reflect the offsets from
health insurance savings of $200 million in fiscal year 2019, $300 million in fiscal year 2020, and $600 million in fiscal year 2021 and thereafter. These savings are pursuant to the MLC Agreement. The City has the right to enforce the agreement
through a binding arbitration process. If total health insurance savings in fiscal year 2021 are greater than $600 million, the first $68 million of such additional savings will be used by the City to make a $100 per member per year increase to
welfare funds effective July 1, 2021. If a savings amount over $600 million but less than $668 million is achieved, the $100 per member per year increase will be prorated. Any savings thereafter are to be divided equally between the City and the
unions. These savings are in addition to the $3.4 billion of health insurance savings the City achieved in fiscal years 2015 through 2018, $1.3 billion of which are recurring, which were negotiated pursuant to a previous MLC agreement.</div>
<div>Administrative Other Than Personal Services Costs
(“OTPS”) and Energy<font>. The Financial Plan contains estimates of the City’s administrative OTPS expenditures for general supplies and materials, equipment and selected contractual services, and the
impact of agency gap-closing actions relating to such expenditures in the 2019 fiscal year. Thereafter, to account for inflation, administrative OTPS expenditures are projected to rise by 2.5% annually in fiscal years 2020 through 2023. Energy costs
for each of the 2019 through 2023 fiscal years are assumed to vary annually, with total energy expenditures projected at $906 million in fiscal year 2019 and increasing to $995 million by fiscal year 2023.</font></div>
<div>Public Assistance<font>. Of total
cash assistance expenditures in the City, the City-funded portion is projected to be $640 million in fiscal year 2019 and $719 million in each of fiscal years 2020 through 2023.</font></div>
<div>Medical Assistance<font>. Medical
assistance payments projected in the Financial Plan consist of payments to voluntary hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, intermediate care facilities, home care providers, pharmacies, managed care organizations, physicians and other medical
practitioners. The City-funded portion of medical assistance payments is estimated at $5.8 billion for the 2019 fiscal year.</font></div>
<div>The City-funded portion of medical assistance payments is
expected to be $5.8 billion in each of fiscal years 2020 through 2023. Such payments include the City’s capped share of local Medicaid expenditures as well as Supplemental Medicaid payments to NYCHH.</div>
<div>New York City Health and Hospitals (“NYCHH”)<font>. NYCHH, which provides essential services to over 1.1 million New Yorkers annually, faces near- and long-term financial challenges resulting from, among other things, changes in hospital reimbursement under the
Affordable Care Act and the statewide transition to managed care. On April 26, 2016, the City released “One New York: Health Care for Our Neighborhoods,” a report outlining the City’s plan to address NYCHH’s financial
shortfall.</font></div> <div>In February 2019, NYCHH released a
cash-based financial plan, which projected City-funded expenditures of $784 million, $998 million, $1.0 billion, $1.1 billion, and $1.1 billion in fiscal years 2019 through 2023, respectively, in addition to the forgiveness of debt service and the
City’s contribution to supplemental Medicaid payments which is consistent with the City’s Financial Plan. NYCHH’s financial plan projected total receipts of $8.5 billion, $7.9 billion, $7.8 billion, $7.8 billion, and $7.8 billion,
and total disbursements of $8.4 billion, $7.8 billion, $7.9 billion, $8.1 billion, and $8.2 billion in fiscal years 2019 through 2023, respectively.</div>
<div>NYCHH relies on significant projected revenue from Medicaid,
Medicare and other third-party payor programs. Future changes to such programs could have adverse impacts on NYCHH’s financial condition.</div>
<div>Other<font>. The projections set
forth in the Financial Plan for OTPS-Other include the City’s contributions to New York City Transit (“NYCT”), NYCHA, City University of New York (“CUNY”) and subsidies to libraries and various cultural institutions.
They also include projections for the cost of future judgments and claims which are discussed below under “Judgments and Claims.” In the past, the City has provided additional assistance to certain Covered Organizations which had
exhausted their financial resources prior to the end of the fiscal year. No assurance can be given that similar additional assistance will not be required in the future.</font></div>
<div>New York City Transit<font>. NYCT
operates under its own section of the Financial Plan as a Covered Organization. The financial plan for NYCT covering its 2018 through 2022 fiscal years was prepared in November 2018. The NYCT fiscal year coincides with the calendar year. The NYCT
financial plan projects City assistance to the NYCT operating budget of $627.4 million in 2018, decreasing to $410.9 million in 2022; 2018 assistance includes $254.0 million in City funding for the Subway Action Plan, the MTA’s emergency plan
to address subway delays, which is expected to be funded through a separate revenue</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>stream starting in 2019. In addition, the NYCT financial plan projects real
estate transfer tax revenue dedicated for NYCT use of $681.3 million in 2018, decreasing to $656.9 million in 2022.</div>
<div>The NYCT financial plan includes reforecasts of baseline
revenue reflecting current declining ridership trends and baseline cost increases. Further, the NYCT financial plan contains increased costs for subway car upkeep and maintenance. Based on OMB review and analysis, the NYCT accrual-based financial
plan reflects $10.9 billion in revenues and $14.1 billion in expenses for 2018, leaving a budget gap of $3.3 billion. After accounting for accrual adjustments and cash carried over from 2017, accrual-based operating budget gaps of $150.5 million in
2018, $558.0 million in 2019, $1.4 billion in 2020, $2.6 billion in 2021, and $3.9 billion in 2022 are projected. On February 25, 2019, an updated financial plan for NYCT, covering fiscal years 2018 through 2022, was released, which is currently
being reviewed by OMB.</div> <div>In 2009, a Payroll Mobility Tax
(“PMT”) was enacted into State law to provide $0.34 for every $100 of payroll in the MTA’s twelve-county service area. The PMT is currently expected to raise revenues for the MTA in the amount of $812.1 million in 2018, increasing
to $895.4 million in 2022</div> <div>In September 2014, the MTA
proposed the 2015-2019 Capital Program. The proposed plan included $32.0 billion for all MTA agencies, including $17.1 billion to be invested in the NYCT core system, and $1.5 billion for NYCT network expansion. On October 2, 2014, the Capital
Program Review Board (“CPRB”) vetoed the proposed program without prejudice to permit additional time to resolve issues related to fully funding the program. On October 28, 2015, the MTA Board voted on and approved a revised 2015-2019
Capital Program. The revised plan included $29.0 billion for all MTA agencies, including $15.8 billion to be invested in the NYCT core system and $535 million for NYCT network expansion. On April 20, 2016, the MTA Board voted on and approved another
revised 2015-2019 Capital Program, which included $29.5 billion for all MTA agencies, including $15.8 billion to be invested in the NYCT core system and $535 million for NYCT network expansion. On April 20, 2016, the MTA Board voted on and approved
another revised 2015-2019 Capital Program, which included $29.5 billion for all MTA agencies, including $15.8 billion to be invested in the NYCT core system and $1.0 billion for NYCT network expansion. The additional City capital funding will be
provided concurrently with the additional State capital funding. On May 24, 2017, the MTA Board voted on and approved a revised 2015-2019 Capital Program. The revised plan includes $32.5 billion for all MTA agencies, including $16.3 billion to be
invested in the NYCT core system and $1.7 billion for NYCT network expansion. This amendment was approved by the CPRB in July 2017. On December 13, 2017 the MTA Board voted on and approved a further revised 2015-2019 Capital Program. The revised
plan includes $32.8 billion for all MTA agencies, including $16.7 billion to be invested in the NYCT core system and $1.7 billion for NYCT network expansion. This amendment was not subject to CPRB approval. The 2015-2019 Capital Program expects $8.5
billion from the State. On April 25, 2018 the MTA Board voted on and approved a further revised 2015-2019 Capital Program. The revised plan includes $33.3 billion for all MTA agencies, including $16.7 billion to be invested in the NYCT core system
and $1.7 billion for NYCT network expansion. This amendment was approved by the CPRB in May 2018. On November 15, 2018, the MTA released its 2019 Financial Plan, which is subject to MTA Board approval in December 2018.</div>
<div>The State has agreed to contribute $8.6 billion towards the
2015-2019 Capital Program, which has not yet been fully reflected in the State’s capital plan. The City has agreed to contribute $2.7 billion (which has not yet been fully reflected in the City’s capital plan), including $164 million for
the Subway Action Plan. The additional City capital funding will be provided concurrently with the additional State capital funding.</div>
<div>On June 29, 2017 Governor Cuomo announced the State would be
increasing its contribution to the 2015-2019 Capital Program by $1 billion and signed an Executive Order declaring a State-wide disaster emergency related to the MTA. The Order temporarily suspends provisions of Public Authority, State Finance, and
Environmental Conservation Laws if compliance “would prevent, hinder or delay action necessary to cope with the disaster.” The Governor has not provided additional details or identified additional funding for the $1 billion.</div>
<div>Various actions have been taken to increase funding to the MTA
for NYCT. The State budget for State fiscal year 2019, adopted on March 30, 2018, includes a requirement for the City to provide payments totaling an additional $418.0 million to the MTA through calendar year 2018 to fund the Subway Action Plan
described above, which is reflected in the Financial Plan, including $164.0 million in capital funding, as discussed above, and $254.0 million in expense funding. The State budget for State fiscal year 2019 also imposes an additional surcharge,
which was slated to start January 1, 2019, on for-hire vehicles and taxis traveling below 96th Street in Manhattan, to be used to fund the Subway Action Plan and other MTA projects. In December 2018, a lawsuit was filed in New York State Supreme

<div>surcharge and a temporary restraining order was issued blocking the
surcharge. In January 2019, the court lifted the temporary restraining order and allowed collection of the surcharge to begin on February 4, 2019, pending the outcome of the litigation.</div>
<div>The State 2020 Budget includes enactment of congestion tolling
for vehicles entering a designated congestion zone in Manhattan below 60th Street, with a start date no earlier than December 31, 2020, the revenues from which will be directed to the MTA for transit improvements. Details of the plan, including
pricing and the start date, have yet to be determined. In addition, the State 2020 Budget includes legislation authorizing the imposition of sales tax on certain additional internet sales and providing that sales tax revenues in the amount of $127.5
million in State fiscal year 2020 (reflecting the portion of the year in which it is effective) and $170 million in State fiscal year 2021 and thereafter increasing by one percent per year, will be directed to the MTA for transit improvements.
Revenues from such additional sales tax are currently estimated to be approximately $170 million per year and are in addition to existing sales taxes attributable to certain other internet transactions. The State 2020 Budget also includes
legislation increasing real estate transfer taxes on properties valued at more than $2 million, which will also be directed to the MTA for transit improvements.</div>
<div>Department of Education<font>. State
law requires the City to provide City funds for the Department of Education (“DOE”) each year in an amount not less than the amount appropriated for the preceding fiscal year, excluding amounts for debt service and pensions for the DOE.
Such City funding must be maintained, unless total City funds for the fiscal year are estimated to be lower than in the preceding fiscal year, in which case the mandated City funding for the DOE may be reduced by an amount up to the percentage
reduction in total City funds.</font></div> <div>Judgments and Claims<font>. In the fiscal year ended on June 30, 2018, the City expended $730.4 million for judgments and claims. The Financial Plan includes provisions for judgments and claims of $697.0 million, $711.9 million, $727.1 million,
$742.3 million and $758.2 million for the 2019 through 2023 fiscal years, respectively. These projections incorporate a substantial amount of claims costs attributed to NYCHH, estimated to be $140 million in each year of the Financial Plan, for
which NYCHH reimburses the City unless otherwise forgiven by the City, which was the case in fiscal years 2013 and 2016. The City is a party to numerous lawsuits and is the subject of numerous claims and investigations. The City has estimated that
its potential future liability on account of outstanding claims against it as of June 30, 2018 amounted to approximately $6.7 billion. This estimate was made by categorizing the various claims and applying a statistical model, based primarily on
actual settlements by type of claim during the preceding ten fiscal years, and by supplementing the estimated liability with information supplied by the City’s Corporation Counsel.</font></div>
<div>In addition to the above claims, numerous real estate tax
certiorari proceedings involving allegations of inequality of assessment, illegality and overvaluation are currently pending against the City. The City’s Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 include an estimate that the
City’s liability in the certiorari proceedings, as of June 30, 2018, could amount to approximately $1.208 billion. Provision has been made in the Financial Plan for estimated refunds of $400 million in fiscal years 2019 through 2022,
respectively.</div> <div>Certain Reports<font>. Set forth below are the summaries of the most recent reports of the City Comptroller, OSDC and the staff of the Control Board. These summaries do not purport to be comprehensive or definitive.</font></div>
<div>On March 6, 2019, the City Comptroller released a report
entitled “Comments on New York City’s Preliminary Budget for Fiscal Year 2020 and Financial Plan for Fiscal Years 2019-2023.” In the report, the City Comptroller projects net additional resources of $160 million, $249 million, $285
million and $117 million in fiscal years 2019, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively, as well as a net risk of $1 million in fiscal year 2020, which when added to the results projected in the Financial Plan, would result in a budget surplus of
approximately $160 million in fiscal year 2019 and gaps of approximately $1 million, $3.27 billion, $2.65 billion and $3.18 billion in fiscal years 2020 through 2023, respectively.</div>
<div>The differences from the Financial Plan projections result in
part from the City Comptroller’s net expenditure projections, which are lower than the Financial Plan projections by $107 million in fiscal year 2019, and higher than the Financial Plan projections by $459 million, $755 million, $952 million
and $1.23 billion in fiscal years 2020 through 2023, respectively, as a result of: (i) additional overtime expenditures of $193 million in fiscal year 2019, $122 million in fiscal year 2020 and $150 million in each of fiscal years 2021 through 2023;
(ii) increased expenditures associated with increases in charter school tuition rates of $119 million, $281 million, $478 million and $758 million in fiscal years 2020 through 2023, respectively; (iii) uncertainty of federal Medicaid reimbursement
for special education services of $20 million in each of fiscal years 2019 through 2023; (iv) increased expenditures associated with payments to parents who legally seek reimbursement for placing special needs children in non-public schools of $80
million in each of fiscal years 2019 through 2023; (v) increased</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>expenditures to fund the Fair Fares program of $106 million in fiscal year
2020 and $212 million in each of fiscal years 2021 through 2023; and (vi) increased homeless shelter operation expenditures of $12 million in each of fiscal years 2020 through 2023. The report also projects (i) decreased expenditures of $50 million
in fiscal year 2019 to fund the Fair Fares program; (ii) anticipated debt service savings from low interest rates on variable rate bonds of $50 million in fiscal year 2019; and (iii) decreased expenditures of $300 million in fiscal year 2019 due to
the assumption that the $300 million fiscal year 2019 general reserve in the Financial Plan will not be needed for budget balance.</div>
<div>The differences from the Financial Plan projections also
result from the City Comptroller’s net revenue projections, which are higher than the Financial Plan projections by $53 million, $458 million, $1.00 billion, $1.24 billion and $1.35 billion in fiscal years 2019 through 2023, respectively. The
report projects: (i) property tax revenues will be higher by $200 million, $387 million, $735 million and $1.09 billion in fiscal years 2020 through 2023, respectively; (ii) personal income tax revenues will be higher by $49 million, $88 million and
$46 million in fiscal years 2020 through 2022, respectively; (iii) business tax revenues will be higher by $145 million, $9 million, and $31 million in fiscal years 2019, 2022 and 2023, respectively; (iv) sales tax revenues will be higher by $77
million, $158 million, $165 million, $150 million and $107 million in fiscal years 2019 through 2023, respectively; (v) real-estate-related tax revenues will be higher by $108 million, $166 million and $82 million in fiscal years 2020 through 2022,
respectively; (vi) revenues from audit collections will be higher by $179 million in each of fiscal years 2021 through 2023; (vii) Environmental Control Board fine revenues will be higher by $4 million, $13 million, $13 million, $19 million and $19
million in fiscal years 2019 through 2023, respectively; (viii) Department of Buildings penalty revenues will be higher by $4 million in each of fiscal years 2019 and 2020 and $10 million in each of fiscal years 2021 through 2023; (ix) motor vehicle
fine revenues will be higher by $2 million in each of fiscal years 2019 through 2023; and (x) parking violation fine revenues will be higher by $8 million in fiscal year 2019 and $5 million in each of fiscal years 2020 through 2023. The report also
identifies certain risks to projected revenues that result in differences from the Financial Plan: (i) personal income tax revenues will be lower by $103 million and $59 million in fiscal years 2019 and 2023, respectively; (ii) business tax revenues
will be lower by $81 million and $11 million in fiscal years 2020 and 2021, respectively; and (iii) real-estate-related tax revenues will be lower by $84 million and $30 million in fiscal years 2019 and 2023, respectively.</div>
<div>On March 20, 2019, the OSDC released a report on the Financial
Plan. The report states that the Financial Plan projects a surplus of $3.2 billion in fiscal year 2019, which results mostly from a drawdown of unneeded reserves in fiscal year 2019, resources from the citywide savings program and
higher-than-expected revenues, and projects budget gaps in fiscal years 2021 through 2023 due to the cost of wage increases for the municipal work force, higher costs for debt service and health insurance, and an anticipated slowdown in job growth
and tax collections. The report notes that these out-year budget gaps are manageable under current conditions. The City’s economy continues to set records, benefitting from record tourism, continued job expansion, high consumer confidence and
increased wages. The City continues to post solid job gains although it expects job growth to slow.</div>
<div>The report also identifies a number of potential risks the
City may need to address during the Financial Plan period, noting that external risks are growing. The most immediate risk is the potential impact of the State budget, which includes a number of proposals that could have an adverse impact on the
Financial Plan. The largest risk to the Financial Plan remains the potential for an economic setback, which would make it more difficult to close the out-year budget gaps. The report also notes that the City’s pension fund investment earnings
have trailed expectations. The MTA is facing a crisis, and while it projects a balanced operating budget for fiscal year 2019, budget gaps remain in the years thereafter despite planned fare and toll increases. There is also still a risk of federal
budget cuts during the Financial Plan period given the growing federal deficit.</div>
<div>The OSDC report quantifies certain risks and offsets to the
Financial Plan. The report identifies net risks to the Financial Plan of $45 million in each of fiscal years 2019 and 2020 and $327 million in each of fiscal years 2021 through 2023. When combined with the results projected in the Financial Plan,
the report estimates budget gaps of $45 million in each of fiscal years 2019 and 2020 and $3.84 billion, $3.27 billion and $3.62 billion in fiscal years 2021 through 2023, respectively. The risks to the Financial Plan identified in the report
include: (i) increased pension contributions of $105 million in each of fiscal years 2019 and 2020; (ii) increased funding costs for the Department of Education of $170 million in each of fiscal years 2019 through 2023; (iii) increased uniform
services overtime costs of $70 million in each of fiscal years 2019 through 2023; and (iv) increased expenditures to fund the Fair Fares program of $212 million in each of fiscal years 2021 through 2023. The report also identifies: (i) additional
tax revenues of $225 million and $125 million in fiscal years 2019 and 2020, respectively; (ii) additional miscellaneous revenues (including fines, license fees, water and sewer charges, and asset sales) of $75 million in fiscal year 2019 and $125
million in each of fiscal years 2020 through 2023; and (iii) additional debt services savings of $50 million in fiscal year 2020.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>On March 26, 2019, the staff of the Control Board issued a
report reviewing the Financial Plan. The report states the City has been able to manage the fiscal year 2019 budget to build a surplus to help balance next year’s budget despite a shortfall in personal income tax revenue, which was offset by
higher collections in the general corporation tax, and property and real estate related taxes. By minimizing new agency needs, reducing the general reserve, and adopting an agency savings program, the City was able to increase funds in the Budget
Stabilization Account in order to prepay fiscal year 2020 expenses and balance the fiscal year 2020 budget. The report states that the City will maintain a general reserve of at least $1 billion and a capital stabilization account of $250 million in
each of fiscal years 2019 through 2023. The report states the City will also create a $750 million program to eliminate the gap to be included in the Mayor’s fiscal year 2020 executive budget. The report identifies a number of concerns,
including economic concerns such as the Federal Reserve policy on interest rates, trade frictions, economic slowdowns in Europe and China, increasing federal deficits and borrowing and a possible pullback in domestic consumer spending, and the
possibility of actions that may be taken by the state and federal governments which could have an impact on the budget. The report states that if the City is able to develop actions with recurring savings in the program to eliminate the gap, it will
be able to manage its finances with the least service disruption, even if unforeseen events occur.</div>
<div>The report identifies net offsets to the Financial Plan of
$161 million and $196 million in fiscal years 2019 and 2020, respectively, and net risks of $184 million in each of fiscal years 2021 through 2023, resulting in estimated surpluses of $161 million and $196 million in fiscal years 2019 and 2020,
respectively, and estimated gaps of $3.70 billion, $3.12 billion and $3.48 billion in fiscal years 2021 through 2023, respectively. Such net risks and offsets result from: (i) increased nonproperty tax revenues of $150 million in each of fiscal
years 2019 and 2020; (ii) increased miscellaneous revenues of $40 million in fiscal year 2019 and $100 million in each of fiscal years 2020 through 2023; (iii) increased expenditures to fund the Fair Fares program of $212 million in each of fiscal
years 2021 through 2023; and (iv) increased uniform services overtime expenses of $29 million and $54 million in fiscal years 2019 and 2020, respectively, and $72 million in each of fiscal years 2021 through 2023.</div>
<div>Outstanding General Obligation Indebtedness<font>. As of March 31, 2019, approximately $37.64 billion of City general obligation bonds were outstanding.</font></div>
<div>Currently, the Hudson Yards Infrastructure Corporation
(“HYIC”) has outstanding $2.72 billion aggregate principal amount of bonds. In addition, HYIC has entered into a term loan facility with Bank of America, N.A. pursuant to which HYIC may draw up to an aggregate amount of $350 million,
none of which has been drawn. The bonds financed the extension of the Number 7 subway line and other public improvements in the Hudson Yards area, and the term loan will be used to finance any remaining costs of completion of the original project
and the expansion of the park in the Hudson Yards area. HYIC’s bonds and, on a subordinate basis, draws under the term loan facility are secured by and payable from payments in lieu of taxes and other revenues generated by development in the
Hudson Yards area. However, HYIC expects to repay amounts drawn under the term loan facility with the proceeds of its long-term bonds prior to maturity on June 30, 2022. To the extent payments in lieu of taxes and other HYIC revenues are
insufficient to pay interest on the HYIC bonds or the term loan, the City has agreed to pay the amount of any shortfall in interest, subject to appropriation. The Financial Plan provides $0 in fiscal years 2019 through 2023 for such interest support
payments. The City has no obligation to pay the principal of such bonds or of such term loan.</div>
<div>Water and Sewer<font>. The
City’s financing program includes the issuance of water and sewer revenue bonds by the Water Authority which is authorized to issue bonds to finance capital investment in the City’s water and sewer system. Pursuant to State law, debt
service on Water Authority indebtedness is secured by water and sewer fees paid by users of the water and sewer system. Such fees are revenues of the Water Board, which holds a lease interest in the City’s water and sewer system. After
providing for debt service on obligations of the Water Authority and certain incidental costs, the revenues of the Water Board are paid to the City to cover the City’s costs of operating the water and sewer system and as rental for the system.
Beginning in fiscal year 2017, the City has not requested the rental payment due to the City from the Water Board. The City’s Preliminary Ten-Year Capital Strategy applicable to the City’s water and sewer system covering fiscal years
2020 through 2029, projects City-funded water and sewer investment (which is expected to be financed with proceeds of Water Authority debt) at approximately $19.3 billion. The 2019-2023 Capital Commitment Plan reflects total anticipated City-funded
water and sewer commitments of $13.1 billion which are expected to be financed with the proceeds of Water Authority debt.</font></div>
<div>New York City Transitional Finance Authority<font>. The TFA is authorized to have outstanding $13.5 billion of Future Tax Secured Bonds (excluding Recovery Bonds). The TFA may have outstanding Future Tax Secured Bonds in excess of $13.5 billion provided that the amount
of the Future Tax Secured Bonds, together with the amount of indebtedness contracted by the City,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>do not exceed the debt limit of the City. Future Tax Secured Bonds are issued
for general City capital purposes and are secured by the City’s personal income tax revenues and, to the extent such revenues do not satisfy specified debt ratios, sales tax revenues. In addition, the TFA is authorized to have outstanding $9.4
billion of Building Aid Revenue Bonds to pay for a portion of the City’s five-year educational facilities capital plan. Building Aid Revenue Bonds are secured by State building aid, which the Mayor has assigned to the TFA. The Financial Plan
reflects the issuance of $500 million, $103 million, $31 million, $78 million and $25 million of Building Aid Revenue Bonds by TFA in fiscal years 2019 through 2023.</div>
<div>Implementation of the financing program is dependent upon the
ability of the City and other financing entities to market their securities successfully in the public credit markets which will be subject to prevailing market conditions at the times of sale. No assurance can be given that the credit markets will
absorb the projected amounts of public bond sales. A significant portion of bond financing is used to reimburse the City’s General Fund for capital expenditures already incurred. If the City and such other entities are unable to sell such
amounts of bonds, it would have an adverse effect on the City’s cash position. In addition, the need of the City to fund future debt service costs from current operations may also limit the City’s capital program. The Preliminary
Ten-Year Capital Strategy for fiscal years 2020 through 2029 totals $104.1 billion, of which approximately 94% is to be financed with funds borrowed by the City and such other entities. Congressional developments affecting federal taxation generally
could reduce the market value of tax-favored investments and increase the debt-service costs of carrying out the major portion of the City’s capital plan which is currently eligible for tax-exempt financing.</div>
<div>New York State</div>
<div>New York is the fourth most populous state in the nation,
after California, Texas, and Florida, and has a relatively high level of personal wealth. The State’s economy is diverse, with a comparatively large share of the nation’s financial activities, information, education, and health services
employment, and a very small share of the nation’s farming and mining activity. The State’s location and its air transport facilities and natural harbors have made it an important hub for international commerce. Travel and tourism
constitute an important part of the economy. Like the rest of the nation, New York has a declining proportion of its workforce engaged in manufacturing, and an increasing proportion engaged in service industries.</div>
<div>Manufacturing employment continues to decline as a share of
total State employment, as in most other states, and as a result New York’s economy is less reliant on this sector than in the past. However, it remains an important sector of the State economy, particularly for the upstate region, which hosts
high concentrations of manufacturers of transportation and other types of equipment. As defined under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), the trade, transportation, and utilities supersector accounts for the second largest
component of State nonagricultural employment, but only the fifth largest when measured by wage share. This sector accounts for proportionally less employment and wages for the State than for the nation as a whole. New York City is the
nation’s leading center of banking and finance and, hence this is a far more important sector for the State than for the nation as a whole. Although this sector accounts for less than one-tenth of all nonagricultural jobs in the State, it
contributes about one-fifth of total wages. The remaining service-producing sectors include information, professional and business services, private education and healthcare, leisure and hospitality services, and other services. Combined, these
industries account for half of all nonagricultural jobs in New York. Information, education and health, and other services account for a higher proportion of total State employment than for the nation. Farming is an important part of the
State’s rural economy, although it constitutes only about 0.2 percent of total State output. Principal agricultural products of the State include milk and dairy products, greenhouse and nursery products, fruits, and vegetables. New York ranks
among the nation’s leaders in the production of certain of these commodities.</div>
<div>Federal, State, and local governments together comprise the
third largest sector in terms of nonagricultural jobs, with the bulk of the employment accounted for by local governments. Public education is the source of about 40 percent of total State and local government employment.</div>

The Annual Information Statement, dated July 2, 2018 (the “AIS”), reflects the State’s Enacted Budget Financial Plan (the “Enacted Budget Financial Plan”) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2019<sup>1</sup> and sets forth the State’s official Financial Plan projections for Fiscal Year 2019 through Fiscal Year 2022. The State updates the Annual

<td>The State fiscal year is

<div>Overview of the Updated Financial Plan<font>. The Governor submitted his FY 2020 Executive Budget proposal on January 15, 2019, and amendments through February 14, 2019 (the “Executive Budget”), as permitted by law. On February 15, 2019, the Division
of the Budget (DOB) issued the Updated Financial Plan which includes updated estimates for the current fiscal year (FY 2019), projections for FY 2020 through FY 2022, and initial projections for FY 2023. The estimates and projections included in the
Updated Financial Plan incorporate the impact of the Executive Budget legislative proposals.</font></div>
<div>The FY 2019 Personal Income Tax (PIT) collections through
January 2019, a period of the fiscal year that is typically marked by a relatively heavy flow of PIT receipts compared to the rest of the year, have been less than previously projected. Since the FY 2019 Enacted Budget Financial Plan, DOB has
reduced the annual estimate for All Funds PIT receipts by $2.8 billion in FY 2019 and $2.2 billion in FY 2020, due to weaker than expected PIT collections. DOB believes that the revisions are reasonable and consistent with available data, but there
can be no assurance that actual receipts collections will not vary materially and adversely from these revised estimates.</div>
<div>In addition to the revision to PIT receipts, the Updated
Financial Plan reflects the costs of a new labor contract with the union representing State correctional officers, whose members ratified a seven-year contract on January 24, 2019. The contract, which is patterned on the agreements of other State
employee unions, covers FY 2017 through FY 2023. The Updated Financial Plan expects that the Legislature will authorize the necessary retroactive payments for the contract period from April 1, 2016 through the present to be paid in FY 2019.</div>
<div>The Updated Financial Plan reflects a combination of
legislative and administrative actions to address the receipts shortfall and costs of the labor contract. DOB expects that the actions will be sufficient to maintain budget balance in the current year and ensure a balanced budget proposal for FY
2020.</div> <div><font>FY 2019
Financial Plan Update</font></div> <div>Receipts<font>. General Fund receipts, including transfers from other funds, are projected to total $68.5 billion in FY 2019, a decrease of $2.1 billion (3.0 percent) from FY 2018 results. The annual change is affected by taxpayer
behavior in response to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) by increasing current estimated payments in the final year of uncapped state and local tax (SALT) deductions. Specifically, FY 2019 receipts are negatively affected by an increase in
FY 2018 current estimated payments, at the expense of FY 2019 extensions. In addition, FY 2019 receipts are negatively affected by a decrease in FY 2019 current estimated payments, to the projected benefit of FY 2020 extensions.</font></div>
<div>General Fund PIT receipts, including transfers after payment
of debt service on State PIT Revenue Bonds, are expected to total $43.2 billion, a decrease of $3.8 billion from FY 2018 results. This decline is attributable to the shifting payment pattern and taxpayer behavior described above.</div>
<div>General Fund consumption/use tax receipts, including transfers
after payment of debt service on Local Government Assistance Corporation (LGAC) and Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, are estimated to total $13.5 billion, an annual increase of $278 million (2.1 percent) from FY 2018 results. This reflects projected growth
in disposable income and taxable consumption.</div> <div>General
Fund business tax receipts are estimated at $5.4 billion, an annual increase of $480 million (9.8 percent) from FY 2018 results. This growth is due to projected higher gross receipts due to a projected increase in corporate profits and various TCJA
flow-through impacts.</div> <div>Other tax receipts to the General
Fund are expected to total $2.0 billion after payment of debt service on Clean Water/Clean Air (CW/CA) bonds, a decrease of $246 million (10.8 percent). This decrease reflects a return to an average number of estate tax payments exceeding $25
million.</div> <div>Non-tax receipts are estimated at $4.4 billion,
an increase of $1.1 billion. The growth is mainly due to the expected transfer of resources from the Health Care Transformation Fund (HCTF) and the transfer of balances accumulated in other funds.</div> </div>

percent), mainly due to medical cost inflation. The State’s costs for Workers’ Compensation are expected to increase by $101 million, due to underlying growth in the average weekly wage benefit and medical costs ($51 million), as well as
a reduction in other resources available to offset those costs ($50 million).</div>
<div>General Fund transfers to other funds are estimated to total
$8.8 billion in FY 2019, a decrease of $661 million from FY 2018 results. The decline is mainly due to the timing of General Fund capital reimbursements from bond proceeds.</div>
<div><font>FY 2019 General Fund
Revisions</font></div> <div>Receipts Revisions<font>. General Fund receipts, including transfers from other funds, have been reduced by $2.0 billion compared to the Enacted Budget Financial Plan, largely due to weaker than expected PIT collections.</font></div>
<div>Two significant factors affect reported General Fund tax
receipts that are unrelated to actual collections. First, changes in debt service costs impact General Fund tax receipts. The State has three bonding programs where tax receipts are deposited into dedicated debt service funds (outside of the General
Fund) and used to make debt service payments on State-supported debt. After satisfying debt service requirements for these bonding programs, the residual is transferred back to the General Fund. Debt service costs in FY 2019 are projected to
increase by $645 million compared to the Enacted Budget Financial Plan, largely due to debt service prepayments, resulting in less tax revenue being transferred back to the General Fund. Second, the STAR program is funded from PIT receipts, with
changes in the cost of the program affecting reported PIT receipts. In FY 2019, the estimated cost of the STAR program has been lowered based on updated claims.</div>
<div>Miscellaneous receipts and transfers from other funds have
been increased mainly to reflect the transfer of excess balances identified by DOB and not needed to fund program commitments. Many of the transfers were planned in prior years but held aside when they were not needed. In addition, the State has
received $998 million in Extraordinary Monetary settlements since the Enacted Budget Financial Plan. Of this amount, $336 million will be used for operations in FY 2019. Other adjustments to non-tax receipts are based on results to date, updated
information and the transfer of balances accumulated in other funds.</div>
<div>Disbursements Revisions<font>.
General Fund disbursements, including transfers to other funds, have been reduced by $3.0 billion. The lower estimates reflect program-specific information and the cautious estimation of expenses in the General Fund to create an informal reserve
against risks. The estimates for Local Assistance and State Operations have been reduced for a range of programs and activities, based on updated data and operating results to date. Agency operations includes the expected payment of salary
increases, which includes retroactive payments for FY 2017 to the present, consistent with recently ratified labor contracts. These costs were previously planned and are expected to be offset by continued cost controls.</font></div>
<div>Capital transfers have been lowered due to the timing of
General Fund reimbursements of eligible capital expenses with bond proceeds. The increase in debt service is due to the planned prepayment of expenses. Other transfer revisions reflect routine adjustments to the timing of transactions.</div>
<div><font>FY 2019 Closing
Balance.</font></div> <div>DOB projects the State will end FY 2019
with a total General Fund cash balance of $6.5 billion, a decrease of $2.9 billion from the FY 2018 year-end balance. The General Fund closing balance excluding Extraordinary Monetary Settlements is estimated at $2.6 billion, or $1.8 billion lower
than the closing balance at the end of FY 2018. The change is due mostly to the expected use of the $1.9 billion in cash received in FY 2018. These funds are attributed to the acceleration of PIT payments in response</div> </div>

<div>to the Federal limit on SALT deductibility, which became effective January 1,
2018. In addition, the closing balance is reduced due to the use of the labor reserve to fund a portion of the NYSCOPBA contract.</div>
<div>Balances in the State’s principal “rainy
day” reserves, the Tax Stabilization Reserve and the Rainy Day Reserve, are expected to increase by $250 million after the planned deposit of a portion of new Extraordinary Monetary Settlements. The Updated Financial Plan maintains a reserve
of $500 million for debt management purposes, which DOB expects to use in FY 2020 to accelerate the repayment of amortized pension costs.</div>
<div>The balance of Extraordinary Monetary Settlements is expected
to total $3.9 billion at the close of FY 2019, a decrease of $1.1 billion from the close of FY 2018. The anticipated decrease reflects $1 billion in planned transfers to the Dedicated Infrastructure Investment Fund (DIIF) and other funds for
authorized purposes; $194 million in funding for the MTA’s Subway Action Plan; a $250 million deposit to rainy day reserves (the first of two planned deposits); and $719 million for operating expenses. These uses are offset in part by $1.2
billion in new Extraordinary Monetary Settlements received in FY 2019.</div>
<div><font>FY 2020 Financial
Plan</font></div> <div>Receipts<font>.
General Fund receipts, including transfers from other funds, are estimated to total $75.1 billion in FY 2020, an increase of $5.5 billion (7.9 percent) from FY 2019 projections. The annual change is affected by taxpayers responding to TCJA by
shifting estimated PIT payments typically made on a quarterly basis into the extension period. Specifically, FY 2020 receipts are positively affected by an increase in extension payments at the expense of FY 2019 estimated payments. In addition, the
year-over-year change is impacted by the payment of $500 million in additional PIT refunds in the last quarter of FY 2019.</font></div>
<div>PIT receipts, including transfers after payment of debt
service on PIT Revenue Bonds, are estimated to total $47.6 billion, an increase of $4.4 billion (10.2 percent) from FY 2019 projections. A large share of the increase is due to the change in timing of PIT receipts whereby a large amount of receipts
was shifted from FY 2019 to FY 2018. Thus, the FY 2020 receipts grow from a lower base. In addition, the accelerated refunds described above also impact year-over-year growth.</div>
<div>Consumption/use tax receipts, including transfers after
payment of debt service on LGAC and Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, are estimated to total $14.5 billion in FY 2020, an increase of $1 billion (7.4 percent) from FY 2019 projections. The increase mainly reflects projected growth in disposable income and
taxable consumption.</div> <div>Business tax receipts are estimated
at $6.2 billion in FY 2020, an increase of $767 million (14.2 percent) from FY 2019 projections. The growth is primarily attributable to a new for-profit insurance provider subject to premium insurance tax. Other tax receipts, including transfers
after payment of debt service on CW/CA Bonds, are expected to total $2.1 billion in FY 2020, an increase of $43 million (2.1 percent) from FY 2019 projections.</div>
<div>Non-tax receipts and transfers are estimated at $4.7 billion
in FY 2020, a decrease of $690 million from FY 2019 projections. The decline largely reflects the use of certain resources available in FY 2019 that are not expected to recur in FY 2020.</div>
<div>Disbursements<font>. General Fund
disbursements, including transfers to other funds, are expected to total $75.6 billion in FY 2020, an increase of $3.3 billion (4.5 percent) from FY 2019 projections. General Fund disbursements reflect conservative estimates of disbursements in each
financial category, a practice that provides a cushion for potential receipts shortfalls and other unanticipated costs.</font></div>
<div>Local assistance spending is estimated at $51.0 billion in FY
2020, an increase of $1.2 billion (2.4 percent) from FY 2019 projections. The increase is primarily driven by School Aid ($275 million on a State fiscal year basis) and by Medicaid ($911 million).</div>
<div>General Fund operational costs are expected to total nearly
$20.0 billion in FY 2020, an increase of $1.0 billion (5.5 percent) from FY 2019 projections. The increase is comprised of the accelerated repayment of amortized pension costs ($500 million), estimated growth in health insurance costs for State
employees and retirees ($111 million), higher State costs for Workers’ Compensation ($101 million), and projected growth in the State's annual pension payment ($41 million). In addition, operating costs for the independently elected agencies
are projected to increase over FY 2019 levels ($75 million). Growth in operating cost for executive agencies is expected to increase partly due to varying levels of offsets and accounting reclassifications such as operating costs related to snow and
ice removal that was reclassified from Capital Projects Fund to the General Fund beginning in FY 2019.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>The Executive Budget also proposes lowering
the interest charged on judgments against the State from as high as 9 percent to a fair-market interest rate. The current rate was established in 1982 when interest rates were at 15 percent to avoid unnecessary taxpayer costs. The recommended rate

<div>Capital Projects Transfers. The Executive Budget reflects
savings from the use of available bond proceeds to reimburse capital spending expenses from prior years and higher costs for NYC bridge and tunnel security.</div>
<div>Extraordinary Monetary Settlement Transfers. The timing of
transfers of settlement reserves has been updated based on FY 2019 spending to date and estimated activity over the multi-year Financial Plan.</div>
<div>Other Transfers. The Executive Budget reflects a modification
to the accounting of Higher Education Services Corporation Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) payments made to SUNY on behalf of student recipients. This change eliminates recording the payment twice on a State Funds basis - first from the General
Fund to SUNY and again by SUNY to fund operating expenses. The TAP payment will now be reflected as a transfer to SUNY, like Medicaid payments made to State-operated health facilities on behalf of Medicaid recipients. Other changes include updated
estimates of various transfers from other funds, including mental hygiene and Indigent Legal Services.</div>
<div>General Fund Operating Results Through December 2018</div>

<div>Through December 2018, PIT collections were lower than
forecasted due to weaker than expected Tax Year 2018 current estimated payments. Consumption/Use Tax collections exceeded forecasts due to higher sales tax base growth. Lower than projected business tax receipts were primarily driven by the timing
of insurance tax payments and lower than projected audit receipts.</div>
<div>Miscellaneous Receipts exceeded the initial projections mainly
due to the receipt of unplanned Extraordinary Monetary Settlements ($572 million), and higher Health Care Reform Act (HCRA) and lottery receipts. These higher receipts were offset by the timing of bond proceed reimbursements, primarily for Empire
State Development projects, which were reimbursed with a bond sale in January 2019. Compared to the revised estimates, miscellaneous receipts were in line with projections.</div>
<div>Federal grants were higher than both estimates ($3 billion and

<div>Agency operations spending was $151 million lower than
planned. Lower spending for Executive agencies was primarily attributable to Medicaid Administration costs, Department of Corrections and Community Supervision and EP. SUNY and Judiciary personal service spending was higher than expected due to
retroactive salary increases. Lower NPS spending in the University Systems was primarily from SUNY operations.</div>
<div>General State Charges (GSCs) were $251 million lower than
initial estimates, primarily due to timing of reimbursements for operations supported by Federal and capital funding.</div>
<div>Capital spending was $2.2 billion below initial projections
mainly due to the timing of economic development grant awards ($606 million). Additional underspending occurred in Transportation ($566 million) attributable to slower than projected spending for large scale New York State Department of

<div>Compared to updated estimates, spending variances were
generally consistent with the initial estimates described above, except for GSCs, capital projects and Federal Funds, which varied to a lesser degree compared to the revised estimates, due to timing adjustments reflected in the Mid- Year
Update.</div> <div>Special Considerations.</div>
<div>The Updated Financial Plan is subject to complex economic,
social, financial, political, and environmental risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the ability of the State to control. DOB believes that the projections of receipts and disbursements in the Updated Financial Plan are based on
reasonable assumptions, but there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially and adversely from these projections. For instance, actual receipts collections have fallen substantially below the levels forecasted in certain
fiscal years. In addition, certain projections contained in the Updated Financial Plan are based on the assumption that annual growth in State Operating Funds spending will be limited to 2 percent in FY 2021, FY 2022, and FY 2023, and that all
savings that result from the 2 percent spending growth benchmark will be made available to the General Fund.</div>
<div>DOB routinely executes cash management actions to manage the
State’s large and complex budget. These actions are intended for a variety of purposes that include improving the State’s cash flow, managing resources within and across State fiscal years, assisting in the adherence to spending targets
and better positioning the State to address future risks and unanticipated costs, such as economic downturns, unexpected revenue deterioration and unplanned expenditures. As such, the State regularly makes certain payments above those initially
planned to maintain budget flexibility. All payments made above the planned amount are reflected in the year they occur and adhere to the limit of the State’s 2 percent spending growth benchmark.</div>
<div>The Updated Financial Plan is based on numerous assumptions,
including the condition of the State and national economies and the concomitant receipt of economically sensitive tax receipts in the amounts projected. Other uncertainties and risks concerning the economic and receipts forecasts include the impacts
of: national and international events; ongoing financial instability in the Euro-zone; changes in consumer confidence, the price and supply of oil and gas; major terrorist events and hostilities or war; climate change and extreme weather events;

structure of compensation; shifts in monetary policy affecting interest rates and the financial markets; credit rating agency actions; financial and real estate market developments, which may adversely affect bonus income and capital gains
realizations; tech industry developments and employment; the effect of household debt on consumer spending and State tax collections; and the outcomes of litigation and other claims affecting the State.</div>
<div>The Updated Financial Plan is subject to various uncertainties
and contingencies relating to: wage and benefit increases for State employees that exceed projected annual costs; changes in the size of the State’s workforce; the realization of the projected rate of return for pension fund assets, and
current assumptions with respect to wages for State employees affecting the State’s required pension fund contributions; the willingness and ability of the Federal government to provide the aid projected in the Updated Financial Plan; the
ability of the State to implement cost reduction initiatives, including reductions in State agency operations, and the success with which the State controls expenditures; and the ability of the State and its public authorities to issue securities
successfully in the public credit markets. The projections and assumptions contained in the Updated Financial Plan are subject to revisions which may result in substantial change. No assurance can be given that these estimates and projections, which
depend in part upon actions the State expects to be taken but which are not within the State’s control, will be realized.</div>
<div>Budget Risks and
Uncertainties<font>. There can be no assurance that the State’s financial position will not change materially and adversely from current projections. If this were to occur, the State would be required to take
additional gap-closing actions. Such actions may include, but are not limited to: reductions in State agency operations; delays or reductions in payments to local governments or other recipients of State aid; delays in or suspension of capital
maintenance and construction; extraordinary financing of operating expenses; use of non-recurring resources; or other measures. In some cases, the ability of the State to implement such actions requires the approval of the Legislature and cannot be
implemented solely by action of the Governor.</font></div> <div>The
Updated Financial Plan projections for FYs 2020 to 2023 assume that School Aid and Medicaid disbursements will be limited to the ten-year rolling average growth of State personal income and the medical component of the consumer price index (CPI),

<div>income. To reduce volatility and align with the Medicaid cap, the Executive
Budget now proposes amending the statutory PIGI for School Aid to reflect average annual income growth over a ten-year period. Consistent with a ten-year average growth cap, the Updated Financial Plan reflects a School Aid increase of 3.6 percent in
SY 2020.</div> <div>State law grants the Commissioner of Health
(the “Commissioner”) certain powers and authority to maintain Medicaid spending levels assumed in the Updated Financial Plan. The Commissioner’s powers are to limit the rate of annual growth in DOH State Funds Medicaid spending to
the levels estimated for the current fiscal year, through actions which may include reducing rates to providers. These actions may be dependent upon timely Federal approvals and other elements of the program that govern implementation. Over the past
six years, DOH State Funds Medicaid spending levels have remained at or below indexed levels without requiring the Commissioner to exercise this authority. However, Medicaid program spending is sensitive to outside factors including fluctuations in
economic conditions, which may increase caseload, and changes in Federal aid, which could affect State health care spending. It should further be noted that the Medicaid Global Cap, which is indexed to historical CPI Medical trends, applies to State
Operating Funds and, therefore, General Fund spending remains sensitive to revenue performance in the State’s HCRA fund. The HCRA fund finances approximately one-quarter of the State’s share of Medicaid costs.</div>
<div>The Updated Financial Plan forecast assumes various
transactions that could fail to occur as planned including, but not limited to: receipt of certain payments from public authorities; receipt of certain revenue sharing payments under the Tribal-State compact, including payments from the Seneca
Nation<sup>2</sup>; receipt of miscellaneous revenues at the levels expected in the Updated Financial Plan; and achievement of cost-saving measures including, but
not limited to, transfer of available fund balances to the General Fund at levels currently projected. Such risks and uncertainties, if they were to materialize, could adversely impact the Updated Financial Plan in current or future years, or
both.</div> <hr noshade="noshade"/> <div>

<td>The Seneca Nation withheld
payments to the State that were owed in FY 2018 and FY 2019. On January 7, 2019, the majority of an arbitration panel concluded that the Seneca Nation is obligated to make such payments. The Updated Financial Plan assumes these payments will be
received by the end of March 2019. </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>The Updated Financial Plan also includes actions that affect
the spending reported in the State Operating Funds basis, including (i) the realignment of certain operating costs to the capital budget to provide consistency in reporting across all agencies and a more accurate accounting of the overall capital
budget; (ii) the payment of certain operating costs using available resources in accounts outside of the State Operating Funds basis of reporting; (iii) the restructuring of the STAR program to a tax credit for consistency with the reporting of
other State tax credits; and (iv) other accounting and reporting changes. If these and other transactions are not implemented as planned, annual spending growth in State Operating Funds would increase above current estimates.</div>
<div>In developing the Updated Financial Plan, DOB attempts to
mitigate the financial risks from receipts volatility, litigation, and unexpected costs, with a particular emphasis on the General Fund. It does this by, among other things, exercising caution when calculating total General Fund disbursements and
managing the accumulation of financial resources that can be used to offset new costs (including, but not limited to, fund balances not needed each year, reimbursement for capital advances, acceleration of tax refunds above the level budgeted each
year, and prepayment of expenses). There can be no assurance that such resources will be enough to address risks that may materialize in a given fiscal year.</div>
<div>Federal Issues<font>. The State
receives a substantial amount of Federal aid for health care, education, transportation, and other governmental purposes, as well as Federal funding to respond to, and recover from, severe weather events and other disasters. Many policies that drive
this Federal aid may be subject to change under the Trump Administration and the new Congress. Current Federal aid projections, and the assumptions on which they rely, are subject to revision because of changes in Federal policy.</font></div>
<div>In addition, the Updated Financial Plan may also be adversely
affected by other Federal government actions, including audits, disallowances, and changes to Federal participation rates or other Medicaid rules. For instance, the Updated Financial Plan includes reimbursement to the Federal government of $100
million annually through FY 2027 pursuant to a March 2015 agreement between the State and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The agreement resolved a pending disallowance for FY 2011 and all related payment disputes for
State-operated services prior to April 1, 2013, including home and community-based waiver services. Pursuant to the agreement, the State must adjust the Federal/State share of future Medicaid costs to reimburse the Federal government. The State used
$850 million in Extraordinary Monetary Settlement payments, previously set aside for financial risks, to finance the initial repayment amount in FY 2016.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Given this uncertainty regarding Federal policy, the FY 2019
Enacted Budget and the FY 2020 Executive Budget include legislation to continue authorization for a process by which the State could manage any potentially significant reductions in Federal aid during FYs 2020 and 2021. Specifically, the legislation
allows the Budget Director to prepare a plan for consideration by the Legislature if Federal policymakers (i) reduce Federal financial participation in Medicaid funding to New York State or its subdivisions by $850 million or more; or (ii) reduce
Federal financial participation or other Federal aid funding to New York State that affects the State Operating Funds financial plan by $850 million or more, exclusive of any cuts to Medicaid. Each limit is triggered separately, and is not additive.
The plan prepared by the Budget Director must equally and proportionally reduce appropriations and cash disbursements in the General Fund and State Special Revenue Funds. Upon receipt of the plan, the Legislature has 90 days to prepare its own
corrective action plan, which may be adopted by concurrent resolution passed by both the Senate and Assembly. Otherwise, the plan submitted by the Budget Director takes effect automatically.</div>
<div>Current Federal Aid<font>. President
Trump has proposed significant cuts to mandatory and discretionary domestic programs in Federal Fiscal Years (FFYs) 2018 and 2019 which have thus far been largely rejected by the final appropriations bills advanced for both years. FFY 2020 Federal
spending remains at risk due to the significantly lower discretionary spending caps currently in law under the Budget Control Act (BCA) of 2011.</font></div>
<div>The BCA of 2011 temporarily raised the debt limit, established
discretionary spending caps on the Federal government through FFY 2021, and instituted sequestration of some mandatory funds on which the State relies. Despite modest legislative adjustments to the discretionary caps contained in the BCA, the
possibility of reductions in Federal support is elevated as long as the caps remain in place. Congress passed legislation in 2013, 2015, and 2018 that temporarily increased the discretionary spending caps imposed by the BCA through FFY 2019. Similar
adjustments will need to be made to the BCA for the upcoming FFY 2020 to forestall potential cuts in discretionary programs on which the State relies.</div>
<div>Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH)<font>. Payments Provisions within the Medicaid statute allow for a capped amount of payments to hospitals that treat a disproportionate number of Medicaid recipients. Changes made initially in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to
reduce the aggregate amount of Federal reimbursements for DSH payments are scheduled to take effect in FFY 2020, beginning October 1, 2019. DOB estimates that if the changes take effect as scheduled, New York will experience the largest reduction
among all states, costing the State $7.2 billion in lost Federal DSH payments when fully phased in.</font></div>
<div>Federal Health Care Policy<font>. In
2017, the Federal government attempted to end the Basic Health Program (EP in New York State), the ACA’s Medicaid expansion, and shift a larger share of growth in Medicaid costs to states by imposing per capita caps on Medicaid spending in
lieu of Medicaid’s current open-ended policy. If enacted into law, these policies would have had a substantial adverse impact on the State.</font></div>
<div>Additionally, the Trump Administration withheld Cost Sharing
Reduction (CSR) payments, threatening low-cost health insurance coverage for income-eligible recipients purchasing Qualified Health Plan (QHP) or EP coverage through New York State of Health (NYSOH), New York’s official health plan
marketplace. Recent actions by the Trump Administration in response to litigation brought by the State will allow the State to recoup some of the withheld EP funding through changes to the reimbursement methodology for 2018. However, the State has
not received any guidance on whether it will receive Federal reimbursement in the EP for CSR’s in 2019 and beyond. This funding represents about 25 percent of the total Federal funding for the program and, absent any action by Congress, the
State Financial Plan remains at risk. The Financial Plan continues to reflect support for the EP program.</div>
<div>While Federal funding for the Children's Health Insurance
Program (CHIP) has been reauthorized through FFY 2027, it remains possible that other Federal changes could affect the State’s health care policies. DOB continues to monitor Federal health care policy.</div>
<div>Excise Tax on High-Cost Employer-Sponsored Health Coverage
(“Cadillac Tax”)<font>. The Excise Tax on High-Cost Employer Sponsored Health Coverage is a 40 percent excise tax assessed on the portion of the premium for an employer-sponsored health insurance plan that
exceeds a certain annual limit. The provision was initially included in the ACA to offset mandatory spending increases but has since been altered by intervening laws that delay the implementation of the tax until 2022.</font></div>
<div>Regulations from the IRS have yet to be published. DOB has no
current estimate as to the potential financial impact to the State from this Federal excise tax.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Medicaid Redesign Team (“MRT”) Medicaid Waiver<font>. The Federal Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and the State have reached an agreement authorizing up to $8 billion in new Federal funding over several years to transform New York’s health care
system and ensure access to quality care for all Medicaid beneficiaries. This funding, provided through an amendment to the State’s Partnership Plan 1115 Medicaid waiver, is divided among the Interim Access Assurance Fund (IAAF), the Delivery
System Reform Incentive Payment (DSRIP) Program, Health Homes, and various other Medicaid redesign initiatives.</font></div>
<div>Since January 1, 2014, in accordance with provisions of the
ACA, the State has been eligible for enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) funding associated with childless adults. The DOH continues to work with the CMS and to refine the eligibility data systems to draw the appropriate amount of
enhanced FMAP funding. This reconciliation may result in a modification of payments to the State and local governments.</div>
<div>Federal Debt Limit.<font> On March
1, 2019, a temporary suspension of the Federal debt limit expired. The U.S. Treasury is currently operating under “extraordinary measures” to make payments for as long as possible and forestall a potential default. The Congressional
Budget Office estimates that these measures will suffice through late summer or early fall of 2019. A Federal government default on payments, particularly for a prolonged period, could have a materially adverse effect on the national and the State
economies, financial markets, and intergovernmental aid payments. The specific effects on the Updated Financial Plan of a future Federal government default are unknown and impossible to predict. However, data from past economic downturns suggest
that the State’s revenue loss could be substantial if the economy goes into a recession due to a Federal default.</font></div>
<div>A payment default by the United States may adversely affect
the municipal bond market. Municipal issuers, as well as the State, could face higher borrowing costs and impaired market access. This would jeopardize planned capital investments in transportation infrastructure, higher education facilities,
hazardous waste remediation, environmental projects, and economic development projects. Additionally, the market for and market value of outstanding municipal obligations, including municipal obligations of the State, could be adversely
affected.</div> <div>Impact of Federal Tax Law Changes</div>
<div>On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) (H.R. 1, P.L. 115-97), making major changes to the Federal Internal Revenue Code, most of which are effective in the 2018 tax year. The new Federal tax law makes extensive changes to Federal personal income taxes,
corporate income taxes, and estate taxes.</div> <div>The
State’s income tax system interacts with the Federal system in numerous ways. The changes to the Federal tax code have significant flow-through effects on state tax burdens and state tax receipts. From the standpoint of individual New York
State taxpayers, one of the most onerous provisions in the TCJA is a new $10,000 limit on the deductibility of State and Local Tax (SALT) payments, effective for tax year 2018. The TCJA’s SALT deduction limit represents a large increase in the
State’s effective tax rate relative to historical experience, and may adversely affect New York’s economic competitiveness.</div>
<div>DOB and the Department of Taxation and Finance (DTF) estimate
that the SALT deduction limit raises Federal tax liability for New York taxpayers by $14.3 billion for tax year 2018, relative to what taxpayers would have paid absent the limitation. Over the course of the eight years the SALT deduction limit is
scheduled to be in effect, the State estimates that resident taxpayers who itemize at the Federal level for each year through 2025 will collectively pay an additional $121 billion in Federal taxes relative to what they would have paid absent the
SALT deduction limit.</div> <div>Moreover, the TCJA contains
numerous provisions that may adversely affect residential real estate prices in New York State and elsewhere, of which the SALT deduction limit is the most significant. A loss of wealth associated with a decline in home prices could have a
statistically significant impact on household spending in the State through the wealth effect, whereby consumers perceive the rise and fall of the value of an asset, such as a home, as a corresponding increase or decline in income, causing them to
alter their spending practices. Reductions in household spending by New York residents, if they were to occur, would be expected to result in lower sales for the State’s businesses, which, in turn, would cause further reductions in economic
activity and employment. Lastly, falling home prices could result in homeowners delaying the sale of their homes. The combined impact of lower home prices and fewer sales transactions could result in lower real estate transfer tax collections.</div>
<div>In sum, the Federal tax law changes may intensify migration
pressures and erode the value of home prices, thereby posing risks to the State’s tax base.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>State Response to Federal Tax Law Changes</div>
<div>The FY 2019 Enacted Budget includes State tax reforms intended
to mitigate issues arising from the Federal law, including decoupling many State tax provisions from the Federal changes, the creation of an optional payroll tax program, and the establishment of a new State charitable giving vehicle, all of which
are described below. The State continues to evaluate other tax law changes in response to the TCJA.</div>
<div>On July 17, 2018, the State, joined by Connecticut, Maryland,
and New Jersey, filed a lawsuit intended to protect New York taxpayers from the new Federal limit on the SALT deduction. The lawsuit argues that the new SALT limit was enacted to target New York and similarly situated states, that it interferes with
state’s rights to make their own fiscal decisions, and that it will disproportionately harm taxpayers in these states.</div>
<div>Decoupling From Federal Tax Code</div>
<div>The State tax code is closely aligned in many respects with
the Federal tax code. The FY 2019 Enacted Budget includes legislation that decouples the State tax code from the Federal tax code, where appropriate, to minimize roughly $1 billion in State tax increases that would otherwise have been the result of
the Federal tax changes. Those decoupled Federal changes, which would have affected the General Fund budget gaps projected in FY 2020 and beyond, include:</div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Federal
Limit on SALT Deduction. The TCJA capped the itemized deductions for SALT at $10,000. The State tax code is updated to decouple from this limit, preventing a State tax increase from the linkage of this Federal limit to State income tax returns.

Changes and Eliminations to Certain Deductions. The State decoupled from new Federal limits on other deductions. </td></tr>

Credit. Federal law changes the value of, and eligibility for, the child tax credit. The Empire State Child Tax Credit program will remain unchanged. </td></tr>

 York Single Filer Standard Deduction. The Federal repeal of personal exemptions would have eliminated the ability of New York single-filer taxpayers to claim the standard deduction on their State tax returns. The FY 2019 Enacted Budget includes
legislation to address this issue. Absent this legislation, New York State taxpayers would have been subject to an annual State tax increase of $840 million, beginning in FY 2020. </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>Employer Compensation Expense Program (ECEP)</div>
<div>Under legislation approved with the FY 2019 Enacted Budget,
employers may opt in to a new ECEP, which is intended to mitigate the tax burden for employees affected by the SALT deduction limit. While the TCJA limits deductibility for individuals, it does not cap deductibility for ordinary and necessary
business expenses paid or incurred by employers in carrying on a trade or business.</div>
<div>Employers that elect to participate in the ECEP program would
be subject to a 5 percent State tax on all annual payroll expenses in excess of $40,000 per employee, phased in over three years beginning on January 1, 2019 as follows: 1.5 percent in tax year 2019, 3 percent in 2020, and 5 percent in 2021.
Employers must elect to participate in the ECEP for the upcoming tax year by December 1 of the preceding calendar year, with the first annual election due by December 1, 2018 for the tax year beginning on January 1, 2019.</div>
<div>The ECEP is intended to be revenue neutral, with any decrease
in New York State PIT receipts expected to be offset by a comparable increase in ECEP revenue. Remittance of ECEP revenue to the State is expected to occur on the same schedule as PIT withholdings, with remittances starting in the fourth quarter of
FY 2019. A new State PIT credit will be available to employees whose wages are subject to the tax; any decrease in New York State PIT receipts is expected to be offset by a comparable increase in ECEP revenue because the formula used to calculate
the State PIT credit corresponds in value to the ECEP.</div>
<div>For the 2019 Tax Year, 262 employers elected to participate in
the ECEP and are expected to remit $2 million.</div> <div>State

<div>The FY 2019 Enacted Budget created a new State Charitable
Gifts Trust Fund to accept gifts, starting in Tax Year 2018, for the purposes of funding health care and education in New York State. Taxpayers who itemize deductions may claim these charitable contributions as deductions on their Federal and State
income tax returns. Any taxpayer making a donation may also claim a State tax credit equal to 85 percent of the donation amount for the tax year after the donation is made. State PIT receipts will be reduced by the State tax deduction and the 85

and an 85 percent credit for those donations that will be available beginning in tax year 2019. </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>To date, the State has received $93 million in charitable
gifts that have been deposited to the Charitable Gifts Trust Fund for healthcare and education ($58 million and $35 million, respectively). The FY 2020 Executive Budget appropriates these funds for authorized purposes.</div>
<div>Impact of Tax Law Changes on PIT Revenue Bonds</div>
<div>To offset the potential reduction in the level of New York
State PIT receipts resulting from activity of the ECEP and the State Charitable Gifts Trust Fund, the FY 2019 Enacted Budget amends the State Finance Law provisions creating the Revenue Bond Tax Fund (RBTF) to increase the percentage of New York
State PIT receipts required to be deposited upon receipt in the RBTF from 25 percent to 50 percent. In addition, the legislation that created the ECEP requires that 50 percent of ECEP receipts received by the State be deposited to the RBTF. These
changes became effective April 1, 2018.</div> <div>The amendments
also increase the amount of all New York State PIT receipts collected from payroll withholding and ECEP receipts that must be deposited in the RBTF in the event that (a) the State Legislature fails to appropriate amounts required to make all debt
service payments on State PIT Revenue Bonds or (b) having been appropriated and set aside pursuant to a certificate of the Director of the Budget, debt service payments and other cash requirements under the applicable financing agreements have not
been made when due on the State PIT Revenue Bonds. Under prior law, New York State PIT receipts from payroll withholding were to be deposited to the RBTF until amounts on deposit in the RBTF equaled the greater of 25 percent of annual New York State
PIT receipts or $6 billion. Under the new law, New York State PIT receipts and ECEP receipts will be deposited to the RBTF until amounts on deposit in the RBTF equal the greater of 40 percent of the aggregate of annual New York State PIT receipts
and ECEP receipts or $12 billion.</div> <div>Donations to the
Charitable Gifts Trust Fund could reduce State PIT receipts by nearly one dollar for every dollar donated. Accordingly, the amount of donations to the State Charitable Gifts Trust Fund is the principal direct risk to the amount of New York State PIT
receipts deposited to the RBTF under the tax law changes enacted by the State as part of the FY 2019 Enacted Budget. To address this risk, the State increased the amount of PIT receipts deposited into the RBTF from 25 percent to 50 percent.</div>
<div>DOB and DTF have prepared a calculation of the maximum amount
of charitable donations to the State Charitable Gifts Trust Fund that could occur annually under varying assumptions. The calculation of this ceiling is intended as a stress test on State PIT receipts that may flow to the RBTF under different levels
of assumed taxpayer participation. It should not, under any circumstances, be viewed either as an estimate or projection of likely donations. The factors that may influence donation activity are complex and include, but are not limited to, possible
statements, actions, or interpretive guidance by the IRS or other governmental actors relating to the deductibility of such donations; the liquidity position, risk tolerance, and knowledge of individual taxpayers; advice or guidance of tax advisors
or other professionals; changes in general economic conditions; adoption of similar trusts in other states; and tax reciprocity agreements among states.</div>
<div>The ceiling on the amount of potential donations is calculated
to be in the range of $28 billion annually, on average (2018 through 2022).<sup>4</sup> The calculation of the ceiling assumes that every resident taxpayer who has
an incentive to donate will do so, and such donations will be equal to the total value of each resident taxpayer’s SALT payments less the value of the $10,000 Federal SALT deduction limit, up to the value of the taxpayer’s total State
tax liability. The calculation is dependent on several assumptions concerning the number of itemized filers. It relies on the most recent personal income tax population study file (2016), as trended forward, as well as the impact of the TCJA and
State law changes on the number and distribution</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>of itemized and standardized filers. The calculation also assumes that (i) no
further changes in Federal tax law occur, and (ii) DOB projections of the level of State taxpayer liability for the forecast period as set forth in the Updated Financial Plan are materially accurate.</div>

<td>The calculation of maximum
potential donations is based on current law, including the scheduled reversion of the top PIT rate from 8.82 percent to 6.85 percent starting in Tax Year 2020. </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>In general, assumptions made regarding taxpayer behavior were
intended to maximize the calculated impact of charitable giving on PIT receipts in each year. After these adjustments and with inclusion of ECEP revenues, receipts to the RBTF are projected to remain above the level of receipts that would have been
expected under statutes effective prior to April 2018, even in a maximum participation scenario.</div>
<div>The DOB and DTF calculation of the projected ceiling on the
amount of donations is necessarily based on many assumptions that may change materially over time. While DOB believes that these factors can be expected to constrain donation activity, there can be no assurance that, under conditions of maximum
participation, the amount of annual charitable gifts will not reduce the level of PIT receipts deposited into the RBTF below the levels projected in February 2018. If that were to occur, it is DOB’s expectation that changes to the tax law
would be recommended to further increase the percentage of PIT receipts deposited into the RBTF.</div>
<div>Accordingly, although the calculation of a maximum amount of
charitable donations to the State Charitable Gifts Trust Fund reflect DOB’s and DTF’s current best judgment and estimates, such amount may be higher.</div>
<div>IRS Guidance</div>
<div>On August 23, 2018, the IRS issued proposed regulations - IRS
REG-112176-18 - that seek to provide new rules governing the availability of Federal income tax deductions for charitable contributions when a taxpayer receives or expects to receive a state or local tax credit for such charitable contributions. In
the case of state tax credits received by a taxpayer making a charitable contribution, the proposed regulations would require the taxpayer to reduce the Federal income tax deduction by the amount of the state tax credit received for such charitable
contribution; provided, however, this rule would not apply if the value of the state tax credit to be received does not exceed 15 percent of the charitable contribution. If finalized, the effective date of these proposed regulations would be August
27, 2018. The Treasury Department and the IRS have collected comments from the general public on these proposed regulations and held a public hearing on November 5, 2018. Based on its review of the proposed regulations, DOB anticipates that if the
proposed regulations are adopted in their current form, then contributions to the State Charitable Gifts Trust Fund may decline. The proposed regulations, by their terms, do not impact the Federal tax reduction that DOB expects would result for
certain taxpayers employed by entities that may enroll in the ECEP.</div>
<div>Implementation</div>
<div>The State developed the ECEP and Charitable Gifts Trust Fund
based on a review of existing laws, regulations, and precedents. However, there can be no assurance that the IRS will allow taxes paid under the ECEP by an electing employer, or donations made by taxpayers to the Charitable Gifts Trust Fund, to be
deductible for Federal tax purposes under current law and the TCJA. As noted above, the IRS has proposed regulations that would impair the ability of taxpayers to deduct donations to the Charitable Gifts Trust Fund from Federally taxable income
while receiving State tax credits for such donations.</div>
<div>The FY 2019 Enacted Budget allows taxpayers to claim
reimbursement from the State for interest on underpayments of Federal tax liability for the 2019, 2020 and 2021 tax years if the underpayments arise from reliance on amendments to State tax law enacted in 2018. To receive reimbursement, taxpayers

<div>There could be a material expense to the State if taxpayer
participation in the ECEP and Charitable Gifts initiatives for the 2019, 2020 and 2021 tax years results in Federal determinations of underpayment of Federal income tax. Any cost to the Financial Plan from State reimbursement of interest charges

<div>The Updated Financial Plan does not include any estimate of
the magnitude of the possible interest expense to the State, which depends on several factors, including: rates of participation in the ECEP; the magnitude of donations to the State Charitable Gifts Trust Fund; the amount of determinations of
underpayment attributable to reliance on other changes in State tax law made in 2018; the amount of time between the due date of the return and the date any Federal determination is issued; the interest rate applied; and the frequency at which
taxpayers submit timely reimbursement claims to the State. Interest on unpaid Federal tax generally accrues from the due date of the return until the date of payment in full. Under current Federal law, the interest rate is determined quarterly and
is the Federal short-term rate plus 3 percent, compounded daily.</div>
<div>State Government Employment.</div>
<div>As of March 31, 2018, the State had approximately 181,600 full
time equivalent annual salaried employees funded from all funds including some part-time and temporary employees, independently-elected agencies and university systems, but excluding seasonal, legislative and judicial employees. The workforce is now
substantially smaller than it was in 1990, when it peaked at approximately 230,000 positions. The State workforce is projected to total 182,728 positions at the end of FY 2019. The State workforce subject to direct Executive control is expected to
total 118,868 full time equivalent positions at the end of FY 2019.</div>
<div>Status of Current Labor Negotiations<font>. The State has multi-year labor agreements in place with most of the unionized workforce. The Civil Service Employees Association (CSEA) and DC-37 (Local 1359 Rent Regulation Service Employees) have five-year labor
contracts that provides annual salary increases of 2 percent for FYs 2017 through 2021 and additional compensation changes, offset by benefit design changes within NYSHIP and reductions in overtime costs.</font></div>
<div>United University Professions (UUP) has a six-year collective
bargaining agreement that covers academic years 2017 through 2022. The agreement provides for a 2 percent general salary increase in each year of the contract and additional compensation changes, which are partly offset by benefit design changes
within NYSHIP. The cost of the agreement (approximately $253 million in FY 2020) has been included in the Updated Financial Plan and is primarily funded by SUNY except for the related fringe benefit costs, which are paid by the State. At the request
of SUNY, the State will advance approximately $110 million in planned payments for State-operated SUNY campuses from November 2018 to June 2019, to make resources available for retroactive payments.</div>
<div>On October 10, 2018, the Police Benevolent Association of the
New York State Troopers (NYSTPBA) ratified a five-year collective bargaining agreement for FY 2019 through FY 2023. The agreement provides for a 2 percent annual general salary increase in each year of the contract and additional compensation
changes, which are partly offset by changes to health insurance benefit design within NYSHIP, like UUP and CSEA). The cost of this agreement is expected to be offset by agency management plan savings, consistent with past practice.</div>
<div>Employees represented by the Public Employees Federation (PEF)
and the Graduate Student Employees Union (GSEU) have a three-year collective bargaining agreement providing 2 percent annual salary increases in FYs 2017 through 2019. Salary increases provided to PEF and GSEU employees have also been extended to
Management/Confidential (M/C) employees. Negotiations on the next contracts with PEF and GSEU are expected to commence later in the year.</div>
<div>The State and NYSCOPBA recently agreed to a seven-year
contract covering fiscal years 2017 through 2023, which was ratified by the membership on January 24, 2019. The agreement provides for a 2 percent general salary increase each year, and additional compensation changes, offset by benefit design
changes within NYSHIP and reductions in overtime costs. The agreement is estimated to cost approximately $360 million in FY 2019 and FY 2020, including retroactive payments. The cost of the agreement is expected to be offset by reserves previously
included in the Financial Plan.</div> <div>The State is in
negotiations with all other employee unions whose contracts concluded in previous fiscal years, including the New York State Police Investigators Association (NYSPIA) and Council 82. Negotiations also continue with the Police Benevolent Association
of New York State (PBANYS), whose contract expired at the end of FY 2015.</div>
<div>The Judiciary has reached agreements with all 12 unions
represented within its workforce. The contract periods are as follows: FY 2018 to FY 2020 for CSEA, FY 2012 to FY 2019 for Court Officers Benevolent Association of Nassau County (COBANC), FY 2012 to FY 2021 for the NYS Supreme Court Officers
Association, the NYS Court Officers Association and the Court Clerks Association, and FY 2017 to FY 2019 for seven other unions.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>State Retirement System<font>. The
System provides pension benefits to public employees of the State and its localities (except employees of New York City, and public school teachers and administrators, who are covered by separate plans). State employees made up about 33 percent of
the membership as of March 31, 2018. There were 3,044 other public employers participating in the System, including all cities and counties (except New York City), most towns, villages and school districts (with respect to non-teaching employees),
and many public authorities.</font></div> <div>As of March 31,
2018, 652,030 persons were members of the System and 470,596 pensioners or beneficiaries were receiving pension benefits. Article 5, section 7 of the State Constitution considers membership in any State pension or retirement system to be “a
contractual relationship, the benefits of which shall not be diminished or impaired.”</div>
<div>The State Comptroller is the administrative head of New York
State and Local Retirement System (NYSLRS) and the trustee and custodian of the Common Retirement Fund (CRF), a trust created pursuant to the Retirement and Social Security Law to hold the System’s assets, and, as such, is responsible for
investing the assets of the System.</div> <div>The State makes
annual contributions to the NYSLRS for employees in the New York State and Local Employees’ Retirement System (ERS) and the New York State and Local Police and Fire Retirement System (PFRS). All projections are based on projected market
returns and numerous actuarial assumptions which, if unrealized, could change these projections materially.</div>
<div>During FY 2016, the NYSLRS updated its actuarial assumptions
based on the results of the 2015 five-year experience study. In September 2015, NYSLRS announced that employer contribution rates would decrease beginning in FY 2017 and the assumed rate of return would be lowered from 7.5 percent to 7 percent. The
salary scale assumptions were also changed for ERS the scale was reduced from 4.9 percent to 3.8 percent and for PFRS the scale was reduced from 6.0 percent to 4.5 percent. During FY 2019, salary scale assumptions were further changed via a one-time
10 percent increase for both ERS and PFRS, to be reflected in FY 2020 contribution rates.</div>
<div>In order to protect employers from potentially volatile
contributions tied directly to the value of the System’s assets held by the CRF, the System utilizes a multi-year smoothing procedure. One of the factors used by the System’s Actuary to calculate employer contribution requirements is the
assumed investment rate of return, which is currently 7.0 percent.<sup>5</sup> The current actuarial smoothing method recognizes unexpected annual gains and losses
(returns above or below the assumed investment rate of return) over a 5-year period.</div>
<hr noshade="noshade"/> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td><sup>5</sup> </td>
<td>During 2015, the Retirement
System’s Actuary conducted the statutorily required quinquennial actual experience study of economic and demographic assumptions. The assumed investment rate of return is an influential factor in calculating employer contribution rates. In
addition, the Chief Investment Officer conducted an asset allocation study. The resulting asset allocation and long-term asset allocation policy informed the Actuary's recommendation regarding the revision of the investment rate of return (discount
rate). In September 2015, the Comptroller announced the assumed rate of return for NYSLRS would be lowered from 7.5 percent to 7 percent. The 7 percent rate of return has been used to determine employer contribution rates in FYs 2017 through 2020.
</td></tr></table> </div> <div>The amount of future annual employer
contribution rates will depend, in part, on the value of the assets held by the CRF as of each April 1, as well as on the present value of the anticipated benefits to be paid by the System as of each April 1. Contribution rates for FY 2020 were
released in August 2018. The average ERS rate decreased by 0.3 percent from 14.9 percent of salary in FY 2019 to 14.6 percent of salary in FY 2020, while the average PFRS rate in FY 2020 will remain at 23.5 percent of payroll, the same rate as in FY
2019.</div> <div>The System assets are held by the CRF for the
exclusive benefit of members, pensioners and beneficiaries. Investments for the System are made by the State Comptroller as trustee of the CRF. The System reports that the net position restricted for pension benefits as of March 31, 2018 was $212.1
billion (including $5.5 billion in receivables, which consist of employer contributions, amortized amounts, member contributions, member loans, accrued interest and dividends, investment sales and other miscellaneous receivables), an increase of
$14.5 billion or 7.3 percent from the FY 2017 level of $197.6 billion. The increase in net position restricted for pension benefits from FY 2017 to FY 2018 reflects, in large part, equity market</div> </div>

Comptroller released a statement indicating that the value of the System’s invested assets posted a 7.17 percent time-weighted rate of return (gross rate of return before the deduction of certain fees) for the three-month period ending
December 31, 2018. This report reflects unaudited data for assets invested for the System. The value of invested assets changes daily. </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>The System reports that the present value of anticipated
benefits for current members, retirees, and beneficiaries increased to $251.4 billion (including $127.8 billion for retirees and beneficiaries) as of April 1, 2018, up from $240.7 billion as of April 1, 2017. The funding method used by the System
anticipates that the plan net position, plus future actuarially determined contributions, will be sufficient to pay for the anticipated benefits of current members, retirees and beneficiaries. The valuation used by the Retirement Systems Actuary was
based on audited net position restricted for pension benefits as of March 31, 2018. Actuarially determined contributions are calculated using actuarial assets and the present value of anticipated benefits. Actuarial assets differed from plan net
position on April 1, 2018 in that the determination of actuarial assets utilized a smoothing method that recognized 20 percent of the unexpected gain for FY 2018, 40 percent of the unexpected gain for FY 2017, 60 percent of the unexpected loss for
FY 2016, and 80 percent of the unexpected loss for FY 2015. The asset valuation method smooths gains and losses based on the market value of all investments. Actuarial assets increased from $198.1 billion on April 1, 2017 to $206.7 billion on April
1, 2018.</div> <div>The ratio of the fiduciary net position to the
total pension liability for ERS, as of March 31, 2018, calculated by the System’s Actuary, was 98.2 percent. The ratio of the fiduciary net position to the total pension liability for PFRS, as of March 31, 2018, calculated by the
System’s Actuary, was 96.9 percent.<sup>7</sup></div>

<td>The System previously
disclosed a funded ratio in accordance with GASB Statements 25 and 27, which have been amended by GASB Statements 67 and 68. The GASB Statements 67 and 68 amendments had the effect, among other things, of no longer requiring the disclosure of a
funded ratio. GASB now requires the disclosure of the ratio of the fiduciary net position to the total pension liability. This ratio is not called a funded ratio and is not directly comparable to the funded ratio disclosed in prior years.
</td></tr></table> </div> <div>FY 2019 Projections. The
State’s FY 2019 ERS/PFRS pension liability estimate of $2.2 billion is based on the most recent bill prepared by OSC as of October 2018. The estimate includes payment of $432 million towards the balance outstanding on prior-year deferrals
(i.e., amortizations) and additional interest savings from paying the majority of the pension bill in April 2018. The State’s FY 2019 ERS/PFRS pension estimate was revised downward based on actual FY 2018 salary base (used to calculate the FY
2019 bill), which was lower than previously projected.</div>
<div>FY 2020 Projections. The preliminary FY 2020 ERS/PFRS pension
liability estimate of $2.2 billion is impacted by FY 2018 investment returns of 11.5 percent, which was above the Comptroller’s assumed rate of return (7 percent). The estimate also reflects the impact of past investment performance and growth
in the number of lower cost Tier 6 members. As a result, the average contribution rate for ERS will decrease from 14.9 percent to 14.6 percent of payroll, while the average contribution rate for PFRS will remain stable at 23.5 percent of payroll. In
addition to the $2.2 billion liability, the FY 2020 estimate reflects a $500 million repayment in FY 2020 of amortized pension costs due in FY 2021 through FY 2023. The accelerated repayment would save approximately $33 million in interest expense.
DOB will evaluate fiscal conditions before executing the accelerated amortization repayment.</div>
<div>Outyear Projections. Pension estimates for FY 2021 and beyond,
as projected by DOB, reflect growth in normal costs primarily based on the expectation that collective bargaining will result in continued salary increases and that investment returns will be below the actuarially assumed 7 percent rate of return in
the near-to-mid-term.</div> <div>Other Post-Employment Benefits<font>. State employees become eligible for post-employment benefits (e.g., health insurance) if they reach retirement while working for the State and are enrolled in the New York State Health Insurance Program
(“NYSHIP”), or are enrolled in the NYSHIP opt-out program at the time they reach retirement and have at least ten years of eligible service for NYSHIP benefits. The cost of providing post-retirement health insurance is shared between the
State and the retired employee. Contributions are established by law and may be amended by the Legislature. The State pays its share of costs on a Pay-As-You-Go (“PAYGO”) basis as required by law.</font></div>
<div>In accordance with the GASB Statement 45, the State must
perform an actuarial valuation every two years for purposes of calculating OPEB liabilities. As disclosed in Note 13 of the State’s Basic Financial Statements for FY 2018, the State’s Annual</div> </div>

<div>Required Contribution (ARC) represents the annual level of funding that, if
set aside on an ongoing basis, is projected to cover normal costs each year and to amortize any unfunded liabilities of the plan over a period not to exceed 30 years. Amounts required but not actually set aside to pay for these benefits are
accumulated, with interest, as part of the net OPEB obligation, after adjusting for amounts previously required.</div>
<div>As reported in the State’s Basic Financial Statements
for FY 2018, the unfunded actuarial accrued liability for FY 2018 is $90.5 billion ($72.8 billion for the State and $17.7 billion for SUNY), an increase of $3.3 billion from FY 2017 (attributable entirely to SUNY). The unfunded actuarial accrued
liability for FY 2018 used an actuarial valuation of OPEB liabilities as of April 1, 2016. These valuations were determined using the Frozen Entry Age actuarial cost method, and are amortized over an open period of 30 years using the level
percentage of projected payroll amortization method. A significant portion of the annual growth in the State’s unfunded actuarial accrued liability is due to the reduction of the discount rate from 3.155 to 2.637 percent, calculated as the
average Short-Term Investment Pool (STIP) rate for the past 20 years at the time of valuation. The decline in the discount rate increases the present value of the projected benefit obligation.</div>
<div>The actuarially determined annual OPEB cost for FY 2018
totaled $5.5 billion ($4.3 billion for the State and $1.2 billion for SUNY), an increase of $1.3 billion from FY 2017 ($1.0 billion for the State and $264 million for SUNY). The actuarially-determined cost is calculated using the Frozen Entry Age
actuarial cost method, allocating costs on a level percentage of earnings basis. The actuarially determined cost was $3.6 billion ($2.7 billion for the State and $878 million for SUNY) greater than the PAYGO required cash payments for retiree costs
made by the State in FY 2018. This difference between the State’s PAYGO costs, and the actuarially-determined ARC under GASB Statement 45, reduced the State’s net asset condition at the end of FY 2018 by $3.6 billion.</div>
<div>GASB has no authority to require the additional costs to be
funded on the State’s budgetary (cash) basis, and no additional funding is assumed for this purpose in the Updated Financial Plan. The State continues to fund these costs, along with all other employee health care expenses, on a PAYGO basis,
meaning the State pays these costs as they become due.</div>
<div>There is no provision in the Updated Financial Plan to fund
the ARC for OPEB. If the State began making a contribution, the additional cost above the PAYGO amounts would be lowered. However, it is not expected that the State will alter its current PAYGO funding practice.</div>
<div>The FY 2018 Enacted Budget included legislation creating a
Retiree Health Benefit Trust Fund (the “Trust Fund”) that authorizes the State to reserve money for the payment of health benefits of retired employees and their dependents. Under the legislation, the State may deposit into the Trust
Fund, in any given fiscal year, up to 0.5 percent of total then-current unfunded actuarial accrued OPEB liability. The Updated Financial Plan does not include any deposits to the Trust Fund.</div>
<div>The provisions of GASB Statement 75 (Accounting and Financial
Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions), which amends GASB Statement 45 and GASB Statement 57, is expected to be incorporated into the State’s FY 2019 Basic Financial Statements. The FY 2019 Basic Financial Statements are
expected to be issued in July 2019. The GASB Statements, as amended by GASB Statement 75, alter the actuarial methods used to calculate OPEB liabilities, standardizes asset smoothing and discount rates, and require the unfunded net OPEB obligation
to be reported by the State in its Statement of Net Position. Reporting the unfunded OPEB liability on the Statement of Net Position, rather than as a note to the Basic Financial Statements, is expected to significantly increase the State’s
total long-term liabilities and show the State in a negative net position.</div>
<div>GASB Statement 75 is not expected to alter the Updated
Financial Plan cash PAYGO projections for health insurance, as the DOB methodology for forecasting these costs over a multi-year period already incorporates factors and considerations consistent with the new actuarial methods and calculations
required by the GASB Statement.</div> <div>Litigation<font>. Litigation against the State may include potential challenges to the constitutionality of various actions. The State may also be affected by adverse decisions that are the result of various lawsuits. Such adverse
decisions may not meet the materiality threshold to warrant individual description but, in the aggregate, could still adversely affect the Updated Financial Plan.</font></div>
<div>Climate Change Adaptation<font>.
Climate change poses significant long-term threats to physical and biological systems in New York and around the world. Potential hazards and risks related to climate change for the State include, among other things, rising sea levels, more severe
coastal flooding and erosion hazards, and more intense storms. Storms in recent years, including Superstorm Sandy, Hurricane Irene, and Tropical Storm Lee, have demonstrated vulnerabilities in the State’s</font></div> </div>

<div>infrastructure (including mass transit systems, power transmission and
distribution systems, and other critical lifelines) to extreme weather events including coastal flooding caused by storm surges. The potential effects of climate change could adversely impact the Updated Financial Plan in current or future years. To
mitigate and manage these impacts, significant long-term planning and investments by the Federal government, the State of New York, municipalities, and public utilities are expected to be needed to adapt existing infrastructure to climate change
risks.</div> <div>On October 8, 2018, the United Nations'
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a special report on the impacts of global warming. The report found that human activity has already caused approximately 1.0°C of warming and is continuing to increase average global
temperatures at 0.2°C per decade due to past and ongoing emissions. The IPCC states that global warming is likely to reach 1.5°C of warming between 2030 and 2052 if temperatures continue to increase at the current rate. This increase is
expected to produce a range of adverse outcomes (“reasons for concern”). For example, the IPCC rates global risks of extreme weather events and coastal flooding as increasing from moderate (“detectable”) today, to high
(“severe and widespread”) at 1.5°C of warming. The risk of severe impacts increases further at higher temperatures. Using current trends, climate change risks increasingly fall within the term of current outstanding bonds of the
State, its public authorities and municipalities. State bonds may be issued with a term of up to 30 years under State statute.</div>
<div>Participants in financial markets are acknowledging climate
change risks. In June 2017, an industry-led Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure convened by the Financial Stability Board (an international body which monitors the global financial system) published recommendations stating that
climate risk affects most market sectors and that climate-related risk should be publicly disclosed to investors in annual financial filings. In November 2017, Moody's Investors Service issued guidance to state and local governments that climate
change is forecast to heighten exposure to economic losses, placing potential pressure on credit ratings. The Moody's report identified rising sea levels and the effect on coastal infrastructure as the primary climate risk for the northeastern US
region, including the State. These risks are heightened by population concentration in coastal counties.</div>
<div>The State continues to recover from the damage sustained
during three powerful storms that crippled entire regions. In August 2011, Hurricane Irene disrupted power and caused extensive flooding to various State counties. In September 2011, Tropical Storm Lee caused flooding in additional State counties
and, in some cases, exacerbated the damage caused by Hurricane Irene two weeks earlier. On October 29, 2012, Superstorm Sandy struck the East Coast, causing widespread infrastructure damage and economic losses to the greater New York region. The
frequency and intensity of these storms present economic and financial risks to the State. Reimbursement claims for costs of the immediate response, recovery, and future mitigation efforts continue, largely supported by Federal funds. In January
2013, the Federal government approved approximately $60 billion in Federal disaster aid for general recovery, rebuilding, and mitigation activity nationwide. It is anticipated that the State, its localities, and the MTA may receive approximately
one-half of this amount for response, recovery, and mitigation costs. To date, a total of $17 billion has been committed to repairing impacted homes and businesses, restoring community services, and mitigating future storm risks across the State.
There can be no assurance that all anticipated Federal disaster aid described above will be provided to the State and its affected entities over the coming years.</div>
<div>Cybersecurity<font>. New York State
government, like many other large public and private entities, relies on a large and complex technology environment to conduct its operations. As a recipient and provider of personal, private, or sensitive information, the State and its public
corporations and municipalities face multiple cyber threats including, but not limited to, hacking, viruses, malware and other attacks on computer and other sensitive digital networks and systems. Entities or individuals may attempt to gain
unauthorized access to the State’s digital systems for the purposes of misappropriating assets or information or causing operational disruption and damage. To mitigate the risk of business operations impact and/or damage from cyber incidents
or cyber-attacks, the State invests in multiple forms of cybersecurity and operational controls. The State’s Chief Information Security Office (CISO) within the State’s Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) maintains
comprehensive policies and standards, programs, and services relating to the security of State government networks and geographic information systems, and annually assesses the implementation of security policies and standards to ensure compliance
through the Nationwide Cyber Security Review. In addition, the CISO maintains the New York State Cyber Command Center team and hotline, which provides a security operations center, digital forensics capabilities, and related procedures for cyber
incident reporting and response, distributes real-time advisories and alerts, provides managed security services, and implements statewide information security training and exercises. While controls are routinely reviewed and tested, no assurances
can be given that such security and operational control measures will be completely successful at guarding against cyber threats and attacks. The results of any such attack could impact business operations and/or damage State digital networks and
systems, and the costs of remedying any such damage could be substantial.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>The State has also adopted regulations designed to protect the
financial services industry from cyberattacks. Banks, insurance companies and other covered entities regulated by DFS are, unless eligible for limited exemptions, required to (i) maintain a cyber security program, (ii) create written cybersecurity
policies and perform risk assessments, (iii) designate a Chief Information Security Officer with responsibility to oversee the cybersecurity program, (iv) annually certify compliance with the cybersecurity regulations and (v) report to DFS
cybersecurity events that have a reasonable likelihood of materially harming any material part of the entity’s normal operation(s) or of which notice is required to any government body, self-regulatory agency, or supervisory body.</div>
<div>Financial Condition of New York State Localities<font>. The State’s localities rely in part on State aid to balance their budgets and meet their cash requirements. As such, unanticipated financial need among localities can adversely affect the State financial
projections. Certain localities outside New York City, including cities and counties, have experienced financial problems and have requested and received additional State assistance during the last several State fiscal years. In 2013, the Financial
Restructuring Board for Local Governments was created to provide assistance to distressed local governments. The Restructuring Board performs comprehensive reviews and provides grants and loans on the condition of implementing recommended efficiency
initiatives.</font></div> <div>Bond Market<font>. Successful implementation of the Updated Financial Plan is dependent on the State’s ability to market bonds. The State finances much of its capital spending, in the first instance, from the General Fund or the
STIP, which it then reimburses with proceeds from the sale of bonds. If the State cannot sell bonds at the levels (or on the timetable) expected in the capital plan, the State’s overall cash position and capital funding plan may be adversely
affected. The success of projected public sales will be subject to prevailing market conditions, among other things. Future developments in the financial markets, including possible changes in Federal tax law relating to the taxation of interest on
municipal bonds, as well as future developments concerning the State and public discussion of such developments generally, may affect the market for outstanding State-supported and State-related debt. The TCJA adversely impacts the State and its
public authorities by removing certain refunding opportunities for Federal tax exempt financing, including advance refundings for debt service savings when interest rates are favorable.</font></div>
<div>Debt Reform Act<font>. The Debt
Reform Act of 2000 (“Debt Reform Act”) restricts the issuance of State-supported debt to capital purposes only, and for a maximum term of bonds to 30 years. The Debt Reform Act limits the amount of new State-supported debt to 4 percent
of State personal income, and new State-supported debt service costs to 5 percent of All Funds receipts. The restrictions apply to all new State-supported debt issued since April 1, 2000. DOB, as administrator of the Act, determined that the State
was in compliance with the statutory caps in the most recent calculation period (FY 2018).</font></div>
<div>Updated Financial Plan projections indicate that debt
outstanding and debt service will continue to remain below limits imposed by the Debt Reform Act. Based on the most recent personal income and debt outstanding forecasts, the available debt capacity under the debt outstanding cap is expected to
decline from $5.8 billion in FY 2019 to about $24 million in FY 2023. This includes the estimated impact of funding increased capital commitment levels with State bonds. The debt service costs on debt issued after April 1, 2000 and estimated new
issuances is projected at $5.1 billion in FY 2020, or roughly $3.5 billion below the statutory debt service limitation.</div>
<div>The projected debt capacity under the debt outstanding cap
depends on expected growth in State personal income. The State uses personal income estimates published by the Federal government, specifically the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), to calculate the cap on debt outstanding, as required by statute.
The BEA revises these estimates on a quarterly basis and such revisions can be significant. The BEA increased its calendar year 2017 personal income estimate by $70 billion from March to October 2018, resulting in a $2.8 billion increase in debt
outstanding capacity. Notably, this material fluctuation in statutory debt capacity occurred between the end of FY 2018, when debt outstanding is measured, and the final compliance determination in October 2018. While, in this instance, the State
benefitted from the significant increase in BEA’s estimate of New York State personal income, this volatility could have compromised the State’s ability to manage within its statutory debt cap had the personal income estimate been
unexpectedly revised downward by a similar amount. Absent such swings in personal income estimates, the State traditionally has relied on adjustments to capital spending priorities and debt financing practices to preserve available debt capacity and
stay within the statutory limits.</div> <div>Such volatility in New
York State personal income estimates has prompted DOB to reexamine the manner in which BEA calculates personal income, in particular the apportionment of income among states. For Federal reporting purposes, BEA reassigns income from the state where
it was earned to the state in which a person resides, for situations where a person lives and earns income in different states (the “residency adjustment”). The BEA residency adjustment has the effect of</div> </div>

<div>reducing New York State personal income because income earned in New York by
nonresidents regularly exceeds income earned in other states by New York residents. The net residency adjustment reported by BEA decreased the measure of 2017 State personal income by $73 billion at the time of the FY 2018 debt outstanding
calculation. The State taxes all personal income earned in New York, regardless of place of residency. Therefore, including the BEA personal income residency adjustment in the debt cap calculation reduces alignment with the State tax base and
understates the PIT revenues available to support State debt. To date, in administering the debt reform cap, DOB has used State personal income, as reduced by the BEA residency adjustment, in debt outstanding cap calculations and projections which
correspondingly reduces the State’s debt capacity under the Debt Reform Act.</div>
<div>Changes in the State's available debt capacity since the
Mid-Year Update reflect the impact of several factors, including personal income forecast adjustments and capital spending revisions. The State may adjust capital spending priorities and debt financing practices from time to time to preserve
available debt capacity and stay within the statutory limits, as events warrant.</div>
<div>Secured Hospital Program<font>.
Under the Secured Hospital Program, the State entered into service contracts to enable certain financially distressed not-for-profit hospitals to have tax-exempt debt issued on their behalf, to pay for upgrading their primary health care facilities.
Revenues pledged to pay debt service on the bonds include hospital payments made under loan agreements between the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York (DASNY) and the hospitals and certain reserve funds held by the applicable trustees for
the bonds. In the event of revenue shortfalls to pay debt service on the Secured Hospital bonds, the service contracts obligate the State to pay debt service, subject to annual appropriations by the Legislature, on bonds issued by DASNY through the
Secured Hospital Program. As of March 31, 2018, there were approximately $193 million of bonds outstanding for this program.</font></div>
<div>Three of the four remaining hospitals in the State’s
Secured Hospital Program are in poor financial condition. In relation to the Secured Hospital Program, the State’s contingent contractual obligation was invoked to pay debt service for the first time in FY 2014. Since then the State has paid
$125 million for debt service costs. DASNY also estimates the State will pay debt service costs of approximately $31 million annually in FY 2020 and FY 2021, $25 million in FY 2022, and $20 million in FY 2023 and FY 2024. These amounts are based on
the actual experience to date of the participants in the program, and would cover the debt service costs for one hospital whose debt service obligation was discharged in bankruptcy, a second hospital which closed in 2010, and a third hospital that
is currently delinquent in its payments. The State has estimated additional exposure of up to $7 million annually, if all hospitals in the Program failed to meet the terms of their agreements with DASNY and if available reserve funds were
depleted.</div> <div>Economic and Demographic Trends</div>
<div>The National Economy.</div>
<div>DOB projects real growth in U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
of 2.4 percent for calendar year 2019, following estimated growth of 2.9 percent for calendar year 2018. Global economic data indicate further weakening to come, putting downward pressure on inflation. This could keep the Federal Reserve cautious
with respect to further increases in the Federal funds rate.</div>
<div>The projected quarterly growth path for U.S. real GDP has been
altered by the impact of the recent partial Federal government shutdown. The partial Federal government shutdown lasted five weeks, from December 22, 2018, through January 25, 2019, making it the longest in U.S. history. Almost 800,000 Federal
government workers were either furloughed or worked without pay; based on Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates, a total of approximately $18 billion in Federal discretionary spending was delayed. The Updated Financial Plan forecast
incorporates CBO’s estimates of he altered path of Federal spending due to the shutdown.</div>
<div>Based on CBO estimates, DOB assumes the partial Federal
government shutdown lowered the level of U.S. real GDP by one-tenth of a percent relative to what it otherwise would have been, reflecting the negative impact from delayed Federal government spending, weaker consumer spending due to the delayed
payment of Federal government workers, and second-round effects of lower private-sector income resulting from Federal spending delays. This lost inflation-adjusted level of output is estimated to have resulted in lower growth of 0.2 percentage point
on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis. Additional weakness in housing and net exports has resulted in a total downward revision to projected U.S. real GDP in 2019 to 2.4 percent.</div> </div>

<div>CBO estimates that the partial government shutdown will
continue to shave growth from the first quarter of 2019 since not all forgone economic activity will be recoverable in February and March 2019. Furloughed Federal employees may try to make up for forgone activity once they resume work, but in the
National Income and Product Accounts data, the contribution of Federal salaried workers to real GDP is usually measured as a function of their regular hours and thus will not be recorded. However, it is assumed that all of the recoverable activity
will be recouped before September 30, 2019, the end of the current Federal fiscal year. Therefore, a boost to economic output is expected for both the second and third quarters of calendar year 2019, as Federal workers spend their back pay and
Federal agencies resume making purchases and providing services.</div>
<div>The partial Federal government shutdown is expected to have
had a small temporary impact on both the level of employment and the unemployment rate. The estimated 800,000 Federal employees who were either furloughed or working without pay will receive back pay, so they should be counted as employed in the
establishment survey conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Based on the household survey, from which the unemployment rate is derived, only the 300,000 Federal workers who were furloughed in January 2019 would be counted as unemployed
on temporary layoff, which may have elevated the January 2019 unemployment rate. But the temporary decrease in private-sector activity that resulted from the partial Federal government shutdown might have slowed hiring and increased layoffs in the
private sector. On balance, January 2019 employment posted a strong monthly gain of 304,000. However, household survey data indicate that the number of individuals working part-time for economic reasons increased by 490,000 in January 2019. This
jump could include unpaid Federal workers who took temporary part-time jobs to replace a portion of their lost income, in which case the January 2019 monthly gain could have overstated the strength of the labor market.</div>
<div>In addition, the annual benchmark revisions to the payroll
survey data raised the average monthly gain for 2018 to 223,000. DOB’s current outlook for the labor market reflects this gain, with average monthly gains of 166,000 now projected for 2019. However, DOB expects employment growth to slow as the
expansion matures. Total nonagricultural employment growth of 1.6 percent is projected for 2019, a deceleration from a revised 1.7 percent for 2018.</div>
<div>In an effort to normalize interest rates, the Federal Reserve
raised its Federal funds target rate three times in 2017 and four times in 2018. However, as the outlook for both the domestic and global economies becomes murkier, the outlook for monetary policy has become more uncertain. The Federal Open Market
Committee (FOMC) removed references to “further gradual increases in its January 2019 meeting statement and included new language signaling a more patient, data-dependent stance. DOB’s economic outlook is consistent with a single rate
hike at the end of 2019, followed by one more rate hike in 2020. This would bring the upper end of the target range close to 3 percent by the end of 2020.</div>
<div>Several factors are at work prompting a change in the monetary
policy outlook. First, the global economic outlook has deteriorated. The failure to produce a deal on the U.K.’s exit from the European Union has clouded the outlook for the U.K. economy, while the Italian economy appears to be in recession.
Moreover, China’s fragile growth outlook has reduced momentum in all its neighboring trading partners. While currency pressures eased in 2018, growth in other emerging markets is not expected to be able to offset the weakness in developed
markets. World GDP is expected to be weaker. Accordingly, real export growth of 2.5 percent is projected for 2019.</div>
<div>Second, financial conditions have tightened. The most recent
results from the Federal Reserve’s Senior Loan Officer Survey indicate a tightening of bank lending standards. The risk spread (as measured by difference between corporate bond yields and risk-free long-term treasury yields) widened over the
course of 2018 and continued widening in early 2019. Meanwhile, the yield curve, which tracks the difference between long- and short-term rates, remains relatively flat, putting downward pressure on banking system profits, particularly now that the
rates that banks pay their depositors are finally rising from historically low levels, as banks are forced to compete with the rise in risk-free short-term Treasury yields. The 10-year Treasury yield has fallen more than 50 basis points since early
November 2018, despite a 25 basis-point increase in the Federal funds rate in the middle of December 2018. The decline in the 10-year Treasury yield is due in large part to the safe-haven status of U.S. Treasury securities and is therefore likely to
persist, particularly as the global economy decelerates.</div>
<div>Finally, inflation remains moderate from a historical
perspective and well within the Federal Reserve’s target range. Domestic oil prices appear to be stabilizing between $50 and $55 per barrel, with slowing global growth and expanding U.S. production providing a counterweight to the uncertainty
that a complicated geopolitical landscape is having on supply. Thus, there is little evidence that inflation is poised to rise significantly above the Federal Reserve 2 percent target over the near term. Therefore, consumer price inflation is
estimated to fall from 2.4 percent in 2018 to 2.0 percent in 2019 on an annual average basis.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Many risks to the economic outlook remain. Recent analysis by
the U.S. Government Accountability Office indicates that many households may have under-withheld during the 2018 tax year under the new tax law, resulting in fewer and smaller refunds paid out by the IRS in the first and second quarters of 2019 than
anticipated. If this phenomenon is sufficiently widespread, household spending for the first half of 2019 could be weaker than reflected in the Updated Financial Plan forecast. If the U.S. and China fail to strike a trade deal, yet another
escalation in the tariff war could cause world trade to contract further, possibly damaging U.S. corporate profits if companies are forced to shift away from east Asian supply chains to more expensive countries. In addition, if tariffs result in
even higher input prices than anticipated, the current relatively benign inflation environment could deteriorate, possibly resulting in lower job and investment growth than reflected in the Updated Financial Plan forecast. Slower global growth than
projected could result in lower demand for U.S. exports, resulting in weaker growth in corporate profits, investment, and employment than reflected in the Updated Financial Plan forecast.</div>
<div>Finally, all of the risks mentioned above have injected a
large degree of volatility into equity markets in recent months. Lower and more volatile equity prices can result in lower household spending through both the wealth effect and as a signal that the road ahead is uncertain. This volatility could be
further exacerbated by the risk surrounding the long-term impact of declining Federal tax receipts on budget deficits and the national debt, due to the TCJA and other Federal actions. On the positive side, if global growth is stronger than reflected
in this outlook, or lower long-term interest rates spark a stronger housing market than expected, growth in corporate profits, investment, and employment could be stronger than anticipated in the Updated Financial Plan forecast.</div>
<div>The New York State Economy</div>
<div>New York State private sector job growth appears to be
stabilizing at a historically healthy rate. Following 1.5 percent growth for calendar year 2017, the first half of calendar year 2018 had slightly stronger growth of 1.6 percent. However, the State economy will not be immune to slowing global growth
and a weakening national economy going forward. Indeed, preliminary data for the second half of calendar year 2018 indicate a slight decrease from the first half of 2018, resulting in estimated growth of 1.4 percent for all of 2018, representing an
upward revision of 0.1 percent from the Enacted Budget Financial Plan forecast. Slower growth of 1.3 percent is projected for 2019 as national and global economic growth moderates, which represents an upward revision of 0.1 percent above the Enacted
Budget Financial Plan forecast.</div> <div>Finance and insurance
sector bonuses, which at the time of the Enacted Budget Financial Plan forecast were expected to decline by 1.9 percent in FY 2019, have been revised downward and are now expected to decline by 14.7 percent for FY 2019. The estimated decline in
finance and insurance sector bonuses in FY 2019 is attributable to weaker estimates of Wall Street’s calendar year 2018 revenue performance, and evidence that one-time bonus payments in FY 2018 were likely stronger than originally estimated.
Finance and insurance sector bonus growth of 0.2 percent is projected for FY 2020.</div>
<div>Revised Quarterly Census of Employment and Wage data indicate
weaker bonus growth, but stronger non-bonus wage growth for the second half of 2018. Underlying non-bonus wage growth is projected at 4.8 percent for FY 2019, with 4.2 percent growth now projected for FY 2020. On balance, total State wage growth of
3.2 percent is projected for FY 2019, representing a 0.4 percentage point downward revision from the Enacted Budget Financial Plan forecast, while wage growth of 3.8 percent is projected for FY 2020.</div>
<div>Equity market volatility and taxpayer responses to both
anticipated and actual changes to Federal tax law have resulted in large swings in taxable non-wage income for the State. For example, prior to 2009, hedge fund managers were able to avoid paying U.S. income taxes on fee compensation earned from
their offshore funds by deferring and reinvesting it. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 ended this practice and required that all deferred compensation for services performed before January 1, 2009, be repatriated by December 31,
2017, at which point it would be subject to taxation. DOB estimates that approximately $15 billion in such income was added to New York State adjusted gross income (NYSAGI) for the 2017 tax year. Moreover, the results of the 2016 presidential
election created an expectation among high-income taxpayers that Federal PIT rates would be reduced effective in 2017, including the capital gains tax. This expectation likely motivated taxpayers to delay capital gains, wages, and possibly other
income-generating activity into 2017, reducing wage and nonwage income for 2016 and increasing it for 2017. State taxpayers are estimated to have delayed $6 billion in capital-gains generating activity from 2016 into 2017. These developments,
combined with fourth quarter financial market activity, are estimated to have boosted growth in the non-wage components of NYSAGI for the 2017 Tax Year, while depressing them for 2018. As a result, positive capital gains realizations are now
estimated to have fallen 3.1 percent for the 2018 Tax Year, following growth of 32.2 percent for 2017. Combined positive partnership and S Corp gains are estimated to have fallen 16.1 percent for tax year 2018, following growth of 18.1 percent for
2017.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Although State private sector job growth remains above its
historical average, there are many risks to the forecast. All the risks to the U.S. forecast apply to the State forecast as well although as the nation’s financial capital, both the volume of financial market activity and the volatility in
equity markets pose a particularly large degree of uncertainty for the State. The uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic outlook for the national and global economies is amplified in the financial markets, as demonstrated by the 19.8 percent
decline in the S&amp;P 500 over a scant three months at the end of 2018. Risks related to the impact of tariffs, the strong dollar, and weakening global growth are likely to continue to create volatility and restrain equity market growth over the
near term. Due to the disproportionate global tilt of financial markets, the State's finance sector is particularly vulnerable to these risks. Weaker and/or more volatile markets than anticipated could result in weaker bonus and wage growth, as well
as lower taxable capital gains realizations, than are reflected in the Updated Financial Plan forecast. In contrast, stronger equity markets, along with stronger national and global growth, could result in stronger employment and wage growth than
the Updated Financial Plan forecast reflects.</div> <div>Consensus
Revenue Forecast</div> <div>The consensus revenue forecasting
process is set forth in State Finance Law. On February 28, 2019, representatives from the Executive, Legislature, OSC and independent nationally recognized economists, met to discuss the outlook for economic activity and receipts. The majorities in
each house of the Legislature issued public estimates that were substantially above the receipts forecast set forth in the State’s official Financial Plan dated February 15, 2019. On March 1, 2019, the Executive and Legislature did not reach a
consensus on the projections of certain receipts for the current and ensuing fiscal years.</div>
<div>On March 5, 2019, the State Comptroller issued his report
containing a forecast for the projections of certain receipts for the current and ensuing fiscal years. The State Comptroller projects that receipts over the two-year period (FYs 2019 and 2020) will be above the Executive Budget forecast by $190
million. If excess receipts at this level were to materialize, DOB plans to deposit them into the State’s rainy day reserves, fiscal conditions permitting. Consistent with prior fiscal years, the projections from the consensus forecasting
process are not reflected in the Updated Financial Plan. DOB will undertake a complete update to the official Financial Plan projections following the enactment of the FY 2020 budget.</div>
<div>Supranational Entities Risk.
<font> Certain of the Funds may invest in obligations issued or guaranteed by supranational entities (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, the
World Bank, European Investment Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, and Asia Development Bank), which are often chartered to promote economic development. The government members, or “stockholders,” usually make initial capital
contributions to the supranational entity and, in many cases, are committed to make additional capital contributions if such entity is unable to repay its borrowings. There is no guarantee that one or more stockholders of the supranational entity
will continue to make any necessary additional capital contributions. If such contributions are not made, the entity may be unable to pay interest or repay principal on its debt securities, certain of the Funds may have limited legal recourse in the
event of default, and certain of the Funds may lose money on such investments.</font></div>
<div>Tax Risks Associated with Municipal Securities. <font> As with any investment, you should consider how your investment in shares of each Municipal Bond Fund will be taxed. The tax information in the relevant Prospectus and this SAI is provided as general information.
You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of an investment in shares of each Municipal Bond Fund.</font></div>
<div>Unless your investment in shares is made through a tax-exempt
entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an individual retirement account, you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when each Municipal Bond Fund makes distributions or you sell Municipal Bond Fund shares. In general, each
Municipal Bond Fund seeks to produce income that is generally exempt from federal income tax and will not benefit investors in tax deferred retirement accounts such as IRAs or investors not subject to federal income tax. Further, the iShares
California Muni Bond ETF seeks to produce income that is generally exempt from California's income tax, which will not provide any state tax benefit to investors who are not subject to California's state income tax and the iShares New York Muni Bond
ETF seeks to produce income that is generally exempt from New York's income tax, which will not provide any state tax benefit to investors who are not subject to New York's state income tax.</div>
<div>In response to the national economic downturn in recent years,
governmental cost burdens may be reallocated among federal, state and local governments. Also, as a result of the downturn, many state and local governments are experiencing significant reductions in revenues and are consequently experiencing
difficulties meeting ongoing expenses. Certain of these state or local governments may have difficulty paying principal or interest on their outstanding debt and may experience ratings downgrades of their debt.</div> </div>

<div>U.S. Economic Trading Partners Risk. <font> The U.S. is a significant, and in some cases the most significant, trading partner of, or foreign investor in, the country or countries in which a Fund invests. As a result, economic conditions of such countries
may be particularly affected by changes in the U.S. economy. The U.S. economy has recently experienced very difficult conditions and increased volatility, as well as significant adverse trends. While government intervention and recent legislation
has been enacted to improve the U.S. economy, the recovery has been fragile and modest. A decrease in U.S. imports or exports, new trade and financial regulations or tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate or an economic slowdown in the
U.S. may have a material adverse effect on a country’s economic conditions and, as a result, securities to which a Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>The U.S. has developed increasingly strained relations with a
number of foreign countries, including traditional allies, such as certain European countries, and historical adversaries, such as North Korea, Iran, China and Russia. If these relations were to worsen, it could adversely affect U.S. issuers as well
as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also experienced increased internal unrest and discord. If this trend were to continue, it may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and many of the issuers in which a Fund
invests.</div> <div>U.S. Treasury Obligations Risk. <font> Certain of the Funds invest in various types of U.S. Treasury securities. U.S. Treasury obligations may differ from other securities in their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and other characteristics.
Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial condition or credit rating of the U.S. government may cause the value of U.S. Treasury obligations to decline. U.S. Treasury obligations typically offer lower interest rates than other obligations.
Neither the U.S. government nor any of its agencies or instrumentalities guarantees the market value of the securities it issues.</font></div>
<div>The total public debt of the U.S. as a percent of GDP has
grown rapidly since the beginning of the recent financial downturn. Although high debt levels do not necessarily indicate or cause economic problems, they may create systemic risks if sound debt management practices are not implemented. A high
national debt level may increase market pressures to meet government funding needs, which may drive debt cost higher and cause a country to sell additional debt, thereby increasing refinancing risk. A high national debt also raises concerns that a
government will not be able to make principal or interest payments when they are due. In the worst case, unsustainable debt levels can cause a decline in the value of the dollar (which may lead to inflation), and can prevent the U.S. government from
implementing effective counter-cyclical fiscal policy in economic downturns.</div>
<div>On August 5, 2011, S&amp;P Global Ratings downgraded U.S.
Treasury securities from an AAA rating to AA+. A further downgrade of the ratings of U.S. government debt obligations, which are often used as a benchmark for other borrowing arrangements, could result in higher interest rates for individual and
corporate borrowers, cause disruptions in the international bond markets and generally have a substantial negative effect on the U.S. economy. A downgrade of U.S. Treasury securities from another ratings agency or a further downgrade beyond AA+
rating by S&amp;P Global Ratings may cause the value of a Fund's U.S. Treasury obligations to decline.</div>
<div>Valuation Risk. <font> In
certain circumstances, a Fund’s securities may be valued using techniques other than market quotations. The value established for a security may be different from what would be produced through the use of another methodology or if the value
had been priced using market quotations. Securities that are valued using methods other than market quotations, including “fair valued” securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation in their value from one day to the next than would
be the case if market quotations were used. In addition, there is no assurance that a Fund could sell a security for the value established for it at any time, and it is possible that a Fund could incur a loss if a security is sold for less than its
established value.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in Asia.<font>   Investments in securities of issuers in certain Asian countries involve risks not typically associated with investments in securities of issuers in other regions. Such heightened risks include, among others,
expropriation and/or nationalization of assets, confiscatory taxation, piracy of intellectual property, data and other security breaches (especially of data stored electronically), political instability, including authoritarian and/or military
involvement in governmental decision-making, armed conflict and social instability as a result of religious, ethnic and/or socio-economic unrest. Certain Asian economies have experienced rapid rates of economic growth and industrialization in recent
years, and there is no assurance that these rates of economic growth and industrialization will be maintained.</font></div>
<div>Certain Asian countries have democracies with relatively short
histories, which may increase the risk of political instability. These countries have faced political and military unrest, and further unrest could present a risk to their local economies and securities markets. Indonesia and the Philippines have
each experienced violence and terrorism, which has negatively impacted their economies. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial military capabilities, and historical tensions between the two countries present the risk of war. Escalated

<div>hostilities between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of
hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on the entire Asian region. Certain Asian countries have also developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian
issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. Political, religious, and border disputes persist in India. India has recently experienced and may continue to experience civil unrest and hostilities with certain of its neighboring countries. Increased
political and social unrest in these geographic areas could adversely affect the performance of investments in this region.</div>
<div>Certain governments in this region administer prices on
several basic goods, including fuel and electricity, within their respective countries. Certain governments may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector in their respective countries and may own or control many
companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic conditions in this region, which in turn could have a negative impact on private sector companies. There is also the possibility of diplomatic developments
adversely affecting investments in the region.</div>
<div>Corruption and the perceived lack of a rule of law in dealings
with international companies in certain Asian countries may discourage foreign investment and could negatively impact the long-term growth of certain economies in this region. In addition, certain countries in the region are experiencing high
unemployment and corruption, and have fragile banking sectors.</div>
<div>Some economies in this region are dependent on a range of
commodities, including oil, natural gas and coal. Accordingly, they are strongly affected by international commodity prices and particularly vulnerable to any weakening in global demand for these products. The market for securities in this region
may also be directly influenced by the flow of international capital, and by the economic and market conditions of neighboring countries. Adverse economic conditions or developments in neighboring countries may increase investors' perception of the
risk of investing in the region as a whole, which may adversely impact the market value of the securities issued by companies in the region.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Australasia. <font> The economies of Australasia, which include Australia and New Zealand, are dependent on exports from the agricultural and mining sectors. This makes Australasian economies susceptible to fluctuations in the
commodity markets. Australasian economies are also increasingly dependent on their growing service industries. Australia and New Zealand are located in a part of the world that has historically been prone to natural disasters, such as drought and
flooding. Any such event in the future could have a significant adverse impact on the economies of Australia and New Zealand and affect the value of securities held by a relevant Fund. The economies of Australia and New Zealand are dependent on
trading with certain key trading partners, including Asia, Europe and the U.S. The Australia–U.S. Free Trade Agreement has significantly expanded the trading relationship between the U.S. and Australia. Economic events in the U.S., Asia, or in
other key trading countries can have a significant economic effect on the Australian economy. The economies of Australia and New Zealand are heavily dependent on the mining sector. Passage of new regulations limiting foreign ownership of companies
in the mining sector or imposition of new taxes on profits of mining companies may dissuade foreign investment, and as a result, have a negative impact on companies to which a Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Central and South America.<font>   The economies of certain Central and South American countries have experienced high interest rates, economic volatility, inflation, currency devaluations, government defaults, high unemployment rates and
political instability which can adversely affect issuers in these countries. In addition, commodities (such as oil, gas and minerals) represent a significant percentage of the region's exports and many economies in this region are particularly
sensitive to fluctuations in commodity prices. Adverse economic events in one country may have a significant adverse effect on other countries of this region.</font></div>
<div>The governments of certain countries in Central and South
America may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic conditions in such countries, which could have a
negative impact on the securities in which the Fund invests. Diplomatic developments may also adversely affect investments in certain countries in Central and South America. Some countries in Central and South America may be affected by public
corruption and crime, including organized crime.</div> <div>Certain
countries in Central and South America may be heavily dependent upon international trade and, consequently, have been and may continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values
and other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade. These countries also have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade. In addition,
certain issuers located in countries in Central and South America in which the Fund invests may be the subject of sanctions (for example, the U.S. has imposed sanctions on certain Venezuelan individuals, corporate entities and</div> </div>

<div>the Venezuelan government) or have dealings with countries subject to
sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. An issuer may sustain damage to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer that
has dealings with such countries. The Fund may be adversely affected if it invests in such issuers.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. <font> Many countries with developed markets have recently experienced significant economic pressures. These countries generally tend to rely on the services sectors (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, the financial services sector) as the primary source of economic growth and may be susceptible to the risks of individual service sectors. For example,
companies in the financial services sector are subject to governmental regulation and, recently, government intervention, which may adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge and amount of capital they must maintain.
Recent dislocations in the financial sector and perceived or actual governmental influence over certain financial companies may lead to credit rating downgrades and, as a result, impact, among other things, revenue growth for such companies. If
financial companies experience a prolonged decline in revenue growth, certain developed countries that rely heavily on financial companies as an economic driver may experience a correlative slowdown. Recently, new concerns have emerged with respect
to the economic health of certain developed countries. These concerns primarily stem from heavy indebtedness of many developed countries and their perceived inability to continue to service high debt loads without simultaneously implementing
stringent austerity measures. Such concerns have led to tremendous downward pressure on the economies of these countries. As a result, it is possible that interest rates on debt of certain developed countries may rise to levels that make it
difficult for such countries to service such debt. Spending on health care and retirement pensions in most developed countries has risen dramatically over the last few years. Medical innovation, extended life expectancy and higher public
expectations are likely to continue the increase in health care and pension costs. Any increase in health care and pension costs will likely have a negative impact on the economic growth of many developed countries. Certain developed countries rely
on imports of certain key items, such as crude oil, natural gas, and other commodities. As a result, an increase in demand for, or price fluctuations of, certain commodities may negatively affect developed country economies. Developed market
countries generally are dependent on the economies of certain key trading partners. Changes in any one economy may cause an adverse impact on several developed countries. In addition, heavy regulation of, among others, labor and product markets may
have an adverse effect on certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause prolonged periods of recession. Such risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of a Fund’s investments.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets. <font> Certain of the Funds may invest in securities of issuers domiciled in emerging market countries.  Investments in emerging market countries may be subject to greater risks than investments in developed
countries. These risks include: (i) less social, political, and economic stability; (ii) greater illiquidity and price volatility due to smaller or limited local capital markets for such securities, or low or non-existent trading volumes; (iii)
custodians, clearinghouses, foreign exchanges and broker-dealers may be subject to less scrutiny and regulation by local authorities; (iv) local governments may decide to seize or confiscate securities held by foreign investors and/or local
governments may decide to suspend or limit an issuer's ability to make dividend or interest payments; (v) local governments may limit or entirely restrict repatriation of invested capital, profits, and dividends; (vi) capital gains may be subject to
local taxation, including on a retroactive basis; (vii) issuers facing restrictions on dollar or euro payments imposed by local governments may attempt to make dividend or interest payments to foreign investors in the local currency; (viii)
investors may experience difficulty in enforcing legal claims related to the securities and/or local judges may favor the interests of the issuer over those of foreign investors; (ix) bankruptcy judgments may only be permitted to be paid in the
local currency; (x) limited public information regarding the issuer may result in greater difficulty in determining market valuations of the securities; and (xi) lack of financial reporting on a regular basis, substandard disclosure and differences
in accounting standards may make it difficult to ascertain the financial health of an issuer.</font></div>
<div>Emerging market securities markets are typically marked by a
high concentration of market capitalization and trading volume in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries, as well as a high concentration of ownership of such securities by a limited number of investors. In addition,
brokerage and other costs associated with transactions in emerging market securities can be higher, sometimes significantly, than similar costs incurred in securities markets in developed countries. Although some emerging markets have become more
established and tend to issue securities of higher credit quality, the markets for securities in other emerging market countries are in the earliest stages of their development, and these countries issue securities across the credit spectrum. Even
the markets for relatively widely traded securities in emerging market countries may not be able to absorb, without price disruptions, a significant increase in trading volume or trades of a size customarily undertaken by institutional investors in
the securities markets of developed countries. The limited size of many of these securities markets can cause prices to be erratic for reasons apart from factors that affect the soundness and competitiveness of the securities issuers. For example,
prices may be unduly influenced by traders who</div> </div> <div type="Block">

 Table of Contents </a> </div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>control large positions in these markets. Additionally, market making and
arbitrage activities are generally less extensive in such markets, which may contribute to increased volatility and reduced liquidity of such markets. The limited liquidity of emerging market country securities may also affect a Fund's ability to
accurately value its portfolio securities or to acquire or dispose of securities at the price and time it wishes to do so or in order to meet redemption requests.</div>
<div>Many emerging market countries suffer from uncertainty and
corruption in their legal frameworks. Legislation may be difficult to interpret and laws may be too new to provide any precedential value. Laws regarding foreign investment and private property may be weak or non-existent. Sudden changes in
governments may result in policies which are less favorable to investors such as policies designed to expropriate or nationalize “sovereign” assets. Certain emerging market countries in the past have expropriated large amounts of private
property, in many cases with little or no compensation, and there can be no assurance that such expropriation will not occur in the future.</div>
<div>Investment in the securities markets of certain emerging
market countries is restricted or controlled to varying degrees. These restrictions may limit a Fund's investment in certain emerging market countries and may increase the expenses of the Fund. Certain emerging market countries require governmental
approval prior to investments by foreign persons or limit investment by foreign persons to only a specified percentage of an issuer's outstanding securities or a specific class of securities which may have less advantageous terms (including price)
than securities of the company available for purchase by nationals.</div>
<div>Many emerging market countries lack the social, political, and
economic stability characteristic of the U.S. Political instability among emerging market countries can be common and may be caused by an uneven distribution of wealth, social unrest, labor strikes, civil wars, and religious oppression. Economic
instability in emerging market countries may take the form of: (i) high interest rates; (ii) high levels of inflation, including hyperinflation; (iii) high levels of unemployment or underemployment; (iv) changes in government economic and tax
policies, including confiscatory taxation; and (v) imposition of trade barriers.</div>
<div>A Fund's income and, in some cases, capital gains from foreign
securities will be subject to applicable taxation in certain of the emerging market countries in which it invests, and treaties between the U.S. and such countries may not be available in some cases to reduce the otherwise applicable tax
rates.</div> <div>Emerging markets also have different clearance
and settlement procedures, and in certain of these emerging markets there have been times when settlements have been unable to keep pace with the volume of securities transactions, making it difficult to conduct such transactions.</div>
<div>In the past, certain governments in emerging market countries
have become overly reliant on the international capital markets and other forms of foreign credit to finance large public spending programs, which in the past have caused huge budget deficits. Often, interest payments have become too overwhelming
for a government to meet, representing a large percentage of total GDP. These foreign obligations have become the subject of political debate and served as fuel for political parties of the opposition, which pressure the government not to make
payments to foreign creditors, but instead to use these funds for, among other things, social programs. Either due to an inability to pay or submission to political pressure, foreign governments have been forced to seek a restructuring of their loan
and/or bond obligations, have declared a temporary suspension of interest payments or have defaulted. These events have adversely affected the values of securities issued by foreign governments and corporations domiciled in those countries and have
negatively affected not only their cost of borrowing, but their ability to borrow in the future as well.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Europe.
<font> Investing in European countries may expose a Fund to the economic and political risks associated with Europe in general and the specific European countries in which it invests. The economies and markets of
European countries are often closely connected and interdependent, and events in one European country can have an adverse impact on other European countries. A Fund makes investments in securities of issuers that are domiciled in, or have
significant operations in, member states of the EU. A number of countries within the EU are also members of the EMU (the eurozone) and have adopted the euro as their currency. Eurozone membership requires member states to comply with restrictions on
inflation rates, deficits, interest rates, debt levels and fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every country in Europe. Changes in import or export tariffs, changes in governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes
in the exchange rate of the euro and other currencies of certain EU countries which are not in the eurozone, the default or threat of default by an EU member state on its sovereign debt, and/or an economic recession in an EU member state may have a
significant adverse effect on the economies of other EU member states and their trading partners. Although certain European countries are not in the eurozone, many of these countries are obliged to meet the</font></div> </div>

<div>criteria for joining the eurozone. Consequently, these countries must comply
with many of the restrictions noted above. The European financial markets have experienced volatility and adverse trends in years past due to concerns about economic downturns, rising government debt levels and the possible default of government
debt in several European countries, including, but not limited to, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. In order to prevent further economic deterioration, certain countries, without prior warning, can institute
“capital controls.” Countries may use these controls to restrict volatile movements of capital entering and exiting their country. Such controls may negatively affect a Fund’s investments. A default or debt restructuring by any
European country would adversely impact holders of that country’s debt and sellers of credit default swaps linked to that country’s creditworthiness, which may be located in countries other than those listed above. In addition, the
credit ratings of certain European countries were downgraded in the past. These events have adversely affected the value and exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect the economies of every country in Europe, including
countries that do not use the euro and non-EU member states. Responses to the financial problems by European governments, central banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may result in social
unrest and may limit future growth and economic recovery or have other unintended consequences. Further defaults or restructurings by governments and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, financial markets
and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The impact of these actions, especially if they occur in a disorderly fashion, is not clear but could be significant and
far-reaching and could adversely impact the value of a Fund’s investments in the region. In a referendum held on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) resolved to leave the EU (“Brexit”). The referendum has
introduced significant uncertainties and instability in the financial markets as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the EU. The outcome of negotiations remains uncertain. U.K. businesses are increasingly preparing for a disorderly Brexit, and the
consequences for European and U.K. businesses could be severe. A Fund will face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and consequences that may follow Brexit, including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates.
Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. Brexit could also lead to legal
uncertainty and politically divergent national laws and regulations as a new relationship between the U.K. and EU is defined and the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit could adversely affect any of
the companies to which a Fund has exposure and any other assets in which a Fund invests. The political, economic and legal consequences of Brexit are not yet known. In the short term, financial markets may experience heightened volatility,
particularly those in the U.K. and Europe, but possibly worldwide. The U.K. may be less stable than it has been in recent years, and investments in the U.K. may be difficult to value, or subject to greater or more frequent rises and falls in value.
In the longer term, there is likely to be a period of significant political, regulatory and commercial uncertainty as the U.K. seeks to negotiate its long-term exit from the EU and the terms of its future trading relationships.</div>
<div>Certain European countries have also developed increasingly
strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect European issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain and the independence movement in
Scotland, as well as governmental or other responses to such movements, may also create instability and uncertainty in the region. In addition, the national politics of countries in the EU have been unpredictable and subject to influence by varying
political groups and ideologies. The governments of EU countries may be subject to change and such countries may experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments may result in sudden and significant
investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe also could impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely affect the value and liquidity
of a Fund's investments.</div> <div>Risk of Investing in the Middle
East. <font> Many Middle Eastern countries have little or no democratic tradition, and the political and legal systems in such countries may have an adverse impact on a Fund. Many economies in the Middle East are
highly reliant on income from the sale of oil or trade with countries involved in the sale of oil, and their economies are therefore vulnerable to changes in the market for oil and foreign currency values. As global demand for oil fluctuates, many
Middle Eastern economies may be significantly impacted.</font></div>
<div>In addition, many Middle Eastern governments have exercised
and continue to exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector. In certain cases, a Middle Eastern country’s government may own or control many companies, including some of the largest companies in the country.
Accordingly, governmental actions in the future could have a significant effect on economic conditions in Middle Eastern countries. This could affect private sector companies and a Fund, as well as the value of securities in a Fund's
portfolio.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Certain Middle Eastern markets are in the earliest stages of
development. As a result, there may be a high concentration of market capitalization and trading volume in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries, as well as a high concentration of investors and financial
intermediaries. Brokers in Middle Eastern countries typically are fewer in number and less capitalized than brokers in the U.S.</div>
<div>The legal systems in certain Middle Eastern countries also may
have an adverse impact on a Fund. For example, the potential liability of a shareholder in a U.S. corporation with respect to acts of the corporation generally is limited to the amount of the shareholder’s investment. However, the notion of
limited liability is less clear in certain Middle Eastern countries. A Fund therefore may be liable in certain Middle Eastern countries for the acts of a corporation in which it invests for an amount greater than its actual investment in that
corporation. Similarly, the rights of investors in Middle Eastern issuers may be more limited than those of shareholders of a U.S. corporation. It may be difficult or impossible to obtain or enforce a legal judgment in a Middle Eastern country. Some
Middle Eastern countries prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on investments in their capital markets, particularly their equity markets, by foreign entities such as a Fund. For example, certain countries may require governmental approval
prior to investment by foreign persons or limit the amount of investment by foreign persons in a particular issuer. Certain Middle Eastern countries may also limit investment by foreign persons to only a specific class of securities of an issuer
that may have less advantageous terms (including price) than securities of the issuer available for purchase by nationals of the relevant Middle Eastern country.</div>
<div>The manner in which foreign investors may invest in companies
in certain Middle Eastern countries, as well as limitations on those investments, may have an adverse impact on the operations of a Fund. For example, in certain of these countries, a Fund may be required to invest initially through a local broker
or other entity and then have the shares that were purchased re-registered in the name of a Fund. Re-registration in some instances may not be possible on a timely basis. This may result in a delay during which a Fund may be denied certain of its
rights as an investor, including rights as to dividends or to be made aware of certain corporate actions. There also may be instances where a Fund places a purchase order but is subsequently informed, at the time of re-registration, that the
permissible allocation of the investment to foreign investors has already been filled and, consequently, a Fund may not be able to invest in the relevant company.</div>
<div>Substantial limitations may exist in certain Middle Eastern
countries with respect to a Fund’s ability to repatriate investment income or capital gains. A Fund could be adversely affected by delays in, or a refusal to grant, any required governmental approval for repatriation of capital, as well as by
the application to a Fund of any restrictions on investment.</div>
<div>Certain Middle Eastern countries may be heavily dependent upon
international trade and, consequently, have been and may continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values and other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries
with which they trade. These countries also have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade. In addition, certain issuers located in Middle Eastern countries in which a Fund invests
may operate in, or have dealings with, countries subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations, and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer
may sustain damage to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer which operates in, or has dealings with, such countries. A Fund, as an investor in such issuers, will be indirectly subject to those risks.</div>
<div>Certain Middle Eastern countries have strained relations with
other Middle Eastern countries due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, international alliances, defense concerns or other reasons, which may adversely affect the economies of these Middle Eastern countries. Certain Middle Eastern
countries experience significant unemployment, as well as widespread underemployment. There has also been a recent increase in recruitment efforts and an aggressive push for territorial control by terrorist groups in the region, which has led to an
outbreak of warfare and hostilities. Warfare in Syria has spread to surrounding areas, including many portions of Iraq and Turkey. Such hostilities may continue into the future or may escalate at any time due to ethnic, racial, political, religious
or ideological tensions between groups in the region or foreign intervention or lack of intervention, among other factors.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in North America. <font> A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations or an economic recession in any North American country can have a significant economic effect on the entire North American region and on some or all of
the North American countries in which a Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>The U.S. is Canada's and Mexico's largest trading and
investment partner. The Canadian and Mexican economies are significantly affected by developments in the U.S. economy. Since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) in 1994 among Canada, the U.S. and
Mexico, total merchandise trade among the three countries has</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>increased. However, political developments in the U.S., including
renegotiation of NAFTA and imposition of tariffs by the U.S., may have implications for the trade arrangements among the U.S., Mexico and Canada, which could negatively affect the value of securities held by a Fund. Policy and legislative changes in
one country may have a significant effect on North American markets generally, as well as on the value of certain securities held by a Fund.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Basic Materials Industry. <font> Issuers in the basic materials industry could be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, exchange rates, import controls and increased competition. Companies in the basic materials industry may be subject
to swift fluctuations in supply and demand. Fluctuations may be caused by events relating to political and economic developments, the environmental impact of basic materials operations, and the success of exploration projects. Production of
industrial materials often exceeds demand as a result of over-building or economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns. Issuers in the basic materials industry are at risk for environmental damage and product liability claims and may be
adversely affected by depletion of resources, delays in technical progress, labor relations, tax and government regulations related to changes to, among other things, energy and environmental policies.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Capital Goods Industry. <font> Companies in the capital goods industry may be affected by fluctuations in the business cycle and by other factors affecting manufacturing demands. Companies in the capital goods industry depend heavily on
corporate spending. Companies in the capital goods industry may perform well during times of economic expansion, and as economic conditions worsen, the demand for capital goods may decrease due to weakening demand, worsening business cash flows,
tighter credit controls and deteriorating profitability. During times of economic volatility, corporate spending may fall and adversely affect the capital goods industry. This industry may also be affected by changes in interest rates, corporate tax
rates and other government policies. Many capital goods are sold internationally and such companies are subject to market conditions in other countries and regions.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Chemicals Industry. <font> The success of companies in the chemicals industry can be significantly affected by intense competition, product obsolescence, raw materials prices, and government regulation. As regulations are developed and
enforced, chemicals companies could be required to alter or cease production of a product, pay fines, pay for cleaning up a disposal site or agree to restrictions on their operations. In addition, chemicals companies may be subject to risks
associated with production, handling, and disposal, as some of the materials and processes used by these companies involve hazardous components.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Cyclical Industry. <font> A Fund may invest in consumer cyclical companies, which rely heavily on business cycles and economic conditions. Consumer cyclical companies include automotive manufacturers, retail companies, and housing-related
companies. The consumer cyclical industry can be significantly affected by several factors, including, without limitation, the performance of domestic and international economies, exchange rates, changing consumer tastes and trends, marketing
campaigns, cyclical revenue generation, consumer confidence, commodity price volatility, labor relations, interest rates, import and export controls, intense competition, technological developments and government regulation.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Discretionary Sector. <font> Companies engaged in the design, production or distribution of products or services for the consumer discretionary sector (including, without limitation, television and radio broadcasting, manufacturing,
publishing, recording and musical instruments, motion pictures, photography, amusement and theme parks, gaming casinos, sporting goods and sports arenas, camping and recreational equipment, toys and games, apparel, travel-related services,
automobiles, hotels and motels, and fast food and other restaurants) are subject to the risk that their products or services may become obsolete quickly. The success of these companies can depend heavily on disposable household income and consumer
spending. During periods of an expanding economy, the consumer discretionary sector may outperform the consumer staples sector, but may underperform when economic conditions worsen. Moreover, the consumer discretionary sector can be significantly
affected by several factors, including, without limitation, the performance of domestic and international economies, exchange rates, changing consumer preferences, demographics, marketing campaigns, cyclical revenue generation, consumer confidence,
commodity price volatility, labor relations, interest rates, import and export controls, intense competition, technological developments and government regulation.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Goods Industry. <font> Companies in the consumer goods industry include companies involved in the design, production or distribution of goods for consumers, including food, household, home, personal and office products, clothing and
textiles. The success of the consumer goods industry is tied closely to the performance of the domestic and international economy, interest rates, exchange rates, competition, consumer confidence and consumer disposable income. The consumer goods
industry may be affected by trends, marketing campaigns and other factors</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>affecting consumer demand. Governmental regulation affecting the use of
various food additives may affect the profitability of certain companies in the consumer goods industry. Moreover, international events may affect food and beverage companies that derive a substantial portion of their net income from foreign
countries. In addition, tobacco companies may be adversely affected by new laws, regulations and litigation. Many consumer goods may be marketed globally, and consumer goods companies may be affected by the demand and market conditions in other
countries and regions. Companies in the consumer goods industry may be subject to severe competition, which may also have an adverse impact on their profitability. Changes in demographics and consumer preferences may affect the success of consumer
products.</div> <div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Services
Industry. <font> The success of firms in the consumer services industry and certain retailers (including food and beverage, general retailers, media, and travel and leisure) is tied closely to the performance of the
domestic and international economy, interest rates, exchange rates, competition and consumer confidence. The consumer services industry depends heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending. Companies in the consumer services industry
may be subject to severe competition, which may also have an adverse impact on their profitability. Changes in demographics and consumer preferences may affect the success of consumer service providers.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Staples Sector. <font> Companies in the consumer staples sector may be adversely affected by changes in the global economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, and production spending. Companies in the
consumer staples sector may also be affected by changes in global economic, environmental and political events, economic conditions, the depletion of resources, and government regulation. For instance, government regulations may affect the
permissibility of using various food additives and production methods of companies that make food products, which could affect company profitability. In addition, tobacco companies may be adversely affected by the adoption of proposed legislation
and/or by litigation. Companies in the consumer staples sector also may be subject to risks pertaining to the supply of, demand for and prices of raw materials. The prices of raw materials fluctuate in response to a number of factors, including,
without limitation, changes in government agricultural support programs, exchange rates, import and export controls, changes in international agricultural and trading policies, and seasonal and weather conditions. Companies in the consumer staples
sector may be subject to severe competition, which may also have an adverse impact on their profitability.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Energy Sector. <font> Companies in the energy sector are strongly affected by the levels and volatility of global energy prices, energy supply and demand, government regulations and policies, energy production and conservation efforts,
technological change, development of alternative energy sources, and other factors that they cannot control. These companies may also lack resources and have limited business lines. Energy companies may have relatively high levels of debt and may be
more likely to restructure their businesses if there are downturns in certain energy markets or in the global economy. If an energy company in a Fund's portfolio becomes distressed, a Fund could lose all or a substantial portion of its
investment.</font></div> <div>The energy sector is cyclical and is
highly dependent on commodity prices; prices and supplies of energy may fluctuate significantly over short and long periods of time due to, among other things, national and international political changes, Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (“OPEC”) policies, changes in relationships among OPEC members and between OPEC and oil-importing nations, the regulatory environment, taxation policies, and the economy of the key energy-consuming countries. Commodity prices
have recently been subject to increased volatility and declines, which may negatively affect companies in which a Fund invests.</div>
<div>Companies in the energy sector may be adversely affected by
terrorism, natural disasters or other catastrophes. Companies in the energy sector are at risk of civil liability from accidents resulting in injury, loss of life or property, pollution or other environmental damage claims. Disruptions in the oil
industry or shifts in fuel consumption may significantly impact companies in this sector. Significant oil and gas deposits are located in emerging markets countries where corruption and security may raise significant risks, in addition to the other
risks of investing in emerging markets. Additionally, the Middle East, where many companies in the energy sector may operate, has historically and recently experienced widespread social unrest.</div>
<div>Companies in the energy sector may also be adversely affected

<div>small number of customers that are largely composed of governmental entities
and utilities, governmental budget constraints may have a significant impact on the stock prices of companies in this sector. The energy sector is highly regulated. Entities operating in the energy sector are subject to significant regulation of
nearly every aspect of their operations by governmental agencies. Such regulation can change rapidly or over time in both scope and intensity. Stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be enacted in the future which would likely
increase compliance costs and may materially adversely affect the financial performance of companies in the energy sector.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Financials Sector. <font> Companies in the financials sector include regional and money center banks, securities brokerage firms, asset management companies, savings banks and thrift institutions, specialty finance companies (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, credit card, mortgage providers), insurance and insurance brokerage firms, consumer finance firms, financial conglomerates and foreign banking and
financial companies.</font></div> <div>Most financial companies are
subject to extensive governmental regulation, which limits their activities and may affect their ability to earn a profit from a given line of business. Government regulation may change frequently and may have significant adverse consequences for
companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by the regulation. Direct governmental intervention in the operations of financial companies and financial markets may materially and adversely affect the companies in which a Fund
invests, including legislation in many countries that may increase government regulation, repatriation and other intervention. The impact of governmental intervention and legislative changes on any individual financial company or on the financials
sector as a whole cannot be predicted. The valuation of financial companies has been and continues to be subject to unprecedented volatility and may be influenced by unpredictable factors, including interest rate risk and sovereign debt default.
Certain financial businesses are subject to intense competitive pressures, including market share and price competition. Financial companies in foreign countries are subject to market specific and general regulatory and interest rate concerns. In
particular, government regulation in certain foreign countries may include taxes and controls on interest rates, credit availability, minimum capital requirements, bans on short sales, limits on prices and restrictions on currency transfers. In
addition, companies in the financials sector may be the targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or customer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</div>
<div>The profitability of banks, savings and loan associations and
financial companies is largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change; for instance, when interest rates go up, the value of securities issued by many types of companies in
the financials sector generally goes down. In other words, financial companies may be adversely affected in certain market cycles, including, without limitation, during periods of rising interest rates, which may restrict the availability and
increase the cost of capital, and during periods of declining economic conditions, which may cause, among other things, credit losses due to financial difficulties of borrowers.</div>
<div>In addition, general economic conditions are important to the
operations of these companies, and financial difficulties of borrowers may have an adverse effect on the profitability of financial companies. Financial companies can be highly dependent upon access to capital markets, and any impediments to such
access, such as adverse overall economic conditions or a negative perception in the capital markets of a financial company’s financial condition or prospects, could adversely affect its business. Deterioration of credit markets can have an
adverse impact on a broad range of financial markets, causing certain financial companies to incur large losses. In these conditions, companies in the financials sector may experience significant declines in the valuation of their assets, take
actions to raise capital and even cease operations. Some financial companies may also be required to accept or borrow significant amounts of capital from government sources and may face future government-imposed restrictions on their businesses or
increased government intervention. In addition, there is no guarantee that governments will provide any such relief in the future. These actions may cause the securities of many companies in the financials sector to decline in value.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Healthcare Sector. <font> Companies in the healthcare sector are often issuers whose profitability may be affected by extensive government regulation, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising or falling costs of
medical products and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, a limited number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market developments. Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent
on patent protection and the actual or perceived safety and efficiency of their products.</font></div>
<div>Patents have a limited duration, and, upon expiration, other
companies may market substantially similar “generic” products that are typically sold at a lower price than the patented product, which can cause the original developer of the product to</div> </div>

<div>lose market share and/or reduce the price charged for the product, resulting
in lower profits for the original developer. As a result, the expiration of patents may adversely affect the profitability of these companies.</div>
<div>In addition, because the products and services of many
companies in the healthcare sector affect the health and well-being of many individuals, these companies are especially susceptible to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims. Healthcare companies are subject to
competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may result in price discounting. Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The process of obtaining such approvals may be long and
costly, which can result in increased development costs, delayed cost recovery and loss of competitive advantage to the extent that rival companies have developed competing products or procedures, adversely affecting the company’s revenues and
profitability. In other words, delays in the regulatory approval process may diminish the opportunity for a company to profit from a new product or to bring a new product to market, which could have a material adverse effect on a company’s
business. Healthcare companies may also be strongly affected by scientific biotechnology or technological developments, and their products may quickly become obsolete. Also, many healthcare companies offer products and services that are subject to
governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies or laws. Changes in governmental policies or laws may span a wide range of topics, including cost control, national health insurance, incentives for
compensation in the provision of healthcare services, tax incentives and penalties related to healthcare insurance premiums, and promotion of prepaid healthcare plans. In addition, a number of legislative proposals concerning healthcare have been
considered by the U.S. Congress in recent years. It is unclear what proposals will ultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect they may have on companies in the healthcare sector.</div>
<div>Additionally, the expansion of facilities by
healthcare-related providers may be subject to “determinations of need” by certain government authorities. This process not only generally increases the time and costs involved in these expansions, but also makes expansion plans
uncertain, limiting the revenue and profitability growth potential of healthcare-related facilities operators and negatively affecting the prices of their securities. Moreover, in recent years, both local and national governmental budgets have come
under pressure to reduce spending and control healthcare costs, which could both adversely affect regulatory processes and public funding available for healthcare products, services and facilities.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Industrials Sector. <font> The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by supply of and demand for both their specific products or services and for industrials sector products in general.
The products of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction. Government regulations, world events and economic conditions may affect the performance of companies in the
industrials sector. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. For example, commodity price declines and unit volume reductions resulting from an
over-supply of materials used in the industrials sector can adversely affect the sector. Furthermore, companies in the industrials sector may be subject to liability for environmental damage, product liability claims, depletion of resources, and
mandated expenditures for safety and pollution control.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Infrastructure Industry. <font> Companies in the infrastructure industry may be subject to a variety of factors that could adversely affect their business or operations, including high interest costs in connection with capital construction
programs, high degrees of leverage, costs associated with governmental, environmental and other regulations, the effects of economic slowdowns, increased competition from other providers of services, uncertainties concerning costs, the level of
government spending on infrastructure projects, and other factors. Infrastructure companies may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, changes in exchange rates, import controls, depletion of resources, technological developments, and
labor relations. There is also the risk that corruption may negatively affect publicly funded infrastructure projects, especially in emerging markets, resulting in delays and cost overruns. Infrastructure issuers can be significantly affected by
government spending policies because companies involved in this industry rely to a significant extent on U.S. and other government demand for their products.</font></div>
<div>Infrastructure companies in the oil and gas industry may be
adversely affected by government regulation or world events in the regions where the companies operate (<font>e.g.</font>, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of
restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest, violence or labor unrest). Infrastructure companies may have significant capital investments in, or engage in transactions involving, emerging market
countries, which may heighten these risks.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

 Table of Contents </a> </div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Operations Risk. <font>The failure
of an infrastructure company to carry adequate insurance or to operate its assets appropriately could lead to significant losses. Infrastructure may be adversely affected by environmental clean-up costs and catastrophic events such as earthquakes,
hurricanes and terrorist acts.</font></div> <div>Customer Risk. <font>Infrastructure companies can be dependent upon a narrow customer base. Additionally, if these customers fail to pay their obligations, significant revenues could be lost and may not be replaceable.</font></div>
<div>Regulatory Risk.
<font>Infrastructure companies may be subject to significant regulation by various governmental authorities and also may be affected by regulation of rates charged to customers, service interruption due to environmental,
operational or other events, the imposition of special tariffs and changes in tax laws, regulatory policies and accounting standards.</font></div>
<div>Strategic Asset Risk.
<font>Infrastructure companies may control significant strategic assets (</font>e.g.<font>, major pipelines or highways), which are assets that have a national or regional profile, and may have
monopolistic characteristics. Given their national or regional profile or irreplaceable nature, strategic assets could generate additional risk not common in other industry sectors and they may be targeted for terrorist acts or adverse political
actions.</font></div> <div>Interest Rate Risk. <font>Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for infrastructure companies, which could negatively impact their ability to meet payment obligations.</font></div>
<div>Leverage Risk. <font>Infrastructure
companies can be highly leveraged, which increases investments risk and other risks normally associated with debt financing and could adversely affect an infrastructure company's operations and market value in periods of rising interest
rates.</font></div> <div>Inflation Risk. <font>Many infrastructure companies may have fixed income streams. Consequently, their market values may decline in times of higher inflation. Additionally, the prices that an infrastructure company is able to charge users of
its assets may be linked to inflation, whether by government regulation, contractual arrangement or other factors. In this case, changes in the rate of inflation may affect the company's profitability.</font></div>
<div>Transportation Risk. <font>The
stock prices of companies in the transportation industry group are affected by both supply and demand for their specific product. Government regulation, world events and economic conditions may affect the performance of companies in the
transportation industry group.</font></div> <div>Oil and Gas Risk.<font> The profitability of oil and gas companies is related to worldwide energy prices, exploration, and production spending.</font></div>
<div>Utilities Risk. <font>Utilities
companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on their profit margins. The rates charged by regulated utility companies are subject to review and limitation by governmental regulatory
commissions.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in the Insurance
Industry. <font> The insurance industry is subject to extensive government regulation in some countries and can be significantly affected by changes in interest rates, general economic conditions, price and marketing
competition, the imposition of premium rate caps or other changes in government regulation or tax law. Different segments of the insurance industry can be significantly affected by changes in mortality and morbidity rates, environmental clean-up
costs and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Media Sub-Industry. <font> Companies in the media sub-industry may encounter distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition, particularly in formulating new products and services using new
technology. Media companies are subject to risks that include cyclicality of revenues and earnings, a potential decrease in the discretionary income of targeted individuals, changing consumer tastes and interests, competition in the industry and the
potential for increased state and federal regulation. Advertising spending is an important source of revenue for media companies. During economic downturns, advertising spending typically decreases and, as a result, media companies tend to generate
less revenue.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in Municipal
Securities in the Utilities Sector. <font> Certain municipal securities are issued by public bodies, including state and municipal utility authorities, to, among other things, finance the operation or expansion of
utility entities. Various future economic and other conditions may adversely affect utility entities, including inflation, increases in financing requirements, increases in raw material costs and other operating costs, changes in demand for services
and the effects of environmental and other governmental regulations. Municipal securities that are issued to finance a particular utility project</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>often depend on revenues from that project to make principal and interest
payments. Adverse conditions and developments affecting a particular utility project can result in lower revenues to the issuer of the municipal securities. Certain utilities are subject to specific risks. Gas utilities are subject to risks of
supply conditions and increased competition from other providers of utility services. In addition, gas utilities are affected by gas prices, which may be magnified to the extent that a gas utility enters into long-term contracts for the purchase or
sale of gas at a fixed price, since such prices may change significantly and to the disadvantage of the gas utility.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Oil and Gas Industry. <font> Companies in the oil and gas industry are strongly affected by the levels and volatility of global energy prices, oil and gas supply and demand, government regulations and policies, oil and gas production and
conservation efforts and technological change. The oil and gas industry is cyclical and from time to time may experience a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or qualified personnel, or due to significant demand, such services may not be
available on commercially reasonable terms. Prices and supplies of oil and gas may fluctuate significantly over short and long periods of time due to national and international political changes, OPEC policies, changes in relationships among OPEC
members and between OPEC and oil-importing nations, the regulatory environment, taxation policies, and the economies of key energy-consuming countries. Disruptions in the oil sub-industry or shifts in energy consumption may significantly impact
companies in this industry. For instance, significant oil and gas deposits are located in emerging market countries where corruption and security may raise significant risks, in addition to the other risks of investing in emerging markets. In
addition, the Middle East, where many companies in the oil and gas industry may operate, has recently experienced widespread social unrest. Oil and gas companies operate in a highly competitive industry, with intense price competition. A significant
portion of their revenues may depend on a relatively small number of customers, including governmental entities and utilities.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Real Estate Industry. <font> Companies in the real estate industry include companies that invest in real estate, such as real estate investment trusts (“REITs”), real estate holding and operating companies or real estate
development companies (collectively, “Real Estate Companies”). Investing in Real Estate Companies exposes investors to the risks of owning real estate directly, as well as to risks that relate specifically to the way in which Real Estate
Companies are organized and operated. The real estate industry is highly sensitive to general and local economic conditions and developments, and characterized by intense competition and periodic overbuilding. Investing in Real Estate Companies
involves various risks. Some risks that are specific to Real Estate Companies are discussed in greater detail below.</font></div>
<div>Interest Rate Risk.<font> Rising
interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could negatively impact a Real Estate Company’s ability to meet its payment obligations. Declining interest rates could result in increased prepayment on
loans and require redeployment of capital in less desirable investments.</font></div>
<div>Leverage Risk.<font> Real Estate
Companies may use leverage (and some may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk and could adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s operations and market value in periods of rising interest rates. Real Estate Companies are also
exposed to the risks normally associated with debt financing. Financial covenants related to a Real Estate Company’s leverage may affect the ability of the Real Estate Company to operate effectively. In addition, real property may be subject
to the quality of credit extended and defaults by borrowers and tenants. If the properties do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses, including, where applicable, debt service, ground lease payments, tenant improvements,
third-party leasing commissions and other capital expenditures, the income and ability of a Real Estate Company to make payments of any interest and principal on its debt securities will be adversely affected.</font></div>
<div>Loan Foreclosure Risk.<font> Real
Estate Companies may foreclose on loans that the Real Estate Company originated and/or acquired. Foreclosure may generate negative publicity for the underlying property that affects its market value. In addition to the length and expense of such
proceedings, the validity of the terms of the applicable loan may not be recognized in foreclosure proceedings. Claims and defenses asserted by borrowers or other lenders may interfere with the enforcement of rights by a Real Estate Company.
Parallel proceedings, such as bankruptcy, may also delay resolution and limit the amount of recovery on a foreclosed loan by a Real Estate Company even where the property underlying the loan is liquidated.</font></div>
<div>Property Risk.<font> Real Estate
Companies may be subject to risks relating to functional obsolescence or reduced desirability of properties; extended vacancies due to economic conditions and tenant bankruptcies; catastrophic events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist
acts; and casualty or condemnation losses. Real estate income and values also may be greatly affected by demographic trends, such as population shifts or changing tastes and values, or increasing vacancies or declining rents resulting from legal,
cultural, technological, global or local economic developments.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

 Table of Contents </a> </div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Distressed Investment Risk.<font>
Real Estate Companies may invest in distressed, defaulted or out-of-favor bank loans. Identification and implementation by a Real Estate Company of loan modification and restructure programs involves a high degree of uncertainty. Even successful
implementation may still require adverse compromises and may not prevent bankruptcy. Real Estate Companies may also invest in other debt instruments that may become non-performing, including the securities of companies with higher credit and market
risk due to financial or operational difficulties. Higher risk securities may be less liquid and more volatile than the securities of companies not in distress.</font></div>
<div>Underlying Investment Risk.<font>
Real Estate Companies make investments in a variety of debt and equity instruments with varying risk profiles. For instance, Real Estate Companies may invest in debt instruments secured by commercial property that have higher risks of delinquency
and foreclosure than loans on single family homes due to a variety of factors associated with commercial property, including the tie between income available to service debt and productive use of the property. Real Estate Companies may also invest
in debt instruments and preferred equity that are junior in an issuer’s capital structure and that involve privately negotiated structures. Subordinated debt investments, such as B-Notes and mezzanine loans, involve a greater credit risk of
default due to the need to service more senior debt of the issuer. Similarly, preferred equity investments involve a greater risk of loss than conventional debt financing due to their non-collateralized nature and subordinated ranking. Investments
in CMBS may also be junior in priority in the event of bankruptcy or similar proceedings. Investments in senior loans may be effectively subordinated if the senior loan is pledged as collateral. The ability of a holder of junior claims to proceed
against a defaulting issuer is circumscribed by the terms of the particular contractual arrangement, which vary considerably from transaction to transaction.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk.<font> Real Estate
Companies are dependent upon management skills and may have limited financial resources. Real Estate Companies are generally not diversified and may be subject to heavy cash flow dependency, default by borrowers and voluntary liquidation. In
addition, transactions between Real Estate Companies and their affiliates may be subject to conflicts of interest, which may adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s shareholders. A Real Estate Company may also have joint venture investments
in certain of its properties, and, consequently, its ability to control decisions relating to such properties may be limited.</font></div>
<div>Illiquidity Risk.<font> Investing
in Real Estate Companies may involve risks similar to those associated with investing in small-capitalization companies. Real Estate Company securities, like the securities of small-capitalization companies, may be more volatile than, and perform
differently from, shares of large-capitalization companies. There may be less trading in Real Estate Company shares, which means that buy and sell transactions in those shares could have a magnified impact on share price, resulting in abrupt or
erratic price fluctuations. In addition, real estate is relatively illiquid, and, therefore, a Real Estate Company may have a limited ability to vary or liquidate properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> Real
Estate Companies may own a limited number of properties and concentrate their investments in a particular geographic region or property type. Economic downturns affecting a particular region, industry or property type may lead to a high volume of
defaults within a short period.</font></div> <div>U.S. Tax Risk.<font> Certain U.S. Real Estate Companies are subject to special U.S. federal tax requirements. A REIT that fails to comply with such tax requirements may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation, which may affect the value
of the REIT and the characterization of the REIT’s distributions. The U.S. federal tax requirement that a REIT distribute substantially all of its net income to its shareholders may result in a REIT having insufficient capital for future
expenditures. A REIT that successfully maintains its qualification may still become subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes, including excise, penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage recording, and transfer taxes, both directly and indirectly
through its subsidiaries.</font></div> <div>Regulatory Risk.<font> Real estate income and values may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable domestic and foreign laws (including tax laws). Government actions, such as tax increases, zoning law changes or environmental
regulations, also may have a major impact on real estate income and values. In addition, quarterly compliance with regulations limiting the proportion of asset types held by a U.S. REIT may force certain Real Estate Companies to liquidate or
restructure otherwise attractive investments. Some countries may not recognize REITs or comparable structures as a viable form of real estate funds.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Retail Industry. <font> The retail industry may be affected by changes in domestic and international economies, consumer confidence, disposable household income and spending, and consumer tastes and preferences. Companies in the retail
industry face intense competition, which may have an adverse effect on their profitability. The success of companies in the retail industry may be strongly affected by social trends, marketing campaigns and public</font></div> </div>

<div>perceptions. Companies in the retail industry may be dependent on outside
financing, which may be difficult to obtain. Many of these companies are dependent on third party suppliers and distribution systems. Retail companies may be unable to protect their intellectual property rights or may be liable for infringing the
intellectual property rights of others.</div> <div>Risk of Investing
in the Technology Sector. <font> Technology companies are characterized by periodic new product introductions, innovations and evolving industry standards, and, as a result, face intense competition, both
domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Companies in the technology sector are often smaller and less experienced companies and may be subject to greater risks than larger companies; these risks may be
heightened for technology companies in foreign markets. Technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of technology companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological
developments and frequent new product introduction, changes in consumer and business purchasing patterns, unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. In addition, a rising interest rate environment
tends to negatively affect companies in the technology sector because, in such an environment, those companies with high market valuations may appear less attractive to investors, which may cause sharp decreases in the companies’ market
prices. Companies in the technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. The technology sector may also be
adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced or characterized by unpredictable factors. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies in the technology sector
may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Telecommunications Sector. <font> The telecommunications sector of a country’s economy is often subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with governmental regulations, delays or failure to receive required regulatory
approvals, or the enactment of new regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of telecommunications companies. Government actions around the world, specifically in the area of pre-marketing clearance of products and prices, can be
arbitrary and unpredictable. Companies in the telecommunications sector may experience distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition, particularly in developing new products and services using new
technology. Technological innovations may make the products and services of certain telecommunications companies obsolete. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies in the telecommunications
sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Transportation Infrastructure Industry.
<font> Municipal securities include, among others, bonds payable from fuel taxes and tolls for municipal toll roads, as well as general airport bonds. Issuers in the transportation infrastructure industry can be
significantly affected by economic changes, fuel prices, labor relations, technology developments, exchange rates, industry competition, insurance costs and deteriorating public infrastructure, such as bridges, roads, rails, ports and airports.
Municipal securities that are issued to finance a particular transportation project often depend on revenues from that project to make principal and interest payments. Adverse conditions and developments affecting a particular project can result in
lower revenues to the issuer of the municipal securities. Other risk factors that may affect the transportation infrastructure industry include the risk of increases in fuel and other operating costs and the effects of regulatory changes or other
government decisions.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in the
Utilities Sector. <font> The utilities sector may be adversely affected by changing commodity prices, government regulation stipulating rates charged by utilities, increased tariffs, changes in tax laws, interest
rate fluctuations and changes in the cost of providing specific utility services. The utilities industry is also subject to potential terrorist attacks, natural disasters and severe weather conditions, as well as regulatory and operational burdens
associated with the operation and maintenance of nuclear facilities. Government regulators monitor and control utility revenues and costs, and therefore may limit utility profits. In certain countries, regulatory authorities may also restrict a
company’s access to new markets, thereby diminishing the company’s long-term prospects.</font></div>
<div>There are substantial differences among the regulatory
practices and policies of various jurisdictions, and any regulatory agency may make major shifts in policy from time to time. There is no assurance that regulatory authorities will, in the future, grant rate increases. Additionally, existing and
possible future regulatory legislation may make it even more difficult for utilities to obtain adequate relief. Certain of the issuers of securities held in a Fund's portfolio may own or operate nuclear generating facilities. Governmental
authorities may from time to time review existing policies and impose additional requirements governing the licensing, construction and operation of nuclear power plants. Prolonged changes in climate</div> </div>

<div>conditions can also have a significant impact on both the revenues of an
electric and gas utility as well as the expenses of a utility, particularly a hydro-based electric utility.</div>
<div>The rates that traditional regulated utility companies may
charge their customers generally are subject to review and limitation by governmental regulatory commissions. Rate changes may occur only after a prolonged approval period or may not occur at all, which could adversely affect utility companies when
costs are rising. The value of regulated utility debt securities (and, to a lesser extent, equity securities) tends to have an inverse relationship to the movement of interest rates. Certain utility companies have experienced full or partial
deregulation in recent years. These utility companies are frequently more similar to industrial companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been permitted by regulators to diversify outside of their original geographic regions
and their traditional lines of business. As a result, some companies may be forced to defend their core business and may be less profitable. Deregulation may also permit a utility company to expand outside of its traditional lines of business and
engage in riskier ventures.</div> <div>Proxy Voting Policy</div>
<div>For all Funds other than the iShares ESG 1-5 Year USD
Corporate Bond ETF, iShares ESG U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF and iShares ESG USD Corporate Bond ETF (these three Funds together, the “Sustainable Funds”), the Board has delegated the voting of proxies for each Fund’s securities to BFA
pursuant to the Funds' Proxy Voting Policy (the “iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policy”), and BlackRock, Inc. has adopted policies and procedures (the “BlackRock Proxy Voting Policies”) governing proxy voting by accounts
managed by BlackRock, Inc., including the Funds. For the Sustainable Funds, the Board has delegated the voting of proxies for each Sustainable Fund’s securities to BFA pursuant to the Sustainable Funds’ Proxy Voting Policy (the
“iShares Sustainable ETFs Proxy Voting Policy”), and BlackRock, Inc. has adopted the BlackRock Proxy Voting Policies and supplemental guidelines applicable to environmental and social issues investing (the “Supplemental BlackRock
Sustainable Proxy Voting Guidelines”) governing proxy voting by the iShares sustainable ETFs managed by BlackRock, Inc., including the Sustainable Funds.</div>
<div>Under the BlackRock Proxy Voting Policies, BFA will vote
proxies related to Fund securities in the best interests of a Fund and its shareholders. From time to time, a vote may present a conflict between the interests of a Fund’s shareholders, on the one hand, and those of BFA, or any affiliated
person of a Fund or BFA, on the other. BFA maintains policies and procedures that are designed to prevent undue influence on BFA’s proxy voting activity that might stem from any relationship between the issuer of a proxy (or any dissident
shareholder) and BFA, BFA’s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund’s affiliates. Most conflicts are managed through a structural separation of BFA’s Corporate Governance Group from BFA’s employees with sales and client
responsibilities. In addition, BFA maintains procedures to ensure that all engagements with corporate issuers or dissident shareholders are managed consistently and without regard to BFA’s relationship with the issuer of the proxy or the

<div>Under the Supplemental BlackRock Sustainable Proxy Voting
Guidelines, the Sustainable Funds maintain proxy voting guidelines consistent with the belief that well-managed companies will deal effectively with the material environmental and social (E&amp; S) factors relevant to their businesses. BFA expects
companies to identify and report on the material, business-specific E&amp;S risks and opportunities and to explain how these are managed. BFA may vote against the election of directors where BFA has concerns that a company might not be dealing with
E&amp;S issues appropriately. For E&amp;S shareholder proposals, BFA may vote differently for different funds based on BFA’s assessment of the materiality of the underlying issues in conjunction with an assessment that investors in the
Sustainable Funds may expect more urgent action be taken by the company.</div>

<div>Portfolio Holdings Information</div>
<div>The Board has adopted a policy regarding the disclosure of the
Funds' portfolio holdings information that requires that such information be disclosed in a manner that: (i) is consistent with applicable legal requirements and in the best interests of each Fund’s respective shareholders; (ii) does not put
the interests of BFA, the Distributor or any affiliated person of BFA or the Distributor, above those of Fund shareholders; (iii) does not advantage any current or prospective Fund shareholders over any other current or prospective Fund
shareholders, except to the extent that certain Entities (as described below) may receive portfolio holdings information not available to other current or prospective Fund shareholders in connection with the dissemination of information necessary
for transactions in Creation Units, as discussed below, and certain information may be provided to personnel of BFA and its affiliates who manage funds that invest a significant percentage of their assets in shares of the Fund for the purpose of
facilitating risk management and hedging activities; and (iv) does not provide selective access to portfolio holdings information except pursuant to the procedures outlined below and to the extent appropriate confidentiality arrangements limiting
the use of such information are in effect. The “Entities” referred to in sub-section (iii) above are generally limited to National Securities Clearing Corporation (“NSCC”) members, subscribers to various fee-based
subscription services, large institutional investors (known as “Authorized Participants”) that have been authorized by the Distributor to purchase and redeem large blocks of shares pursuant to legal requirements and market makers and
other institutional market participants and entities that provide information or transactional services.</div>
<div>Each business day, each Fund's portfolio holdings information
is provided to the Distributor or other agent for dissemination through the facilities of the NSCC and/or other fee-based subscription services to NSCC members and/or subscribers to those other fee-based subscription services, including market
makers and Authorized Participants, and to entities that publish and/or analyze such information in connection with the process of purchasing or redeeming Creation Units or trading shares of the Funds in the secondary market or evaluating such
potential transactions. This information typically reflects each Fund’s anticipated holdings on the following business day.</div>
<div>Daily access to information concerning the Funds' portfolio
holdings is permitted: (i) to certain personnel of those service providers that are involved in portfolio management and providing administrative, operational, risk management, or other support to portfolio management; and (ii) to other personnel of
the Funds' investment adviser, the Distributor and their affiliates, and the administrator, custodian and fund accountant who deal directly with, or assist in, functions related to investment management, distribution, administration, custody,
securities lending and fund accounting, as may be necessary to conduct business in the ordinary course in a manner consistent with federal securities laws and regulations thereunder. In addition, each Fund discloses its fixed-income and/or equity
portfolio holdings daily at <font>www.iShares.com</font>. More information about this disclosure is available at <font>www.iShares.com</font>.</div>
<div>Portfolio holdings information made available in connection
with the creation/redemption process may be provided to other entities that provide services to the Funds in the ordinary course of business after it has been disseminated to the NSCC. From time to time, information concerning portfolio holdings
other than portfolio holdings information made available in connection with the creation/redemption process, as discussed above, may be provided to other entities that provide services to the Funds, including rating or ranking organizations, in the
ordinary course of business, no earlier than one business day following the date of the information.</div>
<div>Each Fund discloses its complete portfolio holdings schedule
in public filings with the SEC within 70 days of the end of the second and fourth fiscal quarters and within 60 days of the end of the first and third fiscal quarters and will provide such information to shareholders as required by federal
securities laws and regulations thereunder. A Fund may, however, voluntarily disclose all or part of its portfolio holdings other than in connection with the creation/redemption process, as discussed above, in advance of required filings with the
SEC, provided that such information is made generally available to all shareholders and other interested parties in a manner that is consistent with the above policy for disclosure of portfolio holdings information. Such information may be made
available through a publicly available website or other means that make the information available to all likely interested parties contemporaneously.</div>
<div>The Trust's Chief Compliance Officer or his delegate may
authorize disclosure of portfolio holdings information pursuant to the above policy and procedures, subject to restrictions on selective disclosure imposed by applicable law.</div>
<div>The Board reviews the policy and procedures for disclosure of
portfolio holdings information at least annually.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Construction and Maintenance of the Underlying Indexes</div>
<div>Descriptions of the Underlying Indexes are provided
below.</div> <div>With respect to certain underlying indexes of the
iShares funds, BFA or its affiliates have held discussions with the applicable index provider regarding their business interest in licensing an index to track a particular market segment and conveyed investment concepts and strategies that could be
considered for the index. The index provider designed and constituted the index using concepts conveyed by BFA or its affiliates. For certain of these indices, the relevant fund may be the first or sole user of the underlying index. In its sole
discretion, the index provider determines the composition of the securities and other instruments in such underlying index, the rebalance protocols of the underlying index, the weightings of the securities and other instruments in the underlying
index, and any updates to the methodology. From time to time, BFA or its affiliates may also provide input relating to possible methodology changes of such underlying index pursuant to the index provider’s consultation process or pursuant to
other communications with the index provider.</div> <div>The
Bloomberg Barclays Indexes</div> <div>The Bloomberg Barclays
Indexes are maintained by Bloomberg Barclays Capital Inc (“Bloomberg Barclays”), which is the index provider and is not affiliated with BFA. BFA will have no role in maintaining the Underlying Indexes.</div>
<div>To use the Bloomberg Barclays MSCI US Corporate 1-5 Year ESG
Focus Index and Bloomberg Barclays MSCI US Corporate ESG Focus Index, BFA or its affiliates have entered into a license agreement with MSCI ESG Research LLC (“MSCI ESG Research”), which may license the Bloomberg Barclays MSCI US
Corporate 1-5 Year ESG Focus Index and Bloomberg Barclays MSCI US Corporate ESG Focus Index pursuant to its agreement with Bloomberg Index Services Limited (a subsidiary of Bloomberg Barclays) or an affiliate.</div>
<div>Bloomberg Barclays MSCI US Aggregate ESG Focus Index</div>
<div><font>Number of Components:
approximately 5,226</font></div> <div>Index Description.<font> The Bloomberg Barclays MSCI US Aggregate ESG Focus Index, the Underlying Index, is designed to maximize exposure to favorable environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) practices while exhibiting risk and
return characteristics similar to those of the Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index, the parent index. The Underlying Index is constructed by selecting constituents from the parent index and applying an optimization process to certain
constituents using ESG rating inputs from MSCI ESG Research in an effort to maximize exposure to ESG factors for a target tracking error constraint of 10 basis points relative to the parent index. To construct the Underlying Index, the Fund’s
index provider begins with the parent index and replicates its U.S. Treasury bond, MBS, CMBS and ABS exposures. These exposures are preserved at the weights of the parent index and are not subject to the index provider’s optimization process,
which is a quantitative process that seeks to determine optimal weights for securities to maximize exposure to securities of entities with higher MSCI ESG Research ratings, subject to maintaining risk and return characteristics similar to the parent
index. For the remaining constituents of the parent index, the index provider excludes securities of entities involved in the business of tobacco and controversial weapons, producers and retailers of civilian firearms, as well as securities of
entities involved in very severe business controversies (in each case as determined by MSCI ESG Research). MSCI ESG Research identifies key ESG controversies, including, among other things, issues involving: (i) the environment (e.g., biodiversity
and land use, toxic emissions and waste, energy and climate change, water stress, non-hazardous operational waste, and supply chain management); (ii) human rights and communities (e.g., impact on local communities, human rights concerns, and civil
liberties); (iii) labor rights and supply chains (e.g., child labor, collective bargaining and union, health and safety, discrimination and workforce diversity, and labor management relations); (iv) customers (e.g., anti-competitive practices,
customer relations, privacy and data security, product safety and quality, and marketing and advertising); and (v) governance (e.g., bribery and fraud, governance structures, and controversial investments). MSCI ESG Research then rates each
entity’s exposure to these ESG issues and evaluates the extent to which the entity has created strategies and programs to manage ESG risks and opportunities. Entities are scored by MSCI ESG Research based on both their risk exposure and risk
management, and then ranked in comparison to their industry peers. Using MSCI ESG Research’s ESG ratings, the index provider then follows its optimization process.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

agency bonds or debentures. The Underlying Index includes callable and non-callable securities issued by U.S. government agencies, quasi-federal corporations (as described under </font><font>Index
Methodology</font><font> below), and corporate or foreign debt guaranteed by the U.S. government. In addition, the securities in the Underlying Index must be fixed-rate and non-convertible and have $300 million or more of
outstanding face value. As of February 28, 2019, approximately 82% of the composite market value of the bonds represented in the Underlying Index was in the form of U.S. agency debentures. The largest issues within the Underlying Index were FHLB,
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with a composite market value weight in the Underlying Index of approximately 31%, 31%, and 18%, respectively.</font></div>

<div>Index Maintenance. <font>The
Underlying Index constituents are reset on the last business day of each month and remain static throughout the month. The universe of Underlying Index constituents adjust for securities that become ineligible for inclusion in an Underlying Index
during the month (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, because of downgrades or called bonds) or for issues that are newly eligible (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, up-grades or newly issued bonds) on the last business day of each month. The Bloomberg Barclays Indexes are valued using end of day bid side prices, as
marked by Bloomberg. Intra-month cash flows contribute to monthly returns, but they are not reinvested during the month and do not earn a reinvestment return. Total returns are calculated based on the sum of price changes, gain/loss on repayments of
principal, and coupon received or accrued, expressed as a percentage of beginning market value. The Bloomberg Barclays Indexes are calculated once a day and are available from major data vendors.</font></div> </div>

bonds, government-related bonds, investment-grade corporate bonds, MBS, CMBS and ABS that are publicly offered for sale in the U.S. The securities in the Underlying Index must have $300 million or more of outstanding face value and must have at
least one year remaining to maturity, with the exception of amortizing securities such as ABS and MBS, which have lower minimum thresholds as defined by the index provider. In addition, the securities must be denominated in U.S. dollars and must be
fixed-rate, non-convertible, and taxable. Certain types of securities, such as SLGs, are excluded from the Underlying Index. Also excluded from the Underlying Index are structured notes with embedded swaps or other special features, private

the bonds represented in the Underlying Index were U.S. fixed-rate agency MBS. U.S. fixed-rate agency MBS are securities issued by entities such as Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae that are backed by pools of mortgages. Most transactions in
fixed-rate MBS occur through standardized contracts for future delivery in which the exact mortgage pools to be delivered are not specified until a few days prior to settlement TBA transactions. The Fund may enter into such contracts on a regular
basis. The Fund, pending settlement of such contracts, will invest its assets in high-quality, liquid short-term instruments, including shares of BlackRock Cash Funds. The Fund will assume its pro rata share of the fees and expenses of any money
market fund that it may invest in, in addition to the Fund's own fees and expenses. The Fund may also acquire interests in mortgage pools through means other than such standardized contracts for future delivery.</font></div>

corporate bond market.</font></div> <div>Index Methodology<font>. The Underlying Index is a subset of a broader high yield universe of sub- investment-grade bonds. Bonds in the Underlying Index are selected from the universe of eligible bonds in the Markit iBoxx USD Corporate Bond
Index using defined rules. The bonds eligible for inclusion in the Underlying Index include U.S. dollar-denominated corporate bonds that: (i) are issued by companies domiciled in the countries classified as developed markets by the index provider;
(ii) have an average rating of sub-investment grade (ratings from Fitch, Moody's or S&amp;P Global Ratings are considered; if more than one agency provides a rating, the average rating is attached to the bond); (iii) are from issuers with at least
$1 billion of outstanding face value (iv) are bond issues with at least $400 million of outstanding face value; (v) have an original maturity date of less than 15 years; (vi) have at least one year remaining to maturity; and (vii) have at least one
year and 6 months to maturity for new index insertions.</font></div>

<div>Issue Changes.<font> General
oversight responsibility for the S&amp;P Indexes, including overall policy guidelines and methodology, is handled by an S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC (“SPDJI”) Index Committee. Maintenance of component investments, including additions
and deletions to these investments, is the responsibility of separate regional index committees composed of S&amp;P index staff specialized in the various regional equity markets and, in some cases with the assistance of local stock exchanges.
Public announcements of index changes as the result of committee decisions will generally be made two business days in advance of the anticipated effective date whenever possible, although for exceptional corporate events announcements may be made
earlier.</font></div> <div>Index Maintenance.<font> Maintaining the S&amp;P Fixed Income Indexes includes monitoring and completing the adjustments for bond additions and deletions, par amount changes, rating changes and corporate actions. Each S&amp;P Fixed Income Index
is a market-value weighted index. Securities Evaluations | ICE Data Services (“Securities Evaluations”), the pricing division of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (“ICE”), Securities Evaluations, reports the price of each bond
in the index each day. The prices used in the index calculation will add the accrued interest for each bond to the price reported by S&amp;P. The total return is calculated by aggregating the interest return, reflecting the return due to paid and
accrued interest, and principal return, reflecting the capital gains or losses due to changes in S&amp;P's end-of-day price and principal repayments and the reinvestment return, excluding the reinvestment of related cash flows. Each index is
generally reviewed and rebalanced on a monthly basis. The SPDJI Index Committee, nevertheless, reserves the right to make adjustments to each index at any time that it believes appropriate. Additions, deletions and other changes to each index
arising from the monthly rebalancing are published three business days prior to the last business day of the month (the “Announcement Date”). Publicly available information, up to and including the close on the fourth business day
preceding the Rebalancing Date, is considered in the rebalancing. Index changes published in the announcement will not normally be subject to revision and will become effective after the close. Any index bond that is downgraded below investment
grade between rebalancing dates is removed at the next rebalancing date.</font></div>

<div>Index Methodology.<font> To be
included in the Underlying Index, bonds must meet all of the following criteria: (i) the bond issuer is from New York State or a local government or agency whose interest payments are exempt from U.S. federal and New York state income taxes and the
federal AMT, as determined by the index provider in accordance with its methodology; (ii) the bond must be denominated in U.S. dollars; (iii) the bond must have a rating of at least BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings, Baa3 by Moody’s, or BBB- by
Fitch. A bond must be rated by at least one of these three rating agencies in order to qualify for the index, and the lowest rating will be used in determining if a bond is investment-grade; (iv) each bond in the Underlying Index must be a
constituent of an offering where the original offering amount was at least $20 million, and must have a minimum par amount of $5 million. To remain in the Underlying Index, bonds must maintain a minimum par amount greater than or equal to $5 million
as of the next rebalancing date and must maintain a minimum Par Amount greater than or equal to $5 million as of four days prior to last Business Day of each month (“Rebalancing Reference Date”); and (v) as of the last Business Day of
each month (“Rebalancing Date”), the bond must have a minimum term to maturity and/or pre-refunded or call date greater than or equal to one calendar month. “Business Day” is defined as any day that U.S. municipal bonds are
traded, as determined by the SIFMA and/or the NYSE. Bonds that are completely called or tendered during the course of the month and bonds that are scheduled to be completely called or redeemed, during the course of the month following the
Rebalancing Date, will be removed on the Rebalancing Date. At each monthly rebalancing, no one issuer can represent more than 25% of the weight of the Underlying Index; and individual issuers that represent at least 5% of the weight of the
Underlying Index cannot account for more than 50% of the weight of the Underlying Index in aggregate. The following types of bonds are specifically excluded from the Underlying Index: commercial paper, derivative securities (inverse floaters,
forwards, and swaps), housing bonds, non-rated bonds, notes, taxable municipals, tobacco bonds, and variable rate debt and certain conduit financed municipal securities.</font></div>

<div>Index Methodology.<font> In order
for a bond to be classified as eligible for inclusion in the Underlying Index, a bond must meet all of the following criteria: (i) the bond issuer is a state or local government or agency such that interest on the bond is exempt from U.S. federal
income taxes and the federal AMT, as determined by the index provider in accordance with its methodology; (ii) the bond must be denominated in U.S. dollars; (iii) the bond must have a rating of at least BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings, Baa3 by
Moody’s, or BBB- by Fitch. A bond must be rated by at least one of these three rating agencies in order to qualify for the Underlying Index, and the lowest rating will be used in determining if a bond is investment-grade; (iv) each bond in the

<div>Notations Regarding each of the iShares Core 5-10 Year USD Bond
ETF's, iShares ESG 1-5 Year USD Corporate Bond ETF's, iShares ESG U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF's and iShares ESG USD Corporate Bond ETF's Fundamental Investment Policies</div>
<div>The following notations are not considered to be part of each
Fund’s fundamental investment policies and are subject to change without shareholder approval.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to
concentration set forth in (1) above, the Investment Company Act does not define what constitutes “concentration” in an industry. The SEC staff has taken the position that investment of 25% or more of a fund’s total assets in one
or more issuers conducting their principal activities in the same industry or group of industries constitutes concentration. It is possible that interpretations of concentration could change in the future. The policy in (1) above will be interpreted
to refer to concentration as that term may be interpreted from time to time. The policy also will be interpreted to permit investment without limit in the following: securities of the U.S. government and its agencies or instrumentalities; securities
of state, territory, possession or municipal governments and their authorities, agencies, instrumentalities or political subdivisions; and repurchase agreements collateralized by any such obligations. Accordingly, issuers of the foregoing securities
will not be considered to be members of any industry. There also will be no limit on</div> </div> <div type="Block">

 Table of Contents </a> </div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>investment in issuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or country. Finance
companies will be considered to be in the industries of their parents if their activities are primarily related to financing the activities of the parents. Each foreign government will be considered to be a member of a separate industry. With
respect to each Fund's industry classifications, each Fund currently utilizes any one or more of the industry sub-classifications used by one or more widely recognized market indexes or rating group indexes, and/or as defined by Fund management. The
policy also will be interpreted to give broad authority to each Fund as to how to classify issuers within or among industries.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to borrowing
money set forth in (2) above, the Investment Company Act permits each Fund to borrow money in amounts of up to one-third of the Fund’s total assets from banks for any purpose, and to borrow up to 5% of the Fund’s total assets from banks
or other lenders for temporary purposes. (The Fund’s total assets include the amounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks attendant to borrowing, the Investment Company Act requires each Fund to maintain at all times an “asset
coverage” of at least 300% of the amount of its borrowings. Asset coverage means the ratio that the value of each Fund’s total assets (including amounts borrowed), minus liabilities other than borrowings, bears to the aggregate amount of
all borrowings. Borrowing money to increase portfolio holdings is known as “leveraging.” Certain trading practices and investments, such as reverse repurchase agreements, may be considered to be borrowings or involve leverage and thus
are subject to the Investment Company Act restrictions. In accordance with SEC staff guidance and interpretations, when each Fund engages in such transactions, the Fund instead of maintaining asset coverage of at least 300%, may segregate or earmark
liquid assets, or enter into an offsetting position, in an amount at least equal to the Fund’s exposure, on a mark-to-market basis, to the transaction (as calculated pursuant to requirements of the SEC). The policy in (2) above will be
interpreted to permit each Fund to engage in trading practices and investments that may be considered to be borrowing or to involve leverage to the extent permitted by the Investment Company Act and to permit each Fund to segregate or earmark liquid
assets or enter into offsetting positions in accordance with the Investment Company Act. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered to be
borrowings under the policy. Practices and investments that may involve leverage but are not considered to be borrowings are not subject to the policy.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to
underwriting set forth in (5) above, the Investment Company Act does not prohibit each Fund from engaging in the underwriting business or from underwriting the securities of other issuers; in fact, in the case of diversified funds, the Investment
Company Act permits the Fund to have underwriting commitments of up to 25% of its assets under certain circumstances. Those circumstances currently are that the amount of each Fund’s underwriting commitments, when added to the value of the
Fund’s investments in issuers where each Fund owns more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of those issuers, cannot exceed the 25% cap. A fund engaging in transactions involving the acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities
may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act. Although it is not believed that the application of the 1933 Act provisions described above would cause each Fund to be engaged in the business of underwriting, the policy in (5) above will
be interpreted not to prevent the Fund from engaging in transactions involving the acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities, regardless of whether the Fund may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act or is otherwise engaged
in the underwriting business to the extent permitted by applicable law.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to lending set
forth in (7) above, the Investment Company Act does not prohibit each Fund from making loans (including lending its securities); however, SEC staff interpretations currently prohibit funds from lending more than one-third of their total assets
(including lending its securities), except through the purchase of debt obligations or the use of repurchase agreements. In addition, collateral arrangements with respect to options, forward currency and futures transactions and other derivative
instruments (as applicable), as well as delays in the settlement of securities transactions, will not be considered loans.</div>

<div>The iShares Core 5-10 Year USD Bond ETF, iShares ESG 1-5 Year
USD Corporate Bond ETF, iShares ESG U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF and iShares ESG USD Corporate Bond ETF<font> </font></div>
<div>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy not to make
short sales of securities or maintain a short position, except to the extent permitted by each Fund's Prospectus and SAI, as amended from time to time, and applicable law.</div>
<div>All funds other than the iShares Core 5-10 Year USD Bond ETF,

<div>In addition to the investment restrictions adopted as
fundamental policies, set forth above, each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy not to invest in the securities of a company for the purpose of exercising management or control, or purchase or otherwise acquire any illiquid investment, except
as permitted under the 1940 Act, which currently limits each Fund’s holdings in illiquid investments to 15% of a Fund’s net assets. BFA monitors Fund holdings in illiquid investments pursuant to the Liquidity Program. Except with regard
to the fundamental policy relating to senior securities set forth in (3) above for all Funds, if any percentage restriction described above is complied with at the time of an investment, a later increase or decrease in percentage resulting from a
change in values of assets will not constitute a violation of such restriction.</div>
<div>Under normal circumstances (i) each of the iShares National
Muni Bond ETF and the iShares Short-Term National Muni Bond ETF will invest at least 80% of the value of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in investments the income of which is free from federal income tax,
including AMT; (ii) the iShares California Muni Bond ETF will invest at least 80% of the value of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in investments the income of which is free from federal income tax,
including AMT, and California income tax; and (iii) the iShares New York Muni Bond ETF will invest at least 80% of the value of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in investments the income of which is free
from federal income tax, including AMT, and New York income tax. These policies are fundamental policies of the Municipal Bond Funds and may not be changed without a vote of a majority of each Fund’s outstanding voting securities, as defined
in the 1940 Act. Each Fund (except the Municipal Bond Funds and iShares ESG U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF) has adopted a non-fundamental investment policy to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the value of its net assets, plus the
amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in securities in the Fund's Underlying Index and (except the iShares ESG 1-5 Year USD Corporate Bond ETF and iShares ESG USD Corporate Bond ETF) in TBA transactions with respect to the percentage of
the Underlying Index (if any) that consists of mortgage pass-through securities. The iShares ESG U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF has adopted a non-fundamental policy to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the value of its net assets, plus
the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in the component securities in the Fund's Underlying Index and in TBA transactions with respect to the percentage of its Underlying Index that consists of mortgage pass-through securities. Each
of the iShares Core 10+ Year USD Bond ETF and iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF have adopted an additional non-fundamental policy under which the iShares Core 10+ Year USD Bond ETF and iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF, under normal
circumstances, will invest, at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in securities of U.S. issuers. Each Fund also has adopted a policy to provide its shareholders with at least 60 days’ prior
written notice of any change in such policy. If, subsequent to an investment, an 80% requirement is no longer met, a Fund’s future investments will be made in a manner that will bring the Fund into compliance with this policy.</div>
<div>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy such that,
under normal market conditions, any borrowings by the Fund will not exceed 10% of the Fund’s net assets.</div>
<div>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy not to purchase
securities of other investment companies, except to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. As a matter of policy, however, a Fund will not purchase shares of any registered open-end investment company or registered unit investment trust, in reliance
on Section 12(d)(1)(F) or (G) (the “fund of funds” provisions) of the 1940 Act, at any time the Fund has knowledge that its shares are purchased by another investment company investor in reliance on the provisions of subparagraph (G) of
Section 12(d)(1).</div> <div>Unless otherwise indicated, all
limitations under each Fund's fundamental or non-fundamental investment policies apply only at the time that a transaction is undertaken. Any change in the percentage of each Fund's assets invested in certain securities or other instruments
resulting from market fluctuations or other changes in each Fund’s total assets will not require each Fund to dispose of an investment until BFA determines that it is practicable to sell or close out the investment without undue market or tax
consequences.</div> <div>Continuous Offering</div>
<div>The method by which Creation Units are created and traded may
raise certain issues under applicable securities laws. Because new Creation Units are issued and sold by the Funds on an ongoing basis, at any point a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may occur. Broker-dealers and
other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters and subject them to the
prospectus delivery requirement and liability provisions of the 1933 Act.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

 Table of Contents </a> </div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>For example, a broker-dealer firm or its client may be deemed
a statutory underwriter if it takes Creation Units after placing an order with the Distributor, breaks them down into constituent shares and sells such shares directly to customers or if it chooses to couple the creation of new shares with an active
selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand for shares. A determination of whether one is an underwriter for purposes of the 1933 Act must take into account all of the facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the
broker-dealer or its client in the particular case and the examples mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that could lead to a categorization as an underwriter.</div>
<div>Broker-dealer firms should also note that dealers who are not
“underwriters” but are effecting transactions in shares, whether or not participating in the distribution of shares, generally are required to deliver a prospectus. This is because the prospectus delivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of
the 1933 Act is not available in respect of such transactions as a result of Section 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that incur a prospectus delivery obligation with respect to shares of the Funds are reminded that, pursuant to Rule 153 under the 1933
Act, a prospectus delivery obligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the 1933 Act owed to an exchange member in connection with a sale on the Listing Exchange generally is satisfied by the fact that the prospectus is available at the Listing Exchange upon
request. The prospectus delivery mechanism provided in Rule 153 is available only with respect to transactions on an exchange.</div>
<div>Management</div>
<div>Trustees and Officers.
<font> The Board has responsibility for the overall management and operations of the Funds, including general supervision of the duties performed by BFA and other service providers. Each Trustee serves until he or
she resigns, is removed, dies, retires or becomes incapacitated. Each officer shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualifies or until his or her death, resignation or removal. Trustees who are not “interested
persons” (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Trust are referred to as independent trustees (“Independent Trustees”).</font></div>
<div>The registered investment companies advised by BFA or its
affiliates (the “BlackRock-advised Funds”) are organized into one complex of open-end equity, multi-asset, index and money market funds (the “BlackRock Multi-Asset Complex”), one complex of closed-end funds and open-end

Leadership Structure and Oversight Responsibilities</font></div>
<div>Overall responsibility for oversight of the Funds rests with
the Board. The Board has engaged BFA to manage the Funds on a day-to-day basis. The Board is responsible for overseeing BFA and other service providers in the operations of the Funds in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, applicable
provisions of state and other laws and the Trust’s charter. The Board is currently composed of nine members, seven of whom are Independent Trustees. The Board currently conducts regular in person meetings four times a year. In addition, the
Board frequently holds special in person or telephonic meetings or informal conference calls to discuss specific matters that may arise or require action between regular meetings. The Independent Trustees meet regularly outside the presence of
management, in executive session or with other service providers to the Trust.</div>
<div>The Board has appointed an Independent Trustee to serve in the
role of Board Chair. The Board Chair’s role is to preside at all meetings of the Board and to act as a liaison with service providers, officers, attorneys, and other Trustees generally between meetings. The Board Chair may also perform such
other functions as may be delegated by the Board from time to time. The Board has established seven standing Committees: a Nominating and Governance Committee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c) Committee, a Securities Lending Committee, a Risk Committee,
an Equity Plus Committee and a Fixed Income Plus Committee to assist the Board in the oversight and direction of the business and affairs of the Funds, and from time to time the Board may establish ad hoc committees or informal working groups to
review and address the policies and practices of the Funds with respect to certain specified matters. The Chair of each standing Committee is an Independent Trustee. The role of the Chair of each Committee is to preside at all meetings of the
Committee and to act as a liaison with service providers, officers, attorneys and other Trustees between meetings. Each standing Committee meets regularly to conduct the oversight functions delegated to the Committee by the Board and reports its
finding to the Board. The Board and each standing Committee conduct annual assessments of their oversight function and structure. The Board has determined that the Board’s leadership structure is appropriate because it allows the Board to
exercise independent judgment over management and it allocates areas of responsibility among committees of Independent Trustees and the full Board to enhance effective oversight.</div>
<div>Day-to-day risk management with respect to the Funds is the
responsibility of BFA or other service providers (depending on the nature of the risk), subject to the supervision of BFA. Each Fund is subject to a number of risks, including investment, compliance, operational, reputational, counterparty and
valuation risks, among others. While there are a number of risk management functions performed by BFA and other service providers, as applicable, it is not possible to identify and eliminate all of the risks applicable to the Funds. The Trustees
have an oversight role in this area, satisfying themselves that risk management processes and controls are in place and operating effectively. Risk oversight forms part of the Board’s general oversight of each Fund and is addressed as part of
various Board and committee activities. In some cases, risk management issues are specifically addressed in presentations and discussions. For example, BFA has an independent dedicated Risk and Quantitative Analysis Group (“RQA”) that
assists BFA in managing fiduciary and corporate risks, including investment, operational, counterparty credit and enterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet with the Board to discuss their analysis and methodologies, as well as specific risk
topics such as operational and counterparty risks relating to the Funds.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>The Board, directly or through a committee, also reviews reports from, among
others, management and the independent registered public accounting firm for the Trust, as appropriate, regarding risks faced by each Fund and management’s risk functions. The Board has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer who oversees the
implementation and testing of the Trust's compliance program, including assessments by independent third parties, and reports to the Board regarding compliance matters for the Trust and its principal service providers. In testing and maintaining the
compliance program, the Chief Compliance Officer (and his or her delegates) assesses key compliance risks affecting each Fund, and addresses them in periodic reports to the Board. In addition, the Audit Committee meets with both the Funds'
independent registered public accounting firm and BFA’s internal audit group to review risk controls in place that support each Fund as well as test results. Board oversight of risk is also performed as needed between meetings through
communications between BFA and the Board. The Independent Trustees have engaged independent legal counsel to assist them in performing their oversight responsibilities. From time to time, the Board may modify the manner in which it conducts risk
oversight. The Board’s oversight role does not make it a guarantor of the Funds' investment performance or other activities.</div>
<div>Committees of the Board of Trustees.<font>  The members of the Audit Committee are Richard L. Fagnani (Chair), John E. Kerrigan and Madhav V. Rajan, each of whom is an Independent Trustee. The purposes of the Audit Committee are to assist the Board (i) in
its oversight of the Trust's accounting and financial reporting principles and policies and related controls and procedures maintained by or on behalf of the Trust; (ii) in its oversight of the Trust's financial statements and the independent audit
thereof; (iii) in selecting, evaluating and, where deemed appropriate, replacing the independent accountants (or nominating the independent accountants to be proposed for shareholder approval in any proxy statement); (iv) in evaluating the
independence of the independent accountants; (v) in complying with legal and regulatory requirements that relate to the Trust's accounting and financial reporting, internal controls, compliance controls and independent audits; and (vi) to assume
such other responsibilities as may be delegated by the Board. The Audit Committee met eight times during the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019.</font></div>
<div>The members of the Nominating and Governance Committee are
John E. Kerrigan (Chair), Madhav V. Rajan and Drew E. Lawton, each of whom is an Independent Trustee. The Nominating and Governance Committee nominates individuals for Independent Trustee membership on the Board and recommends appointments to the
Advisory Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee functions include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) reviewing the qualifications of any person properly identified or nominated to serve as an Independent Trustee; (ii) recommending
to the Board and current Independent Trustees the nominee(s) for appointment as an Independent Trustee by the Board and current Independent Trustees and/or for election as Independent Trustees by shareholders to fill any vacancy for a position of
Independent Trustee(s) on the Board; (iii) recommending to the Board and current Independent Trustees the size and composition of the Board and Board committees and whether they comply with applicable laws and regulations; (iv) recommending a
current Independent Trustee to the Board and current Independent Trustees to serve as Board Chair; (v) periodic review of the Board's retirement policy; and (vi) recommending an appropriate level of compensation for the Independent Trustees for
their services as Trustees, members or chairpersons of committees of the Board, Board Chair and any other positions as the Nominating and Governance Committee considers appropriate. The Nominating and Governance Committee does not consider Board
nominations recommended by shareholders (acting solely in their capacity as a shareholder and not in any other capacity). The Nominating and Governance Committee met one time during the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019.</div>
<div>Each Independent Trustee serves on the 15(c) Committee. The
Chair of the 15(c) Committee is Drew E. Lawton. The principal responsibilities of the 15(c) Committee are to support, oversee and organize on behalf of the Board the process for the annual review and renewal of the Trust's advisory and sub-advisory
agreements. These responsibilities include: (i) meeting with BlackRock, Inc. in advance of the Board meeting at which the Trust's advisory and sub-advisory agreements are to be considered to discuss generally the process for providing requested
information to the Board and the format in which information will be provided; and (ii) considering and discussing with BlackRock, Inc. such other matters and information as may be necessary and appropriate for the Board to evaluate the investment
advisory and sub-advisory agreements of the Trust. The 15(c) Committee met two times during the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019.</div>
<div>The members of the Securities Lending Committee are John E.
Martinez (Chair), Jane D. Carlin and Drew E. Lawton, each of whom is an Independent Trustee. The principal responsibilities of the Securities Lending Committee are to support, oversee and organize on behalf of the Board the process for oversight of

<div>Potential Conflicts of Interest. <font> The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (“PNC”), through a subsidiary, has a significant economic interest in BlackRock, Inc., the parent of BFA, the Funds' investment adviser. Certain activities of BFA,
BlackRock, Inc. and the other subsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc. (collectively referred to in this section as “BlackRock”) and PNC and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to in this section as the “Entities”), and their
respective directors, officers and employees, with respect to the Funds and/or other accounts managed by BlackRock or Entities, may give rise to actual or perceived conflicts of interest such as those described below.</font></div>
<div>BlackRock is one of the world's largest asset management
firms. PNC is a diversified financial services organization spanning the retail, business and corporate markets. BlackRock, PNC and their respective subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers and employees, including, in the case
of BlackRock, the business units or entities and personnel who may be involved in the investment activities and business operations of a Fund, are engaged worldwide in businesses, including managing equities, fixed-income securities, cash and
alternative investments, and banking and other financial services, and have interests other than that of managing the Funds. These are considerations of which investors in a Fund should be</div> </div>

<div>aware, and which may cause conflicts of interest that could disadvantage a
Fund and its shareholders. These businesses and interests include potential multiple advisory, transactional, financial and other relationships with, or interests in, companies and interests in securities or other instruments that may be purchased
or sold by a Fund.</div> <div>BlackRock and the Entities have
proprietary interests in, and may manage or advise with respect to, accounts or funds (including separate accounts and other funds and collective investment vehicles) that have investment objectives similar to those of a Fund and/or that engage in
transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and instruments as the Funds. BlackRock and Entities are also major participants in the global currency, equities, swap and fixed income markets, in each case, for the accounts of clients and,
in some cases, on a proprietary basis. As such, BlackRock and Entities are or may be actively engaged in transactions in the same securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests. Such activities could affect the prices and
availability of the securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests, which could have an adverse impact on a Fund's performance. Such transactions, particularly in respect of most proprietary accounts or client accounts, will be
executed independently of a Fund's transactions and thus at prices or rates that may be more or less favorable than those obtained by the Funds.</div>
<div>When BlackRock seeks to purchase or sell the same assets for
managed accounts, including a Fund, the assets actually purchased or sold may be allocated among the accounts on a basis determined in its good faith discretion to be equitable. In some cases, this system may adversely affect the size or price of
the assets purchased or sold for a Fund. In addition, transactions in investments by one or more other accounts managed by BlackRock or Entities may have the effect of diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies
of a Fund, particularly, but not limited to, with respect to small-capitalization, emerging market or less liquid strategies. This may occur with respect to BlackRock-advised accounts when investment decisions regarding a Fund are based on research
or other information that is also used to support decisions for other accounts. When BlackRock implements a portfolio decision or strategy on behalf of another account ahead of, or contemporaneously with, similar decisions or strategies for a Fund,
market impact, liquidity constraints, or other factors could result in the Fund receiving less favorable trading results and the costs of implementing such decisions or strategies could be increased or the Fund could otherwise be disadvantaged.
BlackRock may, in certain cases, elect to implement internal policies and procedures designed to limit such consequences, which may cause a Fund to be unable to engage in certain activities, including purchasing or disposing of securities, when it
might otherwise be desirable for it to do so.</div> <div>Conflicts
may also arise because portfolio decisions regarding a Fund may benefit other accounts managed by BlackRock. For example, the sale of a long position or establishment of a short position by a Fund may impair the price of the same security sold short
by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its other accounts or funds, and the purchase of a security or covering of a short position in a security by a Fund may increase the price of the same security held by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its
other accounts or funds. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, certain Funds may invest their assets in other funds advised by BlackRock, including funds that are managed by one or more of the same portfolio managers, which could
result in conflicts of interest relating to asset allocation, timing of Fund purchases and redemptions, and increased remuneration and profitability for BlackRock, and/or its personnel, including portfolio managers.</div>
<div>In certain circumstances, BlackRock, on behalf of the Funds,
may seek to buy from or sell securities to another fund or account advised by BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is not required to) effect purchases and sales between BlackRock clients (“cross trades”), including the Funds, if BlackRock
believes such transactions are appropriate based on each party's investment objectives and guidelines, subject to applicable law and regulation. There may be potential conflicts of interest or regulatory issues relating to these transactions which
could limit BlackRock’s decision to engage in these transactions for the Funds. BlackRock may have a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities to the parties in such transactions. On any occasion when a Fund
participates in a cross trade, BlackRock will comply with procedures adopted under applicable rules and SEC guidance.</div>
<div>BlackRock and the Entities and their respective clients may
pursue or enforce rights with respect to an issuer in which a Fund has invested, and those activities may have an adverse effect on the Fund. As a result, prices, availability, liquidity and terms of a Fund's investments may be negatively impacted
by the activities of BlackRock or the Entities or their respective clients, and transactions for the Fund may be impaired or effected at prices or terms that may be less favorable than would otherwise have been the case.</div>
<div>The results of a Fund’s investment activities may differ
significantly from the results achieved by BlackRock for its proprietary accounts or other accounts (including investment companies or collective investment vehicles) which it manages or advises.</div> </div>

<div>It is possible that one or more accounts managed or advised by BlackRock and
such other accounts will achieve investment results that are substantially more or less favorable than the results achieved by a Fund. Moreover, it is possible that a Fund will sustain losses during periods in which one or more proprietary or other
accounts managed or advised by BlackRock achieve significant profits. The opposite result is also possible.</div>
<div>From time to time, a Fund may be restricted from purchasing or
selling securities, or from engaging in other investment activities because of regulatory, legal or contractual requirements applicable to BlackRock or one or more Entities or other accounts managed or advised by BlackRock or an Entity for clients
worldwide, and/or the internal policies of BlackRock and the Entities designed to comply with such requirements. As a result, there may be periods, for example, when BlackRock will not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions in certain
securities or instruments with respect to which BlackRock and/or one or more Entities are performing services or when position limits have been reached. For example, the investment activities of BlackRock or one or more Entities for their
proprietary accounts and accounts under their management may limit the investment opportunities for a Fund in certain emerging and other markets in which limitations are imposed upon the amount of investment, in the aggregate or in individual
issuers, by affiliated foreign investors.</div> <div>In connection
with its management of a Fund, BlackRock may have access to certain fundamental analysis and proprietary technical models developed by BlackRock. BlackRock will not be under any obligation, however, to effect transactions on behalf of a Fund in
accordance with such analysis and models. In addition, BlackRock will not have any obligation to make available any information regarding their proprietary activities or strategies, or the activities or strategies used for other accounts managed by
them, for the benefit of the management of a Fund and it is not anticipated that BlackRock will have access to such information for the purpose of managing the Fund. The proprietary activities or portfolio strategies of BlackRock, or the activities
or strategies used for accounts managed by BlackRock or other client accounts could conflict with the transactions and strategies employed by BlackRock in managing a Fund.</div>
<div>The Funds may be included in investment models developed by
BlackRock for use by clients and financial advisors. To the extent clients invest in these investment models and increase the assets under management of the Funds, the investment management fee amounts paid by the Funds to BlackRock may also
increase. The price, availability and liquidity of a Fund may be impacted by purchases and redemptions of the Fund by model-driven investment portfolios.</div>
<div>In addition, certain principals and certain employees of a
Fund’s investment adviser are also principals or employees of other business units or entities within BlackRock. As a result, these principals and employees may have obligations to such other business units or entities or their clients and
such obligations to other business units or entities or their clients may be a consideration of which investors in a Fund should be aware.</div>
<div>BlackRock may enter into transactions and invest in
securities, instruments and currencies on behalf of a Fund in which clients of BlackRock or an Entity, or, to the extent permitted by the SEC and applicable law, BlackRock or an Entity, serves as the counterparty, principal or issuer. In such cases,
such party's interests in the transaction will be adverse to the interests of the Fund, and such party may have no incentive to assure that the Fund obtains the best possible prices or terms in connection with the transactions. In addition, the
purchase, holding and sale of such investments by a Fund may enhance the profitability of BlackRock or an Entity.</div>
<div>BlackRock or one or more Entities may also create, write or
issue derivatives for their clients, the underlying securities, currencies or instruments in which a Fund may invest or which may be based on the performance of the Fund. BlackRock has entered into an arrangement with Markit Indices Limited, the
index provider for underlying fixed-income indexes used by certain iShares funds, related to derivative fixed-income products that are based on such iShares funds. BlackRock will receive certain payments for licensing intellectual property belonging
to BlackRock and for facilitating the provision of data in connection with such derivative products, which may include payments based on the trading volumes of, or revenues generated by, the derivative products. Other funds and accounts managed by
BlackRock may from time to time transact in such derivative products, which could contribute to the viability of such derivative products by making them more appealing to funds and accounts managed by third parties, and in turn lead to increased
payments to BlackRock. Trading activity in such derivative products could also potentially lead to increased purchase activity with respect to these iShares funds and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</div>
<div>A Fund may, subject to applicable law, purchase investments
that are the subject of an underwriting or other distribution by BlackRock or one or more Entities and may also enter into transactions with other clients of BlackRock or an Entity where such other clients have interests adverse to those of the
Fund.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>At times, these activities may cause business units or
entities within BlackRock or an Entity to give advice to clients that may cause these clients to take actions adverse to the interests of a Fund. To the extent such transactions are permitted, a Fund will deal with BlackRock and/or Entities on an
arm’s-length basis.</div> <div>To the extent authorized by
applicable law, BlackRock or one or more Entities may act as broker, dealer, agent, lender or adviser or in other commercial capacities for a Fund. It is anticipated that the commissions, mark-ups, mark-downs, financial advisory fees, underwriting
and placement fees, sales fees, financing and commitment fees, brokerage fees, other fees, compensation or profits, rates, terms and conditions charged by BlackRock or an Entity will be in its view commercially reasonable, although BlackRock and
each Entity, including its sales personnel, will have an interest in obtaining fees and other amounts that are favorable to BlackRock or the Entity and such sales personnel, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. Index based funds also may
use an index provider that is affiliated with another service provider of a Fund or BlackRock that acts as a broker, dealer, agent, lender or in other commercial capacities for a Fund or BlackRock.</div>
<div>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock and the Entities (and
their personnel and other distributors) will be entitled to retain fees and other amounts that they receive in connection with their service to the Funds as broker, dealer, agent, lender, adviser or in other commercial capacities. No accounting to
the Funds or their shareholders will be required, and no fees or other compensation payable by the Funds or their shareholders will be reduced by reason of receipt by BlackRock or an Entity of any such fees or other amounts.</div>
<div>When BlackRock or an Entity acts as broker, dealer, agent,
adviser or in other commercial capacities in relation to the Funds, BlackRock or the Entity may take commercial steps in its own interests, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. A Fund will be required to establish business relationships
with its counterparties based on the Fund's own credit standing. BlackRock will not have any obligation to allow its credit to be used in connection with a Fund's establishment of its business relationships, nor is it expected that the Fund's
counterparties will rely on the credit of BlackRock in evaluating the Fund's creditworthiness.</div>
<div>BTC, an affiliate of BFA pursuant to SEC exemptive relief,
acts as securities lending agent to, and receives a share of securities lending revenues from, the Funds. BlackRock will also receive compensation for managing the reinvestment of the cash collateral from securities lending. There are potential
conflicts of interests in managing a securities lending program, including but not limited to: (i) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to increase or decrease the amount of securities on loan or to lend particular securities
in order to generate additional risk-adjusted revenue for BlackRock and its affiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to allocate loans to clients that would provide more revenue to BlackRock. As described
further below, BlackRock seeks to mitigate this conflict by providing its securities lending clients with equal lending opportunities over time in order to approximate pro rata allocation. </div>
<div>As part of its securities lending program, BlackRock
indemnifies certain clients and/or funds against a shortfall in collateral in the event of borrower default. BlackRock’s RQA calculates, on a regular basis, BlackRock’s potential dollar exposure to the risk of collateral shortfall upon
counterparty default (“shortfall risk”) under the securities lending program for both indemnified and non-indemnified clients. On a periodic basis, RQA also determines the maximum amount of potential indemnified shortfall risk arising
from securities lending activities (“indemnification exposure limit”) and the maximum amount of counterparty-specific credit exposure (“credit limits”) BlackRock is willing to assume as well as the program’s operational
complexity. RQA oversees the risk model that calculates projected shortfall values using loan-level factors such as loan and collateral type and market value as well as specific borrower counterparty credit characteristics. When necessary, RQA may
further adjust other securities lending program attributes by restricting eligible collateral or reducing counterparty credit limits. As a result, the management of the indemnification exposure limit may affect the amount of securities lending
activity BlackRock may conduct at any given point in time and impact indemnified and non-indemnified clients by reducing the volume of lending opportunities for certain loans (including by asset type, collateral type and/or revenue profile).</div>
<div>BlackRock uses a predetermined systematic process in order to
approximate pro rata allocation over time. In order to allocate a loan to a portfolio: (i) BlackRock as a whole must have sufficient lending capacity pursuant to the various program limits (<font>i.e.,</font>
indemnification exposure limit and counterparty credit limits); (ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset at the time a loan opportunity arrives; and (iii) the lending portfolio must also have enough inventory, either on its own or when
aggregated with other portfolios into one single market delivery, to satisfy the loan request. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to provide equal lending opportunities for all portfolios, independent of whether BlackRock indemnifies the portfolio.

<div>opportunities for lending portfolios does not guarantee equal outcomes.
Specifically, short and long-term outcomes for individual clients may vary due to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on different securities, and the overall limits imposed by the firm.</div>
<div>Purchases and sales of securities and other assets for a Fund
may be bunched or aggregated with orders for other BlackRock client accounts, including with accounts that pay different transaction costs solely due to the fact that they have different research payment arrangements. BlackRock, however, is not
required to bunch or aggregate orders if portfolio management decisions for different accounts are made separately, or if they determine that bunching or aggregating is not practicable or required, or in cases involving client direction.</div>
<div>Prevailing trading activity frequently may make impossible the
receipt of the same price or execution on the entire volume of securities purchased or sold. When this occurs, the various prices may be averaged, and the Funds will be charged or credited with the average price. Thus, the effect of the aggregation
may operate on some occasions to the disadvantage of the Funds. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Funds will not be charged the same commission or commission equivalent rates in connection with a bunched or aggregated order.</div>
<div>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock may select brokers
(including, without limitation, certain Entities) that furnish BlackRock, the Funds, other BlackRock client accounts or personnel, directly or through correspondent relationships, with research or other appropriate services which provide, in
BlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to BlackRock in the investment decision-making process (including with respect to futures, fixed-price offerings and OTC transactions). Such research or other services may include, to the extent permitted by
law, research reports on companies, industries and securities; economic and financial data; financial publications; proxy analysis; trade industry seminars; computer data bases; research-oriented software and other services and products. Research or
other services obtained in this manner may be used in servicing any or all of the Funds and other BlackRock client accounts, including in connection with BlackRock client accounts other than those that pay commissions to the broker relating to the
research or other service arrangements. Such products and services may disproportionately benefit other BlackRock client accounts relative to the Funds based on the amount of brokerage commissions paid by the Funds and such other BlackRock client
accounts. For example, research or other services that are paid for through one client's commissions may not be used in managing that client's account. In addition, other BlackRock client accounts may receive the benefit, including disproportionate
benefits, of economies of scale or price discounts in connection with products and services that may be provided to the Funds and to such other BlackRock client accounts. To the extent that BlackRock uses soft dollars, it will not have to pay for
those products and services itself.</div> <div>BlackRock does not
currently enter into arrangements to use the Funds' assets for, or participate in, soft dollars, although BlackRock may receive research that is bundled with the trade execution, clearing, and/or settlement services provided by a particular
broker-dealer. To the extent that BlackRock receives research on this basis, many of the same conflicts related to traditional soft dollars may exist. For example, the research effectively will be paid by client commissions that also will be used to
pay for the execution, clearing, and settlement services provided by the broker-dealer and will not be paid by BlackRock. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may endeavor to execute trades through brokers who, pursuant to such
arrangements, provide research or other services in order to ensure the continued receipt of research or other services BlackRock believes are useful in its investment decision-making process. BlackRock may from time to time choose not to engage in
the above described arrangements to varying degrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may also enter into commission sharing arrangements under which BlackRock may execute transactions through a broker-dealer, including, where
permitted, an Entity, and request that the broker-dealer allocate a portion of the commissions or commission credits to another firm that provides research to BlackRock. To the extent that BlackRock engages in commission sharing arrangements, many
of the same conflicts related to traditional soft dollars may exist.</div>
<div>BlackRock may utilize certain electronic crossing networks
(“ECNs”) (including, without limitation, ECNs in which BlackRock or an Entity has an investment or other interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law) in executing client securities transactions for certain types of
securities. These ECNs may charge fees for their services, including access fees and transaction fees. The transaction fees, which are similar to commissions or markups/markdowns, will generally be charged to clients and, like commissions and
markups/markdowns, would generally be included in the cost of the securities purchased. Access fees may be paid by BlackRock even though incurred in connection with executing transactions on behalf of clients, including the Funds. In certain
circumstances, ECNs may offer volume discounts that will reduce the access fees typically paid by BlackRock. BlackRock will only utilize ECNs consistent with its obligation to seek to obtain best execution in client transactions.</div> </div>

<div>BlackRock has adopted policies and procedures designed to
prevent conflicts of interest from influencing proxy voting decisions that it makes on behalf of advisory clients, including the Funds, and to help ensure that such decisions are made in accordance with BlackRock's fiduciary obligations to its
clients. Nevertheless, notwithstanding such proxy voting policies and procedures, actual proxy voting decisions of BlackRock may have the effect of favoring the interests of other clients or businesses of other divisions or units of BlackRock and/or
an Entity, provided that BlackRock believes such voting decisions to be in accordance with its fiduciary obligations. For a more detailed discussion of these policies and procedures, see the <font>Proxy Voting
Policy</font> section of this SAI.</div> <div>It is also possible
that, from time to time, BlackRock or an Entity may, subject to compliance with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of a Fund. Increasing a Fund’s assets may enhance liquidity, investment flexibility and diversification and may contribute
to economies of scale that tend to reduce the Fund's expense ratio. BlackRock and the Entities reserve the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to sell into the market or redeem in Creation Units through an Authorized Participant at any
time some or all of the shares of a Fund acquired for their own accounts. A large sale or redemption of shares of a Fund by BlackRock or an Entity could significantly reduce the asset size of the Fund, which might have an adverse effect on the
Fund's liquidity, investment flexibility, portfolio diversification, expense ratio or ability to comply with the listing requirements for the Fund. BlackRock seeks to consider the effect of redemptions on a Fund and other shareholders in deciding
whether to redeem its shares but is not obligated to do so and may elect not to do so.</div>
<div>It is possible that a Fund may invest in securities of, or
engage in transactions with, companies with which an Entity has developed or is trying to develop investment banking relationships as well as securities of entities in which BlackRock or an Entity has significant debt or equity investments or other
interests or in which an Entity makes a market. A Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which BlackRock provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of such
issuances. A Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in transactions with, companies to which an Entity provides or may in the future provide research coverage. Such investments or transactions could cause conflicts between the interests of
a Fund and the interests of BlackRock, other clients of BlackRock or an Entity. In making investment decisions for a Fund, BlackRock is not permitted to obtain or use material non-public information acquired by any unit of BlackRock in the course of
these activities. In addition, from time to time, the activities of BlackRock or an Entity may limit a Fund's flexibility in purchases and sales of securities. When an Entity is engaged in an underwriting or other distribution of securities of an
entity, BlackRock may be prohibited from purchasing or recommending the purchase of certain securities of that entity for a Fund. As indicated below, BlackRock or an Entity may engage in transactions with companies in which BlackRock-advised funds
or other clients of BlackRock or of an Entity have an investment.</div>
<div>BlackRock and Chubb Limited (“Chubb”), a public
company whose securities are held by BlackRock-advised funds and other accounts, partially funded the creation of a re-insurance company (“Re Co”) pursuant to which each has approximately a 9.9% ownership interest and each has
representation on the board of directors. Certain employees and executives of BlackRock have a less than ½ of 1% ownership interest in Re Co. BlackRock manages the investment portfolio of Re Co, which is held in a wholly-owned subsidiary. Re Co
participates as a reinsurer with reinsurance contracts underwritten by subsidiaries of Chubb. An independent director of certain BlackRock-advised funds also serves as an independent director of Chubb and has no interest or involvement in the Re Co
transaction.</div> <div>BlackRock and the Entities, their personnel
and other financial service providers may have interests in promoting sales of the Funds. With respect to BlackRock and the Entities and their personnel, the remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of the Funds or other
products may be greater than remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of certain funds or other products that might be provided or offered. BlackRock and the Entities and their sales personnel may directly or indirectly
receive a portion of the fees and commissions charged to the Funds or their shareholders. BlackRock and its advisory or other personnel may also benefit from increased amounts of assets under management. Fees and commissions may also be higher than
for other products or services, and the remuneration and profitability to BlackRock or the Entities and such personnel resulting from transactions on behalf of or management of the Funds may be greater than the remuneration and profitability
resulting from other funds or products.</div> <div>Third parties,
including service providers to BlackRock or a Fund, may sponsor events (including, but not limited to, marketing and promotional activities and presentations, educational training programs and conferences) for registered representatives, other
professionals and individual investors. There is a potential conflict of interest as such sponsorships may defray the costs of such activities to BlackRock, and may provide an incentive to BlackRock to retain such third parties to provide services
to a Fund.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>BlackRock may provide valuation assistance to certain clients
with respect to certain securities or other investments and the valuation recommendations made for such clients' accounts may differ from the valuations for the same securities or investments assigned by a Fund's pricing vendors, especially if such
valuations are based on broker-dealer quotes or other data sources unavailable to the Fund's pricing vendors. While BlackRock will generally communicate its valuation information or determinations to a Fund's pricing vendors and/or fund accountants,
there may be instances where the Fund's pricing vendors or fund accountants assign a different valuation to a security or other investment than the valuation for such security or investment determined or recommended by BlackRock.</div>
<div>As disclosed in more detail in the <font>Determination of Net Asset Value</font> section of each Fund’s Prospectus and this SAI, when market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BlackRock to be unreliable, a Fund’s investments are
valued at fair value by BlackRock in accordance with procedures adopted by the Board. When determining “fair value price,” BlackRock seeks to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of
that asset or liability in an arm’s-length transaction. The price generally may not be determined based on what a Fund might reasonably expect to receive for selling an asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability
to maturity. While fair value determinations will be based upon all available factors that BlackRock deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be based on analytical values determined by BlackRock using proprietary or third-party
valuation models, fair value represents only a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could have
been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used in determining a Fund’s net asset value. As a result, a Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at net asset value, at a time when a holding or holdings are valued
by BlackRock (pursuant to Board-adopted procedures) at fair value, may have the effect of diluting or increasing the economic interest of existing shareholders and may affect the amount of revenue received by BlackRock with respect to services for
which it receives an asset-based fee.</div> <div>To the extent
permitted by applicable law, a Fund may invest all or some of its short-term cash investments in any money market fund or similarly-managed private fund advised or managed by BlackRock. In connection with any such investments, a Fund, to the extent
permitted by the 1940 Act, may pay its share of expenses of a money market fund or other similarly-managed private fund in which it invests, which may result in a Fund bearing some additional expenses.</div>
<div>BlackRock and its directors, officers and employees, may buy
and sell securities or other investments for their own accounts and may have conflicts of interest with respect to investments made on behalf of a Fund. As a result of differing trading and investment strategies or constraints, positions may be
taken by directors, officers and employees that are the same, different from or made at different times than positions taken for a Fund. To lessen the possibility that a Fund will be adversely affected by this personal trading, each Fund, BFA and
BlackRock have each adopted a code of ethics in compliance with Section 17(j) of the 1940 Act that restricts securities trading in the personal accounts of investment professionals and others who normally come into possession of information
regarding a Fund's portfolio transactions. Each code of ethics is available by contacting BlackRock or by accessing the EDGAR Database on the SEC's Internet site at http://www.sec.gov, and copies may be obtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by
e-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov.</div> <div>BlackRock will not
purchase securities or other property from, or sell securities or other property to, a Fund, except that a Fund may in accordance with rules or guidance adopted under the 1940 Act engage in transactions with accounts that are affiliated with a Fund
as a result of common officers, directors, or investment advisers or pursuant to exemptive orders granted to the Funds and/or BlackRock by the SEC. These transactions would be effected in circumstances in which BlackRock determined that it would be
appropriate for a Fund to purchase and another client of BlackRock to sell, or the Fund to sell and another client of BlackRock to purchase, the same security or instrument on the same day. From time to time, the activities of a Fund may be
restricted because of regulatory requirements applicable to BlackRock and/or BlackRock's internal policies designed to comply with, limit the applicability of, or otherwise relate to such requirements. A client not advised by BlackRock would not be
subject to some of those considerations. There may be periods when BlackRock may not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions, or may otherwise restrict or limit their advice in certain securities or instruments issued by or related to
companies for which BlackRock or an Entity is performing investment banking, market making, advisory or other services or has proprietary positions. For example, when BlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or risk management services for a
company, BlackRock may be prohibited from or limited in purchasing or selling securities of that company on behalf of a Fund, particularly where such services result in BlackRock obtaining material non-public information about the company (<font>e.g.</font>, in connection with participation in a creditors’ committee). Similar situations could arise if personnel of BlackRock serve as directors of companies the securities of which a Fund wishes to purchase or
sell. However, if permitted by applicable law, and where consistent with BlackRock’s policies and procedures (including the necessary implementation of appropriate information barriers), the Funds may purchase securities or</div> </div>

<div>instruments that are issued by such companies, are the subject of an
underwriting, distribution or advisory assignment by an Entity, or are the subject of an advisory or risk management assignment by BlackRock, or where personnel of BlackRock are directors or officers of the issuer.</div>
<div>The investment activities of BlackRock for their proprietary
accounts and for client accounts may also limit the investment strategies and rights of the Funds. For example, in certain circumstances where the Funds invest in securities issued by companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in
certain emerging or international markets, or are subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or invest in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits on the aggregate amount invested by BlackRock for their
proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Funds) that may not be exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if exceeded, may cause BlackRock, the Funds or other client accounts to suffer
disadvantages or business restrictions.</div> <div>If certain
aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either through the actions of BlackRock or a Fund or as a result of third-party transactions, the ability of BlackRock, on behalf of clients (including the Funds), to purchase or dispose of investments, or
exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. As a result, BlackRock, on behalf of its clients (including the Funds), may limit purchases, sell existing investments, or otherwise restrict,
forgo or limit the exercise of rights (including transferring, outsourcing or limiting voting rights or forgoing the right to receive dividends) when BlackRock, in its sole discretion, deems it appropriate in light of potential regulatory or other
restrictions on ownership or other consequences resulting from reaching investment thresholds.</div>
<div>In those circumstances where ownership thresholds or
limitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks to allocate limited investment opportunities equitably among clients (including the Funds), taking into consideration benchmark weight and investment strategy. BlackRock has adopted certain controls
designed to prevent the occurrence of a breach of any applicable ownership threshold or limits, including, for example, when ownership in certain securities nears an applicable threshold, BlackRock may remove such securities from the list of Deposit
Securities to be delivered to the Fund in connection with purchases of Creation Units of such Fund and may limit purchases in such securities to the issuer's weighting in the applicable benchmark used by BlackRock to manage such Fund. If client
(including Fund) holdings of an issuer exceed an applicable threshold and BlackRock is unable to obtain relief to enable the continued holding of such investments, it may be necessary to sell down these positions to meet the applicable limitations.
In these cases, benchmark overweight positions will be sold prior to benchmark positions being reduced to meet applicable limitations.</div>
<div>In addition to the foregoing, other ownership thresholds may
trigger reporting requirements to governmental and regulatory authorities, and such reports may entail the disclosure of the identity of a client or BlackRock’s intended strategy with respect to such security or asset.</div>
<div>BlackRock may not serve as an Authorized Participant in the
creation and redemption of iShares ETFs.</div> <div>BlackRock may
maintain securities indices. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, the Funds may seek to license and use such indices as part of their investment strategy. Index based funds that seek to track the performance of securities indices also may use
the name of the index or index provider in the fund name. Index providers, including BlackRock (to the extent permitted by applicable law), may be paid licensing fees for use of their index or index name. BlackRock may benefit from the Funds using
BlackRock indices by creating increasing acceptance in the marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is not obligated to license its indices to any Fund and the Funds are under no obligation to use BlackRock indices. Any Fund that enters into a
license for a BlackRock index cannot be assured that the terms of any index licensing agreement with BlackRock will be as favorable as those terms offered to other licensees.</div>
<div>The custody arrangement described in “Investment
Advisory, Administrative and Distribution Services” may lead to potential conflicts of interest with BlackRock where BlackRock has agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse ordinary operating expenses in order to cap expenses of the Funds (or
where BlackRock charges a unitary management fee). This is because the custody arrangements with certain Funds' custodian may have the effect of reducing custody fees when the Funds leave cash balances uninvested. This could be viewed as having the
potential to provide BlackRock an incentive to keep high positive cash balances for Funds in order to offset fund custody fees that BlackRock might otherwise reimburse or pay. However, BlackRock’s portfolio managers do not intentionally keep
uninvested balances high, but rather make investment decisions that they anticipate will be beneficial to fund performance. For funds without a unitary management fee, when a fund’s actual operating expense ratio exceeds a stated cap, a
reduction in custody fees reduces the amount of waivers and/or reimbursements BlackRock would be required to make to the fund.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>BlackRock may enter into contractual arrangements with
third-party service providers to a Fund (<font>e.g.</font>, custodians, administrators and index providers) pursuant to which BlackRock receives fee discounts or concessions in recognition of BlackRock’s overall
relationship with such service providers. To the extent that BlackRock is responsible for paying these service providers out of its management fee, the benefits of any such fee discounts or concessions may accrue, in whole or in part, to
BlackRock.</div> <div>BlackRock owns or has an ownership interest
in certain trading, portfolio management, operations and/or information systems used by Fund service providers. These systems are, or will be, used by a Fund service provider in connection with the provision of services to accounts managed by
BlackRock and funds managed and sponsored by BlackRock, including the Funds, that engage the service provider (typically the custodian). A Fund’s service provider remunerates BlackRock for the use of the systems. A Fund service
provider’s payments to BlackRock for the use of these systems may enhance the profitability of BlackRock.</div>
<div>BlackRock has entered into an arrangement with ICE to be one
of ICE’s development partners in connection with ICE’s intention to launch a new open-architecture, centralized industry platform to facilitate creation and redemption orders for ETFs (the “ICE Platform”). As a development
partner, BlackRock has licensed certain of its intellectual property to ICE. Once the ICE Platform is launched, BlackRock intends to use the ICE Platform to facilitate creations and redemptions in the Funds and certain other services provided by the
ICE Platform. BlackRock may have an incentive to promote the broad adoption of the ICE Platform by the ETF marketplace because BlackRock will earn a fee, based on the total revenues earned by the ICE Platform, for licensing BlackRock’s
intellectual property to ICE and for BlackRock’s role as development partner. ICE Data Services, the underlying index provider for certain BFA managed funds, is a wholly owned subsidiary of ICE.</div>
<div>BlackRock’s receipt of fees from a service provider in
connection with the use of systems provided by BlackRock may create an incentive for BlackRock to recommend that a Fund enter into or renew an arrangement with the service provider.</div>
<div>A Fund from time to time may purchase in the secondary market
(i) certain mortgage pass-through securities packaged and master serviced by PNC Mortgage Securities Corp. (“PNC Mortgage”) or Midland Loan Services, Inc. (“Midland”), or (ii) mortgage-related securities containing loans or
mortgages originated by PNC Bank, National Association (“PNC Bank”) or its affiliates. It is possible that under some circumstances, PNC Mortgage, Midland or other affiliates could have interests that are in conflict with the holders of
these mortgage-backed securities, and such holders could have rights against PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates. For example, if PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates engaged in negligence or willful misconduct in carrying out its duties
as a master servicer, then any holder of the mortgage-backed security could seek recourse against PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates, as applicable. Also, as a master servicer, PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates may make certain
representations and warranties regarding the quality of the mortgages and properties underlying a mortgage-backed security. If one or more of those representations or warranties is false, then the holders of the mortgage backed securities could
trigger an obligation of PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates, as applicable, to repurchase the mortgages from the issuing trust. Finally, PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates may own securities that are subordinate to the senior
mortgage-backed securities owned by a Fund.</div> <div>Present and
future activities of BlackRock (including BFA) and the Entities and their respective directors, officers and employees, in addition to those described in this section, may give rise to additional conflicts of interest.</div>

June 16, 2016, investors (the “Plaintiffs”) in certain iShares funds (iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF, iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF, iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF, iShares Russell Mid-Cap Growth ETF, iShares Russell Mid-Cap ETF,
iShares Russell Mid-Cap Value ETF, iShares Select Dividend ETF, iShares Morningstar Mid-Cap ETF, iShares Morningstar Large-Cap ETF, iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF and iShares U.S. Aerospace &amp; Defense ETF) filed a putative class
action lawsuit against the Trust, BlackRock, Inc. and certain of its advisory affiliates, and certain directors/trustees and officers of the Trust (collectively, “Defendants”) in California State Court. The lawsuit alleges the Defendants
violated federal securities laws by failing to adequately disclose in the prospectuses issued by the funds noted above the risks of using stop-loss orders in the event of a “flash crash,” such as the one that occurred on May 6, 2010. On
September 18, 2017, the court issued a Statement of Decision holding that the Plaintiffs lack standing to assert their claims. On October 11, 2017, the court entered final judgment dismissing all of Plaintiffs’ claims with prejudice.
Plaintiffs have appealed the court’s decision.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Investment Advisory, Administrative and Distribution
Services</div> <div>Investment Adviser. <font> BFA serves as investment adviser to each Fund pursuant to an investment advisory agreement between the Trust, on behalf of each Fund, and BFA. BFA is a California corporation indirectly owned by BlackRock, Inc. and
is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Under the investment advisory agreement, BFA, subject to the supervision of the Board and in conformity with the stated investment policies of each Fund,
manages and administers the Trust and the investment of each Fund’s assets. BFA is responsible for placing purchase and sale orders and providing continuous supervision of the investment portfolio of each Fund.</font></div>
<div>Pursuant to the investment advisory agreement, BFA may, from
time to time, in its sole discretion and to the extent permitted by applicable law, appoint one or more sub-advisers, including, without limitation, affiliates of BFA, to perform investment advisory or other services with respect to a Fund. In
addition, BFA may delegate certain of its investment advisory functions under the investment advisory agreement to one or more of its affiliates to the extent permitted by applicable law. BFA may terminate any or all sub-advisers or such delegation
arrangements in its sole discretion upon appropriate notice at any time to the extent permitted by applicable law.</div>
<div>BFA is responsible, under the investment advisory agreement,
for substantially all expenses of the Funds, including the cost of transfer agency, custody, fund administration, legal, audit and other services. BFA is not responsible for, and the Funds will bear, the management fees, interest expenses, taxes,
expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses

received a management fee at the annual rates (as a percentage of such Fund’s average net assets) set forth below for the fiscal years noted. For its investment advisory services to the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF, BFA is
paid a management fee from the Fund based on the aggregate average daily net assets of the following iShares funds: iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF and iShares J.P. Morgan USD Emerging Markets Bond ETF. The management fee for the Fund
equals the ratio of the Fund's net assets over the aggregate net assets of the above iShares funds multiplied by the amount calculated as follows: 0.5000% per annum of the aggregate net assets less than or equal to $19 billion, plus 0.4750% per

investment advisory services to the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond ETF, iShares Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, iShares MBS ETF and iShares Short-Term Corporate Bond ETF, BFA is paid a

securities and other financial instruments that compose those indexes or through a representative sampling of the securities and other financial instruments that compose those indexes based on objective criteria and data. Pursuant to BFA policy,
investment opportunities are allocated equitably among the Funds and other portfolios and accounts. For example, under certain circumstances, an investment opportunity may be restricted due to limited supply in the market, legal constraints or other
factors, in which event the investment opportunity will be allocated equitably among those portfolios and accounts, including the Funds, seeking such investment opportunity. As a consequence, from time to time the Funds may receive a smaller

<div>Like the Funds, the other portfolios or accounts for which the
Portfolio Managers are primarily responsible for the day-to-day portfolio management generally pay an asset-based fee to BFA or its affiliates, as applicable, for its advisory services. One or more of those other portfolios or accounts, however, may
pay BFA or its affiliates a performance-based fee in lieu of, or in addition to, an asset-based fee for its advisory services. A portfolio or account with a performance-based fee would pay BFA or its affiliates a portion of that portfolio's or
account's gains, or would pay BFA or its affiliates more for its services than would otherwise be the case if BFA or its affiliates meets or exceeds specified performance targets. Performance-based fee arrangements could present an incentive for BFA
or its affiliates to devote greater resources, and allocate more investment opportunities, to the portfolios or accounts that have those fee arrangements, relative to other portfolios or accounts, in order to earn larger fees. Although BFA and its
affiliates have an obligation to allocate resources and opportunities equitably among portfolios and accounts and intends to do so, shareholders of the Funds should be aware that, as with any group of portfolios and accounts managed by an investment
adviser and/or its affiliates pursuant to varying fee arrangements, including performance-based fee arrangements, there is the potential for a conflict-of-interest, which may result in the Portfolio Managers' favoring those portfolios or accounts

Overview</div> <div>The discussion below describes the Portfolio
Managers' compensation as of February 28, 2019.</div>
<div>BlackRock, Inc.'s financial arrangements with its portfolio
managers, its competitive compensation and its career path emphasis at all levels reflect the value senior management places on key resources. Compensation may include a variety of components and may vary from year to year based on a number of
factors. The principal components of compensation include a base salary, a performance-based discretionary bonus, participation in various benefits programs and one or more of the incentive compensation programs established by BlackRock, Inc.</div>
<div>Base compensation.<font> Generally,
portfolio managers receive base compensation based on their position with the firm.</font></div>
<div>Discretionary Incentive Compensation.<font> Discretionary incentive compensation is a function of several components: the performance of BlackRock, Inc., the performance of the portfolio manager’s group within BlackRock, Inc., the investment performance,
including risk-adjusted returns, of the firm’s assets under management or supervision by that portfolio manager relative to predetermined benchmarks, and the individual’s performance and contribution to the overall performance of these
portfolios and BlackRock, Inc. Performance is generally assessed over trailing 1-, 3- and 5-year periods relative to benchmarks plus an alpha target as well as against peer groups. In most cases, benchmarks are the same as the benchmark or
benchmarks against which the performance of the Funds or other accounts managed by the portfolio managers are measured. Among other things, BlackRock, Inc.’s Chief Investment Officers make a subjective determination with respect to each
portfolio manager’s compensation based on the performance of the Funds and other accounts managed by each portfolio manager relative to the various benchmarks. With respect to these portfolio managers in relation to these portfolios, the
benchmarks for the Funds and other accounts are: a combination of S&amp;P 500 Index, FTSE World ex-US Index, ICE BofAML Current 5-Year U.S. Treasury Index and FTSE Non-U.S. Dollar World Government Bond Index.</font></div>
<div>Distribution of Discretionary Incentive Compensation.<font> Discretionary incentive compensation is distributed to portfolio managers in a combination of cash, deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock awards, and/or deferred cash awards that notionally track the return of certain
BlackRock, Inc. investment products.</font></div> <div>Portfolio
managers receive their annual discretionary incentive compensation in the form of cash. Portfolio managers whose total compensation is above a specified threshold also receive deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock awards annually as part of their
discretionary incentive compensation. Paying a portion of discretionary incentive compensation in the form of deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock puts compensation earned by a portfolio manager for a given year “at risk” based on BlackRock,
Inc.’s ability to sustain and improve its performance over future periods. In some cases, additional deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock may be granted to certain key employees as part of a long-term incentive award to aid in retention, align
interests with long-term shareholders and motivate performance. Deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock awards are generally granted in the form of BlackRock, Inc. restricted stock units that vest pursuant to the terms of the applicable plan and, once
vested, settle in BlackRock, Inc. common stock. The portfolio managers of the Funds have deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock awards.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>For certain portfolio managers, a portion of the discretionary
incentive compensation is also distributed in the form of deferred cash awards that notionally track the returns of select BlackRock, Inc. investment products they manage, which provides direct alignment of portfolio manager discretionary incentive
compensation with investment product results. Deferred cash awards vest ratably over a number of years and, once vested, settle in the form of cash. Only portfolio managers who manage specified products and whose total compensation is above a
specified threshold are eligible to participate in the deferred cash award program.</div>
<div>Other Compensation Benefits.<font>
In addition to base salary and discretionary incentive compensation, portfolio managers may be eligible to receive or participate in one or more of the following:</font></div>
<div>Incentive Savings Plans<font>
— BlackRock, Inc. has created a variety of incentive savings plans in which BlackRock, Inc. employees are eligible to participate, including a 401(k) plan, the BlackRock Retirement Savings Plan (“RSP”), and the BlackRock Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). The employer contribution components of the RSP include a company match equal to 50% of the first 8% of eligible pay contributed to the plan capped at $5,000 per year, and a company retirement contribution
equal to 3-5% of eligible compensation up to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) limit ($280,000 for 2019). The RSP offers a range of investment options, including registered investment companies and collective investment funds
managed by the firm. BlackRock, Inc. contributions follow the investment direction set by participants for their own contributions or, absent participant investment direction, are invested into a target date fund that corresponds to, or is closest
to, the year in which the participant attains age 65. The ESPP allows for investment in BlackRock, Inc. common stock at a 5% discount on the fair market value of the stock on the purchase date. Annual participation in the ESPP is limited to the
purchase of 1,000 shares of common stock or a dollar value of $25,000 based on its fair market value on the Purchase Date. All of the portfolio managers of the Funds are eligible to participate in these plans.</font></div>
<div>As of February 28, 2019, the Portfolio Managers beneficially
owned shares of the Funds in the amounts reflected in the following tables:</div> <div>

in the applicable Prospectus and below in the</font><font> Creation</font><font> </font><font>and Redemption of Creation Units
</font><font>section of this SAI. Fund shares in amounts less than Creation Units are generally not distributed by the Distributor or its agent. The Distributor or its agent will arrange for the delivery of the applicable
Prospectus and, upon request, this SAI to persons purchasing Creation Units and will maintain records of both orders placed with it or its agents and confirmations of acceptance furnished by it or its agents. The Distributor is a broker-dealer
registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”), and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”). The Distributor is also licensed as a broker-dealer in all 50
U.S. states, as well as in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia.</font></div>
<div>The Distribution Agreement for each Fund provides that it may
be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, on at least 60 days' prior written notice to the other party following (i) the vote of a majority of the Independent Trustees, or (ii) the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting
securities (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the relevant Fund. The Distribution Agreement will terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).</div>
<div>The Distributor may also enter into agreements with securities
dealers (“Soliciting Dealers”) who will solicit purchases of Creation Units of Fund shares. Such Soliciting Dealers may also be Authorized Participants (as described below), DTC participants and/or investor services organizations.</div>
<div>BFA or its affiliates may, from time to time and from its own
resources, pay, defray or absorb costs relating to distribution, including payments out of its own resources to the Distributor, or to otherwise promote the sale of shares.</div>
<div>Securities Lending. <font> To
the extent that a Fund engages in securities lending, each Fund conducts its securities lending pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, and BTC acts as securities lending agent for the Funds, subject to the overall supervision of BFA, pursuant to a
written agreement (the “Securities Lending Agency Agreement”).</font></div>
<div>Each Fund retains a portion of the securities lending income
and remits the remaining portion to BTC as compensation for its services as securities lending agent. Securities lending income is generally equal to the total of income earned from the reinvestment of cash collateral (and excludes collateral
investment fees as defined below), and any fees or other payments to and from borrowers of securities. As securities lending agent, BTC bears all operational costs directly related to securities lending. Each Fund is responsible for fees in
connection with the investment of cash collateral received for securities on loan in a money market fund managed by BFA (the “collateral investment fees”); however, BTC has agreed to reduce the amount of securities lending income it
receives in order to effectively limit the collateral investment fees the Fund bears to an annual rate of 0.04%. Such money market fund shares will not be subject to a sales load, redemption fee, distribution fee or service fee.</div>
<div>Pursuant to the Securities Lending Agency Agreement:</div>
<div>Effective January 1, 2019, (i) the iShares fixed-income funds,
such as the Funds, retain 82% of securities lending income (which excludes collateral investment fees) and (ii) this amount can never be less than 70% of the sum of securities lending income plus collateral investment fees.</div>
<div>Under the securities lending program, the Funds are
categorized into one of several specific asset classes. The determination of a Fund’s asset class category (fixed-income, domestic equity, international equity or fund-of-funds), each of which may be subject to a different fee arrangement, is
based on a methodology agreed to by the Trust and BTC.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

that the aggregate securities lending income (which includes, for this purpose, collateral investment fees) earned across the Exchange-Traded Fund Complex (as defined under “Management<font></font>—<font></font>Trustees and Officers”) in a calendar year exceeds a specified threshold, each applicable fixed income fund, pursuant to the securities lending agreement, will receive for the remainder of that calendar year
securities lending income as follows:</div> <div>(i) 85% of
securities lending income (which excludes collateral investment fees) and (ii) this amount can never be less than 70% of the sum of securities lending income plus collateral investment fees.</div>
<div>The services provided to the Funds by BTC in the most recent
fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 primarily included the following:</div>
<div>(1) selecting borrowers from an approved
list of borrowers and executing a securities lending agreement as agent on behalf of the Funds with each such borrower; </div>
<div>(2) negotiating the terms of securities
loans, including the amount of fees; </div>
<div>(3) directing the delivery of loaned
securities; </div> <div>(4) monitoring the daily
value of the loaned securities and directing the payment of additional collateral or the return of excess collateral, as necessary; </div>
<div>(5) investing cash collateral received in
connection with any loaned securities; </div>
<div>(6) monitoring distributions on loaned
securities (for example, interest and dividend activity); </div>
<div>(7) in the event of default by a borrower
with respect to any securities loan, using the collateral or the proceeds of the liquidation of collateral to purchase replacement securities of the same issue, type, class and series as that of the loaned securities; and </div>
<div>(8) terminating securities loans and
arranging for the return of loaned securities to the Funds at loan termination.</div>

related to the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products in general. BFA Entities make these payments from their own assets and not from the assets of the Funds. Although a portion of BFA Entities’ revenue comes directly or
indirectly in part from fees paid by the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products, these payments do not increase the price paid by investors for the purchase of shares of, or the cost of owning, the Funds, other iShares funds or
exchange-traded products. BFA Entities make payments for Intermediaries’ participation in activities that are designed to make registered representatives, other professionals and individual investors more knowledgeable about exchange-traded
products, including the Funds and other iShares funds, or for other activities, such as participation in marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting
systems (“Education Costs”). BFA Entities also make payments to Intermediaries for certain printing, publishing and mailing costs or materials relating to the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products (“Publishing
Costs”). In addition, BFA Entities make payments to Intermediaries that make shares of the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products available to their clients, develop new products that feature iShares or otherwise promote the
Funds, other iShares funds and exchange-traded products. BFA Entities may also reimburse expenses or make payments from their own assets to Intermediaries or other persons in consideration of services or other activities that the BFA Entities
believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products. Payments of the type described above are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments.</font></div>
<div>Payments to an Intermediary may be significant to the
Intermediary, and amounts that Intermediaries pay to your salesperson or other investment professional may also be significant for your salesperson or other investment professional. Because an Intermediary may make decisions about which investment
options it will recommend or make available to its clients or what services to provide for various products based on payments it receives or is eligible to receive, such payments may create conflicts of interest between the Intermediary and its
clients and these financial incentives may cause the</div> </div> <div type="Block">

products over other investments. The same conflicts of interest and financial incentives exist with respect to your salesperson or other investment professional if he or she receives similar payments from his or her Intermediary firm.</div>
<div>In addition to the payments described above, BFA Entities have
developed proprietary tools, calculators and related interactive or digital content that is made available through the www.BlackRock.com website at no additional cost to Intermediaries. BlackRock may configure these tools and calculators and
localizes the content for Intermediaries as part of its customary digital marketing support and promotion of the Funds, other iShares funds, exchange-traded products and BlackRock mutual funds.</div>
<div>As of March 1, 2013, BFA Entities have contractual
arrangements to make payments (in addition to payments for Education Costs or Publishing Costs) to one Intermediary, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC (“FBS”). Effective June 4, 2016, this relationship was expanded to include National
Financial Services, LLC (“NFS”), an affiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this special, long-term and significant arrangement (the “Marketing Program”), FBS, NFS and certain of their affiliates (collectively “Fidelity”)
have agreed, among other things, to actively promote iShares funds to customers, investment professionals and other intermediaries and in advertising campaigns as the preferred exchange-traded product, to offer certain iShares funds in certain
Fidelity platforms and investment programs, in some cases at a waived or reduced commission rate or ticket charge, and to provide marketing data to BFA Entities. BFA Entities have agreed to facilitate the Marketing Program by, among other things,
making certain payments to FBS and NFS for marketing and implementing certain brokerage and investment programs. Upon termination of the arrangement, the BFA Entities will make additional payments to FBS and/or NFS based upon a number of criteria,
including the overall success of the Marketing Program and the level of services provided by FBS and NFS during the wind-down period.</div>
<div>In addition, BFA Entities may enter into other contractual
arrangements with Intermediaries and certain other third parties that the BFA Entities believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in iShares funds. Such agreements may include payments by BFA Entities to such Intermediaries
and third parties for data collection and provision, technology support, platform enhancement, or co-marketing and cross-promotional efforts. Payments made pursuant to such arrangements may vary in any year and may be different for different
Intermediaries and third parties. In certain cases, the payments described in the preceding sentence may be subject to certain minimum payment levels. Such payments will not be asset- or revenue-based. As of the date of this SAI, the Intermediaries
and other third parties receiving such contractual payments include: Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Inc., Commonwealth Equity Services, Inc., Dorsey Wright and Associates, LLC, E*Trade Securities LLC, FDx Advisors, Inc., Ladenburg Thalmann Advisor
Network LLC, LPL Financial LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC, Orion Advisors Services, LLC, Pershing LLC, Raymond James Financial Services, Inc., TD Ameritrade, Inc. and UBS Financial
Services Inc. Any additions, modifications, or deletions to Intermediaries and other third parties listed above that have occurred since the date of this SAI are not included in the list.</div>
<div>Further, BFA Entities make Education Costs and Publishing
Costs payments to other Intermediaries that are not listed above. BFA Entities may determine to make such payments based on any number of metrics. For example, BFA Entities may make payments at year-end or other intervals in a fixed amount, an
amount based upon an Intermediary’s services at defined levels or an amount based on the Intermediary’s net sales of one or more iShares funds in a year or other period, any of which arrangements may include an agreed-upon minimum or
maximum payment, or any combination of the foregoing. As of the date of this SAI, BFA anticipates that the payments paid by BFA Entities in connection with the Funds, iShares funds and exchange-traded products in general will be immaterial to BFA
Entities in the aggregate for the next year. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such payments or financial incentives his or her Intermediary firm may
receive. Any payments made, or financial incentives offered, by the BFA Entities to an Intermediary may create the incentive for the Intermediary to encourage customers to buy shares of the Funds, other iShares funds or other exchange-traded
products.</font></div> <div>The Funds may participate in certain
market maker incentive programs of a national securities exchange in which an affiliate of the Funds would pay a fee to the exchange used for the purpose of incentivizing one or more market makers in the securities of a Fund to enhance the liquidity
and quality of the secondary market of securities of a Fund. The fee would then be credited by the exchange to one or more market makers that meet or exceed liquidity and market quality standards with respect to the securities of a Fund. Each market
maker incentive program is subject to approval from the SEC. Any such fee payments made to an exchange will be made by an affiliate of a Fund solely for the benefit of a Fund and will not be paid from any Fund assets. Other funds managed by BFA may
also participate in such programs.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Determination of Net Asset Value</div>
<div>Valuation of Shares. <font>The NAV
for each Fund is generally calculated as of the close of business on the NYSE (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each business day the NYSE is open. Valuation of securities held by a Fund is as follows:</font></div>
<div>Equity Investments. <font>Equity
securities traded on a recognized securities exchange (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, NYSE), on separate trading boards of a securities exchange or through a market system
that provides contemporaneous transaction pricing information (each, an “Exchange”) are valued using information obtained via independent pricing services, generally at the closing price on the Exchange on which the security is primarily
traded, or if an Exchange closing price is not available, the last traded price on that Exchange prior to the time as of which a Fund’s assets or liabilities are valued. However, under certain circumstances, other means of determining current
market value may be used. If an equity security is traded on more than one Exchange, the current market value of the security where it is primarily traded generally will be used. In the event that there are no sales involving an equity security held
by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values such security, the prior day’s price will be used, unless, in accordance with valuation procedures approved by the Board (the “Valuation Procedures”), BlackRock determines in good faith
that such prior day’s price no longer reflects the fair value of the security, in which case such asset would be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below).</font></div>
<div>Fixed-Income Investments.
<font>Fixed-income securities for which market quotations are readily available are generally valued using such securities’ current market value. A Fund values fixed-income portfolio securities using the last
available bid prices or current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated prices) supplied by a Fund’s approved independent third-party pricing services, each in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. The pricing
services may use matrix pricing or valuation models that utilize certain inputs and assumptions to derive values, including transaction data (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>,
recent representative bids and offers), credit quality information, perceived market movements, news, and other relevant information and by other methods, which may include consideration of: yields or prices of securities of comparable quality,
coupon, maturity and type; indications as to values from dealers; general market conditions; and/or other factors and assumptions. Pricing services generally value fixed-income securities assuming orderly transactions of an institutional round lot
size, but a Fund may hold or transact in such securities in smaller, odd lot sizes. Odd lots may trade at lower prices than institutional round lots. The amortized cost method of valuation may be used with respect to debt obligations with sixty days
or less remaining to maturity unless BlackRock determines in good faith that such method does not represent fair value. Loan participation notes are generally valued at the mean of the last available bid prices from one or more brokers or dealers as
obtained from independent third-party pricing services. Certain fixed-income investments, including asset-backed and mortgage-related securities, may be valued based on valuation models that consider the estimated cash flows of each tranche of the
entity, establish a benchmark yield and develop an estimated tranche-specific spread to the benchmark yield based on the unique attributes of the tranche.</font></div>
<div>Options, Futures, Swaps and Other Derivatives. <font>Exchange-traded equity options for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the mean of the last bid and ask prices as quoted on the Exchange or the board of trade on which such options are traded. In
the event that there is no mean price available for an exchange traded equity option held by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values such option, the last bid (long positions) or ask (short positions) price, if available, will be used as the value of
such option. If no such bid or ask price is available on a day on which a Fund values such option, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BlackRock determines in good faith that such prior day’s price no longer reflects the fair
value of the option, in which case such option will be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below). OTC derivatives are valued using the last available bid prices or current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated
prices) supplied by a Fund’s approved independent third-party pricing services, each in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. OTC derivatives may be valued using a mathematical model which may incorporate a number of market data factors.
Financial futures contracts and options thereon, which are traded on exchanges, are valued at their settle price as of the close of such exchanges. Swap agreements and other derivatives are generally valued daily based upon quotations from market
makers or by a pricing service in accordance with the Valuation Procedures.</font></div>
<div>Underlying Funds. <font>Shares of
underlying ETFs will be valued at their most recent closing price on an Exchange. Shares of underlying money market funds will be valued at their NAV.</font></div>
<div>General Valuation Information.
<font>The price a Fund could receive upon the sale of any particular portfolio investment may differ from a Fund’s valuation of the investment, particularly for securities that trade in thin or volatile markets or
that are valued using a fair valuation methodology or a price provided by an independent pricing service. As a result, the price received upon</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>the sale of an investment may be less than the value ascribed by a Fund, and
a Fund could realize a greater than expected loss or lesser than expected gain upon the sale of the investment. A Fund’s ability to value its investment may also be impacted by technological issues and/or errors by pricing services or other
third-party service providers.</div> <div>All cash, receivables and
current payables are carried on a Fund’s books at their fair value.</div>
<div>Prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services,
broker-dealers or market makers to value a Fund’s securities and other assets and liabilities are based on information available at the time a Fund values its assets and liabilities. In the event that a pricing service quotation is revised or
updated subsequent to the day on which a Fund valued such security or other asset or liability, the revised pricing service quotation generally will be applied prospectively. Such determination will be made considering pertinent facts and
circumstances surrounding the revision.</div> <div>In the event
that application of the methods of valuation discussed above result in a price for a security which is deemed not to be representative of the fair market value of such security, the security will be valued by, under the direction of or in accordance
with a method approved by the Board as reflecting fair value. All other assets and liabilities (including securities for which market quotations are not readily available) held by a Fund (including restricted securities) are valued at fair value as
determined in good faith by the Board or by BlackRock (its delegate) pursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any assets and liabilities that are denominated in a foreign currency are converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing market rates on the
date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers.</div>
<div>Certain of the securities acquired by a Fund may be traded on
foreign exchanges or OTC markets on days on which a Fund’s NAV is not calculated. In such cases, the NAV of a Fund’s shares may be significantly affected on days when Authorized Participants can neither purchase nor redeem shares of a
Fund.</div> <div>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities, U.S.
government securities, money market instruments and certain fixed-income securities is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of business on the NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of a Fund
are determined as of such times.</div> <div>Use of fair value
prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate a Fund’s NAV and the prices used in the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between a Fund’s
performance and the performance of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Fair Value.<font> When market
quotations are not readily available or are believed in good faith by BlackRock to be unreliable, a Fund’s investments are valued at fair value (“Fair Value Assets”). Fair Value Assets are valued by BlackRock in accordance with the
Valuation Procedures. BlackRock may reasonably conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if, among other things, a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its complete lack of
trading, if BlackRock believes in good faith that a market quotation from a broker-dealer or other source is unreliable (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, where it varies
significantly from a recent trade, or no longer reflects the fair value of the security or other asset or liability subsequent to the most recent market quotation), or where the security or other asset or liability is only thinly traded or due to
the occurrence of a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation. For this purpose, a “significant event” is deemed to occur if BlackRock determines, in its reasonable business judgment, that an event has occurred
after the close of trading for an asset or liability but prior to or at the time of pricing a Fund’s assets or liabilities, and that the event is likely to cause a material change to the closing market price of the assets or liabilities held
by a Fund. Non-U.S. securities whose values are affected by volatility that occurs in the markets or in related or highly correlated assets (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>,
American Depositary Receipts, Global Depositary Receipts or ETFs that invest in components of the Underlying Index) on a trading day after the close of non-U.S. securities markets may be fair valued. On any day the NYSE is open and a foreign market
or the primary exchange on which a foreign asset or liability is traded is closed, such asset or liability will be valued using the prior day’s price, provided that BlackRock is not aware of any significant event or other information that
would cause such price to no longer reflect the fair value of the asset or liability, in which case such asset or liability would be treated as a Fair Value Asset.</font></div>
<div>BlackRock, with input from the BlackRock Investment Strategy
Group, will submit its recommendations regarding the valuation and/or valuation methodologies for Fair Value Assets to BlackRock’s Valuation Committee. The BlackRock Valuation Committee may accept, modify or reject any recommendations. In
addition, a Fund’s accounting agent periodically endeavors to confirm the prices it receives from all third-party pricing services, index providers and broker-dealers, and, with the assistance of BlackRock, to regularly evaluate the values
assigned to the securities and other assets and liabilities of a Fund. The pricing of all Fair Value Assets is subsequently reported to and, where appropriate, ratified by the Board.</div> </div>

<div>When determining the price for a Fair Value Asset, the
BlackRock Valuation Committee (or BlackRock’s Pricing Group) will seek to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect to receive upon the current sale of that asset or liability in an arm’s-length transaction on the date on
which the assets or liabilities are being valued, and does not seek to determine the price that a Fund might expect to receive for selling the asset, or the cost of extinguishing a liability, at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to
maturity. Fair value determinations will be based upon all available factors that the BlackRock Valuation Committee (or BlackRock’s Pricing Group) deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be based on analytical values
determined by BlackRock using proprietary or third-party valuation models.</div>
<div>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value
of an asset or liability. When determining the fair value of an asset, one or more of a variety of fair valuation methodologies may be used (depending on certain factors, including the asset type). For example, the asset may be priced on the basis
of the original cost of the investment or, alternatively, using proprietary or third-party models (including models that rely upon direct portfolio management pricing inputs and which reflect the significance attributed to the various factors and
assumptions being considered). Prices of actual, executed or historical transactions in the relevant asset and/or liability (or related or comparable assets and/or liabilities) or, where appropriate, an appraisal by a third-party experienced in the
valuation of similar assets and/or liabilities, may also be used as a basis for establishing the fair value of an asset or liability. The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in retrospect, be the price at which those assets or
liabilities could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a holding or holdings are valued
at fair value, may have the effect of diluting or increasing the economic interest of existing shareholders.</div>

are prepared in accordance with US GAAP, follow the requirements for valuation set forth in Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC
820”), which defines and establishes a framework for measuring fair value under US GAAP and expands financial statement disclosure requirements relating to fair value measurements. Generally, ASC 820 and other accounting rules applicable to
funds and various assets in which they invest are evolving. Such changes may adversely affect a Fund. For example, the evolution of rules governing the determination of the fair market value of assets or liabilities to the extent such rules become
more stringent would tend to increase the cost and/or reduce the availability of third-party determinations of fair market value. This may in turn increase the costs associated with selling assets or affect their liquidity due to a Fund’s
inability to obtain a third-party determination of fair market value.</div>
<div>Brokerage Transactions</div>
<div>Subject to policies established by the Board, BFA is primarily
responsible for the execution of a Fund’s portfolio transactions and the allocation of brokerage. BFA does not execute transactions through any particular broker or dealer, but seeks to obtain the best net results for the Funds, taking into
account such factors as price (including the applicable brokerage commission or dealer spread), size of order, difficulty of execution, operational facilities of the firm and the firm’s risk and skill in positioning blocks of securities. While
BFA generally seeks reasonable trade execution costs, a Fund does not necessarily pay the lowest spread or commission available, and payment of the lowest commission or spread is not necessarily consistent with obtaining the best price and execution
in particular transactions. Subject to applicable legal requirements, BFA may select a broker based partly upon brokerage or research services provided to BFA and its clients, including a Fund. In return for such services, BFA may cause a Fund to
pay a higher commission than other brokers would charge if BFA determines in good faith that the commission is reasonable in relation to the services provided.</div>
<div>In selecting brokers or dealers to execute portfolio
transactions, BFA seeks to obtain the best price and most favorable execution for a Fund and may take into account a variety of factors including: (i) the size, nature and character of the security or instrument being traded and the markets in which
it is purchased or sold; (ii) the desired timing of the transaction; (iii) BFA’s knowledge of the expected commission rates and spreads currently available; (iv) the activity existing and expected in the market for the particular security or
instrument, including any anticipated execution difficulties; (v) the full range of brokerage services provided; (vi) the broker’s or dealer’s capital; (vii) the quality of research and research services provided; (viii) the
reasonableness of the commission, dealer spread or its equivalent for the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA’s knowledge of any actual or apparent operational problems of a broker or dealer. Brokers may also be selected because of their
ability to handle special or difficult executions, such as may be involved in large block trades, thinly traded securities, or other circumstances.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act (“Section 28(e)”)
permits a U.S. investment adviser, under certain circumstances, to cause an account to pay a broker or dealer a commission for effecting a transaction in securities that exceeds the amount another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting
the same transaction in recognition of the value of brokerage and research services provided by that broker or dealer. This includes commissions paid on riskless principal transactions in securities under certain conditions.</div>
<div>From time to time, a Fund may purchase new issues of
securities in a fixed price offering. In these situations, the broker may be a member of the selling group that will, in addition to selling securities, provide BFA with research services. FINRA has adopted rules expressly permitting these types of
arrangements under certain circumstances. Generally, the broker will provide research “credits” in these situations at a rate that is higher than that available for typical secondary market transactions. These arrangements may not fall
within the safe harbor of Section 28(e).</div> <div>OTC issues,
including most fixed-income securities such as corporate debt and U.S. Government securities, are normally traded on a “net” basis without a stated commission, through dealers acting for their own account and not as brokers. The Funds
will primarily engage in transactions with these dealers or deal directly with the issuer unless a better price or execution could be obtained by using a broker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect to both foreign and domestic securities will
generally include a “spread,” which is the difference between the prices at which the dealer is willing to purchase and sell the specific security at the time, and includes the dealer’s normal profit.</div>
<div>Under the 1940 Act, persons affiliated with a Fund and persons
who are affiliated with such affiliated persons are prohibited from dealing with the Fund as principal in the purchase and sale of securities unless a permissive order allowing such transactions is obtained from the SEC. Since transactions in the
OTC market usually involve transactions with the dealers acting as principal for their own accounts, the Funds will not deal with affiliated persons and affiliated persons of such affiliated persons in connection with such transactions. The Funds
will not purchase securities during the existence of any underwriting or selling group relating to such securities of which BFA, BRIL or any affiliated person (as defined in the 1940 Act) thereof is a member except pursuant to procedures adopted by
the Board in accordance with Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 Act.</div>
<div>Purchases of money market instruments by the Funds are made
from dealers, underwriters and issuers. The Funds do not currently expect to incur any brokerage commission expense on such transactions because money market instruments are generally traded on a “net” basis with dealers acting as
principal for their own accounts without a stated commission. The price of the security, however, usually includes a profit to the dealer.</div>
<div>BFA may, from time to time, effect trades on behalf of and for
the account of the Funds with brokers or dealers that are affiliated with BFA, in conformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under these provisions, any commissions paid to affiliated brokers or dealers must be
reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by other brokers or dealers in comparable transactions.</div>
<div>Securities purchased in underwritten offerings include a fixed
amount of compensation to the underwriter, generally referred to as the underwriter’s concession or discount. When securities are purchased or sold directly from or to an issuer, no commissions or discounts are paid.</div>
<div>Investment decisions for the Funds and for other investment
accounts managed by BFA and the other Affiliates are made independently of each other in light of differing conditions. A variety of factors will be considered in making investment allocations. These factors include: (i) investment objectives or
strategies for particular accounts, including sector, industry, country or region and capitalization weightings; (ii) tax considerations of an account; (iii) risk or investment concentration parameters for an account; (iv) supply or demand for a
security at a given price level; (v) size of available investment; (vi) cash availability and liquidity requirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory restrictions; (viii) minimum investment size of an account; (ix) relative size of account; and (x)
such other factors as may be approved by BlackRock’s general counsel. Moreover, investments may not be allocated to one client account over another based on any of the following considerations: (i) to favor one client account at the expense of
another; (ii) to generate higher fees paid by one client account over another or to produce greater performance compensation to BlackRock; (iii) to develop or enhance a relationship with a client or prospective client; (iv) to compensate a client
for past services or benefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce future services or benefits to be rendered to BlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize investment performance among different client accounts. BFA and the other Affiliates may deal,
trade and invest for their own respective accounts in the types of securities in which the Funds may invest.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

 Table of Contents </a> </div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Initial public offerings (“IPOs”) of securities
may be over-subscribed and subsequently trade at a premium in the secondary market. When BFA is given an opportunity to invest in such an initial offering or “new” or “hot” issue, the supply of securities available for client
accounts is often less than the amount of securities the accounts would otherwise take. In order to allocate these investments fairly and equitably among client accounts over time, each portfolio manager or a member of his or her respective
investment team will indicate to BFA’s trading desk their level of interest in a particular offering with respect to eligible clients’ accounts for which that team is responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities will be identified as
eligible for particular client accounts that are managed by portfolio teams who have indicated interest in the offering based on market capitalization of the issuer of the security and the investment mandate of the client account and in the case of
international equity securities, the country where the offering is taking place and the investment mandate of the client account. Generally, shares received during the IPO will be allocated among participating client accounts within each investment
mandate on a <font>pro rata</font> basis. This <font>pro rata</font> allocation may result in a Fund receiving less of a particular security than if pro-rating had not occurred. All allocations
of securities will be subject, where relevant, to share minimums established for accounts and compliance constraints. In situations where supply is too limited to be allocated among all accounts for which the investment is eligible, portfolio
managers may rotate such investment opportunities among one or more accounts so long as the rotation system provides for fair access for all client accounts over time. Other allocation methodologies that are considered by BFA to be fair and
equitable to clients may be used as well.</div> <div>Because
different accounts may have differing investment objectives and policies, BFA may buy and sell the same securities at the same time for different clients based on the particular investment objective, guidelines and strategies of those accounts. For
example, BFA may decide that it may be entirely appropriate for a growth fund to sell a security at the same time a value fund is buying that security. To the extent that transactions on behalf of more than one client of BFA or the other Affiliates
during the same period may increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, there may be an adverse effect on price. For example, sales of a security by BlackRock on behalf of one or more of its clients may
decrease the market price of such security, adversely impacting other BlackRock clients that still hold the security. If purchases or sales of securities arise for consideration at or about the same time that would involve the Funds or other clients
or funds for which BFA or another Affiliate act as investment manager, transactions in such securities will be made, insofar as feasible, for the respective funds and clients in a manner deemed equitable to all.</div>
<div>In certain instances, BFA may find it efficient for purposes
of seeking to obtain best execution, to aggregate or “bunch” certain contemporaneous purchases or sale orders of its advisory accounts and advisory accounts of affiliates. In general, all contemporaneous trades for client accounts under
management by the same portfolio manager or investment team will be bunched in a single order if the trader believes the bunched trade would provide each client with an opportunity to achieve a more favorable execution at a potentially lower
execution cost. The costs associated with a bunched order will be shared <font>pro rata</font> among the clients in the bunched order. Generally, if an order for a particular portfolio manager or management team is filled
at several different prices through multiple trades, all accounts participating in the order will receive the average price (except in the case of certain international markets where average pricing is not permitted). While in some cases this
practice could have a detrimental effect upon the price or value of the security as far as the Funds are concerned, in other cases it could be beneficial to the Funds. Transactions effected by BFA or the other Affiliates on behalf of more than one
of its clients during the same period may increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, causing an adverse effect on price. The trader will give the bunched order to the broker-dealer that the trader has
identified as being able to provide the best execution of the order. Orders for purchase or sale of securities will be placed within a reasonable amount of time of the order receipt and bunched orders will be kept bunched only long enough to execute
the order.</div> <div>The table below sets forth the brokerage
commissions paid by each Fund for the fiscal years noted. Any differences in brokerage commissions paid by a Fund from year to year are principally due to increases or decreases in that Fund’s assets over those periods or the
magnitude of changes to the components of a Fund's Underlying Index:</div> <div>

<div><br/> The Funds' purchase and sale orders for securities may be
combined with those of other investment companies, clients or accounts that BlackRock manages or advises. If purchases or sales of portfolio securities of the Funds and one or more other accounts managed or advised by BlackRock are considered at or
about the same time, transactions in such securities are allocated among the Funds and the other accounts in a manner deemed equitable to all by BlackRock. In some cases, this procedure could have a detrimental effect on the price or volume of the
security as far as the Funds are concerned. However, in other cases, it is possible that the ability to participate in volume transactions and to negotiate lower transaction costs will be beneficial to the Funds. BlackRock may deal, trade and invest
for its own account in the types of securities in which the Funds may invest. BlackRock may, from time to time, effect trades on behalf of and for the account of the Funds with brokers or dealers that are affiliated with BFA, in conformity with the
1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under these provisions, any commissions paid to affiliated brokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by other brokers or dealers in comparable transactions. The Funds
will not deal with affiliates in principal transactions unless permitted by applicable SEC rules or regulations, or by SEC exemptive order.</div>
<div>Portfolio turnover may vary from year to year, as well as
within a year. Certain Funds may use TBA transactions, which are expected to cause a higher portfolio turnover rate because TBA positions are rolled every month. High turnover rates may result in comparatively greater brokerage expenses. While
each Fund's portfolio turnover rates are generally expected to be low, the portfolio turnover rate for that portion of the iShares Core 5-10 Year USD Bond ETF's, iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF's, iShares ESG U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF's and
iShares MBS ETF's assets invested through TBA transactions, if any, is expected to be substantially higher because TBA positions are rolled every month. Higher turnover rates would likely result in comparatively greater transaction costs.</div>

Concerning the Trust</div> <div>Shares.<font>  The Trust currently consists of more than 285 separate investment series or portfolios called funds. The Trust issues shares of beneficial interests in the funds with no par value. The Board may designate
additional iShares funds.</font></div> <div>Each share issued by a
fund has a <font>pro rata</font> interest in the assets of that fund. Shares have no preemptive, exchange, subscription or conversion rights and are freely transferable. Each share is entitled to participate equally in
dividends and distributions declared by the Board with respect to the relevant fund, and in the net distributable assets of such fund on liquidation.</div>
<div>Each share has one vote with respect to matters upon which the
shareholder is entitled to vote. In any matter submitted to shareholders for a vote, each fund shall hold a separate vote, provided that shareholders of all affected funds will vote together when: (i) required by the 1940 Act, or (ii) the Trustees
determine that the matter affects the interests of more than one fund.</div>
<div>Under Delaware law, the Trust is not required to hold an
annual meeting of shareholders unless required to do so under the 1940 Act. The policy of the Trust is not to hold an annual meeting of shareholders unless required to do so under the 1940 Act. All shares (regardless of the fund) have noncumulative
voting rights in the election of members of the Board. Under Delaware law, Trustees of the Trust may be removed by vote of the shareholders.</div>
<div>Following the creation of the initial Creation Unit(s) of
shares of a fund and immediately prior to the commencement of trading in such fund’s shares, a holder of shares may be a “control person” of the fund, as defined in Rule 0-1 under the 1940 Act. A fund cannot predict the length of
time for which one or more shareholders may remain a control person of the fund.</div>
<div>Shareholders may make inquiries by writing to iShares Trust,
c/o BlackRock Investments, LLC, 1 University Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</div>
<div>Absent an applicable exemption or other relief from the SEC or
its staff, beneficial owners of more than 5% of the shares of a fund may be subject to the reporting provisions of Section 13 of the 1934 Act and the SEC’s rules promulgated thereunder. In addition, absent an applicable exemption or other
relief from the SEC or its staff, officers and trustees of a fund and beneficial owners of 10% of the shares of a fund (“Insiders”) may be subject to the insider reporting, short-swing profit and short sale provisions of Section 16 of
the 1934 Act and the SEC’s rules promulgated thereunder. Beneficial owners and Insiders should</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>In accordance with the Trust's current Agreement and
Declaration of Trust (the “Declaration of Trust”), the Board may, without shareholder approval (unless such shareholder approval is required by the Declaration of Trust or applicable law, including the 1940 Act), authorize certain funds
to merge, reorganize, consolidate, sell all or substantially all of their assets, or take other similar actions with, to or into another fund.  The Trust or a fund may be terminated by a majority vote of the Board, subject to the affirmative
vote of a majority of the shareholders of the Trust or such fund entitled to vote on termination; however, in certain circumstances described in the Declaration of Trust, only a majority vote of the Board is required. Although the shares are not
automatically redeemable upon the occurrence of any specific event, the Declaration of Trust provides that the Board will have the unrestricted power to alter the number of shares in a Creation Unit. Therefore, in the event of a termination of the
Trust or a fund, the Board, in its sole discretion, could determine to permit the shares to be redeemable in aggregations smaller than Creation Units or to be individually redeemable. In such circumstance, the Trust or a fund may make redemptions
in-kind, for cash or for a combination of cash or securities. Further, in the event of a termination of the Trust or a fund, the Trust or a fund might elect to pay cash redemptions to all shareholders, with an in-kind election for shareholders
owning in excess of a certain stated minimum amount.</div> <div>DTC
as Securities Depository for Shares of the Funds. <font> Shares of each Fund are represented by securities registered in the name of DTC or its nominee and deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC.</font></div>
<div>DTC was created in 1973 to enable electronic movement of
securities between its participants (“DTC Participants”), and NSCC was established in 1976 to provide a single settlement system for securities clearing and to serve as central counterparty for securities trades among DTC Participants.
In 1999, DTC and NSCC were consolidated within The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”) and became wholly-owned subsidiaries of DTCC. The common stock of DTCC is owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and FINRA, through
subsidiaries, hold preferred shares in DTCC that provide them with the right to elect one member each to the DTCC board of directors. Access to the DTC system is available to entities, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies, that clear
through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”).</div>
<div>Beneficial ownership of shares is limited to DTC Participants,
Indirect Participants and persons holding interests through DTC Participants and Indirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in shares (owners of such beneficial interests are referred to herein as “Beneficial Owners”) is
shown on, and the transfer of ownership is effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on the records of DTC Participants (with respect to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners that are not DTC
Participants). Beneficial Owners will receive from or through the DTC Participant a written confirmation relating to their purchase of shares. The laws of some jurisdictions may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of
such securities in definitive form. Such laws may impair the ability of certain investors to acquire beneficial interests in shares of the Fund.</div>
<div>Conveyance of all notices, statements and other communications
to Beneficial Owners is effected as follows. Pursuant to the Depositary Agreement between the Trust and DTC, DTC is required to make available to the Trust upon request and for a fee to be charged to the Trust a listing of the shares of each Fund
held by each DTC Participant. The Trust shall inquire of each such DTC Participant as to the number of Beneficial Owners holding shares, directly or indirectly, through such DTC Participant. The Trust shall provide each such DTC Participant with
copies of such notice, statement or other communication, in such form, number and at such place as such DTC Participant may reasonably request, in order that such notice, statement or communication may be transmitted by such DTC Participant,
directly or indirectly, to such Beneficial Owners. In addition, the Trust shall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair and reasonable amount as reimbursement for the expenses attendant to such transmittal, all subject to applicable statutory and
regulatory requirements.</div> <div>Share distributions shall be
made to DTC or its nominee, Cede &amp; Co., as the registered holder of all shares of the Trust. DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any such distributions, shall credit immediately DTC Participants’ accounts with payments in amounts
proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in shares of each Fund as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. Payments by DTC Participants to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners of shares held through such DTC Participants
will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in a “street name,” and will be the responsibility of such DTC
Participants.</div> <div>The Trust has no responsibility or
liability for any aspect of the records relating to or notices to Beneficial Owners, or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in such shares, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any</div> </div>

<div>records relating to such beneficial ownership interests, or for any other
aspect of the relationship between DTC and the DTC Participants or the relationship between such DTC Participants and the Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners owning through such DTC Participants. DTC may decide to discontinue providing its
service with respect to shares of the Trust at any time by giving reasonable notice to the Trust and discharging its responsibilities with respect thereto under applicable law. Under such circumstances, the Trust shall take action to find a
replacement for DTC to perform its functions at a comparable cost.</div>
<div>Distribution of Shares.
<font> In connection with each Fund's launch, each Fund was seeded through the sale of one or more Creation Units by each Fund to one or more initial investors. Initial investors participating in the seeding may be
Authorized Participants, a lead market maker or other third party investor or an affiliate of each Fund or each Fund’s adviser. Each such initial investor may sell some or all of the shares underlying the Creation Unit(s) held by them pursuant
to the registration statement for each Fund (each, a “Selling Shareholder”), which shares have been registered to permit the resale from time to time after purchase. Each Fund will not receive any of the proceeds from the resale by the
Selling Shareholders of these shares.</font></div> <div>Selling
Shareholders may sell shares owned by them directly or through broker-dealers, in accordance with applicable law, on any national securities exchange on which the shares may be listed or quoted at the time of sale, through trading systems, in the
OTC market or in transactions other than on these exchanges or systems at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale, at varying prices determined at the time of sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales may be effected
through brokerage transactions, privately negotiated trades, block sales, entry into options or other derivatives transactions or through any other means authorized by applicable law. Selling Shareholders may redeem the shares held in Creation Unit
size by them through an Authorized Participant.</div> <div>Any
Selling Shareholder and any broker-dealer or agents participating in the distribution of shares may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the 1933 Act, in connection with such sales.</div>
<div>Any Selling Shareholder and any other person participating in
such distribution will be subject to applicable provisions of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.</div>
<div>Creation and Redemption of Creation Units</div>
<div>General.<font>  The Trust
issues and sells shares of each Fund only in Creation Units on a continuous basis through the Distributor or its agent, without a sales load, at a price based on each Fund's NAV next determined after receipt, on any Business Day (as defined
below), of an order received by the Distributor or its agent in proper form. On days when the applicable Listing Exchange or the bond markets close earlier than normal, a Fund may require orders to be placed earlier in the day. The following table
sets forth the number of shares of a Fund that constitute a Creation Unit for such Fund and the approximate value of such Creation Unit as of March 31, 2019:</font></div> <div>

reserves the right to increase or decrease the number of a Fund’s shares that constitute a Creation Unit. The Board reserves the right to declare a split or a consolidation in the number of shares outstanding of any Fund, and to make a
corresponding change in the number of shares constituting a Creation Unit, in the event that the per share price in the secondary market rises (or declines) to an amount that falls outside the range deemed desirable by the Board.</div>
<div>A “Business Day” with respect to each Fund is any
day on which the Listing Exchange on which the Fund is listed for trading is open for business. As of the date of this SAI, each Listing Exchange observes the following holidays, as observed: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents'
Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.</div>
<div>Fund Deposit.<font>  The
consideration for purchase of Creation Units of a Fund, generally consists of an in-kind deposit of a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) (Deposit Securities) and the Cash
Component computed as described below. Together, the Deposit Securities and the Cash Component constitute the “Fund Deposit,” which, when combined with a Fund’s portfolio securities, is designed to generate performance that has a
collective investment profile similar to that of the Underlying Index. The Fund Deposit represents the minimum initial and subsequent investment amount for a Creation Unit of any Fund.</font></div>
<div>The “Cash Component” is an amount equal to the
difference between the NAV of the shares (per Creation Unit) and the “Deposit Amount,” which is an amount equal to the market value of the Deposit Securities, and serves to compensate for any differences between the NAV per Creation Unit
and the Deposit Amount. Payment of any stamp duty or other similar fees and expenses payable upon transfer of beneficial ownership of the Deposit Securities are the sole responsibility of the Authorized Participant purchasing a Creation Unit.</div>
<div>The iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF and iShares MBS ETF
(the “Partial Cash Funds”) generally offer Creation Units partially for cash, but may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units solely for cash or solely in-kind. Please see the <font>Cash Purchase
Method</font> section below and the following discussion summarizing the Deposit Security method for further information on purchasing Creation Units of the Funds.</div>
<div>To facilitate efficient management of the Funds and to enable

<div>the securities held by such Fund. Consistent with the exemptive orders
granted to the Funds by the SEC, creation baskets will correspond generally to the price and yield performance of each Fund's Underlying Index.</div>
<div>BFA makes available through the NSCC on each Business Day
prior to the opening of business on the Listing Exchange, the list of names and the required number or par value of each Deposit Security and the amount of the Cash Component to be included in the current Fund Deposit (based on information as of the
end of the previous Business Day for each Fund). Such Fund Deposit is applicable, subject to any adjustments as described below, to purchases of Creation Units of shares of a given Fund until such time as the next-announced Fund Deposit is made
available.</div> <div>The identity and number or par value of the
Deposit Securities change pursuant to changes in the composition of a Fund's portfolio and as rebalancing adjustments and corporate action events are reflected from time to time by BFA with a view to the investment objective of the Fund. The
composition of the Deposit Securities may also change in response to adjustments to the weighting or composition of the component securities constituting the relevant Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Trust may require the substitution of an amount of cash (<font>i.e.</font>, a “cash in lieu” amount) to replace any Deposit Security of the Partial Cash Funds that is a TBA transaction or an interest in a mortgage pass-through security. The amount of cash contributed will
be equivalent to the price of the TBA transaction or mortgage pass-through security interest listed as a Deposit Security. A transaction fee may be charged on the cash amount contributed in lieu of the TBA transaction or mortgage pass-through
security.</div> <div>The Funds reserve the right to permit or
require the substitution of a “cash in lieu” amount to be added to the Cash Component to replace any Deposit Security that may not be available in sufficient quantity for delivery or that may not be eligible for transfer through DTC or
the clearing process (as discussed below) or that the Authorized Participant is not able to trade due to a trading restriction. The Funds also reserve the right to permit or require a “cash in lieu” amount in certain circumstances,
including circumstances in which the delivery of the Deposit Security by the Authorized Participant would be restricted under applicable securities or other local laws or in certain other situations.</div>
<div>Cash Purchase Method.
<font> Although the Trust does not generally permit partial or full cash purchases of Creation Units of its funds, when partial or full cash purchases of Creation Units are available or specified for a Fund (Creation
Units of the Partial Cash Funds are generally offered partially for cash), they will be effected in essentially the same manner as in-kind purchases thereof. In the case of a partial or full cash purchase, the Authorized Participant must pay the
cash equivalent of the Deposit Securities it would otherwise be required to provide through an in-kind purchase, plus the same Cash Component required to be paid by an in-kind purchaser.</font></div>
<div>Procedures for Creation of Creation Units.<font>  To be eligible to place orders with the Distributor and to create a Creation Unit of the Funds, an entity must be: (i) a “Participating Party,”</font><font> </font><font>i.e</font><font>., a broker-dealer or other participant in the clearing process through the Continuous Net Settlement System of the NSCC (the “Clearing Process”),
a clearing agency that is registered with the SEC, or (ii) a DTC Participant, and must have executed an agreement with the Distributor, with respect to creations and redemptions of Creation Units (“Authorized Participant Agreement”)
(discussed below). A Participating Party or DTC Participant who has executed an Authorized Participant Agreement is referred to as an “Authorized Participant.” All shares of the Funds, however created, will be entered on the records of
DTC in the name of Cede &amp; Co. for the account of a DTC Participant.</font></div>
<div>Role of the Authorized Participant.<font>  Creation Units may be purchased only by or through a DTC Participant that has entered into an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Distributor. Such Authorized Participant will agree, pursuant to the terms of
such Authorized Participant Agreement and on behalf of itself or any investor on whose behalf it will act, to certain conditions, including that such Authorized Participant will make available in advance of each purchase of shares an amount of cash
sufficient to pay the Cash Component, once the net asset value of a Creation Unit is next determined after receipt of the purchase order in proper form, together with the transaction fees described below. An Authorized Participant, acting on behalf
of an investor, may require the investor to enter into an agreement with such Authorized Participant with respect to certain matters, including payment of the Cash Component. Investors who are not Authorized Participants must make appropriate
arrangements with an Authorized Participant. Investors should be aware that their particular broker may not be a DTC Participant or may not have executed an Authorized Participant Agreement and that orders to purchase Creation Units may have to be
placed by the investor's broker through an Authorized Participant. As a result, purchase orders placed through an Authorized Participant may result in additional charges to such investor. The Trust does not expect to enter into an Authorized
Participant Agreement with more than a small number of DTC Participants. A list of current Authorized Participants may be obtained from the Distributor. The Distributor has adopted guidelines regarding Authorized Participants’</font></div>

<div>transactions in Creation Units that are made available to all Authorized
Participants. These guidelines set forth the processes and standards for Authorized Participants to transact with the Distributor and its agents in connection with creation and redemption transactions. In addition, the Distributor may be appointed
as the proxy of the Authorized Participant and may be granted a power of attorney under its Authorized Participant Agreement.</div>
<div>Placement of Creation Orders.<font>
 Fund Deposits must be delivered through the Federal Reserve System (for cash and U.S. government securities), through DTC (for corporate and municipal securities) or through a central depository account, such as with Euroclear or DTC,
maintained by State Street or a sub-custodian (a “Central Depository Account”). Any portion of a Fund Deposit that may not be delivered through the Fed or DTC must be delivered through a Central Depository Account. The Fund Deposit
transfers made through DTC must be ordered by the DTC Participant in a timely fashion so as to ensure the delivery of the requisite number of Deposit Securities through DTC to the account of the Funds generally before 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the
Settlement Date. Fund Deposit transfers made through the Fed must be deposited by the participant institution in a timely fashion so as to ensure the delivery of the requisite number or amount of Deposit Securities or cash through the Fed to the
account of the Fund generally before 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. Fund Deposit transfers made through a Central Depository Account must be completed pursuant to the requirements established by the custodian or sub-custodian for
such Central Depository Account generally before 2:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. The “Settlement Date” for all funds is generally the second business day after the Transmittal Date. All questions as to the number of
Deposit Securities to be delivered, and the validity, form and eligibility (including time of receipt) for the deposit of any tendered securities, will be determined by the Trust, whose determination shall be final and binding. The amount of cash
equal to the Cash Component must be transferred directly to State Street through the Federal Reserve Bank wire transfer system in a timely manner so as to be received by State Street generally before 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date.
If the Cash Component and the Deposit Securities are not received by 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date, the creation order may be canceled. Upon written notice to the Distributor, such canceled order may be resubmitted the following
Business Day using a Fund Deposit as newly constituted to reflect the then current NAV of the Funds. The delivery of Creation Units so created generally will occur no later than the second Business Day following the day on which the purchase order
is deemed received by the Distributor, provided that the relevant Fund Deposit has been received by the Funds prior to such time.</font></div>
<div>Purchase Orders.<font>   To
initiate an order for a Creation Unit, an Authorized Participant must submit to the Distributor or its agent an irrevocable order to purchase shares of a Fund, in proper form, generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day to
receive that day’s NAV. The Distributor or its agent will notify BFA and the custodian of such order. The custodian will then provide such information to any appropriate sub-custodian. Procedures and requirements governing the delivery of the
Fund Deposit are set forth in the procedures handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time to time. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements for a creation request to be made through an
Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current Authorized Participants upon request. Those placing orders to purchase Creation Units through an Authorized Participant should allow sufficient time to permit proper
submission of the purchase order to the Distributor or its agent by the Cutoff Time (as defined below) on such Business Day.</font></div>
<div>The Authorized Participant must also make available on or
before the contractual settlement date, by means satisfactory to the Funds, immediately available or same day funds estimated by the Funds to be sufficient to pay the Cash Component next determined after acceptance of the purchase order, together
with the applicable purchase transaction fees. Those placing orders should ascertain the applicable deadline for cash transfers by contacting the operations department of the broker or depositary institution effectuating the transfer of the Cash
Component. This deadline is likely to be significantly earlier than the Cutoff Time of the Funds. Investors should be aware that an Authorized Participant may require orders for purchases of shares placed with it to be in the particular form
required by the individual Authorized Participant.</div> <div>The
Authorized Participant is responsible for any and all expenses and costs incurred by a Fund, including any applicable cash amounts, in connection with any purchase order.</div>
<div>Timing of Submission of Purchase Orders.<font>  An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable order to purchase shares of a Fund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day in order to receive that day's NAV. Creation Orders must be
transmitted by an Authorized Participant in the form required by the Funds to the Distributor or its agent pursuant to procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Economic or market disruptions or changes, or telephone or other
communication failure, may impede the ability to reach the Distributor or its agent or an Authorized Participant. Each Fund's deadline specified above for the submission of purchase orders is referred to as that Fund's “Cutoff Time.”

<div>Distributor or its agent, in their discretion, may permit the submission of
such orders and requests by or through an Authorized Participant at any time (including on days on which the Listing Exchange is not open for business) via communication through the facilities of the Distributor's or its agent's proprietary website
maintained for this purpose. Purchase orders and redemption requests, if accepted by the Trust, will be processed based on the NAV next determined after such acceptance in accordance with a Fund's Cutoff Times as provided in the Authorized
Participant Agreement and disclosed in this SAI.</div>
<div>Acceptance of Orders for Creation Units.<font>   Subject to the conditions that (i) an irrevocable purchase order has been submitted by the Authorized Participant (either on its own or another investor's behalf) and (ii) arrangements satisfactory to the Funds
are in place for payment of the Cash Component and any other cash amounts which may be due, the Funds will accept the order, subject to each Fund's right (and the right of the Distributor and BFA) to reject any order until acceptance, as set forth
below.</font></div> <div>Once a Fund has accepted an order, upon
the next determination of the net asset value of the shares, the Fund will confirm the issuance of a Creation Unit, against receipt of payment, at such net asset value. The Distributor or its agent will then transmit a confirmation of acceptance to
the Authorized Participant that placed the order.</div> <div>Each
Fund reserves the absolute right to reject or revoke a creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor or its agent if (i) the order is not in proper form; (ii) the investor(s), upon obtaining the shares ordered, would own 80% or more of the
currently outstanding shares of the Fund; (iii) the Deposit Securities delivered do not conform to the identity and number of shares specified, as described above; (iv) acceptance of the Deposit Securities would have certain adverse tax consequences
to the Fund; (v) acceptance of the Fund Deposit would, in the opinion of counsel, be unlawful; (vi) acceptance of the Fund Deposit would, in the discretion of the Fund or BFA, have an adverse effect on the Fund or the rights of beneficial owners; or
(vii) circumstances outside the control of the Fund, the Distributor or its agent and BFA make it impracticable to process purchase orders. The Distributor or its agent shall notify a prospective purchaser of a Creation Unit and/or the Authorized
Participant acting on behalf of such purchaser of its rejection of such order. The Funds, State Street, the sub-custodian and the Distributor or its agent are under no duty, however, to give notification of any defects or irregularities in the
delivery of Fund Deposits nor shall any of them incur any liability for failure to give such notification.</div>
<div>Issuance of a Creation Unit.<font>
  Except as provided herein, a Creation Unit will not be issued until the transfer of good title to the applicable Fund of the Deposit Securities and the payment of the Cash Component have been completed. When the sub-custodian has confirmed to
the custodian that the securities included in the Fund Deposit (or the cash value thereof) have been delivered to the account of the relevant sub-custodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor or its agent and BFA shall be notified of such delivery
and the applicable Fund will issue and cause the delivery of the Creation Unit. Creation Units are generally issued on a “T+2 basis”
(</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, two Business Days after trade date). Each Fund reserves the right to settle Creation Unit transactions on a basis other than T+2, including a
shorter settlement period, if necessary or appropriate under the circumstances and compliant with applicable law.</font></div>
<div>To the extent contemplated by an Authorized Participant
Agreement with the Distributor, each Fund will issue Creation Units to such Authorized Participant, notwithstanding the fact that the corresponding Fund Deposits have not been received in part or in whole, in reliance on the undertaking of the
Authorized Participant to deliver the missing Deposit Securities as soon as possible, which undertaking shall be secured by such Authorized Participant's delivery and maintenance of collateral having a value at least equal to 105% and up to 122%,
which percentage BFA may change at any time, in its sole discretion, of the value of the missing Deposit Securities in accordance with the Funds' then-effective procedures. The Trust may use such cash deposit at any time to buy Deposit Securities
for the Funds. The only collateral that is acceptable to the Funds is cash in U.S. dollars. Such cash collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the contractual settlement date. The cash collateral
posted by the Authorized Participant may be invested at the risk of the Authorized Participant, and income, if any, on invested cash collateral will be paid to that Authorized Participant. Information concerning the Funds' current procedures for
collateralization of missing Deposit Securities is available from the Distributor or its agent. The Authorized Participant Agreement will permit the Funds to buy the missing Deposit Securities at any time and will subject the Authorized Participant
to liability for any shortfall between the cost to the Funds of purchasing such securities and the cash collateral including, without limitation, liability for related brokerage, borrowings and other charges.</div>
<div>In certain cases, Authorized Participants may create and
redeem Creation Units on the same trade date and in these instances, the Funds reserve the right to settle these transactions on a net basis or require a representation from the Authorized Participants that the creation and redemption transactions
are for separate beneficial owners. All questions as to</div> </div> <div type="Block">

Participant on the day such Authorized Participant creates a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number of Creation Units purchased by the Authorized Participant on the applicable Business Day. If a purchase consists solely or partially

from such transaction (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Authorized Participants will also bear the costs of transferring the Deposit Securities to the Funds. Certain fees/costs associated with

<div>Redemption of Creation Units.
<font> Shares of a Fund may be redeemed by Authorized Participants only in Creation Units at their NAV next determined after receipt of a redemption request in proper form by the Distributor or its agent and only on
a Business Day. The Funds will not redeem shares in amounts less than Creation Units. There can be no assurance, however, that there will be sufficient liquidity in the secondary market at any time to permit assembly of a Creation Unit. Investors
should expect to incur brokerage and other costs in connection with assembling a sufficient number of shares to constitute a Creation Unit that could be redeemed by an Authorized Participant. Beneficial owners also may sell shares in the
secondary market.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>The Partial Cash Funds generally redeem Creation Units
partially for cash. However, the Funds reserve the right to distribute securities and other portfolio instruments in-kind as payment for Creation Units being redeemed. Please see the <font>Cash Redemption Method</font>
section below and the following discussion summarizing the in-kind method for further information on redeeming Creation Units of the Funds.</div>
<div>With respect to each Fund, BFA makes available through the
NSCC, prior to the opening of business on the Listing Exchange on each Business Day, the designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) that will be applicable (subject to
possible amendment or correction) to redemption requests received in proper form (as defined below) on that day (“Fund Securities”), and an amount of cash (the “Cash Amount,” as described below). Such Fund Securities and the
corresponding Cash Amount (each subject to possible amendment or correction) are applicable, in order to effect redemptions of Creation Units of a Fund until such time as the next announced composition of the Fund Securities and Cash Amount is made
available. Fund Securities received on redemption may not be identical to Deposit Securities that are applicable to creations of Creation Units. Procedures and requirements governing redemption transactions are set forth in the handbook for
Authorized Participants and may change from time to time.</div>
<div>Unless cash redemptions are available or specified for a Fund,
the redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit generally consist of Fund Securities, plus the Cash Amount, which is an amount equal to the difference between the net asset value of the shares being redeemed, as next determined after the receipt of a
redemption request in proper form, and the value of Fund Securities, less a redemption transaction fee (as described below).</div>
<div>The Trust may, in its sole discretion, substitute a
“cash in lieu” amount to replace any Fund Security. The Trust also reserves the right to permit or require a “cash in lieu” amount in certain circumstances, including circumstances in which: (i) the delivery of a Fund
Security to the Authorized Participant would be restricted under applicable securities or other local laws; or (ii) the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in the disposition of the Fund Security by the Authorized
Participant due to restrictions under applicable securities or other local laws, or in certain other situations. The amount of cash paid out in such cases will be equivalent to the value of the substituted security listed as a Fund Security.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trust may, in its sole discretion, substitute a “cash in lieu” amount to replace any Fund Security of the Partial Cash Funds that is a TBA transaction or mortgage pass-through security. In such cases, a
transaction fee may be charged on the cash amount paid in lieu of the TBA transaction or mortgage pass through security. In the event that the Fund Securities have a value greater than the NAV of the shares, a compensating cash payment equal to the
difference is required to be made by or through an Authorized Participant by the redeeming shareholder. Each Fund generally redeems Creation Units for Fund Securities (except for the Partial Cash Funds, which generally redeem Creation Units
partially for cash), but each Fund reserves the right to utilize a cash option for redemption of Creation Units. Each Fund may, in its sole discretion, provide such redeeming Authorized Participant a portfolio of securities that differs from the
exact composition of the Fund Securities, but does not differ in NAV.</div>
<div>Cash Redemption Method.<font>  
Although the Trust does not generally permit full cash redemptions of Creation Units of its funds, when partial or full cash redemptions of Creation Units are available or specified
(</font><font>e.g.,</font><font> Creation Units of the Partial Cash Funds are generally redeemed partially for cash), they will be effected in essentially the same manner as
in-kind redemptions thereof. In the case of partial or full cash redemption, the Authorized Participant receives the cash equivalent of the Fund Securities and other instruments it would otherwise receive through an in-kind redemption, plus the same
Cash Amount to be paid to an in-kind redeemer.</font></div>
<div>Costs Associated with Redemption Transactions. <font> A standard redemption transaction fee is imposed to offset transfer and other transaction costs that may be incurred by the relevant Fund. The standard redemption transaction fee is charged to the Authorized
Participant on the day such Authorized Participant redeems a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number of Creation Units redeemed by an Authorized Participant on the applicable Business Day. If a redemption consists solely or partially
of cash, the Authorized Participant may also be required to cover (up to the maximum amount shown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, price movement and other costs and expenses related to the execution of trades resulting
from such transaction (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Authorized Participants will also bear the costs of transferring the Fund Securities from a Fund to their account on their order.
Certain fees/costs associated with redemption transactions may be waived in certain circumstances. Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to dispose of Fund shares may be charged a fee for such
services.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Placement of Redemption
Orders.<font>  Redemption requests for Creation Units of the Funds must be submitted to the Distributor or its agent by or through an Authorized Participant. An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable
request to redeem shares of a Fund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day in order to receive that day's NAV. On days when the Listing Exchange closes earlier than normal, a Fund may require orders to redeem Creation Units to
be placed earlier that day. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements for a redemption request to be made through an Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current
Authorized Participants upon request.</font></div> <div>The
Authorized Participant must transmit the request for redemption in the form required by the Funds to the Distributor or its agent in accordance with procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Investors should be aware that their
particular broker may not have executed an Authorized Participant Agreement and that, therefore, requests to redeem Creation Units may have to be placed by the investor's broker through an Authorized Participant who has executed an Authorized
Participant Agreement. At any time, only a limited number of broker-dealers will have an Authorized Participant Agreement in effect. Investors making a redemption request should be aware that such request must be in the form specified by such
Authorized Participant. Investors making a request to redeem Creation Units should allow sufficient time to permit proper submission of the request by an Authorized Participant and transfer of the shares to the Funds' transfer agent; such investors
should allow for the additional time that may be required to effect redemptions through their banks, brokers or other financial intermediaries if such intermediaries are not Authorized Participants.</div>
<div>A redemption request is considered to be in “proper
form” if: (i) an Authorized Participant has transferred or caused to be transferred to the Funds' transfer agent the Creation Unit redeemed through the book-entry system of DTC so as to be</div> </div>

<div>effective by the Listing Exchange closing time on any Business Day on which
the redemption request is submitted; (ii) a request in form satisfactory to the applicable Fund is received by the Distributor or its agent from the Authorized Participant on behalf of itself or another redeeming investor within the time periods
specified above; and (iii) all other procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement are properly followed.</div>
<div>Upon receiving a redemption request, the Distributor or its
agent shall notify the applicable Fund and the Fund's transfer agent of such redemption request. The tender of an investor's shares for redemption and the distribution of the securities and/or cash included in the redemption payment made in respect
of Creation Units redeemed will be made through DTC and the relevant Authorized Participant to the Beneficial Owner thereof as recorded on the book-entry system of DTC or the DTC Participant through which such investor holds, as the case may be, or
by such other means specified by the Authorized Participant submitting the redemption request.</div>
<div>A redeeming Authorized Participant, whether on its own account
or acting on behalf of a Beneficial Owner, must maintain appropriate security arrangements with a qualified broker-dealer, bank or other custody providers in each jurisdiction in which any of the portfolio securities are customarily traded, to which
account such portfolio securities will be delivered.</div>
<div>Deliveries of redemption proceeds by each Fund are generally
made within two Business Days (<font>i.e.</font>, “T+2”). Each Fund reserves the right to settle redemption transactions on a basis other than T+2 but by T+7, if necessary or appropriate under the circumstances
and compliant with applicable law. Delayed settlement may occur due to a number of different reasons, including, without limitation, settlement cycles for the underlying securities, unscheduled market closings, an effort to link distribution to
dividend record dates and ex-dates and newly announced holidays. For example, the redemption settlement process may be extended beyond T+2 because of the occurrence of a holiday in a non-U.S. market or in the U.S. bond market that is not a holiday
observed in the U.S. equity market.</div> <div>To the extent
contemplated by an Authorized Participant's agreement with the Distributor or its agent, in the event an Authorized Participant has submitted a redemption request in proper form but is unable to transfer all or part of the Creation Unit to be
redeemed to a Fund, at or prior to 10:00 a.m., Eastern time on the Listing Exchange business day after the date of submission of such redemption request, the Distributor or its agent will accept the redemption request in reliance on the undertaking
by the Authorized Participant to deliver the missing shares as soon as possible. Such undertaking shall be secured by the Authorized Participant's delivery and maintenance of collateral consisting of cash, in U.S. dollars in immediately available
funds, having a value at least equal to 105% and up to 122%, which percentage BFA may change at any time, in its sole discretion, of the value of the missing shares. Such cash collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by each
Fund or its custodian on the day after the date of submission of such redemption request and shall be held by State Street and marked-to-market daily. The fees of State Street and any sub-custodians in respect of the delivery, maintenance and
redelivery of the cash collateral shall be payable by the Authorized Participant. The cash collateral posted by the Authorized Participant may be invested at the risk of the Authorized Participant, and income, if any, on invested cash collateral
will be paid to that Authorized Participant. The Authorized Participant Agreement permits the Funds to acquire shares of the Funds at any time and subjects the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the aggregate of the cost
to the Funds of purchasing such shares, plus the value of the Cash Amount, and the value of the cash collateral together with liability for related brokerage and other charges.</div>
<div>Because the portfolio securities of a Fund may trade on
exchange(s) on days that the Listing Exchange is closed or are otherwise not Business Days for such Fund, shareholders may not be able to redeem their shares of such Fund, or purchase or sell shares of such Fund on the Listing Exchange on days when
the NAV of such a Fund could be significantly affected by events in the relevant non-U.S. markets.</div>
<div>The right of redemption may be suspended or the date of
payment postponed with respect to any Fund: (i) for any period during which the Listing Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday closings); (ii) for any period during which trading on the Listing Exchange is suspended or
restricted; (iii) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which disposal of the shares of the Fund's portfolio securities or determination of its net asset value is not reasonably practicable; or (iv) in such other
circumstance as is permitted by the SEC.</div> <div>Taxation on
Creations and Redemptions of Creation Units.<font>   An Authorized Participant generally will recognize either gain or loss upon the exchange of Deposit Securities for Creation Units. This gain or loss is calculated
by taking the market value of the Creation Units purchased over the Authorized Participant’s aggregate basis in the Deposit Securities exchanged therefor. However, the IRS may apply the wash sales rules to determine that any loss realized upon
the exchange of Deposit Securities for Creation Units is not currently deductible. Authorized Participants should consult their own tax advisors.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Current U.S. federal income tax laws dictate that capital gain
or loss realized from the redemption of Creation Units will generally create long-term capital gain or loss if the Authorized Participant holds the Creation Units for more than one year, or short-term capital gain or loss if the Creation Units were

<div>Taxes</div>
<div>The following is a summary of certain material U.S. federal
income tax considerations regarding the purchase, ownership and disposition of shares of a Fund. This summary does not address all of the potential U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be applicable to a Fund or to all categories of
investors, some of which may be subject to special tax rules. Current and prospective shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the specific federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences of investing in a Fund.
The summary is based on the laws and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof in effect on the date of this SAI, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.</div>
<div>Tax reform legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act makes significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax rules for individuals and corporations, generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.
Most of the changes applicable to individuals are temporary and, without further legislation, will not apply after 2025. The application of certain provisions of the Tax Act is uncertain, and the changes in the act may have indirect effects on a
Fund, its investments and its shareholders that cannot be predicted. In addition, legislative, regulatory or administrative changes could be enacted or promulgated at any time, either prospectively or with retroactive effect. Prospective investors
should consult their tax advisors regarding the implications of the Tax Act on their investment in a Fund.</div>
<div>Regulated Investment Company Qualifications. <font> Each Fund intends to continue to qualify for and to elect treatment as a separate RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify for treatment as a RIC, each Fund must annually distribute at least
90% of its investment company taxable income (which includes dividends, interest and net short-term capital gains) and meet several other requirements. Among such other requirements are the following: (i) at least 90% of each Fund’s annual
gross income must be derived from dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities or non-U.S. currencies, other income (including, but not limited to, gains from
options, futures or forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies, and net income derived from interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, partnerships that are traded on an established securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than a partnership that derives at least 90% of
its income from interest, dividends, capital gains and other traditionally permitted RIC income); and (ii) at the close of each quarter of each Fund’s taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the market value of each Fund’s total assets must be
represented by cash and cash items, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs and other securities, with such other securities limited for purposes of this calculation in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater than 5% of the
value of the Fund’s assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (b) not more than 25% of the value of the Fund’s total assets may be invested in the securities of any one issuer, of two or
more issuers of which 20% or more of the voting stock is held by the Fund and that are engaged in the same or similar trades or businesses or related trades or businesses (other than the securities of other RICs) or the securities of one or more
qualified publicly-traded partnerships.</font></div> <div>A Fund
may be able to cure a failure to derive at least 90% of its income from the sources specified above or a failure to diversify its holdings in the manner described above by paying a tax and/or by disposing of certain assets. If, in any taxable year,
a Fund fails one of these tests and does not timely cure the failure, that Fund will be taxed in the same manner as an ordinary corporation and distributions to its shareholders will not be deductible by that Fund in computing its taxable
income.</div> <div>Although in general the passive loss rules of
the Internal Revenue Code do not apply to RICs, such rules do apply to a RIC with respect to items attributable to an interest in a qualified publicly-traded partnership. A Fund’s investments in partnerships, including in qualified
publicly-traded partnerships, may result in the Fund being subject to state, local, or non-U.S. income, franchise or withholding tax liabilities.</div>
<div>Taxation of RICs. <font> As a
RIC, a Fund will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of its taxable investment income and capital gains that it distributes to its shareholders, provided that it satisfies a minimum distribution requirement. To satisfy the
minimum distribution requirement, a Fund must distribute to its shareholders at least the sum of (i) 90% of its</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>“investment company taxable income” (<font>i.e.</font>, income other than its net realized long-term capital gain over its net realized short-term capital loss), plus or minus certain adjustments, and (ii) 90% of its net tax-exempt income for the taxable year. A
Fund will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates on any taxable income or gains that it does not distribute to its shareholders. If a Fund fails to qualify for any taxable year as a RIC or fails to meet the distribution requirement, all
of its taxable income will be subject to tax at regular corporate income tax rates without any deduction for distributions to shareholders, and such distributions generally will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends to the extent of the
Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits. In such event, distributions to individuals should be eligible to be treated as qualified dividend income and distributions to corporate shareholders generally should be eligible for the
dividends-received deduction. Although each Fund intends to distribute substantially all of its net investment income and its capital gains for each taxable year, each Fund will be subject to U.S. federal income taxation to the extent any such
income or gains are not distributed. Moreover, if a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC in any year, it must pay out its earnings and profits accumulated in that year in order to qualify again as a RIC. If a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC for a period
greater than two taxable years, the Fund may be required to recognize any net built-in gains with respect to certain of its assets (<font>i.e.</font>, the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over
aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if the Fund had been liquidated) if it qualifies as a RIC in a subsequent year.</div>
<div>Net Capital Loss Carryforwards. <font> Net capital loss carryforwards may be applied against any net realized capital gains in each succeeding year, until they have been reduced to zero.</font></div>
<div>In the event that a Fund were to experience an ownership
change as defined under the Internal Revenue Code, the loss carryforwards and other favorable tax attributes of a Fund, if any, may be subject to limitation.</div>
<div>The following Funds had tax basis net capital loss
carryforwards as set forth in the table below as of February 28, 2019, the tax year-end for the Funds listed:</div> <div>

98.2% of its capital gain net income for the 12 months ended October 31 of such year. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by a Fund that is subject to corporate income tax will be considered to have
been distributed by year-end. In addition, the minimum amounts that must be distributed in any year to avoid the excise tax will be increased or decreased to reflect any underdistribution or overdistribution, as the case may be, from the previous
year. Each Fund intends to declare and distribute dividends and distributions in the amounts and at the times necessary to avoid the application of this 4% excise tax.</font></div>
<div>Taxation of U.S. Shareholders.
<font> Dividends and other distributions by a Fund are generally treated under the Internal Revenue Code as received by the shareholders at the time the dividend or distribution is made. However, any dividend or
capital gain distribution declared by a Fund in October, November or December of any calendar year and payable to shareholders of record on a specified date in such a month shall be deemed to have been received by each shareholder on December 31 of
such calendar year and to have been paid by the Fund not later than such December 31, provided such dividend is actually paid by the Fund during January of the following calendar year.</font></div>
<div>Each Fund intends to distribute annually to its shareholders
substantially all of its net tax-exempt income, investment company taxable income and any net realized long-term capital gains in excess of net realized short-term capital losses (including any capital loss carryovers). However, if a Fund retains
for investment an amount equal to all or a portion of its net long-term capital gains in excess of its net short-term capital losses (including any capital loss carryovers), it will be subject to a corporate tax (at a flat rate of 21%) on the amount
retained. In that event, the Fund will report such retained amounts as undistributed capital gains in a notice to its shareholders who (a) will be required to include in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as long-term capital gains, their
proportionate shares of the undistributed amount, (b) will be entitled to credit their proportionate shares of the tax paid by the Fund on the undistributed amount against their U.S. federal income tax liabilities, if any, and to claim refunds to
the extent their credits exceed their liabilities, if any, and (c) will be entitled to increase their tax basis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in their shares by an amount equal to the excess of the amount in clause (a) over the amount in
clause (b). Organizations or persons not subject to U.S. federal income tax on such capital gains will be entitled to a refund of their <font>pro rata</font> share of such taxes paid by the Fund upon filing appropriate
returns or claims for refund with the IRS.</div> <div>Distributions
of net realized long-term capital gains, if any, that a Fund reports as capital gain dividends are taxable as long-term capital gains, whether paid in cash or in shares and regardless of how long a shareholder has held shares of the Fund. All other
dividends of a Fund (including dividends from short-term capital gains) from its current and accumulated earnings and profits (“regular dividends”) are generally subject to tax as ordinary income. Long-term capital gains are eligible for
taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts.</div>
<div>If an individual receives a regular dividend qualifying for
the long-term capital gain rates and such dividend constitutes an “extraordinary dividend,” and the individual subsequently recognizes a loss on the sale or exchange of stock in respect of which the extraordinary dividend was paid, then
the loss will be long-term capital loss to the extent of such extraordinary dividend. An “extraordinary dividend” on common stock for this purpose is generally a dividend (i) in an amount greater than or equal to 10% of the
taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates within an 85-day period, or (ii) in an amount greater than 20% of the taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share of stock,
aggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates within a 365-day period.</div>
<div>Distributions in excess of a Fund’s current and
accumulated earnings and profits will, as to each shareholder, be treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of a shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund, and as a capital gain thereafter (if the shareholder holds shares of the
Fund as capital assets). Distributions in excess of a Fund’s minimum distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute</div> </div>

<div>nontaxable returns of capital. The Fund's capital loss carryovers, if any,
carried from taxable years beginning before 2011 do not reduce current earnings and profits, even if such carryforwards offset current year realized gains. Shareholders receiving dividends or distributions in the form of additional shares should be
treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as receiving a distribution in an amount equal to the amount of money that the shareholders receiving cash dividends or distributions will receive and should have a cost basis in the shares received equal
to such amount. No deduction would be allowed to an investor for interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry shares of the Fund to the extent the interest deduction would relate to exempt-interest dividends received.</div>
<div>A 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on
net investment income, including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, and net gain from investments, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing jointly), and of estates and trusts.</div>
<div>Investors considering buying shares just prior to a dividend
or capital gain distribution should be aware that, although the price of shares purchased at that time may reflect the amount of the forthcoming distribution, such dividend or distribution may nevertheless be taxable to them. If a Fund is the holder
of record of any security on the record date for any dividends payable with respect to such security, such dividends will be included in the Fund’s gross income not as of the date received but as of the later of (i) the date such security
became ex-dividend with respect to such dividends (<font>i.e</font>., the date on which a buyer of the security would not be entitled to receive the declared, but unpaid, dividends); or (ii) the date the Fund acquired such
security. Accordingly, in order to satisfy its income distribution requirements, a Fund may be required to pay dividends based on anticipated earnings, and shareholders may receive dividends in an earlier year than would otherwise be the case.</div>
<div>In certain situations, a Fund may, for a taxable year, defer
all or a portion of its net capital loss (or if there is no net capital loss, then any net long-term or short-term capital loss) realized after October and its late-year ordinary loss (defined as the sum of the excess of post-October foreign
currency and passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) losses over post-October foreign currency and PFIC gains, plus the excess of post-December ordinary losses over post-December ordinary income) until the next taxable year in
computing its investment company taxable income and net capital gain, which will defer the recognition of such realized losses. Such deferrals and other rules regarding gains and losses realized after October (or December) may affect the tax
character of shareholder distributions.</div> <div>Sales of Shares.<font>  Upon the sale or exchange of shares of a Fund, a shareholder will realize a taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and the shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund. A
redemption of shares by a Fund will be treated as a sale for this purpose. Such gain or loss will be treated as capital gain or loss if the shares are capital assets in the shareholder’s hands and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the
shares are held for more than one year and short-term capital gain or loss if the shares are held for one year or less. Any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed to the extent the shares disposed of are replaced, including
replacement through the reinvesting of dividends or capital gains distributions, or by an option, or contract to acquire substantially identical shares, within a 61-day period beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after the disposition of the
shares. In such a case, the basis of the shares acquired will be increased to reflect the disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a shareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by the shareholder for six months or less will be treated for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any distributions or deemed distributions of long-term capital gains received by the shareholder with respect to such share. The Medicare contribution tax described above will apply to
the sale of Fund shares.</font></div> <div>If a shareholder incurs
a sales charge in acquiring shares of a Fund, disposes of those shares within 90 days and then, on or before January 31 of the following calendar year, acquires shares in a mutual fund for which the otherwise applicable sales charge is reduced by
reason of a reinvestment right (<font>e.g.</font>, an exchange privilege), the original sales charge will not be taken into account in computing gain/loss on the original shares to the extent the subsequent sales charge is
reduced. Instead, the disregarded portion of the original sales charge will be added to the tax basis of the newly acquired shares. Furthermore, the same rule also applies to a disposition of the newly acquired shares made within 90 days of the
second acquisition. This provision prevents a shareholder from immediately deducting the sales charge by shifting his or her investment within a family of mutual funds.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Backup Withholding. <font> In
certain cases, a Fund will be required to withhold at a 24% rate and remit to the U.S. Treasury such amounts withheld from any distributions paid to a shareholder who: (i) has failed to provide a correct taxpayer identification number; (ii) is
subject to backup withholding by the IRS; (iii) has failed to certify to a Fund that such shareholder is not subject to backup withholding; or (iv) has not certified that such shareholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien). Backup
withholding is not an additional tax and any amount withheld may be credited against a shareholder's U.S. federal income tax liability.</font></div>
<div>Sections 351 and 362.
<font> The Trust, on behalf of each Fund, has the right to reject an order for a purchase of shares of the Fund if the purchaser (or group of purchasers) would, upon obtaining the shares so ordered, own 80% or more
of the outstanding shares of a given Fund and if, pursuant to Sections 351 and 362 of the Internal Revenue Code, that Fund would have a basis in the securities different from the market value of such securities on the date of deposit. If a
Fund’s basis in such securities on the date of deposit was less than market value on such date, the Fund, upon disposition of the securities, would recognize more taxable gain or less taxable loss than if its basis in the securities had been
equal to market value. It is not anticipated that the Trust will exercise the right of rejection except in a case where the Trust determines that accepting the order could result in material adverse tax consequences to a Fund or its shareholders.
The Trust also has the right to require information necessary to determine beneficial share ownership for purposes of the 80% determination.</font></div>
<div>Tax-Exempt Interest Income.<font>
 Dividends paid by the Municipal Bond Funds that are properly reported as exempt-interest dividends will not be subject to regular federal income tax. Each Municipal Bond Fund intends to invest its assets in a manner such that dividend
distributions to its shareholders will generally be exempt from U.S. federal income taxation. Dividends paid by the Fund will be exempt from federal income tax (though not necessarily exempt from state and local taxation) to the extent of the
Fund’s tax-exempt interest income as long as 50% or more of the value of the Fund’s assets at the end of each quarter is invested in state, municipal and other bonds that are excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and
as long as the Fund properly reports such dividends as exempt-interest dividends.</font></div>
<div>So long as, at the close of each quarter of the taxable year
of the California Fund, at least 50% of the value of the California Fund’s total assets consists of obligations of the U.S. and of the State of California and its political subdivisions, the interest on which is exempt from California personal
income tax and California corporate income tax (“CA-exempt Obligations”), exempt-interest dividends (i) paid by the California Fund in an amount not exceeding the interest received on such CA-exempt Obligations during the California
Fund’s taxable year, and (ii) reported by the California Fund as exempt-interest dividends (in a written notice mailed to the California Fund’s shareholders) will be treated as an item of interest excludable from income for California
personal income tax purposes and corporate income tax purposes. Exempt-interest dividends paid to a corporate shareholder subject to California corporate franchise tax, however, will be taxable as ordinary income for purposes of such tax.
Distributions derived from interest on tax-exempt obligations issued by governmental authorities in states other than California or on other obligations or investments the interest on which is not exempt from California personal income tax or
corporate income tax, and distributions to shareholders derived from short-term or long-term capital gains, will be taxed as ordinary income for California personal and corporate income tax purposes and California corporate franchise tax purposes.
Interest on indebtedness incurred or continued by a shareholder of the California Fund to purchase or carry shares of the California Fund generally will not be deductible for California personal or corporate income tax purposes. It should be noted
that California law deviates from the provisions of Subchapter M of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code, relating to regulated investment companies in certain potentially material respects.</div>
<div>The foregoing is a general, abbreviated summary of certain of
the provisions of California law presently in effect that govern the taxation of the shareholders of the California Fund. These provisions are subject to change by legislative or administrative action, and any such change may be retroactive.
Shareholders are advised to consult with their own tax advisors for more detailed information concerning California tax matters.</div>
<div>Individual shareholders of the iShares New York Muni Bond ETF
will not be required to include in their gross income for New York State and City purposes any portion of distributions received from the Fund that are directly attributable to (i) interest earned on tax-exempt obligations issued by New York State
or any political subdivision thereof (including New York City) or (ii) interest earned on obligations of U.S. possessions or territories that is exempt from state taxation pursuant to federal law, provided that the Fund qualifies as a RIC and
satisfies the requirement that at least 50% of its assets at the close of each quarter of its taxable year constitute such obligations. Distributions from the Fund that are attributable to sources other than those described in the preceding sentence

<div><br/> Shareholders of the iShares New York Muni Bond ETF that
are subject to New York State corporation franchise tax or New York City general corporation tax will be required to include exempt-interest dividends paid by the Fund in their “entire net income” for purposes of such taxes and will be
required to include their shares of the Fund in their investment capital for purposes of such taxes. If a shareholder is subject to unincorporated business taxation by New York City, income and gains distributed by the Fund will be subject to such
taxation except to the extent such distributions are directly attributable to interest earned on tax-exempt obligations issued by New York State or any political subdivision thereof (including New York City). However, shareholders of the Fund will
not be subject to the unincorporated business tax imposed by New York City solely by reason of their ownership of shares in the Fund. Shares of the iShares New York Muni Bond ETF will not be subject to property taxes imposed by New York State or
City.</div> <div>Interest on indebtedness incurred by shareholders
to purchase or carry shares of New York Municipal Income generally will not be deductible for New York State personal income tax purposes.</div>
<div>Interest income on the Fund that is distributed to its
shareholders will generally not be taxable to the Fund for purposes of New York State corporation franchise tax or New York City general corporation tax.</div>
<div>The foregoing is a general, abbreviated summary of certain of
the provisions of the tax laws of New York State and City presently in effect as they directly govern the taxation of shareholders of the Fund. These provisions are subject to change by legislative or administrative action, and any such change may
be retroactive with respect to New York Municipal Income transactions. Shareholders are advised to consult with their own tax advisers for more detailed information concerning New York State and City matters.</div>
<div>Taxation of Certain Derivatives.<font>  A Fund’s transactions in zero coupon securities, non-U.S. currencies, forward contracts, options and futures contracts (including options and futures contracts on non-U.S. currencies), to the extent
permitted, will be subject to special provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (including provisions relating to “hedging transactions” and “straddles”) that, among other consequences, may affect the character of gains and
losses realized by the Fund (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, may affect whether gains or losses are ordinary or capital), accelerate recognition of income to the Fund and
defer Fund losses. These rules could therefore affect the character, amount and timing of distributions to shareholders. These provisions also (a) will require the Fund to mark-to-market certain types of the positions in its portfolio (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, treat them as if they were closed out at the end of each year) and (b) may cause the Fund to recognize income without receiving cash with which to pay
dividends or make distributions in amounts necessary to satisfy the distribution requirements for avoiding income and excise taxes. Each Fund will monitor its transactions, will make the appropriate tax elections and will make the appropriate
entries in its books and records when it acquires any zero coupon security, non-U.S. currency, forward contract, option, futures contract or hedged investment in order to mitigate the effect of these rules and prevent disqualification of the Fund as
a RIC. </font></div> <div>A Fund’s investments in so-called
“section 1256 contracts,” such as regulated futures contracts, most non-U.S. currency forward contracts traded in the interbank market and options on most security indexes, are subject to special tax rules. All section 1256 contracts
held by the Fund at the end of its taxable year are required to be marked to their market value, and any unrealized gain or loss on those positions will be included in the Fund’s income as if each position had been sold for its fair market
value at the end of the taxable year. The resulting gain or loss will be combined with any gain or loss realized by the Fund from positions in section 1256 contracts closed during the taxable year. Provided such positions were held as capital assets
and were not part of a “hedging transaction” nor part of a “straddle,” 60% of the resulting net gain or loss will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss, and 40% of such net gain or loss will be treated as short-term
capital gain or loss, regardless of the period of time the positions were actually held by the Fund.</div>
<div>As a result of entering into swap contracts, a Fund may make
or receive periodic net payments. A Fund may also make or receive a payment when a swap is terminated prior to maturity through an assignment of the swap or other closing transaction. Periodic net payments will generally constitute ordinary income
or deductions, while termination of a swap will generally result in capital gain or loss (which will be a long-term capital gain or loss if the Fund has been a party to the swap for more than one year). The cost of any payments made by the Fund on a
swap transaction will be netted <font>pro rata</font> against both tax exempt and taxable gross income. With respect to certain types of swaps, a Fund may be required to currently recognize income or loss with respect to
future payments on such swaps or may elect under certain circumstances to mark such swaps to market annually for tax purposes as ordinary income or loss. Periodic net payments that would otherwise constitute ordinary deductions but are allocable
under the Internal Revenue Code to exempt-interest dividends will not be allowed as deductions but instead will reduce net tax-exempt income.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Market Discount. <font> Any
market discount recognized on a bond is taxable as ordinary income. A market discount bond is a bond acquired in the secondary market at a price below redemption value or adjusted issue price if issued with original issue discount
(“OID”). To the extent a Fund does not include the market discount in income as it accrues, gain on the Fund’s disposition of such an obligation will be treated as ordinary income rather than capital gain to the extent of the
accrued market discount.</font></div> <div>Non-U.S. Investments.<font>  Income (including, in some cases, capital gains) received by certain of the Funds from investments in non-U.S. securities may be subject to withholding and other taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax
conventions between certain countries and the U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes in some cases. If more than 50% of a Fund’s total assets at the close of its taxable year consists of securities of non-U.S. corporations, the Fund may elect
for U.S. income tax purposes to treat non-U.S. income taxes paid by it as paid by its shareholders. A Fund may qualify for and make this election in some, but not necessarily all, of its taxable years. If a Fund were to make an election,
shareholders of the Fund would be required to take into account an amount equal to their pro rata portions of such non-U.S. taxes in computing their taxable income and then treat an amount equal to those non-U.S. taxes as a U.S. federal income tax
deduction or as a foreign tax credit against their U.S. federal income taxes. Shortly after any year for which it makes such an election, a Fund will report to its shareholders the amount per share of such non-U.S. income tax that must be included
in each shareholder’s gross income and the amount which will be available for the deduction or credit. No deduction for non-U.S. taxes may be claimed by a shareholder who does not itemize deductions. Certain limitations will be imposed on the
extent to which the credit (but not the deduction) for non-U.S. taxes may be claimed.</font></div>
<div>Under Section 988 of the Internal Revenue Code, gains or
losses attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the time a Fund accrues income or receivables or expenses or other liabilities denominated in a non-U.S. currency and the time a Fund actually collects such income or pays such
liabilities are generally treated as ordinary income or ordinary loss. In general, gains (and losses) realized on debt instruments will be treated as Section 988 gain (or loss) to the extent attributable to changes in exchange rates between the U.S.
dollar and the currencies in which the instruments are denominated. Similarly, gain or losses on non-U.S. currency, non-U.S. currency forward contracts, certain non-U.S. currency options or futures contracts and the disposition of debt securities
denominated in non-U.S. currency, to the extent attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the acquisition and disposition dates, are also treated as ordinary income or loss unless the Fund were to elect otherwise.</div>
<div>Original Issue Discount.
<font> OID on tax-exempt bonds is recognized over the term of the bond and is tax-exempt to the holder of the bond. Special U.S. federal income tax rules apply to inflation-indexed bonds. Generally, all stated
interest on such bonds is taken into income by a Fund under its regular method of accounting for interest income. The amount of a positive inflation adjustment, which results in an increase in the inflation-adjusted principal amount of the bond, is
treated as original issue discount. The OID is included in a Fund’s gross income ratably during the period ending with the maturity of the bond, under the general OID inclusion rules. The amount of a Fund’s OID in a taxable year with
respect to a bond will increase a Fund’s taxable income for such year without a corresponding receipt of cash, until the bond matures. As a result, a Fund may need to use other sources of cash to satisfy its distributions for such year. The
amount of negative inflation adjustment, which results in a decrease in the inflation-adjusted principal amount of the bond, reduces the amount of interest (including stated, interest, OID, and market discount, if any) otherwise includible in a
Fund’s income with respect to the bond for the taxable year.</font></div>
<div>Reporting.<font>  If a
shareholder recognizes a loss with respect to a Fund’s shares of $2 million or more for an individual shareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate shareholder, the shareholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement on IRS Form
8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases exempted from this reporting requirement, but under current guidance, shareholders of a RIC are not exempted. The fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations does not
affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer’s treatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual
circumstances.</font></div> <div>Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders. <font> Dividends paid by a Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are generally subject to withholding tax at a 30% rate or a reduced rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty to the extent derived from investment income
and short-term capital gains. Dividends paid by a Fund from net tax-exempt income or long-term capital gains are generally not subject to such withholding tax. In order to obtain a reduced rate of withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder will be required
to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying its entitlement to benefits under a treaty. The withholding tax does not apply to regular dividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who provides an IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that the
dividends are effectively connected with the non-U.S. shareholder’s conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. Instead,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

 Table of Contents </a> </div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>the effectively connected dividends will be subject to regular U.S. income
tax as if the non-U.S. shareholder were a U.S. shareholder. A non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively connected dividends may also be subject to additional “branch profits tax” imposed at a rate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A
non-U.S. shareholder who fails to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable form may be subject to backup withholding at the appropriate rate.</div>
<div>Properly-reported dividends are generally exempt from U.S.
federal withholding tax where they (i) are paid in respect of a Fund’s “qualified net interest income” (generally, a Fund’s U.S. source interest income, other than certain contingent interest and interest from obligations of
a corporation or partnership in which a Fund is at least a 10% shareholder or partner, reduced by expenses that are allocable to such income); or (ii) are paid in respect of a Fund’s “qualified short-term capital gains” (generally,
the excess of a Fund’s net short-term capital gain over a Fund’s long-term capital loss for such taxable year). However, depending on its circumstances, a Fund may report all, some or none of its potentially eligible dividends as such
qualified net interest income or as qualified short-term capital gains and/or treat such dividends, in whole or in part, as ineligible for this exemption from withholding. In order to qualify for this exemption from withholding, a non-U.S.
shareholder will need to comply with applicable certification requirements relating to its non-U.S. status (including, in general, furnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or substitute Form). In the case of shares held through an
intermediary, the intermediary may withhold even if a Fund reports the payment as qualified net interest income or qualified short-term capital gain. Non-U.S. shareholders should contact their intermediaries with respect to the application of these
rules to their accounts.</div> <div>Distributions to certain
foreign shareholders by a Fund at least 50% of the assets of which are “U.S. real property interests” (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury regulations) at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the
distributions, to the extent the distributions are attributable to gains from sales or exchanges of U.S. real property interests (including shares in certain “U.S. real property holding corporations” such as certain REITs, although
exceptions may apply if any class of stock of such a corporation is regularly traded on an established securities market and the Fund has held no more than 5% of such class of stock at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the
distributions), generally must be treated by such foreign shareholders as income effectively connected to a trade or business within the U.S., which is generally subject to tax at the graduated rates applicable to U.S. shareholders, except for
distributions to foreign shareholders that held no more than 5% of any class of stock of the Fund at any time during the previous one-year period ending on the date of the distributions. Such distributions may be subject to U.S. withholding tax and
may require a foreign shareholder to file a U.S. federal income tax return. In addition, sales or redemptions of shares held by certain foreign shareholders in such a Fund generally will be subject to U.S. withholding tax and generally will require
the foreign shareholder to file a U.S. federal income tax return, although exceptions may apply if more than 50% of the value of the Fund’s shares are held by U.S. shareholders or the foreign shareholder selling or redeeming the shares has
held no more than 5% of any class of stock of the Fund at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the sale or redemption.</div>
<div>Provided that more than 50% of the value of a Fund’s
stock is held by U.S. shareholders, redemptions and other distributions made in the form of U.S. real property interests (including shares in certain “U.S. real property holding corporations”, although exceptions may apply if any class
of stock of such a corporation is regularly traded on an established securities market and the Fund has held no more than 5% of such class of stock at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the distribution) generally will cause
the Fund to recognize a portion of any unrecognized gain in the U.S. real property interests equal to the product of (i) the excess of fair market value of such U.S. real property interests over the Fund’s adjusted bases in such interests and
(ii) the greatest foreign ownership percentage of the Fund during the five-year period ending on the date of distribution.</div>
<div>Shareholders that are nonresident aliens or foreign entities
are urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning the particular tax consequences to them of an investment in a Fund.</div>
<div>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on
U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items paid to: (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS information regarding their direct and indirect U.S.
account holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will need to: (i) enter into agreements with the
IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information including the names, addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders; comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S.
accounts; report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained; agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required
information; and determine certain other information as to their account</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Regulation Under the Alternative Investment Fund Managers
Directive. <font> The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”) imposes detailed and prescriptive obligations on fund managers established in the EU (“EU Operative Provisions”).
These do not currently apply to managers established outside of the EU, such as BFA. Rather, non-EU managers are only required to comply with certain disclosure, reporting and transparency obligations of AIFMD (“AIFMD Disclosure
Provisions”) if such managers market a fund to EU investors.</font></div>
<div>Where the AIFMD Disclosure Provisions relate to EU Operative
Provisions that do not apply to BFA, no meaningful disclosure can be made. These EU Operative Provisions include prescriptive rules on: measuring and capping leverage in line with known European standards; the treatment of investors; the use of
“depositaries”; and coverage for professional liability risks.</div>
<div>AIFMD imposes certain conditions on the marketing of funds,
such as the Funds, to EU investors. AIFMD requires that an ‘alternative investment fund manager’ (“AIFM”) be identified to meet such conditions where such marketing is sought. For these purposes BFA, as the legal entity
responsible for performing the portfolio and risk management of the Funds, shall be the AIFM.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>AIFMD requires disclosure on an ongoing basis of certain
information relating to the use of special arrangements, leverage, rights of reuse of collateral, guarantees granted under leverage arrangements and the use of gates, side pockets and similar liquidity management tools. Given that the Funds do not
use any special arrangements or allow for collateral reuse, it is not intended that such disclosures will need to be made by the Funds. Each Fund will, however, to the extent relevant and appropriate, disclose in its annual report information on the
Fund's leverage, risk profile and risk management systems employed by BFA. Each Fund will also disclose material changes, if any, to the liquidity management systems and procedures employed in respect of the Fund.</div>

through voting at shareholder meetings.</div> <div>We believe that
there are certain fundamental rights attached to shareholding. Companies and their boards should be accountable to shareholders and structured with appropriate checks and balances to ensure that they operate in shareholders’ best interests.
Effective voting rights are central to the rights of ownership and there should be one vote for one share. Shareholders should have the right to elect, remove and nominate directors, approve the appointment of the auditor and to amend the corporate
charter or by-laws. Shareholders should be able to vote on matters that are material to the protection of their investment including but not limited to changes to the purpose of the business, dilution levels and pre-emptive rights, and the
distribution of income and capital structure. In order to make informed decisions, we believe that shareholders have the right to sufficient and timely information.</div>
<div>Our primary focus is on the performance of the board of
directors. As the agent of shareholders, the board should set the company’s strategic aims within a framework of prudent and effective controls, which enables risk to be assessed and managed. The board should provide direction and leadership
to management and oversee management’s performance. Our starting position is to be supportive of boards in their oversight efforts on shareholders’ behalf and we would generally expect to support the items of business they put to a vote
at shareholder meetings. Votes cast against or withheld from resolutions proposed by the board are a signal that we are concerned that the directors or management have either not acted in the best interests of shareholders or have not responded
adequately to shareholder concerns. We assess voting matters on a case-by-case basis and in light of each company’s unique circumstances taking into consideration regional best practices and long-term value creation.</div>
<div>These principles set out our approach to engaging with
companies, provide guidance on our position on corporate governance and outline how our views might be reflected in our voting decisions. Corporate governance practices can vary internationally, so our expectations in relation to individual
companies are based on the legal and regulatory framework of each local market. However, we believe there are overarching principles of corporate governance that apply globally and provide a framework for more detailed, market-specific
assessments.</div> <div>We believe BlackRock has a responsibility
in relation to monitoring and providing feedback to companies, sometimes known as “stewardship.” These ownership responsibilities include engaging with management or board members on corporate governance matters, voting proxies in the
best long-term economic interests of shareholders and engaging with regulatory bodies to ensure a sound policy framework consistent with promoting long-term shareholder value creation. We also believe in the responsibility to our clients to have
appropriate resources and oversight structures. Our approach is set out in the section below titled “BlackRock’s oversight of its investment stewardship activities” and is further detailed in a team profile on our website.</div>
<div>CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, ENGAGEMENT AND VOTING</div>
<div>We recognize that accepted standards of corporate governance
differ between markets, but we believe there are sufficient common threads globally to identify an overarching set of principles. The objective of our investment stewardship activities is the protection and enhancement of the value of our
clients’ investments in public corporations. Thus, these principles focus on practices and structures that we consider to be supportive of long-term value creation. We discuss below the principles under six key themes. In our regional and
market-specific voting guidelines we explain how these principles inform our voting decisions in relation to specific resolutions that may appear on the agenda of a shareholder meeting in the relevant market.</div>
<div>The six key themes are:</div> </div>

<div>At a minimum, we expect companies to observe the accepted
corporate governance standards in their domestic market or to explain why doing so is not in the interests of shareholders. Where company reporting and disclosure is inadequate or the approach taken is inconsistent with our view of what is in the
best interests of shareholders, we will engage with the company and/or use our vote to encourage a change in practice. In making voting decisions, we perform independent research and analysis, such as reviewing relevant information published by the
company and apply our voting guidelines to achieve the outcome we believe best protects our clients’ long-term economic interests. We also work closely with our active portfolio managers, and may take into account internal and external
research.</div> <div>BlackRock views engagement as an important
activity; engagement provides us with the opportunity to improve our understanding of investee companies and their governance structures to better inform our voting decisions. Engagement also allows us to share our philosophy and approach to
investment and corporate governance with companies to enhance their understanding of our objectives. Our engagements often focus on providing our feedback on company disclosures, particularly where we believe they could be enhanced. There are a
range of approaches we may take in engaging companies depending on the nature of the issue under consideration, the company and the market.</div>
<div>BlackRock takes an engagement-first approach, emphasizing
direct dialogue with companies on governance issues that have a material impact on financial performance. We generally prefer to engage in the first instance where we have concerns and give management time to address or resolve the issue. As a
long-term investor, we are patient and persistent in working with our portfolio companies to have an open dialogue and develop mutual understanding of governance matters, to promote the adoption of best practices and to assess the merits of a
company’s approach to its governance. We monitor the companies in which we invest and engage with them constructively and privately where we believe doing so helps protect shareholders’ interests. We do not try to micro-manage companies,
or tell management and boards what to do. We present our views as a long-term shareholder and listen to companies’ responses. The materiality and immediacy of a given issue will generally determine the level of our engagement and whom we seek
to engage at the company, which could be management representatives or board directors.</div>
<div>Boards and directors</div>
<div>The performance of the board is critical to the economic
success of the company and to the protection of shareholders’ interests. Board members serve as agents of shareholders in overseeing the strategic direction and operation of the company. For this reason, BlackRock focuses on directors in many
of our engagements and sees the election of directors as one of our most important responsibilities in the proxy voting context.</div>
<div>We expect the board of directors to promote and protect
shareholder interests by:</div> <div>

<div>seek to engage with the appropriate directors where we have concerns about
the performance of the board or the company, the broad strategy of the company, or the performance of individual board members.</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that directors should stand for re-election
on a regular basis. We assess directors nominated for election or re-election in the context of the composition of the board as a whole. There should be detailed disclosure of the relevant credentials of the individual directors in order for
shareholders to assess the caliber of an individual nominee. We expect there to be a sufficient number of independent directors on the board to ensure the protection of the interests of all shareholders. Common impediments to independence may
include but are not limited to:</div> <div>

<tr>

 </td>
<td>having
 any other interest, business or other relationship which could, or could reasonably be perceived to, materially interfere with the director’s ability to act in the best interests of the company </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>BlackRock believes that the operation of the board is enhanced
when there is a clearly independent, senior non-executive director to chair it or, where the chairman is also the CEO (or is otherwise not independent), an independent lead director. The role of this director is to enhance the effectiveness of the
independent members of the board through shaping the agenda, ensuring adequate information is provided to the board and encouraging independent participation in board deliberations. The lead independent board director should be available to
shareholders in those situations where a director is best placed to explain and justify a company’s approach.</div>
<div>To ensure that the board remains effective, regular reviews of
board performance should be carried out and assessments made of gaps in skills or experience amongst the members. BlackRock believes it is beneficial for new directors to be brought onto the board periodically to refresh the group’s thinking
and to ensure both continuity and adequate succession planning. In identifying potential candidates, boards should take into consideration the multiple dimensions of diversity, including personal factors such as gender, ethnicity, and age; as well
as professional characteristics, such as a director’s industry, area of expertise, and geographic location. The board should review these dimensions of the current directors and how they might be augmented by incoming directors. We believe
that directors are in the best position to assess the optimal size for the board, but we would be concerned if a board seemed too small to have an appropriate balance of directors or too large to be effective.</div>
<div>There are matters for which the board has responsibility that
may involve a conflict of interest for executives or for affiliated directors. BlackRock believes that shareholders’ interests are best served when the board forms committees of fully independent directors to deal with such matters. In many
markets, these committees of the board specialize in audit, director nominations and compensation matters. An ad hoc committee might also be formed to decide on a special transaction, particularly one with a related party or to investigate a
significant adverse event.</div> <div>Auditors and audit-related
issues</div> <div>BlackRock recognizes the critical importance of
financial statements, which should provide a true and fair picture of a company’s financial condition. We will hold the members of the audit committee or equivalent responsible for overseeing the management of the audit function. We take
particular note of cases involving significant financial restatements or ad hoc notifications of material financial weakness.</div>
<div>The integrity of financial statements depends on the auditor
being free of any impediments to being an effective check on management. To that end, we believe it is important that auditors are, and are seen to be, independent. Where the audit firm provides services to the company in addition to the audit, the
fees earned should be disclosed and explained. Audit committees should have in place a procedure for assessing annually the independence of the auditor.</div>
<div>Capital structure, mergers, asset sales and other special
transactions</div> <div>The capital structure of a company is
critical to its owners, the shareholders, as it impacts the value of their investment and the priority of their interest in the company relative to that of other equity or debt investors. Pre-emptive rights are a key protection for shareholders
against the dilution of their interests.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Effective voting rights are central to the rights of ownership
and we believe strongly in one vote for one share as a guiding principle that supports good corporate governance. Shareholders, as the residual claimants, have the strongest interest in protecting company value, and voting power should match
economic exposure.</div> <div>We are concerned that the creation of
a dual share class may result in an over-concentration of power in the hands of a few shareholders, thus disenfranchising other shareholders and amplifying the potential conflict of interest, which the one share, one vote principle is designed to
mitigate. However, we recognize that in certain circumstances, companies may have a valid argument for dual-class listings, at least for a limited period of time. We believe that such companies should review these dual-class structures on a regular
basis or as company circumstances change. Additionally, they should receive shareholder approval of their capital structure on a periodic basis via a management proposal in the company’s proxy. The proposal should give unaffiliated
shareholders the opportunity to affirm the current structure or establish mechanisms to end or phase out controlling structures at the appropriate time, while minimizing costs to shareholders.</div>
<div>In assessing mergers, asset sales or other special
transactions, BlackRock’s primary consideration is the long-term economic interests of shareholders. Boards proposing a transaction need to clearly explain the economic and strategic rationale behind it. We will review a proposed transaction
to determine the degree to which it enhances long-term shareholder value. We would prefer that proposed transactions have the unanimous support of the board and have been negotiated at arm’s length. We may seek reassurance from the board that
executives’ and/or board members’ financial interests in a given transaction have not adversely affected their ability to place shareholders’ interests before their own. Where the transaction involves related parties, we would
expect the recommendation to support it to come from the independent directors and it is good practice to be approved by a separate vote of the non-conflicted shareholders.</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that shareholders have a right to dispose
of company shares in the open market without unnecessary restriction. In our view, corporate mechanisms designed to limit shareholders’ ability to sell their shares are contrary to basic property rights. Such mechanisms can serve to protect
and entrench interests other than those of the shareholders. We believe that shareholders are broadly capable of making decisions in their own best interests. We expect any so-called ‘shareholder rights plans’ proposed by a board to be
subject to shareholder approval upon introduction and periodically thereafter for continuation.</div>
<div>Compensation and benefits</div>
<div>BlackRock expects a company’s board of directors to put
in place a compensation structure that incentivizes and rewards executives appropriately and is aligned with shareholder interests, particularly generating sustainable long-term shareholder returns. We would expect the compensation committee to take
into account the specific circumstances of the company and the key individuals the board is trying to incentivize. We encourage companies to ensure that their compensation plans incorporate appropriate and challenging performance conditions
consistent with corporate strategy and market practice. We use third party research, in addition to our own analysis, to evaluate existing and proposed compensation structures. We hold members of the compensation committee or equivalent board
members accountable for poor compensation practices or structures.</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that there should be a clear link between
variable pay and company performance that drives shareholder returns. We are not supportive of one-off or special bonuses unrelated to company or individual performance. We acknowledge that the use of peer group evaluation by compensation committees
can help ensure competitive pay; however we are concerned when increases in total compensation at a company are justified solely on peer benchmarking rather than outperformance. We support incentive plans that foster the sustainable achievement of
results relative to competitors. The vesting timeframes associated with incentive plans should facilitate a focus on long-term value creation. We believe consideration should be given to building claw back provisions into incentive plans such that
executives would be required to forgo rewards when they are not justified by actual performance. Compensation committees should guard against contractual arrangements that would entitle executives to material compensation for early termination of
their contract. Finally, pension contributions and other deferred compensation arrangements should be reasonable in light of market practice.</div>
<div>Non-executive directors should be compensated in a manner that
is commensurate with the time and effort expended in fulfilling their professional responsibilities. Additionally, these compensation arrangements should not risk compromising their independence or aligning their interests too closely with those of
the management, whom they are charged with overseeing.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Environmental and social issues</div>
<div>It is within this context of our fiduciary duty to clients
that we undertake our investment stewardship activities. Sound practices in relation to the material environmental and social (“E&amp;S”) factors inherent in the business model can be a signal of operational excellence and management
quality.</div> <div>BlackRock expects companies to identify and
report on the material, business-specific E&amp;S risks and opportunities and to explain how these are managed. This explanation should make clear how the approach taken by the company best serves the interests of shareholders and protects and
enhances the long-term economic value of the company. E&amp;S factors are material if they are core to how the business operates. The key performance indicators in relation to E&amp;S factors should also be disclosed and performance against them
discussed, along with any peer group benchmarking and verification processes in place. This helps shareholders assess how well management is dealing with the material E&amp;S factors relevant to the business. Any generally recognized best practices
and reporting standards adopted by the company should also be discussed in this context.</div>
<div>We do not see it as our role to make social or political
judgments on behalf of clients. Our consideration of these E&amp;S factors is consistent with protecting the long-term economic interest of our clients’ assets. We expect investee companies to comply, at a minimum, with the laws and
regulations of the jurisdictions in which they operate. They should explain how they manage situations where local laws or regulations that significantly impact the company’s operations are contradictory or ambiguous to global norms.</div>
<div>Given that E&amp;S factors are often not issues on which a
shareholder votes, we will engage directly with the board or management. Engagement on a particular E&amp;S factor is based on our assessment that there are potential material economic ramifications for shareholders over the long-term.</div>
<div>We may vote against the election of directors where we have
concerns that a company might not be dealing with material E&amp;S factors appropriately. Sometimes we may reflect such concerns by supporting a shareholder proposal on the issue, where there seems to be either a significant potential threat or
realized harm to shareholders’ interests caused by poor management of E&amp;S factors. In deciding our course of action, we will assess whether the company has already taken sufficient steps to address the concern and whether there is a clear
and material economic disadvantage to the company if the issue is not addressed.</div>
<div>General corporate governance matters and shareholder
protections</div> <div>BlackRock believes that shareholders have a
right to timely and detailed information on the financial performance and viability of the companies in which they invest. In addition, companies should also publish information on the governance structures in place and the rights of shareholders to
influence these. The reporting and disclosure provided by companies help shareholders assess whether their economic interests have been protected and the quality of the board’s oversight of management. We believe shareholders should have the
right to vote on key corporate governance matters, including changes to governance mechanisms, to submit proposals to the shareholders’ meeting and to call special meetings of shareholders.</div>
<div>BLACKROCK’S OVERSIGHT OF ITS INVESTMENT STEWARDSHIP
ACTIVITIES</div> <div>Oversight</div>
<div>We hold ourselves to a very high standard in our investment
stewardship activities, including proxy voting. This function is executed by a team called BlackRock Investment Stewardship (“BIS”) which is comprised of BlackRock employees who do not have other responsibilities other than their roles
in BIS. BIS is considered an investment function. The team does not have sales responsibilities.</div>
<div>BlackRock maintains three regional advisory committees
(“Stewardship Advisory Committees”) for (a) the Americas; (b) Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and (c) Asia-Pacific, generally consisting of senior BlackRock investment professionals and/or senior employees with
practical boardroom experience. The regional Stewardship Advisory Committees review and advise on amendments to the proxy voting guidelines covering markets within each respective region (“Guidelines”).</div> </div>

 Table of Contents </a> </div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>In addition to the regional Stewardship Advisory Committees,
the Investment Stewardship Global Oversight Committee (“Global Committee”) is a risk-focused committee, comprised of senior representatives from various BlackRock investment teams, BlackRock’s Deputy General Counsel, the Global
Head of Investment Stewardship (“Global Head”), and other senior executives with relevant experience and team oversight.</div>
<div>The Global Head has primary oversight of the activities of
BIS, including voting in accordance with the Guidelines, which require the application of professional judgment and consideration of each company’s unique circumstances. The Global Committee reviews and approves amendments to these Global
Corporate Governance &amp; Engagement Principles. The Global Committee also reviews and approves amendments to the regional Guidelines, as proposed by the regional Stewardship Advisory Committees.</div>
<div>In addition, the Global Committee receives and reviews
periodic reports regarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as regular updates on material process issues, procedural changes and other risk oversight considerations. The Global Committee reviews these reports in an oversight capacity as informed by
the BIS corporate governance engagement program and Guidelines.</div>
<div>BIS carries out engagement with companies, monitors and
executes proxy votes, and conducts vote operations (including maintaining records of votes cast) in a manner consistent with the relevant Guidelines. BIS also conducts research on corporate governance issues and participates in industry discussions
to keep abreast of important developments in the corporate governance field. BIS may utilize third parties for certain of the foregoing activities and performs oversight of those third parties. BIS may raise complicated or particularly controversial
matters for internal discussion with the relevant investment teams and/or refer such matters to the appropriate regional Stewardship Advisory Committees for review, discussion and guidance prior to making a voting decision.</div>
<div>Vote execution</div>
<div>We carefully consider proxies submitted to funds and other
fiduciary account(s) (“Fund” or “Funds”) for which we have voting authority. BlackRock votes (or refrains from voting) proxies for each Fund for which we have voting authority based on our evaluation of the best long-term
economic interests of shareholders, in the exercise of our independent business judgment, and without regard to the relationship of the issuer of the proxy (or any shareholder proponent or dissident shareholder) to the Fund, the Fund’s
affiliates (if any), BlackRock or BlackRock’s affiliates, or BlackRock employees (see “Conflicts management policies and procedures”, below).</div>
<div>When exercising voting rights, BlackRock will normally vote on
specific proxy issues in accordance with the Guidelines for the relevant market. The Guidelines are reviewed regularly and are amended consistent with changes in the local market practice, as developments in corporate governance occur, or as
otherwise deemed advisable by BlackRock’s Stewardship Advisory Committees. BIS may, in the exercise of their professional judgment, conclude that the Guidelines do not cover the specific matter upon which a proxy vote is required or that an
exception to the Guidelines would be in the best long-term economic interests of BlackRock’s clients.</div>
<div>In the uncommon circumstance of there being a vote with
respect to fixed income securities or the securities of privately held issuers, the decision generally will be made by a Fund's portfolio managers and/or BIS based on their assessment of the particular transactions or other matters at issue.</div>
<div>In certain markets, proxy voting involves logistical issues
which can affect BlackRock’s ability to vote such proxies, as well as the desirability of voting such proxies. These issues include but are not limited to: (i) untimely notice of shareholder meetings; (ii) restrictions on a foreigner’s
ability to exercise votes; (iii) requirements to vote proxies in person; (iv) “share-blocking” (requirements that investors who exercise their voting rights surrender the right to dispose of their holdings for some specified period in
proximity to the shareholder meeting); (v) potential difficulties in translating the proxy; (vi) regulatory constraints; and (vii) requirements to provide local agents with unrestricted powers of attorney to facilitate voting instructions. We are
not supportive of impediments to the exercise of voting rights such as shareblocking or overly burdensome administrative requirements.</div>
<div>As a consequence, BlackRock votes proxies on a
“best-efforts” basis. In addition, BIS may determine that it is generally in the best interests of BlackRock’s clients not to vote proxies if the costs (including but not limited to opportunity costs associated with shareblocking
constraints) associated with exercising a vote are expected to outweigh the benefit the client would derive by voting on the proposal.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

Rather, they share our view about corporate governance issues generally, and provide insight into how we typically approach issues that commonly arise on corporate ballots.</div>
<div>Reporting and vote transparency</div>
<div>We inform clients about our engagement and voting policies and
activities through direct communication and through disclosure on our website. Each year we publish an annual report, an annual engagement and voting statistics report, and our full voting record to our website. On a quarterly basis, we publish
regional reports which provide an overview of our investment stewardship engagement and voting activities during the quarter, including market developments, speaking engagements, and engagement and voting statistics. Additionally, we make public our
market-specific voting guidelines for the benefit of clients and companies with whom we engage.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Appendix A4 – Supplemental BlackRock Sustainable Proxy
Voting Guidelines</div> <div>September 28, 2018</div>
<div>Environmental and social issues</div>
<div>Our fiduciary duty to clients is to protect and enhance their
economic interest in the companies in which we invest on their behalf. It is within this context that BlackRock Investment Stewardship (BIS) undertake our corporate governance activities. We believe that well-managed companies will deal effectively
with the material environmental and social (“E&amp;S”) factors relevant to their businesses.</div>
<div>BIS expects companies to identify and report on the material,
business-specific E&amp;S risks and opportunities and to explain how these are managed. This explanation should make clear how the approach taken by the company best serves the interests of shareholders and protects and enhances the long-term
economic value of the company. The key performance indicators in relation to E&amp;S matters should also be disclosed and performance against them discussed, along with any peer group benchmarking and verification processes in place. This helps
shareholders assess how well management is dealing with the material E&amp;S factors relevant to the business. Any global standards adopted should also be disclosed and discussed in this context.</div>
<div>We may vote against the election of directors where we have
concerns that a company might not be dealing with E&amp;S issues appropriately. Sometimes we may reflect such concerns by supporting a shareholder proposal on the issue, where there seems to be either a significant potential threat or realized harm
to shareholders’ interests caused by poor management of material E&amp;S matters. In deciding our course of action, we will assess the nature of our engagement with the company on the issue over time, including whether:</div>
<div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>The company has already
taken sufficient steps to address the concern </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>The company is in the
process of actively implementing a response </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>There
 is a clear and material economic disadvantage to the company in the near-term if the issue is not addressed in the manner requested by the shareholder proposal </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>BIS may vote against shareholder proposals that, in our
assessment, are too prescriptive or narrowly focused, deal with issues we consider to be the purview of the board or management, or where the company is already reporting in the spirit of the shareholder proposals even if not in its exact
format.</div> <div>In certain instances, BIS may instruct E&amp;S
shareholder proposals differently for different funds. This “split vote” will be based on BIS’ assessment of the materiality of the underlying issues in conjunction with an assessment that clients invested in the ESG funds may
expect more urgent action be taken by the company. In our view, it is reasonable to expect that clients invested in ESG funds may be less patient with regard to evolution in corporate policies on material E&amp;S matters and therefore wish to send a
stronger signal to the company by supporting a shareholder proposal.</div>
<div>Environmental shareholder proposals:</div>
<div>Climate risks and opportunities:</div>
<div>Within the framework laid out above, as well as our guidance
on “How BlackRock Investment Stewardship engages on climate risk”, we believe that climate presents significant investment risks and opportunities to many companies. We believe that the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on
Climate- Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) sector-specific disclosure standards provide useful guidance to companies on identifying, managing, and reporting on
climate-related risks and opportunities. We expect companies to help their investors understand how the company may be impacted by climate change and to convey their governance around this issue through their corporate disclosures. For companies in
sectors that are significantly exposed to climate-related risk, we expect the whole board to have demonstrable fluency in how climate risk affects the business, and how management mitigates that risk. Shareholder proposals related to climate risk,
include, but are not limited to: the need for greater reporting on GHG</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>emissions; how the company’s strategy would fare under a 2 degree
scenario;<sup>1</sup> the transition to a lower carbon economy (including greater integration of renewable energy etc.); and the company’s management of
methane or other GHG emissions.</div> <div>In assessing these
proposals, we take into consideration the factors laid out above, as well as the robustness of the company’s existing disclosures and our understanding of its management of the issues as revealed through our engagements with the company and
board members over time.</div> <div>Sustainability Disclosures</div>
<div>As set forth above, BIS expects companies to identify and
report on the material, business-specific E&amp;S risks and opportunities and to explain how these are managed. This includes how the company is assessing risks to the natural environment as a result, directly, or indirectly, of its operations. This
may include impacts to forests, species, water, air, as well as the impact of waste, and of product life-cycle management. We believe that SASB’s sector-specific disclosure standards provide useful guidance to companies on identifying,
managing, and reporting on material sector-specific sustainability issues. Using SASB as a guide, where necessary, we will engage with companies to understand their oversight and management of material sustainability factors. Where there is a
shareholder proposal related to a matter of environmental sustainability, we will assess the quality of the company’s existing disclosures, the information gleaned through engagement, and the fund’s timeframe for change in reaching a
decision on how to vote.</div> <div>Social and political shareholder
proposals:</div> <div>Data Privacy and cybersecurity:</div>
<div>BIS views cybersecurity as a significant enterprise-wide risk
that can impact all levels of a company’s operational activities. Managing this risk is essential to preserving corporate value over time. We assess cybersecurity risk as one component of a company’s broader risk management and oversight
responsibility. In any engagement related to risk, we seek to understand a company’s governance and strategy around the issue; the board’s oversight of management and the company’s processes; and the company’s disclosures
regarding its preparedness to manage a risk-related event if and when one occurs. Where a company receives a shareholder proposal related to cybersecurity and data privacy accountability, we will review the company’s existing disclosures and
take into account our understanding of its management of the issues as revealed through our engagements with the company and board members over time.</div>
<div>Human Capital Management:</div>
<div>A company’s approach to human capital management –
employee development, diversity and a commitment to equal employment opportunity, health and safety, labor relations, and supply chain labor standards, amongst other things – will vary across sectors but are a factor in business continuity and
success. In light of evolving market trends like shortages of skilled labor, uneven wage growth, and technology that is transforming the labor market, many companies and investors consider having a high standard of human capital management a
competitive advantage. In our engagement on these factors, we seek to ensure companies are adopting the sound business practices likely to create an engaged and stable workforce. As part of the engagement, we are interested to know if, and how,
boards oversee and work with management to improve performance in these areas. Such engagement also provides a lens into the company’s culture, long-term operational risk management practices, and, more broadly, the quality of the
board’s oversight.</div> <div>BIS is aware that disclosure of
information on HCM is still evolving and that the way HCM risks manifest themselves may vary by industry and market. We are members of the Investor Advisory Group of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), which provides
industry-specific HCM metrics. We encourage companies to aim over time to go beyond commentaries and provide more transparency on their practices. Investors recognize that most companies are already in possession of HCM data on their workforce, but
are cautious of disclosing this information. We believe that both qualitative and quantifiable indicators can help effectively distinguish companies that are managing this important driver of value in their business. Where a company receives a
shareholder proposal related to reporting on Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO), board diversity or pay disparity, we will take into account the company’s current disclosures as well as any insight we receive through our engagements with the
company and board members in reaching a decision on how to vote.</div> <hr noshade="noshade"/>

<div>Human Rights</div>
<div>BIS believes that companies with strong corporate governance
practices are more likely to manage the material environmental and social risks facing the company. To that end, we expect management and the board to oversee the health and safety of its workers, their working conditions, adherence to applicable
labor and anti-discrimination laws, work day length and minimum wage best practices. Companies should also understand and manage their impact on communities, including lower income and indigenous populations. We expect companies and board to be able
to explain their oversight of human rights-related issues. We expect that companies have policies in place to review their practices and supply chains and to have processes to institute corrective action where necessary. We also expect companies to
be in compliance with international standards such as the UN Global Compact, where applicable, and we will take into account any violations thereof in the context of our engagement and voting decisions.</div>
<div>Opioids:</div>
<div>Companies involved in the manufacture and distribution of
opioids have come under increasing scrutiny over their ability to manage the financial and reputational risks associated with their products. We believe financial and reputational consequences of litigation, adverse publicity, and regulatory actions
and investigations have the potential to impact these companies’ long-term financial performance. Through engagement with such companies, we assess the robustness of management’s approach to setting strategy around drug pricing, drug
access, marketing, supply chain management, and public education around controlled substances. We also evaluate board oversight of reputational and legal risks facing the company, as well as the process and frequency by which the board is informed
about corporate policies and procedures related to oversight of opioid-related risks. Where a company receives a shareholder proposal related to reporting or overseeing opioid-related risk, or proposals related to reviewing drug pricing or
distribution practices, our assessment will take into account factors discussed above, and any knowledge gained from our engagement with the company and board members, as well as the time frame needed for change.</div>
<div>Product safety, supply chains and distribution channels:</div>
<div>Companies in certain industries, such as the food and
pharmaceutical sectors, may need to mitigate financial risks associated with their products, supply chains and/or their distribution channels. Where appropriate, BIS expects companies to disclose how they are addressing these risks for themselves
and for their distributors, for example, by their participation in industry groups and/or initiatives or through certification by reputable organizations. Where a company receives a shareholder proposal on topics such as: animal welfare, animal
testing, removal of antibiotic or genetically modified organism use in the supply chain or use of non-recycling packaging, we will assess the materiality of the issue to the company’s business, review the company’s existing disclosure,
and if appropriate, engage the company’s board and management team to enhance our understanding of their processes and oversight.</div>
<div>Corporate political activities:</div>
<div>When presented with shareholder proposals requesting increased
disclosure on corporate political activities, we may consider the political activities of that company and its peers, the existing level of disclosure, and our view of the associated risks. We generally believe that it is the duty of boards and
management to determine the appropriate level of disclosure of all types of corporate activity, and we are generally not supportive of proposals that are overly prescriptive in nature. We may determine to support a shareholder proposal requesting
additional reporting of corporate political activities where there seems to be either a significant potential threat or actual harm to shareholders’ interests and where we believe the company has not already provided shareholders with
sufficient information to assess the company’s management of the risk. Finally, we believe that it is not the role of shareholders to suggest or approve corporate political activities; therefore we generally do not support proposals requesting
a shareholder vote on political activities or expenditures.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Appendix B – Description of Fixed-Income Ratings</div>
<div>A rating is generally assigned to a fixed-income security at
the time of issuance by a credit rating agency designated as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (“NRSRO”) by the SEC. While NRSROs may from time to time revise such ratings, they undertake no obligation to do so, and
the ratings given to securities at issuance do not necessarily represent ratings which would be given to these securities on a particular subsequent date.</div>
<div>NRSROs may rate specific investments (<font>e.g.</font>, bonds), issuers (<font>e.g.</font>, corporations, governments and financial institutions) and/or programs (<font>e.g.</font>, commercial paper programs).
However, certain types of investments generally are not rated by NRSROs, such as certain government/sovereign obligations, US agency securities, commercial paper, time deposits at financial institutions, and derivative instruments such as credit
default swaps. For these types of investments, as well as US Treasury securities (some of which are not rated), where a NRSRO has not rated the specific investment but has rated the investment’s issuer, program, financial institution or
underlying reference asset, BFA may consider the investment to have the same NRSRO rating as its issuer, program, financial institution or underlying reference asset, as applicable. In the case of municipal securities, where one NRSRO provides
multiple ratings for the same security (<font>e.g.</font>, “underlying,” “insured” and/or “enhanced” ratings), BFA may consider the security to have the highest of the multiple
ratings.</div> <div>New issue securities (regardless of type)
rarely are rated by a NRSRO at the time of their initial offering. Preliminary prospectuses or term sheets for new issue securities often include an expected rating for the security (as determined by the underwriter and/or issuer) or a NRSRO rating
for the issuer of the security. If applicable, when deciding whether to purchase a new issue security that has not yet been rated by a NRSRO, BFA may attribute an expected rating to the security based on: (i) the expected rating of the security set
forth in the preliminary prospectus or term sheet for the security; (ii) the NRSRO’s rating for the issuer of the security set forth in the preliminary prospectus or term sheet for the security; or (iii) with respect to asset-backed
securities, the rating of a prior issuance having a similar structure or the same sponsor.</div>
<div>Where the investment objective of a Fund is to track the
performance of an index that includes credit ratings eligibility criteria as part of its index methodology, a Fund may purchase any security within the index, such security having been determined by the index provider as meeting its credit ratings
eligibility criteria. The credit ratings practices of an index provider may differ from BlackRock’s practices, as described above. Further, a Fund may invest, directly or indirectly, in securities that are not rated by a rating agency or
securities with a credit rating that differs from the credit rating specified in its index methodology in various circumstances, including where a security is downgraded but not yet removed from an index, following the removal of a security from an
index prior to its sale by the Fund or as a result of a corporate action or restructuring affecting an issuer of a security held by a Fund.</div>
<div>Fixed-income securities which are unrated expose the investor
to risks with respect to capacity to pay interest or repay principal which are similar to the risks of lower-rated speculative bonds. Evaluation of these securities is dependent on the investment adviser’s judgment, analysis and experience in
the evaluation of such securities.</div> <div>Investors should note
that the assignment of a rating to a security by an NRSRO may not reflect the effect of recent developments on the issuer’s ability to make interest and principal payments or on the likelihood of default.</div>
<div>Securities deemed to be high yield are rated below Baa3 by
Moody’s and below BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch.</div>
<div>The descriptions below relate to general long-term and
short-term obligations of an issuer.</div> <div>Moody’s
Ratings</div> <div>Long-Term Obligations</div>
<div>Aaa:<font> Obligations rated Aaa are
judged to be of the highest quality, subject to the lowest level of credit risk.</font></div>
<div>Aa:<font> Obligations rated Aa are

<div>A:<font> Obligations rated A are
judged to be upper-medium grade and are subject to low credit risk.</font></div>

<div>Ba:<font> Obligations rated Ba are
judged to be speculative and are subject to substantial credit risk.</font></div>
<div>B:<font> Obligations rated B are
considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk.</font></div>
<div>Caa:<font> Obligations rated Caa are
judged to be speculative, of poor standing and are subject to very high credit risk.</font></div>
<div>Ca:<font> Obligations rated Ca are
highly speculative and are likely in, or very near, default, with some prospect of recovery of principal and interest.</font></div>
<div>C:<font> Obligations rated C are the
lowest rated and are typically in default, with little prospect for recovery of principal or interest.</font></div>
<div>Note:<font> Moody's appends
numerical modifiers 1, 2 and 3 in each generic rating classification from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the
modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the lower end of that generic rating category.</font></div>
<div>Absence of Rating:<font> Where no
rating has been assigned or where a rating has been withdrawn, it may be for reasons unrelated to the creditworthiness of the issue.</font></div>
<div>Should no rating be assigned, the reason may be one of the
following:</div> <div>1. An application was not received or
accepted.</div> <div>2. The issue or issuer belongs to a group of
securities or entities that are not rated as a matter of policy.</div>
<div>3. There is a lack of essential data pertaining to the issue
or issuer.</div> <div>4. The issue was privately placed, in which
case the rating is not published in Moody’s publications.</div>
<div>Withdrawal may occur if new and material circumstances arise,
the effects of which preclude satisfactory analysis; if there is no longer available reasonable up-to-date data to permit a judgment to be formed; if a bond is called for redemption; or for other reasons.</div>
<div>Short-Term Obligations</div>
<div>Moody’s short-term debt ratings are opinions of the
ability of issuers to honor short-term financial obligations, generally with an original maturity not exceeding thirteen months.</div>
<div>Moody's employs the following designations to indicate the
relative repayment ability of rated issuers:</div> <div>P-1: <font>Issuers (or supporting institutions) rated Prime-1 have a superior ability to repay short-term debt obligations.</font></div>
<div>P-2: <font>Issuers (or supporting
institutions) rated Prime-2 have a strong ability to repay short-term debt obligations.</font></div>
<div>P-3: <font>Issuers (or supporting
institutions) rated Prime-3 have an acceptable ability to repay short-term obligations.</font></div>
<div>NP: <font>Issuers (or supporting
institutions) rated Not Prime do not fall within any of the Prime rating categories.</font></div>
<div>US Municipal Short-Term Debt Obligations</div>
<div>There are three rating categories for short-term municipal
obligations that are considered investment grade and are designated as Municipal Investment Grade (MIG). In addition, those short-term obligations that are of speculative quality are designated SG, or speculative grade. MIG ratings expire at the
maturity of the obligation.</div> <div>MIG 1:<font> This designation denotes superior credit quality. Excellent protection is afforded by established cash flows, highly reliable liquidity support, or demonstrated broad-based access to the market for
refinancing.</font></div> <div>MIG 2:<font> This designation denotes strong credit quality. Margins of protection are ample, although not as large as in the preceding group.</font></div>
<div>MIG 3:<font> This designation
denotes acceptable credit quality. Liquidity and cash-flow protection may be narrow, and market access for refinancing is likely to be less well-established.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>S&amp;P Global Ratings</div>
<div>Long-Term Obligations</div>
<div>AAA:<font> An obligation rated AAA
has the highest rating assigned by S&amp;P Global Ratings. The obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong.</font></div>
<div>AA:<font> An obligation rated AA
differs from the highest-rated obligations only to a small degree. The obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment is very strong.</font></div>
<div>A:<font> An obligation rated A is
somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher-rated categories. However, the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is still
strong.</font></div> <div>BBB:<font> An
obligation rated BBB exhibits adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation.</font></div> <div>BB; B; CCC; CC; and C:<font> Obligations rated BB, B, CCC, CC, and C are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics. BB indicates the least degree of speculation and C the highest. While such obligations will likely have some
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.</font></div>
<div>BB:<font> An obligation rated BB is
less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions which could lead to the obligor’s inadequate capacity to meet its
financial commitment on the obligation.</font></div> <div>B:<font> An obligation rated B is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated BB, but the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Adverse business, financial, or economic
conditions will likely impair the obligor’s capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.</font></div>
<div>CCC:<font> An obligation rated CCC
is currently vulnerable to nonpayment, and is dependent upon favorable business, financial, and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. In the event of adverse business, financial, or economic
conditions, the obligor is not likely to have the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.</font></div>
<div>CC:<font> An obligation rated CC is
currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment. The CC rating is used when a default has not yet occurred, but S&amp;P Global Ratings expects default to be a virtual certainty, regardless of the anticipated time to default.</font></div>
<div>C:<font> An obligation rated C is
currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment, and the obligation is expected to have lower relative seniority or lower ultimate recovery compared to obligations that are rated higher.</font></div>
<div>D:<font> An obligation rated D is in
default or in breach of an imputed promise. For non-hybrid capital instruments, the D rating category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due, unless S&amp;P Global Ratings believes that such payments will be made within
five business days in the absence of a stated grace period or within the earlier of the stated grace period or 30 calendar days. The D rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of similar action and where
default on an obligation is a virtual certainty, for example due to automatic stay provisions. An obligation's rating is lowered to D if it is subject to a distressed exchange offer.</font></div>
<div>NR:<font> NR indicates no rating has
been requested, or that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that S&amp;P Global Ratings does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy.</font></div>
<div>Note:<font> The ratings from AA to
CCC may be modified by the addition of a plus (+) or minus (-) sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories.</font></div>

<div>A-1: <font>A short-term obligation
rated A-1 is rated in the highest category by S&amp;P Global Ratings. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is strong. Within this category, certain obligations are designated with a plus sign (+). This indicates
that the obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on these obligations is extremely strong.</font></div>
<div>A-2: <font>A short-term obligation
rated A-2 is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher rating categories. However, the obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is

<div>Municipal Short-Term Obligations</div>
<div>An S&amp;P U.S. municipal note rating reflects S&amp;P Global
Ratings opinion about the liquidity factors and market access risks unique to the notes. Notes due in three years or less will likely receive a note rating. Notes with an original maturity of more than three years will most likely receive a
long-term debt rating.</div> <div>SP-1:<font> Strong capacity to pay principal and interest. An issue determined to possess a very strong capacity to pay debt service is given a plus (+) designation.</font></div>
<div>SP-2:<font> Satisfactory capacity to
pay principal and interest, with some vulnerability to adverse financial and economic changes over the term of the notes.</font></div>
<div>SP-3:<font> Speculative capacity to
pay principal and interest.</font></div> <div>Fitch Ratings</div>
<div>Long-Term Obligations</div>
<div>AAA:<font> Highest credit quality.
AAA ratings denote the lowest expectation of credit risk. They are assigned only in cases of exceptionally strong capacity for payment of financial commitments. This capacity is highly unlikely to be adversely affected by foreseeable
events.</font></div> <div>AA:<font> Very
high credit quality. AA ratings denote expectations of very low credit risk. They indicate very strong capacity for payment of financial commitments. This capacity is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events.</font></div>
<div>A:<font> High credit quality. A
ratings denote expectations of low credit risk. The capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered strong. This capacity may, nevertheless, be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic conditions than is the case for higher
ratings.</font></div> <div>BBB:<font>
Good credit quality. BBB ratings indicate that expectations of credit risk are currently low. The capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered adequate but adverse business or economic conditions are more likely to impair this
capacity.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

met.</font></div> <div>B:<font> Highly
speculative. B ratings indicate that material credit risk is present.</font></div>
<div>CCC:<font> Substantial credit risk.
CCC ratings indicate that substantial credit risk is present.</font></div>
<div>CC:<font> Very high levels of credit
risk. CC ratings indicate very high levels of credit risk.</font></div>
<div>C:<font> Exceptionally high levels
of credit risk. C indicates exceptionally high levels of credit risk.</font></div>
<div>Defaulted obligations typically are not assigned RD or D
ratings, but are instead rated in the B to C rating categories, depending upon their recovery prospects and other relevant characteristics. This approach better aligns obligations that have comparable overall expected loss but varying vulnerability
to default and loss.</div> <div>Note: The modifiers “+”
or “-” may be appended to a rating to denote relative status within major rating categories. Such suffixes are not added to the AAA obligation rating category, or to corporate finance obligation ratings in the categories below CCC.</div>
<div>The subscript 'emr' is appended to a rating to denote embedded
market risk which is beyond the scope of the rating. The designation is intended to make clear that the rating solely addresses the counterparty risk of the issuing bank. It is not meant to indicate any limitation in the analysis of the counterparty
risk, which in all other respects follows published Fitch criteria for analyzing the issuing financial institution. Fitch does not rate these instruments where the principal is to any degree subject to market risk.</div>
<div>Short-Term Obligations (Corporate and Public Finance)</div>
<div>A short-term issuer or obligation rating is based in all cases
on the short-term vulnerability to default of the rated entity or security stream and relates to the capacity to meet financial obligations in accordance with the documentation governing the relevant obligation. Short-Term Ratings are assigned to
obligations whose initial maturity is viewed as “short-term” based on market convention. Typically, this means up to 13 months for corporate, sovereign, and structured obligations, and up to 36 months for obligations in U.S. public
finance markets.</div> <div>F1:<font>
Highest short-term credit quality. Indicates the strongest intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments; may have an added “+” to denote any exceptionally strong credit feature.</font></div>
<div>F2:<font> Good short-term credit
quality. Good intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments.</font></div>
<div>F3:<font> Fair short-term credit
quality. The intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments is adequate.</font></div>
<div>B:<font> Speculative short-term
credit quality. Minimal capacity for timely payment of financial commitments, plus heightened vulnerability to near term adverse changes in financial and economic conditions.</font></div>
<div>C:<font> High short-term default
risk. Default is a real possibility.</font></div> <div>RD:<font> Restricted default. Indicates an entity that has defaulted on one or more of its financial commitments, although it continues to meet other financial obligations. Typically applicable to entity ratings
only.</font></div> <div>D:<font> Default.
Indicates a broad-based default event for an entity, or the default of a short-term obligation.</font></div>
