<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the
Morningstar<sup>®</sup> Global Digital Infrastructure &amp; Connectivity Index (the “Underlying Index”), which measures the performance of equity securities issued by
companies positioned to experience meaningful economic benefits from providing products, services, and technologies related to cloud computing and 5G, as determined by Morningstar Indexes or its affiliates (the “Index Provider” or
“Morningstar”). The Underlying Index provides exposure to the top 50 companies identified by Morningstar’s equity research team as a producer of promising digital infrastructure technologies consisting of two themes:</div>
<div>      ο Cloud computing, which
enables cloud computing applications through Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) solutions; and</div>
<div>      ο 5G, which enables next
generation connectivity through fifth generation broadband cellular networks.</div>
<div>Cloud computing encompasses both IaaS and PaaS. IaaS is a
solution whereby a public vendor leases commodity equipment and services such as servers, storage, switches, and network access. IaaS is closely related</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>to PaaS, which incorporates the core software needed to make hardware usable.
PaaS includes the operating system, hypervisor, database, and development tools, among other solutions. Service agreements can range from on-demand burst capacity or full-time digital infrastructure.</div>
<div>5G, which enables next generation connectivity through fifth
generation broadband cellular networks, is a collection of technology standards that forms the foundation of wireless networks under development around the world. The standards seek to enable significant increases in network capacity and speeds, as
well as improved network management capabilities. These factors enable the use of millions of devices simultaneously. Future 5G networks are expected to provide links for digital infrastructure between consumer devices, sensors, and a host of other
users in the field.</div> <div>Using these two themes, the Index
Provider then makes forward-looking assessments rather than relying on single point-in-time metrics to identify relevant companies. The Index Provider identifies companies that have any revenue exposure towards a theme today and identifies any
companies that have the potential to drive a material net profit increase from that theme over the next five years. The Index Provider then assigns a thematic exposure score from 0-3 to the companies in Morningstar’s global coverage on each
theme. The Index Provider designed the thematic exposure scores to share a positive correlation with a given company’s beta relative to each theme. The following scoring framework is used: no or little exposure: 0; modest exposure: 1; moderate
exposure: 2; and</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-2</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>significant exposure: 3.</div>
<div>Thematic exposure scores are reviewed annually by Morningstar's
equity research team before each reconstitution of the Underlying Index to help ensure the consistency of the scores.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is rebalanced and reconstituted annually
in December. A 2.5% cap on the weight of individual securities is applied during the rebalancing process. The Underlying Index includes large-, mid- and small-capitalization companies and may change over time.</div>
<div>As of July 31, 2022, a significant portion of the Underlying
Index is represented by securities of companies in the technology industry or sector.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover
low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to that of an applicable underlying index. The
securities</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics
(based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all
of the securities in the Underlying Index.</div> <div>The Fund
generally will invest at least 80% of its assets in the component securities of its Underlying Index and in investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities of its Underlying Index (<font>i.e</font>., depositary receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index) and may invest up to 20% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money
market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash equivalent investments associated with a derivative
position will be treated as part of that position for the purposes of calculating the percentage of investments included in the Underlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the
Fund.</div> <div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to
one-third of the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by Morningstar, which
is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<p>

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the
Underlying Index.</div> <div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font> The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or
group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements
collateralized by U.S. government securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</font></div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share
(“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>5G Next Gen Connectivity Risk.<font> 5G and next generation connections refer to the nascent technologies forming the foundation of wireless networks that are being developed globally. The Fund’s holdings may include equity
securities of operating companies that focus on or have exposure to a wide variety of industries, and the economic success of certain of these companies may not be significantly tied to such technologies. Smaller 5G and next generation connectivity
companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>resources or personnel and may be more volatile than other companies. These
companies may face intense competition and potentially rapid product obsolescence. These companies could be negatively impacted by cybersecurity attacks, additional regulatory oversight and disruptions in service. These companies may depend on
intellectual property rights and may be adversely affected by the impairment of those rights. The customers and suppliers of these companies may be concentrated in a particular location or industry and could be subject to adverse events occurring in
those locations or industries.</div> <div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or other asset
classes.</font></div> <div>Assets Under Management (AUM) Risk<font>.</font><font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this prospectus (the “Prospectus”)), a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its
investment for a specific period of time to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. Therecan be no assurance that any such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could
negatively impact the Fund.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant
Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in
creation and/or redemption transactions. The Fund has</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-4</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an
agency basis (<font>i.e.,</font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund
and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be
heightened for exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that have lower trading volumes.</div>
<div>Calculation Methodology Risk. <font>The Underlying Index relies on various sources of information to assess the criteria of issuers included in the Underlying Index, including information that may be based on assumptions and estimates.
Neither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances that the Underlying Index’s calculation methodology or sources of information will provide an accurate assessment of included issuers.</font></div>
<div>Cloud-based Computing and Data Storage Risk. <font>Companies involved in, or exposed to, cloud-based computing and data storage-related businesses may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel that face intense competition
and potentially rapid product obsolescence. These companies may not be exclusively or substantially exposed to the cloud-based computing and data storage-related businesses, but may be exposed, directly or indirectly, to the market and business
risks of other</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>companies, industries or sectors. In addition, these companies may depend on
intellectual property rights to protect their computing and storage services, which may be difficult to prevent the misappropriation of, and are susceptible to competitors that may develop substantially similar or superior technology.</div>
<div>Cloud-based computing and data storage companies also depend on
the services of third parties, which, if interrupted, may impact their products and services. These companies are also potential targets for cyberattacks, which may have a materially adverse impact on the performance of these companies. Cloud-based
computing may face increasing regulatory scrutiny and legal liability, which may limit the development of this technology and impede the growth of companies that develop or use this technology. Similarly, the collection of data from consumers and
other sources, and storage of that data, may face increased scrutiny as regulators consider how data may be collected, stored, safeguarded and used.</div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector, market segment or asset class.</font></div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the currency of a non-U.S. market in which the Fund</font></div> </div> <div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>S-5</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are delays or limits
on repatriation of such currency. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may change quickly and without warning.</div>
<div>Cybersecurity Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, the Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of
securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established
business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems of the
Fund’s Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is composed of common stocks, which generally
subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>Geographic Risk<font>.</font><font> A natural disaster could occur in a geographic region in which the Fund invests, which could</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>adversely affect the economy or the business operations of companies in the
specific geographic region, causing an adverse impact on the Fund's investments in, or which are exposed to, the affected region.</div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of
the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders.
Unusual market conditions or other unforeseen circumstances (such as natural disasters, political unrest or war) may impact the Index Provider or a third-party data provider, and could cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance. This
could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition.</font></div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk. <font>A widespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in travel restrictions, disruption of healthcare services, prolonged quarantines, cancellations, supply chain
disruptions, business closures, lower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings downgrades, defaults and other significant economic, social and political impacts. Markets may experience temporary closures, extreme volatility,</font></div> </div>
<div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-6</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>severe losses, reduced liquidity and increased trading costs. Such events may
adversely affect the Fund and its investments and may impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities or cause elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV. Despite the development of vaccines, the
duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects cannot be predicted with certainty.</div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may
cause the value of the securities to decline.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more
limited growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div>
<div>Large Shareholder and Large-Scale Redemption Risk.<font> Certain shareholders, including an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, a market maker, or another entity, may from time
to time own or manage a substantial amount of Fund shares, or may invest in the Fund and hold their investment for a limited period of time. There can be no assurance that any large shareholder or large group of shareholders would not redeem their
investment. Redemptions</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>of a large number of Fund shares could require the Fund to dispose of assets
to meet the redemption requests, which can accelerate the realization of taxable income and/or capital gains and cause the Fund to make taxable distributions to its shareholders earlier than the Fund otherwise would have. In addition, under certain
circumstances, non-redeeming shareholders may be treated as receiving a disproportionately large taxable distribution during or with respect to such year. In some circumstances, the Fund may hold a relatively large proportion of its assets in cash
in anticipation of large redemptions, diluting its investment returns. These large redemptions may also force the Fund to sell portfolio securities when it might not otherwise do so, which may negatively impact the Fund’s NAV, increase the
Fund’s brokerage costs and/or have a material effect on the market price of the Fund shares.</div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The countries in which the Fund invests may be subject to
considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant
impact on the Fund and its investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-7</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruptions in
the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>Mid-Capitalization Companies
Risk<font>.</font><font> Compared to large-capitalization companies, mid-capitalization companies may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse developments. In addition,
the securities of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile and less liquid than those of large-capitalization companies.</font></div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities and/or other assets held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the Fund’s quote from the closed foreign market). The impact of a closed foreign market on the Fund is likely to be greater where a large portion of the Fund’s underlying securities
and/or other assets trade on that closed foreign market or when the foreign market is closed for unscheduled reasons. These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other
ETFs.</font></div> <div>Non-Diversification Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may invest a large percentage of its</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>assets in securities issued by or representing a small number of issuers. As a
result, the Fund's performance may depend on the performance of a small number of issuers.</div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of inflation or nationalization. The Fund may
lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting issuers of non-U.S. securities or non-U.S. markets. In addition, non-U.S. securities markets may trade a small number of securities and may be unable to respond effectively
to changes in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund’s service providers,
counterparties or other third parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible
risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Cloud Computing Companies. <font>Cloud computing companies include companies that provide remote computation, software, data access and storage services. The</font></div> </div> <div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>S-8</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>risks related to investing in such companies include disruption in service
caused by hardware or software failure, interruptions or delays in service by third-party data center hosting facilities and maintenance providers, security breaches involving certain private, sensitive, proprietary and confidential information
managed and transmitted by cloud computing companies, and privacy concerns and laws, evolving Internet regulation and other foreign or domestic regulations that may limit or otherwise affect the operations of such companies. Also, the business
models employed by the companies in the cloud computing industry may not prove to be successful.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the
U.S<font>.</font><font> Certain changes in the U.S. economy, such as when the U.S. economy weakens or when its financial markets decline, may have an adverse effect on the
securities to which the Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax
consequences for the Fund.</font></div> <div>Small Fund Risk. <font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain
conditions of the listing exchange. Any resulting liquidation of the Fund could cause the</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Fund to incur elevated transaction costs for the Fund and negative tax
consequences for its shareholders.</div> <div>Technology Sector Risk<font>.</font><font> Technology companies, including information technology companies, may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. Technology
companies typically face intense competition and potentially rapid product obsolescence. They are also heavily dependent on intellectual property rights and may be adversely affected by the loss or impairment of those rights. Companies in the
technology sector are facing increased government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or regulatory action.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to “tracking error,” which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences
between the securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close
and the Fund's valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund's NAV), transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual or the valuation of dividends or interest
received by the Fund or distributions paid to the Fund’s shareholders, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of
custom baskets, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-9</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>or existing regulatory requirements, among other reasons. This risk may be
heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not. <font>BFA EXPECTS

<div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or other asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index,
particularly for securities or other assets that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. In addition, the value of the securities
or</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>other assets in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods
when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund's shares. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher
redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services
or other third-party service providers.</div> <div>Performance

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only be
bought and sold in the secondary market through a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An investor may incur costs
attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for shares of the Fund (ask) when buying or selling shares in the secondary
market (the “bid-ask spread”).<br/> </div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make distributions that may be taxable to
you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an individual retirement account (“IRA”), in which case, your distributions generally will be taxed when
withdrawn.</div> <div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial
Intermediaries</div> <div>If you purchase shares of the Fund through
a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms
and reporting systems or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another
investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.<br/> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
