<p><font size="2">The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the MSCI EAFE Extended ESG Focus Index (the “Underlying Index”), which has been developed by MSCI Inc.
(the “Index Provider” or “MSCI”). The Underlying Index is an optimized equity index designed to reflect the equity performance of companies that have favorable environmental, social and governance (“ESG”)
characteristics (as determined by the Index Provider), while exhibiting risk and return characteristics similar to those of the MSCI EAFE Index (the “Parent Index”). The Index Provider begins with the Parent Index, excludes securities of
companies involved in the business of tobacco, companies involved with controversial weapons, producers and retailers of civilian firearms, companies involved in certain fossil fuels-related activity such as the production of thermal coal, thermal
coal-based power generation and extraction of oil sands, as well as companies involved in very severe business controversies (in each case as determined by the Index Provider), and then follows a quantitative process that is designed to determine
optimal weights for securities to maximize exposure to securities of companies with higher ESG ratings, subject to maintaining risk and return characteristics similar to the Parent Index. For each industry, the

Index Provider identifies key ESG issues that can lead to unexpected costs for companies in the medium to long term. The Index Provider then calculates the size of each company’s exposure to
each key issue based on the company’s business segment and geographic risk and analyzes the extent to which companies have developed robust strategies and programs to manage ESG risks and opportunities. Using a sector specific key issue
weighting model, companies are rated and ranked in comparison to their industry peers. As of August 31, 2019, the Underlying Index consisted of securities from the following 21 developed market countries or regions: Australia, Austria, Belgium,
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”). The Underlying Index will include
large- and <font>mid-capitalization</font> companies and may change over time. As of August 31, 2019, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the financials industry
or sector. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time. </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b><i>Change in the Fund’s “Construction and Maintenance of

comparable to the MSCI USA Small Cap Index, the parent index, while reflecting a higher allocation than that of the parent index to U.S. small-capitalization companies with favorable ESG
profiles. The Underlying Index is constructed by selecting constituents from the parent index through an optimization process that aims to maximize exposure to ESG factors subject to a target tracking error constraint of 50 basis points relative to
the parent index. In constructing the Underlying Index, the Fund’s index provider begins with the parent index, excludes securities of companies involved in the business of tobacco, companies involved with controversial weapons, producers and
retailers of civilian firearms, companies involved in certain fossil fuels-related activity such as the production of thermal coal, thermal coal-based power generation and extraction of oil sands, as well as companies involved in very severe
business controversies (in each case as determined by the index provider). The index provider identifies key ESG controversies, including, among other things, issues involving: (i) the environment (e.g., biodiversity and land use, toxic
emissions and waste, energy and climate change, water stress, nonhazardous operational waste, and supply chain management); (ii) human rights and communities (e.g., impact on local communities, human rights concerns, and civil liberties);
(iii) labor rights and supply chains (e.g., child labor, collective bargaining and union, health and safety, discrimination and workforce diversity, and labor management relations); (iv) customers (e.g., anti-competitive practices,
customer relations, privacy and data security, product safety and quality, and marketing and advertising); and (v) governance (e.g., bribery and fraud, governance structures, and controversial investments). The index provider then rates each
company’s exposure to these ESG issues and evaluates the extent to which the company has created strategies and programs to manage ESG risks and opportunities. Companies are scored by the index provider based on both their risk exposure and
risk management, and then ranked in comparison to their industry peers. The index provider then follows a quantitative process that is designed to determine optimal weights for securities in the Underlying Index to maximize exposure to companies
with higher ESG ratings, subject to maintaining risk and return characteristics similar to those of the parent index. Optimization is a quantitative process that considers the market capitalization weights from the parent index, ESG scores and
additional constraints, including constraints around predicted tracking error, constituent weights, sector weights, and risk aversion, to select and weight the constituents of the Underlying Index. </font></p>
