A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher </font><font>transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when
Fund </font><font>shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not </font><font>reflected in the Annual Fund
Operating Expenses or in the </font><font>Example, affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent </font><font>fiscal
year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 42% of the </font><font>average value of its portfolio.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>Principal Investment Strategies</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the S&amp;P Global </font><font>Clean Energy
Index</font><font>TM</font><font> (the </font><font>“</font><font>Underlying Index</font><font>”</font><font>), which is designed </font><font>to track the performance of approximately 100 clean energy-related</font><font> companies. The Underlying Index is a subset of the S&amp;P </font><font>Global Broad Market Index and includes stocks traded on
</font><font>developed and emerging market exchanges which meet or </font><font>exceed, at the time of inclusion, $300 million in
total market </font><font>capitalization, $100 million in float- adjusted market </font><font>capitalization, and $3 million median
daily value traded over a six-month</font><font> period (or $2 million for existing constituents).</font></div> </div> </div>
<div> <div><font>S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC (the </font><font>“</font><font>Index Provider</font><font>”</font><font>) uses Global </font><font>Industry Classification Standard
(</font><font>“</font><font>GICS</font><font>”</font><font>) and FactSet’s Revere </font><font>Business Industry Classification System (</font><font>“</font><font>RBICS</font><font>”</font><font>) classifications </font><font>along with Trucost Power Generation Data (</font><font>“</font><font>Trucost</font><font>”</font><font>) for utility </font><font>companies to determine the eligible universe. Companies that </font><font>derive at least 25% in aggregate revenue from clean energy </font><font>related businesses as defined by RBICS data, companies in the
</font><font>Electric Utilities, Multi-Utilities, or Independent Power Producers </font><font>&amp; Energy Traders sub-industries
that generate at least 20% of their </font><font>power from renewable sources as measured by Trucost data, and </font><font>companies
in the GICS </font><font>“</font><font>renewable
utilities</font><font>”</font><font> sub-industry form the
</font><font>preliminary universe. In addition, the Index Provider uses </font><font>company exclusion criteria related to business
activity (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>,
</font><font>controversial weapons, tobacco, thermal coal, etc.) and other </font><font>exclusion guidelines based on a
company’s compliance with the </font><font>United Nations Global Compact (</font><font>“</font><font>UNGC</font><font>”</font><font>) provided by </font><font>Sustainalytics. Effective with the index review in October 2024, </font><font>the Index Provider will utilize measurements from
S&amp;P Global </font><font>Business Involvement Screens when monitoring the company </font><font>exclusion criteria related to
business activity (e.g., controversial </font><font>weapons, tobacco, thermal coal, etc.). Lastly, the Index Provider
</font><font>uses RepRisk, a leading provider of business intelligence on </font><font>environmental, social, and governance risks,
for screening and </font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div>

<div> <div><font>analysis of controversies related to
companies within the index. </font><font>Companies without coverage are ineligible for index inclusion until </font><font>they
receive such coverage.</font></div> <div> <div><font>The Index Provider defines clean energy exposure
scores </font><font>(</font><font>“</font><font>exposure
scores</font><font>”</font><font>) for each company based on its primary </font><font>business. The Index Provider also calculates carbon-to-revenue </font><font>footprint standards and excludes those companies with a
high </font><font>carbon-to-revenue footprint standard score determined by the </font><font>Index Provider. All remaining companies
with a high exposure </font><font>score are selected for the Underlying Index. If the Underlying </font><font>Index does not have 100
constituents, companies with lower </font><font>exposure scores are selected, based on market-capitalization, </font><font>until a
constituent count of 100 is reached. If, after a constituent </font><font>count of 100 is reached, the weighted average exposure score is </font><font>lower than certain thresholds, companies with low exposure </font><font>scores will be removed from the Underlying Index. Therefore,
</font><font>while the Underlying Index targets a constituent count of 100 </font><font>securities, it may be comprised of greater or
fewer than 100 </font><font>securities. As of April 30, 2024, there were 100 constituents in </font><font>the Underlying
Index.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Constituents are weighted based on a product of the
constituent’s </font><font>float-adjusted market capitalization and exposure score, with </font><font>weights of constituents
capped based on their exposure score </font><font>and liquidity weight. The Index Provider determines liquidity </font><font>weight
based on the relative six-month median daily value of a </font><font>security compared to that measure for the overall index. In </font><font>addition, the cumulative weight of all stocks within the Underlying </font><font>Index that have a weight greater than 4.5% cannot
exceed 40%. As </font><font>of April 30, 2024, the Underlying Index comprised securities of </font><font>companies in the following
countries or regions: Austria, Brazil, </font><font>Canada, Chile, China, Denmark, France, Germany, India, </font><font>Indonesia,
Israel, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, </font><font>South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, and the U.S. The </font><font>Underlying Index may include large-, mid- or small-capitalization </font><font>companies. As of April 30, 2024, a significant portion
of the </font><font>Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the </font><font>industrials, technology and
utilities industries or sectors. The </font><font>components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over
</font><font>time.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>BFA uses an indexing approach to try to achieve the Fund’s </font><font>investment objective. Unlike many investment companies,
the </font><font>Fund does not try to
</font><font>“</font><font>beat</font><font>”</font><font> the index it tracks and does not seek </font><font>temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear </font><font>overvalued.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will substantially </font><font>outperform the
Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the </font><font>risks of active management, such as poor security selection.
</font><font>Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax </font><font>performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover
low in </font><font>comparison to actively managed investment companies.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage </font><font>the Fund. </font><font>“</font><font>Representative sampling</font><font>”</font><font> is an indexing strategy that </font><font>involves investing in a representative sample of securities that </font><font>collectively has an investment profile similar to that of an </font><font>applicable underlying index. The securities selected are
expected </font><font>to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on </font><font>factors such as market
capitalization and industry weightings), </font><font>fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) </font></div> </div> </div>
<div> <div><font>and liquidity measures similar to those of
an applicable underlying </font><font>index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the </font><font>Underlying
Index.</font></div> <div> <div><font>The Fund generally will invest at least 80% of its assets in the
</font><font>component securities of its Underlying Index and in investments </font><font>that have economic characteristics that are
substantially identical </font><font>to the component securities of its Underlying Index (</font><font>i.e</font><font>., </font><font>depositary receipts representing securities of the Underlying </font><font>Index) and may invest up to 20% of its assets in certain futures, </font><font>options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,
including </font><font>shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as </font><font>well as in securities not
included in the Underlying Index, but </font><font>which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index.
</font><font>Cash and cash equivalent investments associated with a </font><font>derivative position will be treated as part of that
position for the </font><font>purposes of calculating the percentage of investments included in </font><font>the Underlying Index.
The Fund seeks to track the investment </font><font>results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the
</font><font>Fund.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of the </font><font>value of the Fund's total assets (including the value
of any </font><font>collateral received).</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>The Underlying Index is a product of the Index Provider, which </font><font>is</font><font> </font><font>independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider </font><font>determines the composition and relative weightings of the </font><font>securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information
</font><font>regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Industry Concentration Policy.</font><font> The Fund will concentrate its </font><font>investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or
more of its total assets) in a </font><font>particular industry or group of industries to approximately the </font><font>same extent
that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For </font><font>purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government
</font><font>(including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase </font><font>agreements collateralized by U.S. government
securities are not </font><font>considered to be issued by members of any industry.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Summary of Principal Risks</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your </font><font>investment in the Fund,
and the Fund's performance could trail </font><font>that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks,
</font><font>including the principal risks noted below,any of which may </font><font>adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per
share (</font><font>“</font><font>NAV</font><font>”</font><font>), </font><font>trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment </font><font>objective. Certain key risks are prioritized below (with others </font><font>following in alphabetical order), but the relative
significance of any </font><font>risk is difficult to predict and may change over time. You should </font><font>review each risk
factor carefully.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Clean Energy
Companies Risk</font><font>. </font><font>Clean energy companies may be </font><font>highly dependent on government subsidies, contracts with </font><font>government entities, and the successful development of new and
</font><font>proprietary technologies. Seasonal weather conditions, </font><font>fluctuations in the supply of and demand for clean
energy </font><font>products, changes in energy prices, and political events may </font><font>cause fluctuations in the performance
of clean energy companies </font><font>and the prices of their securities.</font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Equity
Securities Risk</font><font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes </font><font>in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other </font><font>asset classes. The value of a security may decline
for a number of </font><font>reasons that may directly relate to the issuer as well as due to </font><font>general industry or market
conditions. Common stock is </font><font>subordinated to preferred securities and debt in a company’s </font><font>capital
structure. Common stock has the lowest priority, and the </font><font>greatest risk, with respect to dividends and any liquidation </font><font>payments in the event of an issuer’s bankruptcy.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Market Risk</font><font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due </font><font>to short-term market movements and over longer periods during </font><font>more prolonged market downturns. Local, regional or global </font><font>events such as war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or other
public </font><font>health issues, recessions, the prospect or occurrence of a </font><font>sovereign default or other financial
crisis, or other events could </font><font>have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments and </font><font>could
result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s </font><font>NAV.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Index-Related Risk. </font><font>The Index Provider may rely on
various </font><font>sources of information to assess the criteria of components of the </font><font>Underlying Index, including
information that may be based on </font><font>assumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund nor BFA can offer </font><font>assurances
that the Index Provider’s methodology or sources of </font><font>information will provide an accurate assessment of included </font><font>components. Errors in index data, index computations or the </font><font>construction of the Underlying Index in accordance with its
</font><font>methodology may occur, and the Index Provider may not identify </font><font>or correct them promptly or at all, which
may have an adverse </font><font>impact on the Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market </font><font>conditions or other unforeseen
circumstances (such as natural </font><font>disasters, political unrest or war) may impact the Index Provider </font><font>or a
third-party data provider and could cause the Index Provider </font><font>to postpone a scheduled rebalance. This could cause the </font><font>Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Asset Class Risk.</font><font> The securities and other assets in the </font><font>Underlying Index or in the Fund’s portfolio may underperform in </font><font>comparison to financial markets generally, a
particular financial </font><font>market, another index, or other asset classes.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.</font><font> 
An </font><font>“</font><font>Authorized
</font><font>Participant</font><font>”</font><font> is a member or
participant of a clearing agency </font><font>registered with the SEC, which has a written agreement with the </font><font>Fund or
one of its service providers that allows the Authorized </font><font>Participant to place orders for the purchase and redemption of </font><font>creation units (</font><font>“</font><font>Creation Units</font><font>”</font><font>). Only an Authorized Participant </font><font>may
engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with </font><font>the Fund. There are a limited number of institutions that may act </font><font>as Authorized Participants for the Fund, including on an agency </font><font>basis on behalf of other market participants. No
Authorized </font><font>Participant is obligated to engage in creation or redemption </font><font>transactions. To the extent that
Authorized Participants exit the </font><font>business or do not place creation or redemption orders for the </font><font>Fund and no
other Authorized Participant places orders, Fund </font><font>shares are more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV </font><font>and possibly face trading halts or delisting.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Concentration Risk.</font><font> The Fund may be susceptible to an </font><font>increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that </font><font>affect the Fund’s investments more than the
market as a whole, </font><font>to the extent that the Fund’s investments are concentrated in the </font></div> </div> </div>
<div> <div><font>securities or other assets of one or more
issuers, countries or </font><font>other geographic units, markets, industries, project types, or </font><font>asset
classes.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Currency Risk</font><font>.</font><font> Because the Fund’s NAV is determined in U.S. </font><font>dollars, the NAV could decline if the currency of a non-U.S. market </font><font>in which the Fund invests depreciates against the
U.S. dollar or if </font><font>there are delays or limits on the repatriation of foreign currency. </font><font>Currency exchange
rates can be very volatile and can change </font><font>quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund’s NAV may
</font><font>change quickly and without warning. In addition, the Fund may </font><font>incur costs in connection with conversions
between U.S. dollars </font><font>and foreign currencies.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Custody Risk</font><font>.</font><font> Less developed securities markets are more likely </font><font>to experience problems with the clearing and settlement of </font><font>trades, as well as the custody of securities and other assets by </font><font>local banks, agents and depositories. These issues may
have an </font><font>adverse impact on the Fund, including losses or delays in </font><font>payments, delivery or recovery of money
or other assets.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Cybersecurity
Risk</font><font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic </font><font>systems of the Fund, its adviser, distributor,</font><font> </font><font>Index Provider, other </font><font>service providers, counterparties, or issuers of assets in which the </font><font>Fund invests may cause disruptions that negatively impact the </font><font>Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established
</font><font>business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking </font><font>to address system breaches or failures, there
are inherent </font><font>limitations in such plans and systems. The Fund cannot control </font><font>the cybersecurity plans and
systems of its service providers, </font><font>counterparties, and other third parties whose activities affect the </font><font>Fund.
In addition, cyber incidents may adversely impact the </font><font>issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, which may cause </font><font>such investments to lose value.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>ESG Risk. </font><font>To the extent that the Underlying Index uses criteria </font><font>related to the ESG characteristics of issuers, this may limit the </font><font>types and number of investment opportunities available
to the </font><font>Fund and, as a result, the Fund may underperform other funds </font><font>whose underlying index does not use ESG
criteria. The Underlying </font><font>Index’s use of ESG criteria may result in the Fund investing in, or
</font><font>allocating greater weight to, securities or market sectors that </font><font>underperform the market as a whole or
underperform other funds </font><font>that use ESG criteria. In addition, the use of representative </font><font>sampling may result
in divergence of the Fund’s overall ESG </font><font>characteristics or ESG risk from those of the Underlying Index.
</font><font>The Index Provider may evaluate security-level ESG data and, if </font><font>applicable, ESG objectives or constraints
that are relevant to the </font><font>Underlying Index only at index reviews or rebalances. Securities </font><font>included in the
Underlying Index may cease to meet the relevant </font><font>ESG criteria but may nevertheless remain in the Underlying Index </font><font>and the Fund until the next review or rebalance by the Index </font><font>Provider. As a result, certain securities in the Underlying
Index, or </font><font>the Underlying Index as a whole, may not meet the relevant ESG </font><font>objectives or constraints at all
times.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Industrial Companies
Risk.</font><font> Industrial companies face a number </font><font>of risks, including supply chain and distribution disruptions,
</font><font>business interruptions, product obsolescence, third-party vendor </font><font>risks, cyber attacks, trade disputes,
product recalls, liability </font><font>claims, scarcity of materials or parts, excess capacity, changes in </font><font>consumer
preferences, and volatility in commodity prices and </font><font>currencies. The performance of such companies may also be </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>affected by technological developments, labor
relations, </font><font>legislative and regulatory changes, government spending policies, </font><font>and changes in domestic and
international economies.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Issuer
Risk</font><font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the </font><font>performance of individual securities or other assets to which the </font><font>Fund has exposure. The value of securities or other
assets may </font><font>decline, or perform differently from the market as a whole, due to </font><font>changes in the financial
condition or credit rating of the issuer or </font><font>counterparty.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.</font><font> Large-capitalization </font><font>companies may be less able than smaller-capitalization </font><font>companies to adapt to changing market conditions and </font><font>competitive challenges. Large-capitalization companies may be </font><font>more mature and subject to more limited growth potential
</font><font>compared with smaller-capitalization companies. The </font><font>performance of large-capitalization companies could
trail the </font><font>overall performance of the broader securities markets.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Large Shareholder and Large-Scale Redemption Risk.</font><font>
Certain </font><font>shareholders of the Fund, including an Authorized Participant, a </font><font>third-party investor, the
Fund’s adviser, an affiliate of the Fund’s </font><font>adviser, a market maker, or another entity, may from time to time </font><font>own or manage a substantial amount of Fund shares, or may hold </font><font>their investment in the Fund for a limited period of
time. There can </font><font>be no assurance that any large shareholder or large group of </font><font>shareholders would not redeem
their investment. Redemptions of </font><font>a large number of Fund shares could require the Fund to dispose </font><font>of assets
to meet the redemption requests, which can accelerate </font><font>the realization of taxable income and/or capital gains and cause </font><font>the Fund to make taxable distributions to its shareholders earlier </font><font>than the Fund otherwise would have. In addition,
under certain </font><font>circumstances, non-redeeming shareholders may be treated as </font><font>receiving a disproportionately
large taxable distribution during or </font><font>with respect to such year. In some circumstances, the Fund may </font><font>hold a
relatively large proportion of its assets in cash in </font><font>anticipation of large redemptions, diluting its investment returns. </font><font>These large redemptions may also force the Fund to sell portfolio </font><font>securities or other assets when it might not otherwise
do so, </font><font>which may negatively impact the Fund’s NAV, increase the Fund’s </font><font>brokerage costs and/or
have a material effect on the market </font><font>price of Fund shares.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Management Risk</font><font>.</font><font> The Fund generally does not attempt to take </font><font>defensive positions under any market conditions, including </font><font>declining markets. As the Fund will not fully replicate the </font><font>Underlying Index and may hold securities or other assets not
</font><font>included in the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that the </font><font>investment strategy of BFA may not
produce the intended results. </font><font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have </font><font>a
high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or </font><font>that the Fund will achieve its investment objective.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Market Trading Risk</font><font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading </font><font>risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund </font><font>shares (including through a trading halt), losses from
trading in </font><font>secondary markets, periods of high volatility, and disruptions in </font><font>the process of creating and
redeeming Fund shares. Any of these </font><font>factors, among others, may lead to the Fund’s shares trading in
</font><font>the secondary market at a premium or discount to NAV or to the </font><font>intraday value of the Fund’s portfolio
holdings. If you buy Fund </font><font>shares at a time when the market price is at a premium to NAV or </font></div> </div> </div>
<div> <div><font>sell Fund shares at a time when the market
price is at a discount </font><font>to NAV, you may pay significantly more or receive significantly </font><font>less than the
underlying value of the Fund shares.</font></div> <div>
<div><font>Mid-Capitalization Companies
Risk</font><font>.</font><font> Compared to large-capitalization</font><font> companies, mid-capitalization companies may be </font><font>less stable and more susceptible to adverse developments. The </font><font>securities of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile </font><font>and less liquid than those of large-capitalization
companies. As a </font><font>result, the Fund’s share price may be more volatile than that of a </font><font>fund with a
greater investment in large-capitalization stocks.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>National Closed Market Trading Risk.</font><font> To the extent that </font><font>securities or other assets held by the Fund trade on foreign </font><font>exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the
</font><font>securities exchange on which the Fund’s shares trade is open, </font><font>there are likely to be deviations
between such asset’s current </font><font>price and its last quoted price (</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the quote from the closed </font><font>foreign market to the Fund). The impact of a closed foreign </font><font>market on the Fund is likely to be greater where a large portion of </font><font>the Fund’s holdings trade on a closed foreign
market or when a </font><font>foreign market is closed for unscheduled reasons. These </font><font>deviations could result in
premiums or discounts to the Fund’s </font><font>NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other funds.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Non-Diversification Risk</font><font>.</font><font> The Fund is classified as
</font><font>“</font><font>non-diversified.</font><font>”</font>
<font> This means that, compared with funds that are </font><font>classified as </font><font>“</font><font>diversified,</font><font>”</font><font> the Fund may invest a greater </font><font>percentage of its assets in securities or other instruments </font><font>representing a small number of issuers or counterparties and thus </font><font>may be more susceptible to the risks associated with
these </font><font>particular issuers or counterparties. As a result, the Fund's </font><font>performance may depend to a greater
extent on the performance </font><font>of a small number of issuers or counterparties, which may lead to </font><font>more volatility
in the Fund’s NAV.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Non-U.S.
Securities Risk</font><font>.</font><font> Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers </font><font>(including depositary receipts) are subject to different legal, </font><font>regulatory, political, economic, and market risks than
securities </font><font>issued by U.S. issuers. These risks include greater market </font><font>volatility, less market liquidity,
higher transaction costs, </font><font>expropriation, confiscatory taxation, adverse changes in foreign </font><font>investment or
currency control regulations, restrictions on the </font><font>repatriation of capital, and political instability. Non-U.S. issuers </font><font>may be subject to different accounting, audit and financial </font><font>reporting standards than U.S. issuers, and there may be less
</font><font>publicly available information about non-U.S. issuers. Foreign </font><font>market trading hours, different clearing and
settlement </font><font>procedures, and holiday schedules may limit the Fund's ability to </font><font>engage in portfolio
transactions. To the extent that investments </font><font>are made in a limited number of countries, events in those
</font><font>countries will have a more significant impact on the Fund. The </font><font>Fund is specifically exposed to </font><font>Asian Economic Risk </font><font>and </font><font>European Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Operational Risk</font><font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising </font><font>from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human </font><font>error, processing and communication errors, errors of the
Fund’s </font><font>service providers, counterparties or other third parties, failed or </font><font>inadequate processes and
technology or systems failures. The </font><font>Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through </font><font>controls
and procedures. However, these measures do not </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>address every possible risk and may be
inadequate to address </font><font>significant operational risks.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Reliance on Trading Partners Risk</font><font>.</font><font> The Fund invests in countries </font><font>or regions whose economies are heavily dependent upon trading </font><font>with key partners. Any reduction in this trading may have an </font><font>adverse impact on the Fund's investments. Through its
holdings of </font><font>securities of certain issuers, the Fund is specifically exposed to </font><font>Asian
Economic Risk,</font><font> </font><font>European Economic Risk</font><font> and </font><font>U.S.
</font><font>Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in China</font><font>. </font><font>Investments in Chinese securities, </font><font>including certain Hong Kong-listed and U.S.-listed securities, </font><font>subject the Fund to risks specific to China. China may be
subject </font><font>to considerable degrees of economic, political and social </font><font>instability. China is an emerging market
and demonstrates </font><font>significantly higher volatility from time to time in comparison to </font><font>developed markets. Over
the last few decades, the Chinese </font><font>government has undertaken reform of economic and market </font><font>practices and has
expanded the sphere of private ownership of </font><font>property in China. However, Chinese markets generally continue
</font><font>to experience inefficiency, volatility and pricing anomalies </font><font>resulting from governmental influence, a lack
of publicly available </font><font>information and/or political and social instability.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Chinese companies are also subject to the risk that Chinese </font><font>authorities can intervene
in their operations and structure. </font><font>Internal social unrest or confrontations with neighboring </font><font>countries,
including military conflicts in response to such events, </font><font>may also disrupt economic development in China and result in a </font><font>greater risk of currency fluctuations, currency non-convertibility, </font><font>interest rate fluctuations and higher rates of
inflation.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>China has experienced security concerns, such as
terrorism and </font><font>strained international relations. Additionally, China is alleged to </font><font>have participated in
state-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign </font><font>companies and foreign governments. Actual and threatened
</font><font>responses to such activity and strained international relations, </font><font>including purchasing restrictions,
sanctions, tariffs or </font><font>cyberattacks on the Chinese government or Chinese companies, </font><font>may impact China’s
economy and Chinese issuers of securities in </font><font>which the Fund invests. Incidents involving China's or the region's </font><font>security may cause uncertainty in Chinese markets and may </font><font>adversely affect the Chinese economy and the Fund's </font><font>investments. Export growth continues to be a major driver of </font><font>China's rapid economic growth. Reduction in spending on
Chinese </font><font>products and services, supply chain diversification, institution of </font><font>additional tariffs or other
trade barriers (including as a result of </font><font>heightened trade tensions or a trade war between China and the
</font><font>U.S. or in response to actual or alleged Chinese cyber activity) or </font><font>a downturn in any of the economies of
China's key trading </font><font>partners may have an adverse impact on the Chinese economy. </font><font>The Underlying Index may
include companies that are subject to </font><font>economic or trade restrictions (but not investment restrictions)
</font><font>imposed by the U.S. or other governments due to national </font><font>security, human rights or other concerns of such
government. So </font><font>long as these restrictions do not include restrictions on </font><font>investments, the Fund is generally
expected to invest in such </font><font>companies, consistent with its objective to track the performance </font><font>of the
Underlying Index.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Chinese companies, including Chinese companies that
are listed </font><font>on U.S. exchanges, are not subject to the same degree of </font></div> </div> </div>
<div> <div><font>regulatory requirements, accounting
standards or auditor </font><font>oversight as companies in more developed countries. As a result, </font><font>information about the
Chinese securities in which the Fund </font><font>invests may be less reliable or complete. Chinese companies with
</font><font>securities listed on U.S. exchanges may be delisted if they do not </font><font>meet U.S. accounting standards and
auditor oversight </font><font>requirements, which would significantly decrease the liquidity and </font><font>value of the
securities. There may be significant obstacles to </font><font>obtaining information necessary for investigations into or
</font><font>litigation against Chinese companies, and shareholders may have </font><font>limited legal remedies. The Fund does not
select investments </font><font>based on investor protection considerations.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries</font><font>. </font><font>The Fund’s </font><font>investment in  developed country issuers will subject the Fund to </font><font>legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and other </font><font>risks associated with developed countries.
Developed countries </font><font>tend to represent a significant portion of the global economy and </font><font>have generally
experienced slower economic growth than some </font><font>less developed countries. Certain developed countries have
</font><font>experienced security concerns, such as war, terrorism and </font><font>strained international relations. Incidents
involving a country’s or </font><font>region’s security may cause uncertainty in its markets and may
</font><font>adversely affect its economy and the Fund’s investments. In </font><font>addition, developed countries may be
adversely impacted by </font><font>changes to the economic conditions of certain key trading </font><font>partners, regulatory
burdens, debt burdens and the price or </font><font>availability of certain commodities.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets</font><font>.</font><font> Investments in emerging </font><font>market
issuers may be subject to a greater risk of loss than </font><font>investments in issuers located or operating in more developed </font><font>markets. Emerging markets may be more likely to experience </font><font>inflation, social instability, political turmoil or rapid
changes in </font><font>economic conditions than more developed markets. Companies in </font><font>many emerging markets are not
subject to the same degree of </font><font>regulatory requirements, accounting standards or auditor </font><font>oversight as
companies in more developed countries, and as a </font><font>result, information about the securities in which the Fund invests </font><font>may be less reliable or complete. Emerging markets often have </font><font>less reliable securities valuations and greater risk
associated with </font><font>custody of securities than developed markets. There may be </font><font>significant obstacles to
obtaining information necessary for </font><font>investigations into or litigation against companies and </font><font>shareholders
may have limited legal remedies. The Fund does not </font><font>select investments based on investor protection considerations.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in Saudi Arabia</font><font>.</font><font> Investing in Saudi Arabian
</font><font>issuers subjects the Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, </font><font>security, and economic risks that are
specific to Saudi Arabia. The </font><font>economy of Saudi Arabia is dominated by petroleum exports. A </font><font>sustained
decrease in petroleum prices could have a negative </font><font>impact on all aspects of the economy. Investments in the
</font><font>securities of Saudi Arabian issuers involve risks not typically </font><font>associated with investments in securities
of issuers in more </font><font>developed countries, which may negatively affect the value of the </font><font>Fund’s
investments. Such heightened risks may include, among </font><font>others, the expropriation and/or nationalization of assets, </font><font>restrictions on and government intervention in international trade, </font><font>confiscatory taxation, political instability,
including authoritarian </font><font>and/or military involvement in governmental decision-making, </font><font>armed conflict, crime
and instability as a result of religious, ethnic </font></div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

<div> <div><font>and/or socioeconomic unrest. Instability in
the Middle East region </font><font>could adversely impact the economy of Saudi Arabia, and there is </font><font>no assurance of
political stability in Saudi Arabia.</font></div> <div> <div><font>The ability of foreign investors to
invest in the securities of Saudi </font><font>Arabian companies could be restricted by the Saudi Arabian </font><font>government at
any time, and unforeseen risks could materialize </font><font>with respect to foreign ownership of such securities. There are a </font><font>number of ways to conduct transactions in equity securities in the </font><font>Saudi Arabian market. The Fund generally expects to
transact in a </font><font>manner so that it is not limited by Saudi Arabian regulations to a </font><font>single broker. However,
there may be a limited number of brokers </font><font>who can provide services to the Fund, which may have an adverse
</font><font>impact on the prices, quantity or timing of Fund transactions.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Risk of Investing in the U.S</font><font>.</font><font> Investing in U.S. issuers subjects </font><font>the Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, and </font><font>economic risks that are specific to the U.S. Certain changes in the </font><font>U.S., such as a weakening of the U.S. economy or a
decline in its </font><font>financial markets, may have an adverse effect on U.S. issuers.</font></div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Securities Lending Risk. </font><font>The Fund may engage in
securities </font><font>lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may </font><font>lose money because the borrower
of the loaned securities fails to </font><font>return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund could </font><font>also
lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral </font><font>provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any </font><font>investments made with cash collateral. These events could also </font><font>trigger adverse tax consequences for the
Fund.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Semiconductor Companies
Risk</font><font>.</font><font> The semiconductor industry is </font><font>characterized by rapid technological change and product </font><font>obsolescence, cyclical market patterns, price erosion, periods
of </font><font>over-capacity and production shortages, variations in </font><font>manufacturing costs and yields, and significant
expenditures for </font><font>capital equipment and product development. Semiconductor </font><font>companies depend significantly on
third-party suppliers and the </font><font>availability of raw materials and may be adversely affected by </font><font>supply chain
disruptions. They also may be adversely affected by </font><font>the loss or impairment of intellectual property rights.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Small-Capitalization Companies Risk</font><font>.</font><font> Compared to mid- and
</font><font>large-capitalization companies, small-capitalization companies </font><font>may be less stable and more susceptible to
adverse </font><font>developments. The securities of small-capitalization companies </font><font>may be more volatile and less liquid
than those of mid- and large-capitalization</font><font> companies. As a result, the Fund’s share price may </font><font>be
more volatile than that of a fund with a greater investment in </font><font>large- or mid-capitalization stocks.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Technology Companies Risk</font><font>.</font><font> Technology companies and
</font><font>companies that rely heavily on technological advances may have </font><font>limited product lines, markets, financial
resources, supply chains </font><font>and personnel. These companies typically face intense </font><font>competition, potentially
rapid product obsolescence and changes </font><font>in product cycles and customer preferences. They may face </font><font>unexpected
risks and costs associated with technological </font><font>developments, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. </font><font>Technology companies also depend heavily on intellectual </font><font>property rights and may be adversely affected by the loss or
</font><font>impairment of those rights. Technology companies may face </font><font>increased government scrutiny and may be subject
to adverse </font><font>government or legal action.</font></div> </div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Thematic Investing Risk.</font><font> The
Fund relies on the Index Provider to </font><font>identify securities that reflect the relevant themes and sub-themes</font><font>
for inclusion in the Underlying Index. There is no </font><font>guarantee that the Underlying Index or the Fund will reflect the </font><font>intended theme and sub-theme exposures. The Fund’s </font><font>performance may suffer if such securities are not correctly
</font><font>identified, if a theme or sub-theme develops in an unexpected </font><font>manner, or if securities in the Underlying
Index do not benefit </font><font>from the development of a theme or sub-theme. The Fund’s </font><font>performance may also be
impacted if securities that are not </font><font>related to the theme or sub-theme are included in the Underlying
</font><font>Index.</font></div> <div> <div><font>Tracking Error Risk</font><font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to </font><font>“</font><font>tracking
error,</font><font>”</font><font>
</font><font>which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of </font><font>the Underlying Index. Tracking error
may occur due to a number of </font><font>factors, including differences between the securities and other </font><font>assets held in
the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the </font><font>Underlying Index; differences in the timing and methodologies </font><font>used to value securities and other assets; transaction costs and </font><font>other expenses incurred by the Fund that the Underlying
Index </font><font>does not incur; the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash; differences </font><font>in the timing of the accrual
or the valuation of dividends or </font><font>interest received by the Fund or distributions paid to Fund </font><font>shareholders;
tax gains or losses; the requirements for the Fund </font><font>to maintain pass-through tax treatment; portfolio transactions </font><font>carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to </font><font>shareholders; the acceptance of custom baskets; changes to
the </font><font>Underlying Index; and impacts to the Fund of complying with </font><font>certain regulatory requirements or limits.
Tracking error risk may </font><font>be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other </font><font>unusual market
conditions. ETFs that track indexes with </font><font>significant exposure to emerging markets may experience higher
</font><font>tracking error than ETFs that do not track such indexes.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Utility Companies Risk.</font><font> The utilities sector is generally subject to </font><font>significant government regulation and oversight, including </font><font>restrictions on rates as well as environmental and other
</font><font>regulations. Utility companies also may face risks related to, </font><font>among other things, natural disasters, cyber
or other attacks, </font><font>capital project funding, energy price volatility and increased </font><font>competition.</font></div>
</div> <div> <div><font>Valuation Risk</font><font>.</font><font> The price that the Fund could receive upon the </font><font>sale (or other disposition) of a security or other asset may differ </font><font>from the Fund’s valuation of the security or
other asset, </font><font>particularly for securities or other assets that trade in low volume </font><font>or volatile markets or
that are valued using a fair value </font><font>methodology. The price received by the Fund also may differ from </font><font>the
value used by the Underlying Index. In addition, the value of </font><font>the securities or other assets in the Fund’s portfolio may change </font><font>on days or during time periods when investors are not able to </font><font>purchase or sell Fund shares. Authorized Participants that
create </font><font>or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund is holding fair-valued</font><font> securities or other assets may
receive fewer or more </font><font>shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would </font><font>have received had the
securities or other assets not been fair </font><font>valued or been valued using a different methodology. The ability to
</font><font>value investments may be impacted by technological issues or </font><font>errors by pricing services or other
third-party service providers.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div>

Information</font></div> <div> <div><font>The performance information below illustrates how the
Fund’s performance has varied over different periods and provides some indication </font><font>of the risks of investing in the Fund. The bar chart shows how the performance of the Fund
has varied from one calendar year to another </font><font>over the periods shown. The table compares the Fund’s performance to that of an appropriate broad-based securities market index
and </font><font>the Underlying Index. Fund returns assume the reinvestment of any dividends and distributions.

<div><font>The Fund has added this broad-based index in response to new regulatory
requirements.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div><font>After-tax returns in the table above are calculated using the historical highest individual U.S. federal marginal income tax rates and do not </font><font>reflect the impact of state or local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor’s tax situation and may differ from those shown, </font><font>and after-tax returns shown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors or investors who hold shares through tax-deferred arrangements, </font><font>such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts (</font><font>“</font><font>IRAs</font><font>”</font><font>). Fund returns after taxes on
distributions and sales of Fund shares are </font><font>calculated assuming that an investor has sufficient capital gains of the same character from other investments to offset any capital
losses </font><font>from the sales of Fund shares. As a result, Fund returns after taxes on distributions and sales of Fund shares may exceed Fund returns </font><font>before taxes and/or returns after taxes on distributions.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div><font>Investment Adviser.</font><font> BlackRock Fund Advisors.</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>Portfolio Managers.</font><font> Jennifer Hsui, Greg Savage and Paul </font><font>Whitehead (the </font><font>“</font><font>Portfolio Managers</font><font>”</font><font>) are primarily responsible for </font><font>the
day-to-day management of the Fund. Each Portfolio Manager </font><font>supervises a portfolio management team. Ms. Hsui, Mr. Savage </font><font>and Mr. Whitehead have been Portfolio Managers of the Fund </font><font>since 2012, 2008 and 2022, respectively.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only be </font><font>bought and sold in the secondary market through a broker-dealer. </font><font>Because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than
at NAV, </font><font>shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less </font><font>than NAV (a discount). An investor
may incur costs attributable to </font><font>the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay </font><font>to
purchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller </font><font>is willing to accept for shares of the Fund (ask) when buying or </font><font>selling shares in the secondary market (the
</font><font>“</font><font>bid-ask spread</font><font>”</font><font>).</font></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div>
<div><font>Tax Information</font></div> <div>
<div><font>The Fund intends to make distributions that may be taxable to you </font><font>as ordinary income
or capital gains, unless you are investing </font><font>through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an
</font><font>IRA, in which case, your distributions generally will be taxed when </font><font>withdrawn.</font></div> </div>
<div> <div><font>Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial </font><font>Intermediaries</font></div> </div> <div> <div><font>If you purchase shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer or </font><font>other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or
other related </font><font>companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and </font><font>presentations, educational
training programs, conferences, the </font><font>development of technology platforms and reporting systems or </font><font>other
services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These </font><font>payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the </font><font>broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to </font><font>recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your </font><font>salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more </font><font>information.</font></div> </div> </div>
