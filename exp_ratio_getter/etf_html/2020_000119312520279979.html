Prospectus entitled “A Further Discussion of Other Risks” is amended to add the following: </b></font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>LIBOR Risk</b>. The Fund may be exposed to
financial instruments that are tied to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) to determine payment obligations, financing terms, hedging strategies or investment value. The Fund’s investments may pay interest at floating rates
based on LIBOR or may be subject to interest caps or floors based on LIBOR. The Fund may also obtain financing at floating rates based on LIBOR. Derivative instruments utilized by the Fund may also reference LIBOR. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">In 2017, the head of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority announced a desire to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021, and it is expected
that LIBOR will cease to be published after that time. The Fund may have investments linked to other interbank offered rates, such as the Euro Overnight Index Average (“EONIA”), which may also cease to be published. Various financial
industry groups have begun planning for the transition away from LIBOR, but there are challenges to converting certain securities and transactions to a new reference rate (<i>e.g.</i>, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), which
is intended to replace the U.S. dollar LIBOR). </font></p> <p><font size="2">Neither the effect of the LIBOR transition process nor its ultimate success can yet be known. The
transition process might lead to increased volatility and illiquidity in markets for, and reduce the effectiveness of new hedges placed against, instruments whose terms currently include LIBOR. While some existing LIBOR-based instruments may
contemplate a scenario where LIBOR is no longer available by providing for an alternative rate-setting methodology, there may be </font></p>

<p><font size="2">
significant uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of any such alternative methodologies to replicate LIBOR. Not all existing <font>LIBOR-based</font> instruments may
have alternative rate-setting provisions and there remains uncertainty regarding the willingness and ability of issuers to add alternative rate-setting provisions in certain existing instruments. In addition, a liquid market for newly-issued
instruments that use a reference rate other than LIBOR still may be developing. There may also be challenges for the Fund to enter into hedging transactions against such newly-issued instruments until a market for such hedging transactions develops.
All of the aforementioned may adversely affect the Fund’s performance or NAV.<b> </b> </font></p>
