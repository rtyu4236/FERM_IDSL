<p><b>iShares<sup>®</sup><sup> </sup> </b></p> <p><b>iShares Trust and iShares U.S. ETF Trust (each, a “Trust” and together, the
“Trusts”) </b></p> <p><b>Supplement dated June 7, 2024 </b></p>
<p><b>to the currently effective Summary Prospectus, Prospectus, </b></p>
<p><b>and Statement of Additional Information for the </b></p>
<p><b>iShares Currency Hedged MSCI Germany ETF (HEWG), iShares Gold Strategy ETF (IAUF), iShares International Developed Property ETF (WPS), iShares MSCI
Intl Size Factor ETF (ISZE), iShares USD Systematic Bond ETF (USBF), and iShares Virtual Work and Life Multisector ETF (IWFH) </b></p> <p><b>(each, a
“Fund” and collectively, the “Funds”) </b></p> <p>The Board of Trustees of each Trust approved a proposal to close and liquidate the Funds. After market
close on August 12, 2024, the Funds will cease the creation and redemption of Creation Units. Trading in the Funds will be halted prior to market open on August 13, 2024. Proceeds of the liquidation are scheduled to be sent to Fund
shareholders on or around August 15, 2024 (the “Liquidation Date”). </p> <p>While each Fund is in the process of liquidating its portfolio, which is
anticipated to commence prior to August 12, 2024, the Fund will hold cash and securities that will not be consistent with its investment objective and strategies and is likely to incur higher tracking error than is typical for the Fund.
Furthermore, the Trusts cannot assure that there will be a trading market for Fund shares between market close on August 12, 2024 and the Liquidation Date because Fund shares will not be traded on the primary listing exchange identified in the
Prospectus for each Fund (each a “Listing Exchange”) during that period. </p> <p>Shareholders may sell their holdings of each Fund on its Listing Exchange until
market close on August 12, 2024 and may incur the usual and customary brokerage commissions associated with the sale of Fund shares. As of the Liquidation Date, shares of the Fund will be individually redeemed. If you hold Fund shares on the
Liquidation Date, the Fund will automatically redeem your shares for cash based on the net asset value of the Fund as of the close of business on August 12, 2024, which will include any dividends or distributions calculated as of that date.
</p> <p>If you are subject to U.S. federal income tax, the liquidation of a Fund will result in one or more taxable events for you. A sale or exchange of Fund shares prior
to the Liquidation Date will generally give rise to a capital gain or loss to you for federal income tax purposes. In connection with the liquidation, a Fund may declare taxable distributions of its investment income or taxable distributions of its
net capital gain. Any liquidation proceeds paid to you should generally be treated as received by you in exchange for your shares and will therefore generally give rise to a capital gain or loss, depending on your tax basis. Please consult your
personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences. </p> <p>If you have any questions, please call
