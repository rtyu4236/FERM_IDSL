<p><font size="2"><b>The first paragraph of the section of the Summary Prospectus and Prospectus entitled “Principal Investment Strategies” is deleted in its entirety and
replaced with the following: </b></font></p> <p><font size="2">The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the S&amp;P Global 1200 Consumer Discretionary
(Sector) Capped Index</font><font size="1"><sup>TM</sup></font><font size="2"> (the “Underlying Index”), which is designed
to measure the performance of global equities in the consumer discretionary sector. The Underlying Index uses a capping methodology to limit the weight of the securities of any single issuer (as determined by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices (the
“Index Provider” or “SPDJI”)) to a maximum of 10% of the Underlying Index. </font></p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p><font size="2">
Additionally, the capping methodology limits the sum of the weights of the securities of all issuers that individually constitute more than 5% of the weight of the Underlying Index to a maximum
of 25% of the weight of the Underlying Index in the aggregate. In order to implement this capping methodology, the Underlying Index constrains at quarterly rebalance: (i) the weight of any single issuer to a maximum of 10%, and (ii) the
aggregate weight of all issuers that individually exceed 4.50% of the index weight to maximum of 22.50%. Between scheduled quarterly index reviews, the Underlying Index is rebalanced at the end of any day on which the following constraints are
breached: 25.00% for all issuers that individually represent more than 5.00% of the weight of the Underlying Index. In implementing this capping methodology, SPDJI may consider two or more companies as belonging to the same issuer where there is
reasonable evidence of common control. </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b><i>Change in the Fund’s “Summary of Principal Risks” </i></b></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b>The section of the Summary Prospectus and Prospectus entitled “Summary of Principal Risks” is amended to add the following on page <font>S-6</font> with the following: </b></font></p> <p><font size="2"><b><i><font>Non-U.S.</font> Securities
Risk</i></b><b>.</b><b><i> </i></b>Investments in the securities of <font>non-U.S.</font> issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those <font>non-U.S.</font> markets, such
as heightened risks of inflation or nationalization. The Fund may lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting issuers of <font>non-U.S.</font> securities or
<font>non-U.S.</font> markets. In addition, <font>non-U.S.</font> securities markets may trade a small number of securities and may be unable to respond effectively to increases in trading
volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b><i>Change in the Fund’s “A Further Discussion
of Principal Risks” </i></b></font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>The section of the Prospectus entitled “A Further Discussion of Principal Risks” is amended to delete
“European Economic Risk.” </b></font></p> <p><font size="2"><b><i>Change in the Fund’s “A Further Discussion of Other Risks” </i></b></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b>The section of the Prospectus entitled “A Further Discussion of Other Risks” is amended to add the following: </b></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><b>European Economic Risk. </b>The European Union (the “EU”) requires compliance by member states with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest
rates and debt levels, as well as fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every country in Europe, including those countries that are not members of the EU. Changes in
</font></p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p><font size="2">
imports or exports, changes in governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro (the common currency of certain EU countries), the default or threat of default by
an EU member state on its sovereign debt and/or an economic recession in an EU member state may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of EU member states and their trading partners. The European financial markets have historically
experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns or rising government debt levels in several European countries, including, but not limited to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal,
Spain and Ukraine. These events have adversely affected the exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect European countries. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">Responses to financial problems by European governments, central banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results,
may result in social unrest, may limit future growth and economic recovery or may have other unintended consequences. Further defaults or restructurings by governments and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on
economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. In a referendum held on June 23, 2016, the (United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) resolved
to leave the EU (“Brexit”). The referendum may introduce significant uncertainties and instability in the financial markets as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the EU. The outcome of negotiations remains uncertain. U.K. businesses are
increasingly preparing for a disorderly Brexit, and the consequences for European and U.K. businesses could be severe. The Fund will face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and consequences that may follow Brexit, including with respect
to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies
and financial markets. Brexit could also lead to legal uncertainty and politically divergent national laws and regulations as a new relationship between the U.K. and EU is defined and the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of
these effects of Brexit could adversely affect any of the companies to which the Fund has exposure and any other assets in which the Fund invests. The political, economic and legal consequences of Brexit are not yet known. In the short term,
financial markets may experience heightened volatility, particularly those in the U.K. and Europe, but possibly worldwide. The U.K. may be less stable than it has been in recent years, and investments in the U.K. may be difficult to value, or
subject to </font></p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p><font size="2">
greater or more frequent rises and falls in value. In the longer term, there is likely to be a period of significant political, regulatory and commercial uncertainty as the U.K. seeks to
negotiate its long-term exit from the EU. </font></p> <p><font size="2">Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain and the independence movement in Scotland, as
well as governmental or other responses to such movements, may also create instability and uncertainty in the region. In addition, the national politics of countries in the EU have been unpredictable and subject to influence by varying political
groups and ideologies. The governments of EU countries may be subject to change and such countries may experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments may result in sudden and significant investment
losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe also could impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could be significant and <font>far-reaching</font> and could adversely affect
the value and liquidity of the Fund’s investments. </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b><i>Change in the Fund’s “Construction and Maintenance of the Underlying
