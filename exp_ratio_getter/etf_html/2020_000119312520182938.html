<div>The iShares Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond ETF (the
“Fund”) seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of U.S. dollar-denominated investment-grade corporate bonds with remaining maturities between five and ten years.</div>
<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you
will incur if you own shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides that BFA will pay
all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage
commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses.</div>
<div>You may also incur usual and customary brokerage commissions
and other charges when buying or selling shares of the Fund, which are not reflected in the Example that follows:</div> <div>

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund
may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are
held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 26% of the
average value of its portfolio.</font></div> <div>Principal
Investment Strategies</div> <div>The Fund seeks to track the
investment results of the ICE BofA 5-10 Year US Corporate Index (the “Underlying Index”), which measures the performance of investment-grade corporate bonds of both U.S. and non-U.S. issuers that are U.S. dollar-denominated and publicly
issued in the U.S. domestic market and have a remaining maturity of greater than or equal to five years and less than ten years. As of February 29, 2020, there were 2,345 issues in the Underlying Index. As of February 29, 2020, a significant portion
of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the financials industry or sector. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index consists of investment-grade corporate
bonds of both U.S. and non-U.S. issuers that have a remaining maturity of greater than or equal to five years and less than ten years, have been publicly issued in the U.S. domestic market, and have $250 million or more of outstanding</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>face value. The Index Provider deems securities as “investment
grade” based on the average rating of Fitch Ratings, Inc. (BBB or better), Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (Baa or better) and/or Standard &amp; Poor's<sup>®</sup> Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of S&amp;P Global (BBB or better). In addition, the securities in the Underlying Index must be denominated in
U.S. dollars and must be fixed-rate. Excluded from the Underlying Index are equity-linked securities, securities in legal default, hybrid securitized corporates, Eurodollar bonds (U.S. dollar-denominated securities not issued in the U.S. domestic
market), taxable and tax-exempt U.S. municipal securities and dividends-received-deduction-eligible securities. The Underlying Index is market capitalization-weighted, and the securities in the Underlying Index are updated on the last calendar day
of each month. Under normal circumstances, the Fund will seek to maintain a weighted average maturity that is greater than three years and lower than 10 years. Weighted average maturity is a U.S. dollar-weighted average of the remaining term to
maturity of the underlying securities in the Fund’s portfolio.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve</div> </div> <div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>S-2</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio
turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to that of an applicable underlying index. The securities
selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market value and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability, duration, maturity, credit ratings and yield) and
liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally invests at least 90% of its assets in
securities of the Underlying Index. The Fund may invest the remainder of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as well as in
securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of
the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by ICE Data Indices, LLC or
its affiliates (collectively, the “Index Provider” or</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>“IDI”), which is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index
Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities), repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government
securities, and securities of state or municipal governments and their political subdivisions are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</font></div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share
(“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or other asset
classes.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant (as</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-3</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>defined in the <font>Creations and
Redemptions</font> section of this prospectus (the “Prospectus”)) may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption
transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (<font>i.e.,</font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants
exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units (as defined in the
<font>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</font> section of the Prospectus), Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant
concentration risk may be heightened for exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that have lower trading volumes.</div>
<div>Call Risk<font>. </font><font>During periods of falling interest rates, an issuer of a callable bond held by the Fund may “call” or repay the security before its stated maturity, and the Fund may have to reinvest the
proceeds in securities with lower yields, which would result in a decline in the Fund's income, or in securities with greater risks or with other less favorable features.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
investments are</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or
issuers, in a particular country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class.</div>
<div>Credit Risk<font>.</font><font> Debt issuers and other counterparties may be unable or unwilling to make timely interest and/or principal payments when due or otherwise honor their obligations. Changes in an issuer’s credit
rating or the market’s perception of an issuer’s creditworthiness may also adversely affect the value of the Fund’s investment in that issuer. The degree of credit risk depends on an issuer's or counterparty's financial condition
and on the terms of an obligation.</font></div> <div>Cybersecurity
Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, the Index Provider and other service providers, market
makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the Fund and its
shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the
cybersecurity plans and systems of the Fund’s Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>Financials Sector Risk<font>.</font><font> Performance of companies in the financials sector may be adversely impacted by many factors,</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-4</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>including, among others, changes in government regulations, economic
conditions, and interest rates, credit rating downgrades, and decreased liquidity in credit markets. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law. The
impact of changes in capital requirements and recent or future regulation of any individual financial company, or of the financials sector as a whole, cannot be predicted. In recent years, cyberattacks and technology malfunctions and failures have
become increasingly frequent in this sector and have caused significant losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund.</div>
<div>Geographic Risk<font>.</font><font> A natural disaster could occur in a geographic region in which the Fund invests, which could adversely affect the economy or the business operations of companies in the specific geographic region,
causing an adverse impact on the Fund's investments in, or which are exposed to, the affected region.</font></div>
<div>Income Risk.
<font>The Fund's income may decline if interest rates fall. This decline in income can occur because the Fund may subsequently invest in lower-yielding bonds as bonds in its portfolio mature, are near
maturity or are called, bonds in the Underlying Index are substituted, or the Fund otherwise needs to purchase additional bonds.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to
track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a
period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market conditions may cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance, which could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or
expected composition.</div> <div>Infectious Illness Risk. <font>An outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus has resulted in travel restrictions, disruption of healthcare systems, prolonged quarantines, cancellations,
supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings downgrades, defaults and other significant economic impacts. Certain markets have experienced temporary closures, extreme volatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity and increased
trading costs. These events will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and could impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities or cause elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV.
Other infectious illness outbreaks in the future may result in similar impacts.</font></div>
<div>Interest Rate Risk<font>.</font><font> During periods of very low or negative interest rates, the Fund may be unable to maintain positive returns or pay dividends to Fund shareholders. Very low or negative interest rates may magnify
interest rate risk. Changing interest rates, including rates that fall below zero, may have unpredictable effects on markets, result</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-5</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>in heightened market volatility and detract from the Fund’s performance
to the extent the Fund is exposed to such interest rates. Additionally, under certain market conditions in which interest rates are low and the market prices for portfolio securities have increased, the Fund may have a very low, or even negative
yield. A low or negative yield would cause the Fund to lose money in certain conditions and over certain time periods. An increase in interest rates will generally cause the value of securities held by the Fund to decline, may lead to heightened
volatility in the fixed-income markets and may adversely affect the liquidity of certain fixed-income investments, including those held by the Fund. The historically low interest rate environment heightens the risks associated with rising interest
rates.</div> <div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure.The Fund may be adversely affected if an issuer of underlying securities held by the Fund
is unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may cause the value of the securities to decline.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of
terrorism, the spread of infectious</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>illness or other public health issue, recessions, or other events could have a
significant impact on the Fund and its investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV.</div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruptions in
the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Issuers Risk. <font>Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers carry different risks from securities issued by U.S. issuers. These risks include differences in accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards, the
possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation, adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations, political instability, regulatory and economic differences, and potential restrictions on the flow of international
capital.</font></div> <div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors,
errors of the Fund’s service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However,
these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-6</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Privately Issued Securities Risk. <font>The Fund may invest in privately issued securities, including those that are normally purchased pursuant to Rule 144A or Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“1933 Act”). Privately issued securities are securities that have not been registered under the 1933 Act and as a result may be subject to legal restrictions on resale. Privately issued securities are generally not traded on established
markets. As a result of the absence of a public trading market, privately issued securities may be deemed to be illiquid investments, may be more difficult to value than publicly traded securities and may be subject to wide fluctuations in value.
Delay or difficulty in selling such securities may result in a loss to the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund invests in countries or regions whose economies are heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in this trading may have
an adverse impact on the Fund's investments.</font></div> <div>Risk of
Investing in Developed Countries<font>. </font><font>The Fund’s investment in developed country issuers may subject the Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security,
economic and other risks associated with developed countries. Developed countries tend to represent a significant portion of the global economy and have generally experienced slower economic growth than some less developed countries.</font></div>
</div> <div type="Block">
<div>Certain developed countries have experienced security concerns, such as
terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents involving a country’s or region’s security may cause uncertainty in its markets and may adversely affect its economy and the Fund’s investments. In addition, developed
countries may be adversely impacted by changes to the economic conditions of certain key trading partners, regulatory burdens, debt burdens and the price or availability of certain commodities.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Russia. <font>Investing in Russian securities involves significant risks, including legal, regulatory and economic risks that are specific to Russia. In addition, investing in Russian securities involves risks
associated with the settlement of portfolio transactions and loss of the Fund’s ownership rights in its portfolio securities as a result of the system of share registration and custody in Russia. A number of jurisdictions, including the U.S.,
Canada and the European Union (the “EU”), have imposed economic sanctions on certain Russian individuals and Russian corporate entities. Additionally, Russia is alleged to have participated in state-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign
companies and foreign governments. Actual and threatened responses to such activity, including purchasing restrictions, sanctions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Russian government or Russian companies, may impact Russia’s economy and Russian
issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Saudi
Arabia<font>.</font><font> The ability of foreign investors (such as the Fund) to invest in Saudi Arabian issuers is new and untested. Such ability could be restricted or
revoked by the Saudi</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-7</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Arabian government at any time, and unforeseen risks could materialize due to
foreign ownership in such securities. The economy of Saudi Arabia is dominated by petroleum exports. A sustained decrease in petroleum prices could have a negative impact on all aspects of the economy. Investments in securities of Saudi Arabian
issuers involves risks not typically associated with investments in securities of issuers in more developed countries that may negatively affect the value of the Fund’s investments. Such heightened risks may include, among others,
expropriation and/or nationalization of assets, restrictions on and government intervention in international trade, confiscatory taxation, political instability, including authoritarian and/or military involvement in governmental decision making,
armed conflict, crime and instability as a result of religious, ethnic and/or socioeconomic unrest. There remains the possibility that instability in the larger Middle East region could adversely impact the economy of Saudi Arabia, and there is no
assurance of political stability in Saudi Arabia.</div> <div>Saudi
Arabia Broker Risk.<font> There are a number of different ways of conducting transactions in equity securities in the Saudi Arabian market. The Fund generally expects to conduct its transactions in a
manner in which the Fund would not be limited by Saudi Arabian regulations to a single broker. However, there may be a limited number of brokers who can provide services to the Fund, which may have an adverse impact on the prices, quantity or timing
of Fund transactions.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in the U.S<font>.</font><font> Certain changes in the U.S. economy, such as when the U.S. economy weakens or</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>when its financial markets decline, may have an adverse effect on the
securities to which the Fund has exposure.</div> <div>Securities
Lending Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the
securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could
also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Some countries and regions in which the Fund invests have experienced security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents involving a country's or region's security may
cause uncertainty in its markets and may adversely affect its economy and the Fund's investments.</font></div>
<div>Structural Risk<font>.</font><font> The countries in which the Fund invests may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the Fund's
valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund's NAV), transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash,</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of distributions, the
requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, use of custom baskets, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying
with various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the
Underlying Index does not.</div> <div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or other asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the
value used by the Underlying Index, particularly for securities or other assets that trade in</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value
methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. In addition, the value of the securities or other assets in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the
Fund's shares. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund
not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</div> </div>

<td>After-tax returns in the
table above are calculated using the historical highest individual U.S. federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state or local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor’s tax situation and may differ from
those shown, and after-tax returns shown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors or investors who hold shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”). Fund returns after taxes
on distributions and sales of Fund shares are calculated assuming that an investor has sufficient capital gains of the same character from other investments to offset any capital losses from the sale of Fund shares. As a result, Fund returns after
taxes on distributions and sales of Fund shares may exceed Fund returns before taxes and/or returns after taxes on distributions. </td></tr></table> </div> <div>

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund are listed on
a national securities exchange. Most investors will buy and sell shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer. The price of Fund shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a
price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund will only issue or redeem shares that have been aggregated into blocks of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof (“Creation Units”) to Authorized Participants who
have entered into agreements with the Fund's distributor. The Fund generally will issue or redeem Creation Units in return for a designated portfolio of securities (and an amount of cash) that the Fund specifies each day.<br/> </div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make distributions that may be taxable to
you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA, in which case, your distributions generally will be taxed when withdrawn.</div>
<div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial
Intermediaries</div> <div>If you purchase shares of the Fund through
a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms
and reporting systems or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another
investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.<br/> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
