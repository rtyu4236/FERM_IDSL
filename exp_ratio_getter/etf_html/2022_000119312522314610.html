<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund
may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are
held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance. From inception (January 25, 2022) to the most recent fiscal year end, the Fund's portfolio
turnover rate was 17% of the average value of its portfolio.</font></div>
<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the MSCI
China Technology Sub-Industries Select Capped Index (the “Underlying Index”), which is designed to measure the investment performance of the stocks of large- and mid-capitalization Chinese companies that provide technology products
and/or technology-related services within certain sectors, as determined by MSCI, Inc. (the “Index Provider” or “MSCI”). The Underlying Index is a subset of the MSCI China Index (the “Parent Index”), which is a
free float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted index that is designed to measure the performance of equity securities in the top 85% of market capitalization of the Chinese equity securities markets. The Parent Index includes Chinese equity
securities known as A-shares, H-shares, B-shares, Red-Chips and P-Chips, as well as equity securities issued by Chinese companies listed outside of China (<font>e.g.</font>, American Depositary Receipts). As of August 31,
2022, large- and mid-capitalization A-shares are weighted in the Parent Index</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>at 16% of their free float-adjusted market capitalization. </div>
<div>The Underlying Index is constructed by selecting the
constituents of the Parent Index belonging to 27 technology-related GICS sub-industries (as identified by the Index Provider) across the following sectors: communication services, consumer discretionary, financials, health care, industrials and
information technology. At each quarterly review of the Underlying Index, the selected securities are weighted in proportion to their free float market capitalization available to investors outside of China. The weight of any single “group
entity” is capped at 4% of the Underlying Index. A group entity is a group of companies that operate as an affiliated corporate group but may separately issue listed securities. To determine “group entities,” MSCI analyzes
financial accounts of listed companies holding stakes of 20% or more in other listed companies to determine whether these stakes are controlling in nature. In certain cases, even in the absence of consolidated accounts, MSCI may consider two
companies as belonging to the same group entity where there is reasonable evidence of control based on other information.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is rebalanced on a quarterly basis. As of
August 31, 2022, there were 175 companies in the Underlying Index, and a significant portion of the Underlying Index was represented by securities of companies in the communication services, consumer discretionary and technology industries or
sectors. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time.</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover
low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to that of an applicable underlying index. The securities
selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar
to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 80% of its assets in
the component securities of its Underlying Index and in investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities of its Underlying Index (<font>i.e</font>., depositary
receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index) and may invest up to</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>20% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and
cash equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash equivalent
investments associated with a derivative position will be treated as part of that position for the purposes of calculating the percentage of investments included in the Underlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the
Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of
the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index and Parent Index are sponsored by MSCI,
which is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government
securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share
(“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or other asset
classes.</font></div> <div>Assets Under Management (AUM) Risk<font>.</font><font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this prospectus (the “Prospectus”)), a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its
investment for a specific period of time to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. Therecan be no assurance that any such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could
negatively impact the Fund.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant
Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in
creation and/or redemption transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the
business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV
and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened for exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or
instruments that have lower trading volumes.</div> <div>Calculation
Methodology Risk. <font>The Underlying Index relies on various sources of information to assess the criteria of securities included in the Underlying Index, including information that may be based on
assumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances that the Underlying Index’s calculation methodology or sources of information will provide an accurate assessment of included securities.</font></div>
<div>Communication Services Sector Risk.<font> Companies in the communications sector may be affected by industry competition, substantial capital requirements, government regulation, cyclicality of revenues and earnings, obsolescence of
communications products and services due to technological advancement, a potential decrease in the discretionary income of targeted individuals and changing consumer tastes and interests.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>S-4</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div>
<p>
<hr size="3"/> <div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's investments are
concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector, market segment or asset class.</div>
<div>Consumer Discretionary Sector Risk.<font> The consumer discretionary sector may be affected by changes in domestic and international economies, exchange and interest rates, supply chains, competition, consumers' disposable income, consumer
preferences, social trends and marketing campaigns.</font></div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the currency of a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are
delays or limits on repatriation of such currency. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may change quickly and without warning.</font></div>
<div>Custody Risk<font>.</font><font> Less developed securities markets are more likely to experience problems with the clearing and settling of trades, as well as the holding of securities by local banks, agents and
depositories.</font></div> <div>Cybersecurity Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, the Index Provider and other service providers, market makers,
Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the Fund and its
shareholders. While the Fund has established business</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system
breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems of the Fund’s Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized
Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is composed of common stocks, which generally
subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>Geographic Risk<font>.</font><font> A natural disaster could occur in China, which could adversely affect the economy or the business operations of companies located there, causing an adverse impact on the Fund's investments in, or which
are exposed to, China.</font></div> <div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of
the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-5</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div>
<p>
<hr size="3"/> <div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may
have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market conditions or other unforeseen circumstances (such as natural disasters, political unrest or war) may impact the Index Provider or a third-party data provider, and could cause
the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance. This could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition.</div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk. <font>A widespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in travel restrictions, disruption of healthcare services, prolonged quarantines, cancellations, supply chain
disruptions, business closures, lower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings downgrades, defaults and other significant economic, social and political impacts. Markets may experience temporary closures, extreme volatility, severe losses, reduced
liquidity and increased trading costs. Such events may adversely affect the Fund and its investments and may impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities or cause elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the
Fund's NAV. Despite the development of vaccines, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects cannot be predicted with certainty.</font></div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may
cause the value of the securities to decline.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market
conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more limited growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed
the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</div>
<div>Large Shareholder and Large-Scale Redemption Risk.<font> Certain shareholders, including an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, a market maker, or another entity, may from time
to time own or manage a substantial amount of Fund shares, or may invest in the Fund and hold their investment for a limited period of time. There can be no assurance that any large shareholder or large group of shareholders would not redeem their
investment. Redemptions of a large number of Fund shares could require the Fund to dispose of assets to meet the redemption requests, which can accelerate the realization of taxable income and/or capital gains and cause the Fund to make taxable
distributions to its shareholders earlier than the Fund otherwise would have. In addition, under certain circumstances, non-redeeming shareholders may be treated as receiving a disproportionately large taxable distribution during or with respect to
such year. In some circumstances, the Fund may hold a relatively large proportion of its assets in cash in anticipation of large redemptions, diluting its investment returns. These large redemptions may also force the Fund to sell portfolio
securities when it might not otherwise do so, which may negatively impact the</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-6</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div>
<p>
<hr size="3"/> <div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Fund’s NAV, increase the Fund’s brokerage costs and/or have a
material effect on the market price of the Fund shares.</div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The country in which the Fund invests may be subject to
considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant
impact on the Fund and its investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV.</font></div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruptions in
the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>Mid-Capitalization Companies
Risk<font>.</font><font> Compared to large-capitalization companies, mid-capitalization companies may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse developments. In addition,
the securities of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile and less liquid than those of large-capitalization companies.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities and/or other assets held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the Fund’s quote from the closed foreign market). The impact of a closed foreign market on the Fund is likely to be greater where a large portion of the Fund’s underlying securities
and/or other assets trade on that closed foreign market or when the foreign market is closed for unscheduled reasons. These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other
ETFs.</font></div> <div>Non-Diversification Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is classified as “non-diversified.” This means that, compared with other funds that are classified as “diversified,” the Fund
may invest a greater percentage of its assets in securities issued by or representing a small number of issuers. As a result, the Fund's performance may depend on the performance of a small number of issuers.</font></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Investments that track the value of Chinese issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in China, such as heightened risks of inflation or nationalization. The Fund may lose money due to
political, economic and geographic events affecting issuers of Chinese securities or Chinese markets. In addition, non-U.S. securities markets may trade a small number of securities and may be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading
volume,</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-7</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div>
<p>
<hr size="3"/> <div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at
times. The Fund is specifically exposed to <font>Asian Economic Risk</font>.</div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund’s service providers,
counterparties or other third parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible
risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Privatization Risk<font>.</font><font> The country in which the Fund invests has privatized, or has begun the process of privatizing, certain entities and industries. Privatized entities may lose money or be re-nationalized.</font></div>
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund invests in a country whose economy is heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in this trading may have an adverse
impact on the Fund's investments. Through its holdings of securities of certain issuers, the Fund is specifically exposed to </font><font>Asian Economic Risk, European Economic Risk </font><font>and </font><font>U.S. Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in China<font>.
</font><font>Investments in Chinese securities, including certain Hong Kong-listed and U.S.-listed securities, subject the Fund</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>to risks specific to China. China may be subject to considerable degrees of
economic, political and social instability. China is an emerging market and demonstrates significantly higher volatility from time to time in comparison to developed markets. Over the last few decades, the Chinese government has undertaken reform of
economic and market practices and has expanded the sphere of private ownership of property in China. However, Chinese markets generally continue to experience inefficiency, volatility and pricing anomalies resulting from governmental influence, a
lack of publicly available information and/or political and social instability.</div>
<div>Chinese companies are also subject to the risk that Chinese
authorities can intervene in their operations and structure. Internal social unrest or confrontations with neighboring countries, including military conflicts in response to such events, may also disrupt economic development in China and result in a
greater risk of currency fluctuations, currency non-convertibility, interest rate fluctuations and higher rates of inflation.</div>
<div>China has experienced security concerns, such as terrorism and
strained international relations. Additionally, China is alleged to have participated in state-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign companies and foreign governments. Actual and threatened responses to such activity and strained international
relations, including purchasing restrictions, sanctions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Chinese government or Chinese companies, may impact China’s economy and Chinese issuers of securities in which the Fund invests. Incidents involving
China's or the</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-8</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div>
<p>
<hr size="3"/> <div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>region's security may cause uncertainty in Chinese markets and may adversely
affect the Chinese economy and the Fund's investments. Export growth continues to be a major driver of China's rapid economic growth. Reduction in spending on Chinese products and services, institution of additional tariffs or other trade barriers
(including as a result of heightened trade tensions or a trade war between China and the U.S., or in response to actual or alleged Chinese cyber activity) or a downturn in any of the economies of China's key trading partners may have an adverse
impact on the Chinese economy.</div> <div>Chinese companies,
including Chinese companies that are listed on U.S. exchanges, are not subject to the same degree of regulatory requirements, accounting standards or auditor oversight as companies in more developed countries. As a result, information about the
Chinese securities in which the Fund invests may be less reliable or complete. Chinese companies with securities listed on U.S. exchanges may be delisted if they do not meet U.S. accounting standards and auditor oversight requirements, which would
significantly decrease the liquidity and value of the securities. There may be significant obstacles to obtaining information necessary for investigations into or litigation against Chinese companies, and shareholders may have limited legal
remedies. The Fund is not actively managed and does not select investments based on investor protection considerations.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets<font>.</font><font> Investments in China may be subject to a greater risk of loss than investments in issuers located or operating in more developed markets.</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Emerging markets may be more likely to experience inflation, political turmoil
and rapid changes in economic conditions than more developed markets. Companies in many emerging markets are not subject to the same degree of regulatory requirements, accounting standards or auditor oversight as companies in more developed
countries, and as a result, information about the securities in which the Fund invests may be less reliable or complete. Emerging markets often have less reliable securities valuations and greater risk associated with custody of securities than
developed markets. There may be significant obstacles to obtaining information necessary for investigations into or litigation against companies and shareholders may have limited legal remedies. The Fund is not actively managed and does not select
investments based on investor protection considerations.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Hong Kong. <font>Investments in Hong Kong issuers may subject the Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, and economic risk specific to Hong Kong. China is Hong Kong’s largest trading partner,
both in terms of exports and imports. Any changes in the Chinese economy, trade regulations or currency exchange rates, or a tightening of China’s control over Hong Kong, may have an adverse impact on Hong Kong’s economy.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-9</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div>
<p>
<hr size="3"/> <div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any
investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund.</div>
<div>Small Fund Risk. <font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain
conditions of the listing exchange. Any resulting liquidation of the Fund could cause the Fund to incur elevated transaction costs for the Fund and negative tax consequences for its shareholders.</font></div>
<div>Technology Sector Risk<font>.</font><font> Technology companies, including information technology companies, may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. Technology companies typically face intense competition
and potentially rapid product obsolescence. They are also heavily dependent on intellectual property rights and may be adversely affected by the loss or impairment of those rights. Companies in the technology sector are facing increased government
and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or regulatory action.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to “tracking error,” which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences
between the securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close
and the Fund's valuation of a security at the time of</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>calculation of the Fund's NAV), transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the
Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual or the valuation of dividends or interest received by the Fund or distributions paid to the Fund’s shareholders, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax
treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory
requirements, among other reasons. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does
not. Tracking error may occur due to differences between the methodologies used in calculating the value of the Underlying Index and determining the Fund’s NAV. INDEX ETFs THAT TRACK INDICES WITH SIGNIFICANT WEIGHT IN EMERGING MARKETS ISSUERS
MAY EXPERIENCE HIGHER TRACKING ERROR THAN OTHER INDEX ETFs THAT DO NOT TRACK SUCH INDICES.</div>
<div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or other asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index,
particularly for securities or other assets that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. In addition, the value of the securities or other
assets in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only be
bought and sold in the secondary market through a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An investor may incur costs
attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for shares of the Fund (ask) when buying or selling shares in the secondary
market (the “bid-ask spread”).<br/> </div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make distributions that may be taxable to
you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an individual retirement account (“IRA”), in which case, your distributions generally will be taxed when
withdrawn.</div> <div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial
Intermediaries</div> <div>If you purchase shares of the Fund through
a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms
and reporting systems or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another
investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.<br/> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
