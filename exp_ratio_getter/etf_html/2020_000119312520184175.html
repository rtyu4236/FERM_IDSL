50 billion, EUR 40 billion and JPY 5 trillion. Market size is defined as total outstanding market value of eligible securities. However, the Underlying Index excludes the U.S. Countries will no longer be eligible for index inclusion when
their market size falls below each of USD 25B, EUR 20B or JPY 2.5T, and stays below for three consecutive months. Countries are assigned a level of 0, 1 or 2, with 2 </font></p>

representing the highest level of accessibility. Market accessibility levels are assigned to each fixed-rate, local currency government market based on its fulfillment of a set of observable,
transparent criteria. The assessment takes place across four dimensions: (i) market, macroeconomic and regulatory environment; (ii) foreign exchange market structure; (iii) bond market structure; and (iv) global settlement and
custody. A local currency government debt market must have a value of 2 to satisfy the Parent Index accessibility criteria. </font></p> <p><font size="2">The minimum credit rating
for entry to the Underlying Index is <font>A-</font> by Standard &amp; Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“S&amp;P”) and A3 by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc (“Moody’s”). The credit
rating is first mapped to the S&amp;P rating. If a bond is not rated by S&amp;P but it is rated by Moody’s, the S&amp;P equivalent of the Moody’s rating is assigned. If a bond is split-rated (an investment- grade rating by one rating
agency and high-yield by the other), the S&amp;P equivalent of the investment-grade rating is assigned to the index quality. These ratings remain unchanged for the entire performance month. Constituents will be removed from the index when their
credit rating falls below <font>BBB-</font> by S&amp;P and below Baa3 by Moody’s. The Underlying Index includes bonds having a remaining maturity greater than one year and less than three years. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">To be included in the Underlying Index, the minimum issue size must exceed the following thresholds based on the local currency: CAD 2.5 billion (excludes Bank
of Canada Cash Management bond buybacks), DKK 20 billion, EUR 2.5 billion, NOK 20 billion, SEK 25 billion, GBP 2 billion (excludes Bank of England holdings), AUD 750 million, JPY 500 billion (20+ year
