500<sup>®</sup> ETF TRUST </b></p> <p>This Prospectus, relating to the SPDR<sup>®</sup> S&amp;P 500<sup>®</sup> ETF Trust (“SPDR 500 Trust” or the “Trust”), which is issued pursuant to Division 2 of Part 13
of the Securities and Futures Act 2001 of Singapore, has been lodged with and registered by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, who assumes no responsibility for its contents. </p>
<p>This Prospectus incorporates and is not valid without the attached U.S. Prospectus, dated January 28, 2022 issued by the Trust (“U.S.
Prospectus”). Terms defined in the U.S. Prospectus shall have the same meaning when used in this Prospectus. </p> <p>The Trust’s fiscal
year end is September 30. </p> <p>The Trust is a unit investment trust organised in the United States (“U.S.”), and is a single fund
that issues securities called “Units”, which represent an undivided ownership interest in the common stocks that are actually held by the Trust and make up the Trust’s Portfolio (the “Portfolio Securities”). The
“Portfolio” means the portfolio of the common stocks that are included in the Index (as defined below). The Trust seeks to provide investment results that, before expenses, correspond generally to the price and yield performance of the
S&amp;P 500<sup>®</sup> Index (the “Index”). The Trust’s Portfolio consists of substantially all of the component common stocks that comprise the Index, which are weighted in accordance
with the terms of the Trust Agreement (defined below). </p> <p>The Trust’s portfolio turnover ratio, calculated based on the lesser of
purchases or sales of underlying investments of the Trust and expressed as a percentage of daily average net asset value, was 4% during the most recent fiscal year. The Trust’s portfolio turnover ratio, expressed as a percentage of monthly
average value, can be found on page 2 of the U.S. Prospectus and in the “Financial Highlights” section on pages 23 to 24 of the U.S. Prospectus. </p>
<p>The top ten constituents (by weight) of the Trust as of January 27, 2022 are set out below: </p>

<p><b><a name="tx284625_3"></a>TRADING AND SETTLEMENT </b></p>
<p>Trust Units are listed for trading on the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited
<font>(“SGX-ST”)</font> where they may be bought and sold in the secondary market at any time during the trading day. Market prices for Units traded on the <font>SGX-ST</font>
are available on the <font>SGX-ST</font> website <i>https://www2.sgx.com/securities/securities-prices?code=etfs</i>. Units may also be purchased by Authorized Participants directly from the Trust in the U.S. by
placing orders with the U.S. Distributor, as facilitated through the Trustee, in a minimum unit, called a “Creation Unit”, of 50,000 Units or multiples thereof. Creation Units may also be redeemed through a tender to the Trustee in the
U.S. Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of <font>in-kind</font> securities and/or cash constituting a substantial replication of the common stocks that are included in the
Index, as determined by the index provider, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC (“S&amp;P”) (“Index Securities”). Such purchases and redemptions can be made only in the U.S. at the then-current valuation as described herein on pages <font>S-7</font> to <font>S-10</font> and <font>pages S-13</font> to <font>S-14</font> under the heading “Redemption.” For the
purposes of such purchases and redemptions of the Creation Units, the Evaluation Time (as defined on page <font>S-13)</font> is the closing time of the regular trading session on the New York Stock Exchange LLC (ordinarily
4:00 p.m. New York time). For additional details on trading and settlement, please consult pages 7 and 51 to 60 in the U.S. Prospectus attached hereto. </p>
<p>The primary trading market for Units is in the U.S., where Units are listed on NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”). Investors should note
that trading in Units may be halted under certain circumstances. Please refer to pages 67 to 68 and 73 in the U.S. Prospectus for more details. </p>
<p>As with other securities, investors will pay negotiated brokerage commissions and typical Singapore clearing fees and applicable taxes. In
addition, cash dividends to be distributed to investors in Singapore will be net of expenses incurred by CDP (defined below), and where such expenses equal or exceed the amount of the dividends, the investors will not receive any distributions.
Brokerage commissions may be subject to Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) at the prevailing standard rate of seven percent (7%). There will be a Singapore clearing fee, which is currently at the rate of 0.0325% of the contract value (or such
other amount as the CDP may decide from time to time). Clearing fees may be subject to GST in Singapore at the prevailing standard rate of seven percent (7%). Units are traded in U.S. dollars on the <font>SGX-ST</font> in
1 unit round lots. The term “market day” as used in this Prospectus means a business day in which transactions in Units can be executed and settled. Trading of Units on the <font>SGX-ST</font> may be halted
if the Trust fails to comply with continuing listing requirements and advertising guidelines of the <font>SGX-ST.</font> </p>
<p>With respect to holders of Units in Singapore, the trading and settlement process, the system through which they receive distributions or the
manner in which information may be made available, among other aspects, may differ from the information set forth in the U.S. Prospectus. Holders of Units in Singapore should </p>
<p> </p> <p>S-7 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
read this Prospectus carefully and all enquiries in relation hereto should be directed to their local brokers. </p>
<p>The <font>SGX-ST</font> imposes certain requirements for the continued listing of securities, including the Units,
on the <font>SGX-ST.</font> There can be no assurance that the requirements of the <font>SGX-ST</font> necessary to maintain the listing of the Units of the Trust will continue to be met, the <font>SGX-ST</font> will not change its listing requirements or that the Units will always be listed on the <font>SGX-ST.</font> The Trust will not be terminated if Units are delisted from the <font>SGX-ST.</font> If the Units are delisted from the <font>SGX-ST,</font> investors may deliver the Units they hold out of CDP for trading on NYSE Arca through the delivery mechanisms described in
section “3. Delivery of Units out of CDP for Trading on NYSE Arca” on pages <font>S-9</font> to <font>S-10</font> of this Prospectus. </p>
<p><b>1.</b><b><i></i></b><b></b><b><i>    General</i></b><b> </b></p>
<p>Units are issued by the Trust in the form of scripless securities which are eligible “book-entry-only” securities of The Depository
Trust Company (“DTC”). As “book-entry-only” securities, Units are represented by one or more global securities registered in the name of Cede &amp; Co., as nominee for DTC and deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC. </p>
<p>The Central Depository (Pte) Limited (“CDP”) maintains an account—Account No. 5700 (“DTC Account”)—with DTC.
CDP may receive Units from or deliver Units to accounts maintained by member participants in DTC (“DTC Participants”). </p>
<p>Settlement of dealings through the CDP system may be effected only by Depository Agents of CDP or holders of Units who have their own direct
securities accounts with CDP. Investors may open a direct securities account with CDP or a securities <font>sub-account</font> with any Depository Agent to hold their Units in CDP. The term “Depository Agent”
shall have the same meaning as that ascribed to it in Section 81SF of the Securities and Futures Act 2001 of Singapore. </p> <p>Through the
delivery mechanisms discussed below, it is possible for investors to purchase Units in Singapore and sell them in the U.S. and vice versa. Although both CDP and DTC, within their own respective market settlements, provide for Delivery Versus Payment
and <font><font>Free-of-Payment</font></font> transfers of securities, all of the linked transfers between the two depositories are effected only on a <font><font>Free-of-Payment</font></font> basis (i.e., there is no related cash movement to parallel the securities movement. Any related cash transfers may only be effected outside DTC and CDP directly between the buyer and seller
through their own arrangements). Investors should be aware that Singapore time is generally 12 hours ahead of Eastern Daylight Saving Time (13 hours Eastern Standard time) in New York, and that NYSE Arca and the <font>SGX-ST</font> are not open at the same time. Because of this time difference between the Singapore and U.S. markets, trading in Units between the two markets cannot occur simultaneously. Please refer to pages 67 to 68 and
73 of the U.S. Prospectus for details on circumstances under which there may be suspension of dealings or trading. </p>
<p> </p> <p>S-8 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>All dealings in, and transactions of, Units in Singapore must be effected for settlement through
the computerised book-entry (scripless) settlement system in the CDP. Investors should ensure that Units sold on the <font>SGX-ST</font> are available for settlement in their CDP account no later than the second market day
following the transaction date. </p> <p>Investors’ holdings of Units in their CDP account will be credited or debited for settlement on the
second market day following the transaction date, i.e., T+2, T being the transaction date. If Units are not in an investor’s CDP account for settlement by 1:30 p.m. on T+2, the investor will be subject to the
<font>buy-in</font> cycle on that afternoon. More information on the <font>buy-in</font> cycle is available on the <font>SGX-ST</font> website at
<i>http://www.sgx.com</i>. </p> <p>In the absence of unforeseen circumstances, the delivery of Units into and out of CDP will take a minimum of
one market day after the duly completed documentation has been submitted to CDP for processing, assuming that the investor has given proper instructions to his or her DTC Participant. Instructions and forms received by CDP after
1 p.m. Singapore time on a given market day will be treated as being received on the next market day and, as such, will be processed on the next market day. Please refer to pages 1 and 69 to 72 of the U.S. Prospectus for details on the
fees and expenses of the Trust. </p> <p>The Trust has adopted a code of ethics which is described on pages 91 to 92 of the U.S. Prospectus. </p>
<p><b>2.</b><b><i></i></b><b></b><b><i>    Delivery of Units to CDP for Trading on the
<font>SGX-ST</font></i></b><b> </b></p> <p>Investors who hold Units in DTC’s system in the U.S. and wish to trade
them on the <font>SGX-ST</font> can direct delivery of the Units to CDP; this book-entry transfer to CDP’s DTC Account may be effected only on a
<font><font>Free-of-Payment</font></font> basis. Investors may deliver their Units by informing their Singapore broker or Depository Agent to submit delivery instructions to CDP, together with
the applicable CDP delivery fee and GST, no later than 1 p.m. Singapore time on the specified delivery date. Investors must concurrently instruct their DTC Participant to deliver such Units into the DTC Account on the delivery date. Upon
notification that its DTC Account has been credited, CDP will accordingly credit Units to the investor’s account. </p> <p>Investors should
ensure that their Units are delivered into their securities account with CDP in time for settlement. In the event an investor cannot deliver the Units for settlement pursuant to the trade, the CDP may <font>buy-in</font>
against him or her. </p> <p><b>3.</b><b><i></i></b><b></b><b><i>    Delivery of Units out of CDP for Trading on NYSE Arca</i></b><b> </b></p>
<p>Investors who hold Units with CDP and wish to trade on NYSE Arca must arrange to deliver the Units into their accounts with their DTC
Participant for settlement of any such trade, which will occur on the second market day following the transaction date. For such delivery, investors must submit a duly completed CDP </p>
<p> </p> <p>S-9 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
delivery form together with the applicable CDP delivery fee and GST through their Singapore broker or Depository Agent, no later than 1 p.m. Singapore time on the second market day
following the specified delivery date in the U.S. Investors must concurrently instruct their DTC Participant to expect receipt of the relevant number of Units from the DTC Account. Upon receipt of the duly completed CDP delivery form, CDP will
earmark the investor’s securities account for the relevant number of Units and then instruct DTC to deliver the Units to the DTC Participant account as specified by the investor. The relevant number of Units will be debited from the
investor’s securities account after CDP receives DTC’s confirmation that the Units have been transferred out of its DTC account. </p>

<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p><b><a name="tx284625_4"></a>EXCHANGE RATES AND RISKS </b></p>
<p>Units traded on the <font>SGX-ST</font> are denominated and traded in U.S. dollars. Units may only be created or
redeemed in U.S. dollars at the then-current value calculated in U.S. dollars in the manner set out in the U.S. Prospectus. Similarly, the Trust holds only Portfolio Securities that are denominated in U.S. dollars and the distributions which may be
made by the Trustee are in U.S. dollars. </p> <p>The Trust has no ability to manage its investments to hedge against fluctuations in exchange
rates between the U.S. dollar and the Singapore dollar. To the extent a Singapore investor wishes to convert such U.S. dollar holdings or distributions to Singapore dollars, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Singapore dollar and the U.S.
dollar may affect the value of the proceeds following a currency conversion. </p>

its own gross negligence, bad faith, wilful misconduct or wilful malfeasance for any action taken or suffered to be taken by it in good faith and believed by it to be authorized or within the discretion, rights or powers conferred on it or reckless
disregard of its duties and obligations; </p> <p>(vii) the Trustee must ensure that no payment made to the Sponsor is for

including the creation and redemption of </p>

<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
Creation Units, at its offices, and keep such books open for inspection by any beneficial owner at all reasonable times during usual business hours; </p>
<p>(ix) the Trustee must make, or cause to be made, such reports and file such documents as are required by the Securities
Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Company Act of 1940 and U.S. state or federal tax laws and regulations; </p>
<p>(x) the Trustee must keep a certified copy of the Trust Agreement, together with the Indenture for each
Trust Series then in effect and a current list of Portfolio Securities therein, on file at its office and make the same available for inspection; and </p>
<p>(xi) the Trustee must charge and direct from the assets of the Trust all expenses and disbursements incurred under the
Trust Agreement, or shall reimburse itself from the assets of the Trust or the sale of securities in the Trust for any advances made out of its own funds for such expenses and disbursements. </p>
<p><b>3.</b><b><i></i></b><b></b><b><i>    Contracts</i></b><b> </b></p>
<p>A holder of a Unit is not required, obliged or entitled in connection with the Trust to enter into any contract with any person or corporation
whether by way of lease or otherwise. </p> <p><b>4.</b><b><i></i></b><b></b><b><i>    Vesting of Assets in the Trust</i></b><b> </b></p>
<p>The Trustee has legal title to all securities and other property in which funds of the Trust are invested, all funds held for such investment,
all equalisation, redemption, and other special funds of the Trust, and all income upon accretions to, and proceeds of such property and funds, and the Trustee is required to segregate and hold the same in trust until distribution thereof to the
holders of the Units. </p> <p><b>5.</b><b><i></i></b><b></b><b><i>    Redemption</i></b><b> </b></p>
<p>The Trust is not administered by a management company, and there is no obligation on the Sponsor or the Trustee to redeem any Units. As
described on pages 56 to 60 in the U.S. Prospectus, it is the Trust itself that is obligated to effect the redemption (although it is the Trustee acting as agent for the Trust that will actually effect the redemption). </p>
<p>Only Units in Creation Units may be redeemed at their then-current valuation, which is calculated on the Business Day on which the redemption
order is properly received, as of the Evaluation Time, which is the closing time of the regular trading session on the New York Stock Exchange LLC (ordinarily 4:00 p.m. New York time). For redemptions through the Clearing Process, the Trustee
effects a transfer of the Cash Redemption Payment and stocks to the redeeming beneficial owner by the second (2nd) NSCC Business Day following the date on which request for redemption is deemed received. For redemptions outside the Clearing
Process, the Trustee </p>
<p> </p> <p>S-13 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
transfers the Cash Redemption Payment and the stocks to the redeeming beneficial owner by the second (2nd) Business Day following the date on which the request for redemption is deemed
received. The Trustee will cancel all Units delivered upon redemption. Please refer to pages 3, 56 to 60 and 74 of the U.S. Prospectus for a further description of this process. </p>
<p>Investors owning Units in an amount less than a whole Creation Unit (i.e., less than 50,000 Units) or multiples thereof, are not permitted to
tender their Units to the Trustee for redemption. Such investors can only dispose of their Units by selling them on the secondary market at any time during the trading day at market prices. </p>
<p><b>6.</b><b><i></i></b><b></b><b><i>    Transfer of Units</i></b><b> </b></p>
<p>As described on <font>page S-8</font> of this Prospectus, Cede &amp; Co., as nominee for DTC, will be the
registered owner of all outstanding Units on the DTC system. Beneficial ownership of Units will be shown on the records of DTC or its participants. Beneficial ownership records for holders of Units in Singapore will be maintained at CDP. </p>
<p>No certificates will be issued in respect of Units. Transfers of Units between investors will normally occur through the trading mechanism of
the <font>SGX-ST</font> or NYSE Arca as described on pages <font>S-7</font> to <font>S-10</font> in this Prospectus and pages 67 to 68 in the U.S. Prospectus. </p>

<p>The Trust is not required by law to convene meetings of beneficial owners of the Units. </p>
<p>The Sponsor, the Retired Trustee and CDP have entered into a Depository Agreement dated May 18, 2001, as supplemented by a supplemental
depository agreement dated May 22, 2009 (the “CDP Depository Agreement”), pursuant to which CDP has agreed to act as the depository for Units in Singapore. The Sponsor, the Retired Trustee, CDP and the Trustee have entered into a deed
of novation dated December 29, 2018<b><i> </i></b>in relation to the CDP Depository Agreement (the “Deed of Novation”) pursuant to which, <i>inter alia</i>, CDP has agreed to release and discharge the Retired Trustee subject to the

and conditions of the Deed of Novation. CDP’s duties under the CDP Depository Agreement include, among other things: (i) acting as a bare trustee on behalf of individuals who hold securities accounts with CDP and Depository Agents
authorized to maintain <font>sub-accounts</font> with CDP in respect of Units, (ii) distributing to CDP account holders and Depository Agents any applicable payments or cash distributions in respect of Units, and

<p><i>Trustee </i></p> <p>Effective
June 16, 2017, the Retired Trustee resigned as trustee of the Trust. The Sponsor appointed the Trustee, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Retired Trustee, as trustee of the Trust. The services received, and the trustee fees paid, by the Trust
did not change as a result of the change in the identity of the Trustee. The Retired Trustee continues to maintain the Trust’s accounting records, act as custodian and transfer agent to the Trust, and provided administrative services, including
the filing of certain regulatory reports. </p> <p>The Trustee is a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, U.S. The Trustee is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Retired Trustee and as such is regulated by the Federal Reserve System and is subject to applicable U.S. federal and state banking and trust laws and to supervision by the
U.S. Federal Reserve, as well as by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks and the regulatory authorities of those states and countries in which a branch of the Trustee is located. </p>
<p>In accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trustee, <i>inter alia</i>, acts as custodian to the Trust. In this regard, the assets of the Trust
shall be held by, or to the order of the Trustee on behalf of and for the exclusive interest of the holders of the Units. The Trust Agreement does not allow the Trustee to delegate the safekeeping of the assets of the Trust to another custodian. The
Trustee must ensure, <i>inter alia</i>, that adjustments to the Trust’s Portfolio are carried out in accordance with the law and the Trust Agreement. </p>
<p>The Trustee will remain the Trustee of the Trust until it is removed, it resigns or the Trust Agreement is terminated. The remuneration

<td> <p><b><i>CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS </i></b></p></td></tr></table>
<p>The following is a description of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the beneficial ownership of Units by a person that is, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, a nonresident alien individual, a foreign corporation, a foreign trust or a foreign estate (a <font>“Non-U.S.</font> Holder”). The discussion below does not apply to a <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder who is a nonresident alien individual and is present in the United States for 183 days or more during any taxable year. Such <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holders should consult
their tax advisors with respect to the particular tax consequences to them of an investment in the Trust. The discussion below provides general tax information relating to a <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder’s investment
in Units, but it does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all the U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to a particular <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder’s decision to invest in Units.
This discussion does not describe all of the tax consequences that may be relevant in light of a <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder’s particular circumstances or tax consequences applicable to
<font>Non-U.S.</font> Holders subject to special rules, such as a nonresident alien individual who is a former citizen or resident of the United States; an expatriated entity; a controlled foreign corporation; a passive
foreign investment company; a foreign government for purposes of Section 892 of the Code or a <font>tax-exempt</font> organization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. </p>
<p> </p> <p>S-18 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>If an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds
Units, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding Units and partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisors as to
the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences of holding and disposing of the Units in light of their specific circumstances. </p> <p>This
discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions, and final, temporary and proposed Treasury regulations all as of the date hereof, any of which is subject
to change, possibly with retroactive effect. </p> <p>Prospective purchasers of Units are urged to consult their tax advisors with regard to the
application of the U.S. federal income and estate tax laws to their particular situations, as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or <font>non-U.S.</font> taxing jurisdiction. </p>
<p>The U.S. federal income taxation of a <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder depends on whether the income that the <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder derives from the Trust is “effectively connected” with a trade or business that the <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder conducts in the United States (and, if required
by an applicable tax treaty, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment maintained by the <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder). If the income that a <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder derives from the
Trust is not “effectively connected” with a U.S. trade or business conducted by such <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder (or, if an applicable tax treaty so provides, the <font>Non-U.S.</font>
Holder does not maintain a permanent establishment in the United States), distributions of “investment company taxable income” (as described in the U.S. Prospectus) to such <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder will
generally be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a rate of 30% (or lower rate under an applicable tax treaty). There is currently no income tax treaty between the U.S. and Singapore. Provided that certain requirements are satisfied, this
withholding tax will not be imposed on dividends paid by the Trust to the extent that the underlying income out of which the dividends are paid consists of U.S.-source interest income or short-term capital gains that would not have been subject to
U.S. withholding tax if received directly by the <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder (“interest-related dividends” and “short-term capital gain dividends”, respectively). </p>
<p>A <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder whose income from the Trust is not “effectively connected” with a U.S.
trade or business (or, if an applicable tax treaty so provides, does not maintain a permanent establishment in the United States) will generally be exempt from U.S. federal income tax on capital gain dividends and any amounts retained by the Trust
that are designated as undistributed capital gains, as described in the U.S. Prospectus. In addition, such a <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder will generally be exempt from U.S. federal income tax on any gains realized upon the
sale or exchange of Units. </p> <p>If the income from the Trust is “effectively connected” with a U.S. trade or business carried on by a
<font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder (and, if required by an applicable tax treaty, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment maintained by the <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder),
</p>
<p> </p> <p>S-19 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
any distributions of “investment company taxable income,” any capital gain dividends, any amounts retained by the Trust that are designated as undistributed capital gains and any gains
realized upon the sale or exchange of Units will be subject to U.S. federal income tax, on a net income basis, at the rates applicable to holders of Units who are U.S. persons for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For more information, see
“Federal Income Taxes—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders” in the U.S. Prospectus. A <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder that is a corporation may also be subject to the U.S. branch profits tax. </p>
<p>Information returns will be filed with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) in connection with certain payments on the Units
and may be filed in connection with payments of the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of Units. A <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder may be subject to backup withholding on distributions or on the proceeds from a
redemption or other disposition of Units if such <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder does not certify its <font>non-US</font> status under penalties of perjury or otherwise establish an exemption.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld pursuant to the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a credit against the <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if
any, and may entitle the <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder to a refund, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS on a timely basis. </p>
<p>In order to qualify for the exemption from U.S. withholding on interest-related dividends, to qualify for an exemption from U.S. backup
withholding and to qualify for a reduced rate of U.S. withholding tax on Trust distributions pursuant to an income tax treaty, a <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder must generally deliver to the withholding agent a properly
executed IRS form (generally, <font>Form W-8BEN</font> or Form <font><font>W-8BEN-E,</font></font> as applicable). In order to claim a refund of any Trust-level
taxes imposed on undistributed net capital gain, any withholding taxes or any backup withholding, a <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder must obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number and file a U.S. federal income tax return,
even if the <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder would not otherwise be required to obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number or file a U.S. income tax return. </p>
<p>Under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (“FATCA”), a withholding tax at the rate of 30% will generally be imposed on payments of
dividends on Units to certain foreign entities (including financial intermediaries) unless the foreign entity provides the withholding agent with certifications and other information (which may include information relating to ownership by U.S.
persons of interests in, or accounts with, the foreign entity). Treasury and the IRS have issued proposed regulations that (i) provide that “withholdable payments” will not include gross proceeds from the disposition of property that
can produce U.S. source dividends or interest, as otherwise would have been the case after December 31, 2018 and (ii) state that taxpayers may rely on these provisions of the proposed regulations until final regulations are issued. If
FATCA withholding is imposed, a beneficial owner of Units that is not a foreign financial institution generally may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld by filing a U.S. federal income tax return (which may entail significant
</p>
<p> </p> <p>S-20 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
administrative burden). <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of FATCA on their investment in Units. </p>

<td> <p><b><i>CERTAIN SINGAPORE TAX CONSIDERATIONS </i></b></p></td></tr></table>
<p>The following is a general description of material Singapore income tax, stamp duty and estate duty consequences of the ownership and disposal
of Units. The summary discussion below is not intended to be, and does not purport to be, a comprehensive analysis of all the tax consequences relating to ownership and disposal of Units by a person who, for purposes of taxation in Singapore, is
regarded as a Singapore resident taxpayer or otherwise. Prospective investors of Units should consult their own tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of their particular situations. This description, which is not intended to and does not
constitute legal or tax advice, is based on laws, regulations and interpretations now in effect and available as of the date of this Prospectus. The laws, regulations and interpretations, however, may change at any time, and any change could be
retroactive to the date of ownership of the Units. These laws and regulations are also subject to various interpretations and the relevant tax authorities or the courts could later disagree with the explanations or conclusions set out below. </p>
<p><i>General </i></p> <p>Subject to
certain exceptions, Singapore tax resident and <font>non-resident</font> companies are subject to Singapore income tax on income accruing in or derived from Singapore and on foreign income received or deemed received in
Singapore. </p> <p>Foreign-sourced income in the form of branch profits, dividends and service income received or deemed received in Singapore by
a resident corporate taxpayer is, however, <font>tax-exempt</font> (subject to certain conditions) if: </p> <p> </p>
<table>

<table>
<tr>
<td> </td>
<td>(c)</td>
<td> <p>the Comptroller of Income Tax is satisfied that the tax exemption would be beneficial to the Singapore tax
resident company. </p></td></tr></table> <p>Resident and <font>non-resident</font> individuals are generally taxed on
income arising in or derived from Singapore. </p> <p>All foreign-sourced personal income received or deemed received in Singapore on or after
January 1, 2004 by a Singapore tax resident individual (except where such income is received through a partnership in Singapore, or where the overseas employment is incidental to a Singapore employment, or where an individual has a
trade/business in Singapore and such individual is carrying on the trade/business </p>
<p> </p> <p>S-21 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
overseas which is incidental to his trade/business carried out in Singapore, or where an individual is employed overseas on behalf of the Singapore Government) will be exempt from tax in
Singapore. Certain investment income derived from Singapore sources by individuals on or after January 1, 2004 will also be exempt from tax. </p>
<p>A company is regarded as a tax resident in Singapore if the control and management of its business is exercised in Singapore; “control and
management” is the making of decisions on strategic matters, such as those on company policy and strategy. Typically, the location of the company’s board of directors meetings, during which strategic decisions are made, is a key factor in
determining where the control and management is exercised. An individual is regarded as a tax resident in Singapore for income tax purposes if, in the calendar year preceding the year of assessment, he is a foreigner who has stayed/worked in
Singapore for at least 183 days or continuously for three consecutive years, a foreigner who has worked in Singapore for a continuous period straddling two calendar years and his total period of stay is at least 183 days (other than as a director of
a company, public entertainers or porfessionals), or if he is a Singapore Citizen or Singapore permanent resident who normally resides in Singapore except for temporary absences. </p>
<p><i>Tax rates </i></p> <p>The corporate
tax rate is 17% from the Year of Assessment 2010 (i.e., calendar year ended in 2009). With effect from the Year of Assessment 2020, the first SGD10,000 of normal chargeable income will be eligible for a 75% tax exemption, with a further 50% tax
exemption given on the next SGD190,000 of normal chargeable income. In respect of new <font>start-up</font> companies (where any of the first three Years of Assessment falls in or after the Year of Assessment 2020), the
first SGD100,000 of normal chargeable income will be eligible for a 75% tax exemption, with a further 50% tax exemption given on the next SGD100,000 of normal chargeable income. </p>
<p>Singapore tax resident individuals are subject to tax based on a progressive scale. Since the Year of Assessment 2017 (i.e., calendar year
ended in 2016), the top marginal rate is 22%. </p> <p>The employment income of <font>non-resident</font> individuals is
taxed at the flat rate of 15% or the progressive resident tax rates, whichever is the higher tax amount. From the Year of Assessment 2017, the tax rates for <font>non-resident</font> individuals (except certain reduced
final withholding tax rates) has been raised from 20% to 22%. This is to maintain parity between the tax rates of <font>non-resident</font> individuals and the top marginal tax rate of resident individuals. </p>
<p>All tax residents in Singapore will be affected by tax rebates and exemptions granted by the Singapore government from time to time in line

<p><i>Dividends Tax </i></p>
<p>Dividends accrue in the year that they are declared payable. </p>
<p>Generally, the following dividends are not taxable: </p> <p> </p>
<table>
<tr>
<td> </td>
<td>(a)</td>
<td> <p>dividends paid on or after 1 January 2008 by a Singapore resident company under the <font>one-tier</font> corporate tax system except <font>co-operatives;</font> </p></td></tr></table> <p> </p>
<table>
<tr>
<td> </td>
<td>(b)</td>
<td> <p>foreign dividends received in Singapore on or after 1 January 2004 by resident individuals. If an
individual resident in Singapore receives foreign-sourced dividends through a partnership in Singapore, these dividends may be exempt from Singapore tax if certain conditions are met; and </p></td></tr></table>

<td> </td>
<td>(c)</td>
<td> <p>income distribution from real estate investment trusts (“REITs”), except distributions derived by
individuals through a partnership in Singapore, or from the carrying on of a trade, business or profession in REITs. </p></td></tr></table>
<p><i>Capital Gains Tax </i></p>
<p>Generally, profits or losses derived from the buying and selling of shares or other financial instruments are viewed as personal investments.
These profits are capital gains and are not taxable. </p> <p><i>Adoption of FRS 109 treatment for Singapore income tax purposes </i></p>
<p>In addition, with effect from 1 January 2018, the Financial Reporting Standards 109 (“FRS 109”) has replaced the previous
Financial Reporting Standards 39 (“FRS 39”). For holders of the Units, this means that they may be required, for income tax purposes, to recognise gains or losses, irrespective of disposal, in accordance with FRS 109 and, unlike the
previous approach for FRS 39, there is no option for companies to opt out of the FRS 109 tax treatment. </p> <p>Holders of the Units who may be
subject to the tax treatment under the FRS 109 should consult their own accounting and tax advisors regarding the Singapore income tax consequences. </p>
<p><i>Stamp Duty </i></p> <p>Stamp duty
will not be imposed on instruments of transfers relating to the Units. In the event of a change of trustee for the Trust, there will be no stamp duty on any document effecting the appointment of a new trustee and the transfer of trust assets from
the incumbent trustee to the new trustee. </p> <p><i>Estate Duty </i></p>
<p>The Singapore government announced on February 15, 2008 that estate duty would be abolished for deaths occurring on and after
February 15, 2008. </p>

<p>Investors may contact ALPS at the following toll free number to seek any clarification regarding the Trust: <font><font><font>+1-866-732-8673.</font></font></font> </p> <p><b>20.</b><b><i>    Additional
Information on the Index</i></b><b> </b></p> <p>The index provider is S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC (“S&amp;P”), who is independent from
the Trustee.<sup> </sup>The computation of the Index may be inaccurate or incomplete if, amongst other factors, the information received by S&amp;P is inaccurate or incomplete. No warranty, representation or
guarantee is given as to the accuracy or completeness of the Index and its computation or any information related thereto. The process and the basis of computing and compiling the Index and any of its related formulae, constituent companies and
factors may at any time be changed or altered by S&amp;P without notice. </p> <p>The Index Securities which comprise the Index are changed by
S&amp;P from time to time. The price of Units may rise or fall as a result of such changes. The composition of the Index may also change if one of the constituent companies were to delist its securities or if a new eligible company were to list its
securities and be added to the Index. If this happens, the weighting or composition of the Index Securities invested by the Trust would be changed as considered appropriate by the Trustee in order to achieve the investment objective. Thus, an
investment in Units will generally reflect the Index as its constituents change from time to time, and not necessarily the way it is comprised at the time of an investment in Units. </p>
<p>The Index Securities held by the Trust will passively reflect the distribution of companies whose securities are included in the Index.
Therefore, adverse changes in the financial condition or share performance of any company included in the Index will not result in the sale of the shares of such company by the Trust, and will be likely to adversely affect the Trust’s net asset
value and the trading price of Units. The Trustee will have limited discretion to remove the securities of such company from the Fund. </p> <p>A
license agreement (the “License Agreement”) between SSGA FD, an affiliate of the Trustee, and S&amp;P grants a license to SSGA FD to use the Index and to use certain trade names and trademarks of S&amp;P in connection with the Trust. The
Index also serves as a basis for determining the composition of the Portfolio. Currently, the License Agreement is scheduled to terminate on November 29, 2031, but its term may be extended without the consent of any of the beneficial owners of
Units. In the event that the Index is no longer available for use by the Fund, the Trustee will source for a suitable replacement index that gives, in the opinion of the Trustee, the same or substantially similar equity exposure as the Index. There
are no material conditions in the License Agreement in relation to the use of the Index which may prevent the Fund from achieving its investment objective. </p>
<p>Further information on the Index is available online at <i>http://www.spindices.com</i>. </p>

<p><b>21.    </b><b><i>Tracking Error Risk</i></b><b> </b></p>
<p>Factors such as the fees and expenses of the Trust, imperfect correlation between the Portfolio Securities and the Index Securities
constituting the Index, rounding of share prices, changes to the Index and regulatory policies may affect the Trustee’s ability to achieve close correlation with the performance of the Index. The Trust’s returns may therefore deviate from
the Index and there is no assurance that the Trust will be able to fully track the performance of the Index. The Portfolio Securities may be adjusted from time to time to reflect any changes to the composition of, or the weighting of securities in,
the Index, with a view towards minimizing tracking error of the Trust’s overall returns relative to the performance of the Index. </p>
<p><b>22.    </b><b><i>Concentration</i></b><b> </b></p>
<p>If the Index comprises Index Securities that are concentrated in a particular group of stocks, industry or group of industries, the Trust may
be adversely affected by the performance of those stocks and be subject to price volatility. In addition, if the Trust is concentrated in a single stock, group of stocks, industry or group of industries, it may be more susceptible to any single
economic, market, political or regulatory occurrence. </p> <p><b>23.    </b><b><i>Notification</i></b><b> </b></p>
<p>The Units of the Trust are Specified Investment Products (as defined in MAS Notice SFA <font>04-N12:</font> Notice
on the Sale of Investment Products and MAS Notice <font>FAA-N16:</font> Notice on Recommendations on Investment Products) and capital markets products other than prescribed capital markets products (as defined in the

<p>The Trust seeks to achieve its investment objective by holding a portfolio of the common stocks that are included in the Index (the “Portfolio”),
with the weight of each stock in the Portfolio substantially corresponding to the weight of such stock in the Index. </p> <p>In this prospectus, the term
“Portfolio Securities” refers to the common stocks that are actually held by the Trust and make up the Trust’s Portfolio, while the term “Index Securities” refers to the common stocks that are included in the Index, as
determined by the index provider, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC (“S&amp;P”). At any time, the Portfolio will consist of as many of the Index Securities as is practicable. To maintain the correspondence between the composition and
weightings of Portfolio Securities and Index Securities, State Street Global Advisors Trust Company (the “Trustee”) or its parent company, State Street Bank and Trust Company (“SSBT”) adjusts the Portfolio from time to time to
conform to periodic changes made by S&amp;P to the identity and/or relative weightings of Index Securities in the Index. The Trustee or SSBT aggregates certain of these adjustments and makes changes to the Portfolio at least monthly, or more
frequently in the case of significant changes to the Index. </p> <p>The Trust may pay transaction costs, such as brokerage commissions, when it buys and sells
securities (or “turns over” its Portfolio). Such transaction costs may be higher if there are significant rebalancings of Index Securities in the Index, which may also result in higher taxes when Units are held in a taxable account. These
costs, which are not reflected in estimated annual Trust ordinary operating expenses, affect the Trust’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Trust’s portfolio </p>

Trust”). </p> <p>Although the Trust may fail to own certain Index Securities at any particular time, the Trust generally will be substantially invested in
Index Securities, which should result in a close correspondence between the performance of the Index and the performance of the Trust. See “The S&amp;P 500 Index” below for more information regarding the Index. The Trust does not hold or
trade futures or swaps and is not a commodity pool. </p> <p><b><a name="toc280704_5"></a>Dividends </b></p>
<p>Payments of dividends are made quarterly, on the last Business Day (as defined in “Purchases and Redemptions of Creation Units — Purchase

<p><b><a name="toc280704_9"></a>Principal Risks of Investing in the Trust </b></p>
<p>As with all investments, there are certain risks of investing in the Trust, and you could lose money on an investment in the Trust. Prospective investors
should carefully consider the risk factors described below, as well as the additional risk factors under “Additional Risk Information” and the other information included in this prospectus, before deciding to invest in Units. </p>
<p><i>Passive Strategy/Index Risk.    </i>The Trust is not actively managed. Rather, the Trust attempts to track the performance of an
unmanaged index of securities. This differs from an actively managed fund, which typically seeks to outperform a benchmark index. As a result, the Trust will hold constituent securities of the Index regardless of the current or projected performance
of a specific security or a particular industry or market sector. Maintaining investments in securities regardless of market conditions or the performance of individual securities could cause the Trust’s return to be lower than if the Trust
employed an active strategy. </p> <p><i>Index Tracking Risk.    </i>While the Trust is intended to track the performance of the Index as
closely as possible (<i>i.e., </i>to<i> </i>achieve a high degree of correlation with the Index), the Trust’s return may not match or achieve a high degree of correlation with the return of the Index due to expenses and transaction costs
incurred in adjusting the Portfolio. In addition, it is possible that the Trust may not always fully replicate the performance of the Index due to the unavailability of certain Index Securities in the secondary market or due to other extraordinary
circumstances (<i>e.g.</i>, if trading in a security has been halted). </p> <p><i>Equity Investing and Market Risk.    </i>An investment in
the Trust involves risks similar to those of investing in any fund of equity securities, such as market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic and political developments, changes in interest rates, perceived trends in securities prices,
war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious disease or other public health issues. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious disease or other public health issues, recessions, or other events
could have a significant impact on the Trust and its investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Trust’s net asset value. </p>
<p>An investment in the Trust is subject to the risks of any investment in a broadly based portfolio of equity securities, including the risk that the general
level of stock prices may decline, thereby adversely affecting the value of such investment. The value of Portfolio Securities may fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the issuers of Portfolio Securities, the value of
equity securities generally and other factors. The identity and weighting of Index Securities and the Portfolio Securities change from time to time. </p> <p>The
financial condition of issuers of Portfolio Securities may become impaired or the general condition of the stock market may deteriorate, either of which may cause a decrease in the value of the Portfolio and thus in the value of Units. Since the
Trust is not actively managed, the adverse financial condition of an issuer will not result in its </p>
<p> </p> <p>4 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
elimination from the Portfolio unless such issuer is removed from the Index. Equity securities are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations and to volatile increases and decreases in
value as market confidence in and perceptions of their issuers change. These investor perceptions are based on various and unpredictable factors, including expectations regarding government, economic, monetary and fiscal policies, inflation and
interest rates, economic expansion or contraction, and global or regional political, economic and banking crises, as well as war, acts of terrorism and the spread of infectious disease or other public health issues. </p>
<p>An outbreak of infectious respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus known as <font>COVID-19</font> was first detected in
China in December 2019 and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. This coronavirus has resulted in travel restrictions, restrictions on gatherings of people (including closings of, or limitations on, dining and
entertainment establishments, as well as schools and universities), closed businesses (or businesses that are restricted in their operations), closed international borders, enhanced health screenings at ports of entry and elsewhere, disruption of
and delays in healthcare service preparation and delivery, prolonged quarantines, cancellations, supply chain disruptions, and lower consumer demand, as well as general concern and uncertainty. The impact of
<font>COVID-19,</font> and other infectious disease outbreaks that may arise in the future, could adversely affect the economies of many nations or the entire global economy, individual issuers and capital markets in ways
that cannot necessarily be foreseen. Public health crises caused by the <font>COVID-19</font> outbreak may exacerbate other <font>pre-existing</font> political, social and economic risks in
certain countries or globally. The duration of the <font>COVID-19</font> outbreak cannot be determined with certainty. The risk of further spreading of <font>COVID-19</font> has led to
significant uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets, liquidity contraints and disruption to the global economy, the consequences of which are currently unpredictable. Certain of the Trust’s investments have exposure to businesses
that, as a result of <font>COVID-19,</font> have experienced a slowdown or temporary suspension in business activities. Additionally, governments and central banks, including the Federal Reserve in the United States, have
taken extraordinary and unprecedented actions to support local and global economies and the financial markets. The impact of these measures, and whether they will be effective to mitigate the economic and market disruption, will not be known for
some time. These factors, as well as any restrictive measures instituted in order to prevent or control a pandemic or other public health crisis, such as the one posed by <font>COVID-19,</font> could have a material and
adverse effect on the Trust’s investments. </p> <p>Holders of common stocks of any given issuer incur more risk than holders of preferred stocks and debt
obligations of the issuer because the rights of common stockholders, as owners of the issuer, generally are subordinate to the rights of creditors of, or holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks issued by, such issuer. Further, unlike debt
securities that typically have a stated principal amount payable at maturity, or preferred stocks that typically have a liquidation preference and may have stated optional or mandatory redemption provisions, common stocks have
</p>
<p> </p> <p>5 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
neither a fixed principal amount nor a maturity. Equity securities values are subject to market fluctuations as long as the equity securities remain outstanding. The value of the Portfolio will
fluctuate over the entire life of the Trust. </p> <p>There can be no assurance that the issuers of Portfolio Securities will pay dividends. Distributions
generally depend upon the declaration of dividends by the issuers of Portfolio Securities and the declaration of such dividends generally depends upon various factors, including the financial condition of the issuers and general economic conditions.
</p> <p><b><a name="toc280704_10"></a>Trust Performance </b></p> <p>The
following bar chart and table provide an indication of the risks of investing in the Trust by showing changes in the Trust’s performance based on net assets from year to year and by showing how the Trust’s average annual return for certain
time periods compares with the average annual return of the Index. The Trust’s past performance (before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the Trust will perform in the future. Updated performance information is available
online at http://www.spdrs.com. </p> <p>The total returns in the bar chart, as well as the total and <font>after-tax</font> returns
presented in the table, have been calculated assuming that the reinvested price for the last income distribution made in the last calendar year shown below (<i>i.e.,</i> 12/17/21) was the net asset value per Unit (“NAV”) on the last
Business Day of such year (<i>i.e.,</i> 12/31/21), rather than the actual reinvestment price for such distribution which was the NAV on the last Business Day of January of the following calendar year (<i>e.g.</i>, 1/31/22). Therefore, the actual
performance calculation for the last calendar year may be different from that shown below in the bar chart and table. No dividend reinvestment services are provided by the Trust (see “Dividends and Distributions”), so investors’
performance may be different from that shown below in the bar chart and table. </p> <p><i>Annual Total Return (years ended 12/31) </i></p>
<p>
<img alt="LOGO" src="g280704g24d09.jpg"/>
</p> <p>Highest Quarterly Return: 20.44% for the quarter ended June 30, 2020. </p>
<p>Lowest Quarterly Return: –19.60% for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. </p>
<p> </p> <p>6 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p><i>Average Annual Total Returns (for periods ending December 31, 2021) </i></p>
<p>The <font>after-tax</font> returns presented in the table are calculated using the highest historical individual federal marginal
income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Your actual <font>after-tax</font> returns will depend on your specific tax situation and may differ from those shown below. <font>After-tax</font> returns are not relevant to investors who hold Units through <font>tax-deferred</font> arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. The returns after
taxes can exceed the return before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit for a holder of Units from realizing a capital loss on a sale of the Units. </p> <p> </p>

<p><b><a name="toc280704_15"></a>Dividends and Capital Gains </b></p>
<p>Holders of Units receive on the last Business Day of April, July, October and January an amount corresponding to the amount of any cash dividends declared on
the Portfolio Securities during the applicable period, net of fees and expenses associated with operation of the Trust, and taxes, if applicable. Because of such fees and expenses, the dividend yield for Units is ordinarily less than that of the
Index. Although all such distributions are currently made quarterly, under certain limited circumstances the Trustee may vary the times at which such distributions are made. </p>
<p>Any capital gain income recognized by the Trust in any taxable year that is not distributed during the year ordinarily is distributed at least annually in
January of the following taxable year. The Trust may make additional distributions shortly after the end of the year in order to satisfy certain distribution requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Code”). </p> <p>The amount of distributions may vary significantly from period to period. Under limited certain circumstances, special dividend
payments also may be made to holders of Units. See “Additional Information Regarding Dividends and Distributions.” Investors should consult their tax advisors regarding tax consequences associated with Trust dividends, as well as those
associated with Unit sales or redemptions. </p> <p><b><a name="toc280704_16"></a>No Dividend Reinvestment Service </b></p>
<p>No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the Trust. Broker-dealers, at their own discretion, may offer a dividend reinvestment service under which
additional Units are purchased in the secondary market at current market prices. Investors should consult their broker-dealer for further information regarding any dividend reinvestment program offered by such broker-dealer. </p>
<p>Distributions in cash that are reinvested in additional Units through a dividend reinvestment service, if offered by an investor’s broker-dealer, will be
taxable dividends to the same extent as if such dividends had been received in cash. </p>

<p>If an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Units, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner will
generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding Units and partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisors as to the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences of holding
and disposing of the Units in light of their specific circumstances. </p> <p>The following discussion applies only to an owner of Units that (i) is treated
as the beneficial owner of such Units for U.S. federal income tax purposes and (ii) holds such Units as capital assets. </p> <p>This discussion is based on
the Code, administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions, and final, temporary and proposed Treasury regulations all as of the date hereof, any of which is subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. </p>

<p>Prospective purchasers of Units are urged to consult their tax advisors with regard to the application of the
U.S. federal income and estate tax laws to their particular situations, as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or <font>non-U.S.</font> taxing jurisdiction. </p>
<p><b><a name="toc280704_18"></a>Taxation of the Trust </b></p> <p>The
Trust believes that it qualified as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Code (a “RIC”) for its taxable year ended September 30, 2020 and intends to qualify as a RIC in the current and future taxable years.
Assuming that the Trust so qualifies and that it satisfies the distribution requirements described below, the Trust generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on income distributed in a timely manner to the holders of its Units
(“Unitholders”). </p> <p>To qualify as a RIC for any taxable year, the Trust must, among other things, satisfy both an income test and an asset
diversification test for such taxable year. Specifically, (i) at least 90% of the Trust’s gross income for such taxable year must consist of dividends; interest; payments with respect to certain securities loans; gains from the sale or
other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies; other income (including, but not limited to, gains from options, futures or forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies;
and net income derived from interests in “qualified publicly traded partnerships” (such income, “Qualifying RIC Income”) and (ii) the Trust’s holdings must be diversified so that, at the end of each quarter of such
taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the value of the Trust’s total assets is represented by cash and cash items, securities of other RICs, U.S. government securities and other securities, with such other securities limited, in respect of any
one issuer, to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of the Trust’s total assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer and (b) not more than 25% of the value of the Trust’s total assets is
invested (x) in the securities (other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs) of any one issuer or of two or more issuers that the Trust controls and that are engaged in the same, similar or related trades or businesses or
(y) in the securities of one or more “qualified publicly traded partnerships.” A “qualified publicly traded partnership” is generally defined as an entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes
if (i) interests in such entity are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof and (ii) less than 90% of such entity’s gross income for the relevant
taxable year consists of Qualifying RIC Income. The Trust’s share of income derived from a partnership other than a “qualified publicly traded partnership” will be treated as Qualifying RIC Income only to the extent that such income
would have constituted Qualifying RIC Income if derived directly by the Trust. </p> <p>In order to be exempt from U.S. federal income tax on its distributed
income, the Trust must distribute to its Unitholders on a timely basis at least 90% of the sum of (i) its “investment company taxable income” (determined prior to the deduction for </p>
<p> </p> <p>12 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
dividends paid by the Trust) and (ii) its net <font>tax-exempt</font> interest income for each taxable year. In general, a RIC’s “investment company
taxable income” for any taxable year is its taxable income, determined without regard to net capital gain (that is, the excess of net long-term capital gains over net short-term capital losses) and with certain other adjustments. Any taxable
income, including any net capital gain, that the Trust does not distribute to its Unitholders in a timely manner will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates. </p>
<p>A RIC will be subject to a nondeductible 4% excise tax on certain amounts that it fails to distribute during each calendar year. In order to avoid this excise
tax, a RIC must distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98% of its ordinary taxable income for the calendar year, (ii) 98.2% of its capital gain net income for the
<font>one-year</font> period ended on October 31 of the calendar year and (iii) any ordinary income and capital gains for previous years that were not distributed during those years. For purposes of determining
whether the Trust has met this distribution requirement, (i) certain ordinary gains and losses that would otherwise be taken into account for the portion of the calendar year after October 31 will be treated as arising on January 1 of
the following calendar year and (ii) the Trust will be deemed to have distributed any income or gains on which it has paid U.S. federal income tax. </p>
<p>If the Trust failed to qualify as a RIC or failed to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement in any taxable year, the Trust would be subject to U.S. federal
income tax at regular corporate rates on its taxable income, including its net capital gain, even if such income were distributed to its Unitholders, and all distributions out of earnings and profits would be taxable as dividend income. Such
distributions generally would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction in the case of corporate U.S. Holders (defined below) and would constitute “qualified dividend income” for individual U.S. Holders. See “Federal Income
Taxes — Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders — Distributions.” In addition, the Trust could be required to recognize unrealized gains, pay taxes and make distributions (which could be subject to interest charges) before requalifying for
taxation as a RIC. If the Trust fails to satisfy the income test or diversification test described above, however, it may be able to avoid losing its status as a RIC by timely curing such failure, paying a tax and/or providing notice of such failure
to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”). </p> <p>In order to meet the distribution requirements necessary to be exempt from U.S. federal income
and excise tax, the Trust may be required to make distributions in excess of the yield performance of the Portfolio Securities and may be required to sell securities. </p>
<p><b><a name="toc280704_19"></a>Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders </b></p>
<p>The discussion in this section applies only to U.S. Holders. A “U.S. Holder” is (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United
States; (ii) a corporation, or other </p>
<p> </p> <p>13 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state therein or the District of Columbia; or (iii) an estate or trust the income of
which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source. </p> <p><i>Distributions</i>.    Distributions of the Trust’s
ordinary income and net short-term capital gains will, except as described below with respect to distributions of “qualified dividend income,” generally be taxable to U.S. Holders as ordinary income to the extent such distributions are
paid out of the Trust’s current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Distributions (or deemed distributions, as described below), if any, of net capital gains will be taxable as long-term
capital gains, regardless of the length of time the U.S. Holder has owned Units. A distribution of an amount in excess of the Trust’s current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a return of capital that will be applied
against and reduce the U.S. Holder’s basis in its Units. If the amount of any such distribution exceeds the U.S. Holder’s basis in its Units, the excess will be treated as gain from a sale or exchange of the Units. </p>
<p>The ultimate tax characterization of the distributions that the Trust makes during any taxable year cannot be determined until after the end of the taxable
year. As a result, it is possible that the Trust will make total distributions during a taxable year in an amount that exceeds its current and accumulated earnings and profits.
<font><font>Return-of-capital</font></font> distributions may result, for example, if the Trust makes distributions of cash amounts deposited in connection with Portfolio Deposits (as defined
below in “Purchases and Redemptions of Creation Units — Purchase (Creation)”). <font><font>Return-of-capital</font></font> distributions may be more likely to occur in periods
during which the number of outstanding Units fluctuates significantly. </p> <p>Distributions of the Trust’s “qualified dividend income” to an
individual or other <font>non-corporate</font> U.S. Holder will be treated as “qualified dividend income” and will therefore be taxed at rates applicable to long-term capital gains, provided that the U.S. Holder
meets certain holding period and other requirements with respect to its Units and that the Trust meets certain holding period and other requirements with respect to the underlying shares of stock. “Qualified dividend income” generally
includes dividends from domestic corporations and dividends from foreign corporations that meet certain specified criteria. </p> <p>Dividends distributed by the
Trust to a corporate U.S. Holder will qualify for the dividends-received deduction only to the extent that the dividends consist of distributions of dividends eligible for the dividends-received deduction received by the Trust, the Trust meets
certain holding period requirements with respect to the underlying shares of stock and the U.S. Holder meets certain holding period and other requirements with respect to the underlying shares of stock. Dividends eligible for the dividends-received
deduction generally are dividends from domestic corporations. </p>
<p> </p> <p>14 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>The Trust intends to distribute its net capital gains at least annually. If, however, the Trust retains any net
capital gains for reinvestment, it may elect to treat such net capital gains as having been distributed to the Unitholders. If the Trust makes such an election, each U.S. Holder will be required to report its share of such undistributed net capital
gain as long-term capital gain and will be entitled to claim its share of the U.S. federal income taxes paid by the Trust on such undistributed net capital gain as a credit against its own U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, and to claim a
refund on a properly filed U.S. federal income tax return to the extent that the credit exceeds such tax liability. In addition, each U.S. Holder will be entitled to increase the adjusted tax basis of its Units by the difference between its share of
such undistributed net capital gain and the related credit and/or refund. There can be no assurance that the Trust will make this election if it retains all or a portion of its net capital gain for a taxable year. </p>
<p>Because the tax treatment of a distribution depends upon the Trust’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, a distribution received shortly after
an acquisition of Units may be taxable, even though, as an economic matter, the distribution represents a return of the U.S. Holder’s initial investment. Although dividends generally will be treated as distributed when paid, dividends declared
in October, November or December, payable to Unitholders of record on a specified date in one of those months, and paid during the following January, will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as having been distributed by the Trust and
received by the Unitholders on December 31 of the year in which declared. Unitholders will be notified annually as to the U.S. federal tax status of distributions. </p>
<p><i>Sales and Redemptions of Units</i>.    In general, upon the sale or other disposition of Units, a U.S. Holder will recognize capital
gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized on the sale or other disposition and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the relevant Units. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain
or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the relevant Units was more than one year on the date of the sale or other disposition. Under current law, net capital gain (that is, the excess of net long-term capital gains over net short-term
capital losses) recognized by <font>non-corporate</font> U.S. Holders is generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at lower rates than the rates applicable to ordinary income. </p>
<p>Losses recognized by a U.S. Holder on the sale or other disposition of Units held for six months or less will be treated as long-term capital losses to the
extent of any distribution of long-term capital gain received (or deemed received, as discussed above) with respect to such Units. In addition, no loss will be allowed on a sale or other disposition of Units if the U.S. Holder acquires Units, or
enters into a contract or option to acquire Units, within 30 days before or after such sale or other disposition. In such a case, the basis of the Units acquired will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss. </p>
<p>If a U.S. Holder receives an <font>in-kind</font> distribution in redemption of Units (which must constitute a Creation Unit, as
discussed in “Purchases and Redemptions of Creation </p>
<p> </p> <p>15 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
Units — Redemption”), the U.S. Holder will realize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the aggregate fair market value as of the redemption date of the stocks and
cash received in the redemption and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the relevant Units. The U.S. Holder will generally have an initial tax basis in the distributed stocks equal to their respective fair market values on the redemption
date. The IRS may assert that any resulting loss may not be recognized on the ground that there has been no material change in the U.S. Holder’s economic position. The Trust will not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes
on an <font>in-kind</font> distribution in redemption of Creation Units. </p> <p>Under U.S. Treasury regulations, if a U.S. Holder
recognizes losses with respect to Units of $2 million or more for an individual U.S. Holder or $10 million or more for a corporate U.S. Holder, the U.S. Holder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement on IRS Form 8886. Direct
shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases exempted from this reporting requirement, but under current guidance, shareholders of a RIC are not exempted. The fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations does not affect the legal
determination of whether the U.S. Holder’s treatment of the loss is proper. Certain states may have similar disclosure requirements. </p> <p><i>Portfolio
Deposits</i>.    Upon the transfer of a Portfolio Deposit (as defined below in “Purchases and Redemptions of Creation Units — Purchase (Creation)”) to the Trust, a U.S. Holder will generally realize gain or loss
with respect to each stock included in the Portfolio Deposit in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount received with respect to such stock and the U.S. Holder’s basis in the stock. The amount received with respect to each
stock included in a Portfolio Deposit is determined by allocating among all of the stocks included in the Portfolio Deposit an amount equal to the fair market value of the Creation Units received (determined as of the date of transfer of the
Portfolio Deposit) plus the amount of any cash received from the Trust, reduced by the amount of any cash that the U.S. Holder pays to the Trust. This allocation is made among such stocks in accordance with their relative fair market values as of
the date of transfer of the Portfolio Deposit. The IRS may assert that any loss resulting from the transfer of a Portfolio Deposit to the Trust may not be recognized on the ground that there has been no material change in the economic position of
the U.S. Holder. The Trust will not recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes on the issuance of Creation Units in exchange for Portfolio Deposits. </p>
<p><i>Backup Withholding and Information Reporting</i>.    Payments on the Units and proceeds from a sale or other disposition of Units will
be subject to information reporting unless the U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient. A U.S. Holder will be subject to backup withholding on all such amounts unless (i) the U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient or (ii) the U.S. Holder provides
its correct taxpayer identification number (generally, on IRS Form <font>W-9)</font> and certifies that it is not subject to backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld
</p>
<p> </p> <p>16 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
pursuant to the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a credit against the U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle the U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that
the required information is furnished to the IRS on a timely basis. </p> <p><b><a name="toc280704_20"></a>Tax Consequences to
<font>Non-U.S.</font> Holders </b></p> <p>The discussion in this section applies only to
<font>Non-U.S.</font> Holders. A <font>“Non-U.S.</font> Holder” is a person that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is a beneficial owner of Units and is a nonresident alien
individual, a foreign corporation, a foreign trust or a foreign estate. The discussion below does not apply to a <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder who is a nonresident alien individual and is present in the United States for
183 days or more during any taxable year; a nonresident alien individual who is a former citizen or resident of the United States; an expatriated entity; a controlled foreign corporation; a passive foreign investment company; a foreign government
for purposes of Section 892 of the Code or a <font>tax-exempt</font> organization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holders should consult their tax advisors
with respect to the particular tax consequences to them of an investment in the Trust. The U.S. federal income taxation of a <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder depends on whether the income that the <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder derives from the Trust is “effectively connected” with a trade or business that the <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder conducts in the United States (and, if required
by an applicable tax treaty, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment maintained by the <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder). </p>
<p>If the income that a <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder derives from the Trust is not “effectively connected” with a U.S. trade
or business conducted by such <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder (or, if an applicable tax treaty so provides, the <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder does not maintain a permanent establishment in the United
States), distributions of “investment company taxable income” to such <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder will generally be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a rate of 30% (or lower rate under an applicable tax
treaty). Provided that certain requirements are satisfied, this withholding tax will not be imposed on dividends paid by the Trust to the extent that the underlying income out of which the dividends are paid consists of U.S.-source interest income
or short-term capital gains that would not have been subject to U.S. withholding tax if received directly by the <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder (“interest-related dividends” and “short-term capital gain
dividends,” respectively). </p> <p>A <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder whose income from the Trust is not “effectively
connected” with a U.S. trade or business (or, if an applicable tax treaty so provides, does not maintain a permanent establishment in the United States) will generally be exempt from U.S. federal income tax on capital gain dividends and any
amounts retained by the Trust that are designated as undistributed capital gains. In addition, such a <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder will generally be exempt from U.S. federal income tax on any gains realized upon the sale
or exchange of Units. </p> <p>If the income from the Trust is “effectively connected” with a U.S. trade or business carried on by a <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder (and, if required by an applicable tax treaty, is </p>
<p> </p> <p>17 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment maintained by the <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder), any distributions of “investment company taxable income,” any
capital gain dividends, any amounts retained by the Trust that are designated as undistributed capital gains and any gains realized upon the sale or exchange of Units will be subject to U.S. federal income tax, on a net income basis, at the rates
applicable to U.S. Holders. A <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder that is a corporation may also be subject to the U.S. branch profits tax. </p>
<p>Information returns will be filed with the IRS in connection with certain payments on the Units and may be filed in connection with payments of the proceeds
from a sale or other disposition of Units. A <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder may be subject to backup withholding on distributions or on the proceeds from a redemption or other disposition of Units if such <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder does not certify its <font>non-U.S.</font> status under penalties of perjury or otherwise establish an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts
withheld pursuant to the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a credit against the <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, and may entitle the
<font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder to a refund, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS on a timely basis. </p> <p>In
order to qualify for the exemption from U.S. withholding on interest-related dividends, to qualify for an exemption from U.S. backup withholding and to qualify for a reduced rate of U.S. withholding tax on Trust distributions pursuant to an income
tax treaty, a <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder must generally deliver to the withholding agent a properly executed IRS form (generally, Form <font>W-8BEN</font> or Form
<font><font>W-8BEN-E,</font></font> as applicable). In order to claim a refund of any Trust-level taxes imposed on undistributed net capital gain, any withholding taxes or any backup withholding,
a <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder must obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number and file a U.S. federal income tax return, even if the <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holder would not otherwise be
required to obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number or file a U.S. income tax return. </p> <p>Under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code
(“FATCA”), a withholding tax at the rate of 30% will generally be imposed on payments of dividends on Units to certain foreign entities (including financial intermediaries) unless the foreign entity provides the withholding agent with
certifications and other information (which may include information relating to ownership by U.S. persons of interests in, or accounts with, the foreign entity). Treasury and the IRS have issued proposed regulations that (i) provide that
“withholdable payments” will not include gross proceeds from the disposition of property that can produce U.S. source dividends or interest, as otherwise would have been the case after December 31, 2018 and (ii) state that
taxpayers may rely on these provisions of the proposed regulations until final regulations are issued. If FATCA withholding is imposed, a beneficial owner of Units that is not a foreign financial institution generally may obtain a refund of any
amounts withheld by filing a U.S. federal income tax return (which may entail significant administrative burden). <font>Non-U.S.</font> Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of FATCA
on their investment in Units. </p>

<p>We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including the schedule of investments, of SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (the
“Trust”) as of September 30, 2021, the related statements of operations and of changes in net assets for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2021, including the related notes, and the financial highlights
for each of the five years in the period ended September 30, 2021 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Trust as of September 30, 2021, the results of its operations and the changes in its net assets for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2021 and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period
ended September 30, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. </p> <p><b>Basis for Opinion </b></p>
<p>These financial statements are the responsibility of the Trust’s management (the Trustee). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Trust’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Trust in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. </p> <p>We conducted our
audits of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement,
whether due to error or fraud. </p> <p>Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management (the Trustee), as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of
September 30, 2021 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers; when replies were not received from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. </p>

<p><b>September 30, 2021 </b></p> <p> </p>
<p> </p> <p><b>Note 1 — Organization </b></p>
<p>SPDR S&amp;P 500<sup>®</sup> ETF Trust (the “Trust”) is a unit investment trust created under the laws
of the State of New York and registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Trust is an “Exchange-Traded Fund”, the units of which are listed on and traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol
“SPY”, and operates under an exemptive order granted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The Trust was created to provide investors with the opportunity to purchase a security representing a proportionate
undivided interest in a portfolio of securities consisting of substantially all of the component common stocks, in substantially the same weighting, which comprise the Standard &amp; Poor’s
500<sup>®</sup> Index (the “S&amp;P 500<sup>®</sup> Index”). Each unit of fractional undivided interest in the Trust is referred to as a
“Unit”. The Trust commenced operations on January 22, 1993 upon the initial issuance of 150,000 Units (equivalent to three “Creation Units” — see Note 4) in exchange for a portfolio of securities assembled to reflect
the intended portfolio composition of the Trust. </p> <p>Effective June 16, 2017, State Street Bank and Trust Company (“SSBT”) resigned as trustee
of the Trust. PDR Services, LLC, as sponsor of the Trust (the “Sponsor”), appointed State Street Global Advisors Trust Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SSBT, as trustee of the Trust (the “Trustee”). </p>
<p>The services received, and the trustee fees paid, by the Trust have not changed as a result of the change in the identity of the Trustee. SSBT continues to
maintain the Trust’s accounting records, act as custodian and transfer agent to the Trust, and provide administrative services, including the filing of certain regulatory reports. </p>
<p>Under the Amended and Restated Standard Terms and Conditions of the Trust, as amended (the “Trust Agreement”), the Sponsor and the Trustee are
indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties to the Trust. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Trust enters into contracts that contain general indemnification clauses. The Trust’s
maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Trust that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, the Trustee expects the risk of material loss to be remote. </p>
<p>The Sponsor is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (“ICE”). ICE is a publicly-traded entity, trading on the New
York Stock Exchange under the symbol “ICE.” </p>

<p><b>Notes to Financial Statements </b></p> <p><b>September 30, 2021
</b></p> <p> </p> <p> </p>
<p><b>Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies </b></p>
<p>The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Trustee in the preparation of the Trust’s financial statements: </p>
<p>The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) requires the Trustee to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Trust is an investment company under U.S. GAAP and follows the accounting and reporting
guidance applicable to investment companies. </p> <p><b>Security Valuation </b></p>
<p>The Trust’s investments are valued at fair value each day that the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) is open and, for financial reporting
purposes, as of the report date should the reporting period end on a day that the NYSE is not open. Fair value is generally defined as the price a fund would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. By its nature, a fair value price is a good faith estimate of the valuation in a current sale and may not reflect an actual market price. The investments of the Trust are valued pursuant to the policy and
procedures developed by the Oversight Committee of the Trustee (the “Committee”). The Committee provides oversight of the valuation of investments for the Trust. </p>
<p>Valuation techniques used to value the Trust’s equity investments are as follows: </p>
<p>Equity investments (including preferred stocks) traded on a recognized securities exchange for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the
last sale price or official closing price, as applicable, on the primary market or exchange on which they trade. Equity investments traded on a recognized exchange for which there were no sales on that day are valued at the last published sale price
or at fair value. </p> <p>In the event that prices or quotations are not readily available or that the application of these valuation methods results in a price
for an investment that is deemed to be not representative of the fair value of such investment, fair value will be determined in good faith by the Committee, in accordance with the valuation policy and procedures approved by the Trustee. </p>
<p>Fair value pricing could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Trust’s net asset value (“NAV”) and the prices used by
the Trust’s underlying index, the S&amp;P 500<sup>®</sup> Index, which in turn could result in a difference between the Trust’s performance and the performance of the S&amp;P 500<sup>®</sup> Index. </p>

</b></p> <p> </p> <p> </p>
<p><b>Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – (continued) </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Trustee values the Trust’s assets and liabilities at fair value using a hierarchy that prioritizes
the inputs to valuation techniques, giving the highest priority to readily available unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3
measurements) when market prices are not readily available or reliable. The categorization of a value determined for an investment within the hierarchy is based upon the pricing transparency of the investment and is not necessarily an indication of
the risk associated with the investment. </p> <p>The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: </p>
<p> </p>
<table>
<tr>
<td> </td>
<td>•</td>
<td> </td>
<td> <p>Level 1 — Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
</p></td></tr></table> <p> </p>
<table>
<tr>
<td> </td>
<td>•</td>
<td> </td>
<td> <p>Level 2 — Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the
assets or liabilities either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not considered to be active, inputs
other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (such as exchange rates, financing terms, interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates) or other
market-corroborated inputs; and </p></td></tr></table> <p> </p>
<table>
<tr>
<td> </td>
<td>•</td>
<td> </td>
<td> <p>Level 3 — Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, including the Committee’s assumptions
used in determining the fair value of investments. </p></td></tr></table> <p><b>Investment Transactions and Income Recognition </b></p>
<p>Investment transactions are accounted for on the trade date for financial reporting purposes. Dividend income and capital gain distributions, if any, are
recognized on the <font>ex-dividend</font> date, or when the information becomes available, net of any foreign taxes withheld at source, if any. <font>Non-cash</font> dividends received in the
form of stock, if any, are recorded as dividend income at fair value. Distributions received by the Trust may include a return of capital that is estimated by the Trustee. Such amounts are recorded as a reduction of the cost of investments or
reclassified to capital gains. The Trust invests in real estate investment trusts (“REITs”). REITs determine the characterization of their income annually and may characterize a portion of their distributions as a return of capital or
capital gain. The Trustee’s policy is to record all REIT distributions as dividend income initially and <font>re-designate</font> a portion to return of capital or capital gain distributions at year end based on
information provided by the REIT and/or Trustee’s estimates of such <font>re-designations</font> for which actual information </p>

has not yet been reported. Realized gains and losses from the sale or disposition of investments are determined using the identified cost method. </p>
<p><b>Distributions </b></p> <p>The Trust declares and distributes
dividends from net investment income, if any, to its holders of Units (“Unitholders”), quarterly. Capital gain distributions, if any, are generally declared and paid annually. Additional distributions may be paid by the Trust to avoid
imposition of federal income and excise tax on any remaining undistributed net investment income and capital gains. The amount and character of income and gains to be distributed are determined in accordance with federal tax regulations which may
differ from net investment income and realized gains recognized for U.S. GAAP purposes. </p> <p><b>Equalization </b></p>
<p>The Trustee follows the accounting practice known as “Equalization” by which a portion of the proceeds from sales and costs of reacquiring the
Trust’s Units, equivalent on a per Unit basis to the amount of distributable net investment income on the date of the transaction, is credited or charged to undistributed net investment income. As a result, undistributed net investment income
per Unit is unaffected by sales or reacquisitions of the Trust’s Units. Amounts related to Equalization can be found on the Statements of Changes in Net Assets. </p>
<p><b>Federal Income Taxes </b></p> <p>For U.S. federal income tax
purposes, the Trust has qualified as a “regulated investment company” under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (a “RIC”), and intends to continue to qualify as a RIC. As a RIC, the Trust will generally
not be subject to U.S. federal income tax for any taxable year on income, including net capital gains, that it distributes to its Unitholders, provided that it distributes on a timely basis at least 90% of its “investment company taxable
income” determined prior to the deduction for dividends paid by the Trust (generally, its taxable income other than net capital gain) for such taxable year. In addition, provided that the Trust distributes substantially all of its ordinary
income and capital gains during each calendar year, the Trust will not be subject to U.S. federal excise tax. Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with U.S. federal income tax principles, which may differ from U.S.
GAAP. These <font>book-tax</font> differences are primarily due to differing treatments for <font>in-kind</font> transactions, REITs and losses deferred due to wash sales. </p>

</b></p> <p> </p> <p> </p>
<p><b>Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – (continued) </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>U.S. GAAP requires the evaluation of tax positions taken in the course of preparing the Trust’s tax
returns to determine whether the tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. For U.S. GAAP purposes, the Trust recognizes the tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only when the position is more likely
than not to be sustained, assuming examination by tax authorities. </p> <p>The Trustee has reviewed the Trust’s tax positions for the open tax years as of
September 30, 2021 and has determined that no provision for income tax is required in the Trust’s financial statements. Generally, the Trust’s tax returns for the prior three fiscal years remain subject to examinations by the
Trust’s major tax jurisdictions, which include the United States of America, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the State of New York. The Trustee has the Trust recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to tax liabilities as income
tax expense in the Statements of Operations. There were no such expenses for the year ended September 30, 2021. </p> <p>No income tax returns are currently

liabilities. Any potential tax liability is also subject to ongoing interpretation of laws by taxing authorities. The tax treatment of the Trust’s investments may change over time based on factors including, but not limited to, new tax laws,
regulations and interpretations thereof. </p> <p>During the year ended September 30, 2021, the Trustee reclassified $73,003,566,634 of <font>non-taxable</font> security gains realized from the <font>in-kind</font> redemption of Creation Units (Note 4) as an increase to paid in capital in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. </p>

December 30, 1997, the Sponsor is reimbursed by the Trust for certain expenses up to a maximum of 0.20% of the Trust’s NAV on an annualized basis. The expenses reimbursed to the Sponsor for the years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and
2019, did not exceed 0.20% per annum. The licensing and marketing fee disclosed below are subject to both the reimbursement from the Trust to the Sponsor and expense limitation of 0.20% of the Trust’s NAV for the years ended September 30,
2021, 2020 and 2019. The Trust reimbursed the Sponsor for $519,011, $402,393, and $549,533 of legal fees for the years ended September 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, which are included in Legal and audit fees on the Statements of

Street Global Advisors Funds Distributors, LLC (“SSGA FD” or the “Marketing Agent”) have entered into a license agreement (the “License Agreement”). The License Agreement grants SSGA FD, an affiliate of the Trustee, a
license to use the S&amp;P 500<sup>®</sup> Index and to use certain trade names and trademarks of S&amp;P in connection with the Trust. The S&amp;P
500<sup>®</sup> Index also serves as the basis for determining the composition of the Trust’s portfolio. The Trustee (on behalf of the Trust), the Sponsor and NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”,
the principal U.S. listing exchange for the Trust) have each received a sublicense from SSGA FD for the use of the S&amp;P 500<sup>®</sup> Index and certain trade names and trademarks in connection with
their rights and duties with respect to the Trust. The License Agreement may be amended without the consent of any of the owners of beneficial interests of Units. Currently, the License Agreement is scheduled to terminate on November 29, 2031,
but its term may be extended without the consent of any of the owners of beneficial interests of Units. Pursuant to such arrangements and in accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trust reimburses the Sponsor for payment of fees under the License

<p>The Sponsor has entered into an agreement with the Marketing Agent pursuant to which the Marketing Agent has agreed to market and promote the Trust. The
Marketing Agent is reimbursed by the Sponsor for the expenses it incurs for providing such services out of amounts that the Trust reimburses the Sponsor. Expenses incurred by the Marketing Agent include, but are not limited to: printing and

<p>ALPS Distributors, Inc. (the “Distributor”) serves as the distributor of the Units. The Sponsor
pays the Distributor for its services a flat annual fee of $25,000, and the Trust does not reimburse the Sponsor for this fee. </p> <p><b>Investments in
Affiliates of the Trustee and the Sponsor </b></p> <p>The Trust has invested in companies that are considered affiliates of the Trustee (State Street Corp.) and
the Sponsor (ICE). Such investments were made according to the representative portion of the S&amp;P 500<sup>®</sup> Index. The market values of these investments at September 30, 2021 are listed in
the Schedule of Investments. </p> <p><b>Note 4 — Unitholder Transactions </b></p>
<p>Units are issued and redeemed by the Trust only in Creation Unit size aggregations of 50,000 Units. Such transactions are only permitted on an <font>in-kind</font> basis, with a separate cash payment that is equivalent to the undistributed net investment income per Unit (income equalization) and a balancing cash component to equate the transaction to the NAV per Unit
of the Trust on the transaction date. There is a transaction fee payable to the Trustee in connection with each creation and redemption of Creation Units made through the clearing process (the “Transaction Fee”). The Transaction Fee is <font>non-refundable,</font> regardless of the NAV of the Trust. The Transaction Fee is the lesser of $3,000 or 0.10% (10 basis points) of the value of one Creation Unit at the time of creation per participating party per day,
regardless of the number of Creation Units created or redeemed on such day. The Transaction Fee is currently $3,000. For creations and redemptions outside the clearing process, including orders from a participating party restricted from engaging in
transactions in one or more of the common stocks that are included in the S&amp;P 500<sup>®</sup> Index, an additional amount not to exceed three (3) times the Transaction Fee applicable for one
Creation Unit is charged per Creation Unit per day. </p> <p><b>Note 5 — Investment Transactions </b></p>
<p>For the year ended September 30, 2021, the Trust had <font>in-kind</font> contributions,
<font>in-kind</font> redemptions, purchases and sales of investment securities of $327,531,902,003, $317,538,556,954, $12,387,467,621, and $12,351,400,877, respectively. Net realized gain (loss) on investment transactions

political developments, changes in interest rates, perceived trends in securities prices, war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious disease or other public health issues. Local, regional
or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious disease or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Trust and its investments and could result in increased premiums or
discounts to the Trust’s net asset value. </p> <p>An investment in the Trust is subject to the risks of any investment in a broadly based portfolio of equity
securities, including the risk that the general level of stock prices may decline, thereby adversely affecting the value of such investment. The value of common stocks actually held by the Trust and that make up the Trust’s portfolio (the
“Portfolio Securities”) may fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the issuers of Portfolio Securities, the value of equity securities generally and other factors. The identity and weighting of common stocks
that are included in the S&amp;P 500<sup>®</sup> Index and the Portfolio Securities change from time to time. </p>
<p>The financial condition of issuers of Portfolio Securities may become impaired or the general condition of the stock market may deteriorate, either of which
may cause a decrease in the value of the Trust’s portfolio and thus in the value of Units. Since the Trust is not actively managed, the adverse financial condition of an issuer will not result in its elimination from the Trust’s portfolio
unless such issuer is removed from the S&amp;P 500<sup>®</sup> Index. Equity securities are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations and to volatile increases and decreases in value as market
confidence in and perceptions of their issuers change. These investor perceptions are based on various and unpredictable factors, including expectations regarding government, economic, monetary and fiscal policies, inflation and interest rates,
economic expansion or contraction, and global or regional political, economic and banking crises, as well as war, acts of terrorism and the spread of infectious disease or other public health issues. </p>
<p>An outbreak of infectious respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus known as <font>COVID-19</font> was first detected in
China in December 2019 and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. This coronavirus has resulted in travel restrictions, restrictions on gatherings of people (including closings of, or limitations on, dining and
entertainment establishments, as well as schools and universities), closed businesses (or businesses that are restricted in their operations), closed international borders, enhanced health screenings at ports of entry and elsewhere, disruption of
and delays in healthcare service preparation and delivery, prolonged quarantines, cancellations, supply chain disruptions, and lower consumer demand, as well as general concern and uncertainty. The impact of

<p>
other infectious disease outbreaks that may arise in the future, could adversely affect the economies of many nations or the entire global economy, individual issuers and capital markets in ways
that cannot be foreseen. Public health crises caused by the <font>COVID-19</font> outbreak may exacerbate other <font>pre-existing</font> political, social and economic risks in certain countries
or globally. The duration of the <font>COVID-19</font> outbreak cannot be determined with certainty. The risk of further spreading of <font>COVID-19</font> has led to significant uncertainty and
volatility in the financial markets and disruption to the global economy, the consequences of which are currently unpredictable. Certain of the Trust’s investments are likely to have exposure to businesses that, as a result of <font>COVID-19,</font> experience a slowdown or temporary suspension in business activities. These factors, as well as any restrictive measures instituted in order to prevent or control a pandemic or other public health crisis,
such as the one posed by <font>COVID-19,</font> could have a material and adverse effect on the Trust’s investments. </p>
<p>Holders of common stocks of any given issuer incur more risk than holders of preferred stocks and debt obligations of the issuer because the rights of common
stockholders, as owners of the issuer, generally are subordinate to the rights of creditors of, or holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks issued by, such issuer. Further, unlike debt securities that typically have a stated principal amount
payable at maturity, or preferred stocks that typically have a liquidation preference and may have stated optional or mandatory redemption provisions, common stocks have neither a fixed principal amount nor a maturity. Equity securities values are
subject to market fluctuations as long as the equity securities remain outstanding. The value of the Trust’s portfolio will fluctuate over the entire life of the Trust. </p>
<p>There can be no assurance that the issuers of Portfolio Securities will pay dividends. Distributions generally depend upon the declaration of dividends by the
issuers of Portfolio Securities and the declaration of such dividends generally depends upon various factors, including the financial condition of the issuers and general economic conditions. </p>
<p><b>Note 7 — Subsequent Events </b></p> <p>The Trustee has
evaluated the impact of all subsequent events on the Trust through the date on which the financial statements were issued and has determined that there were no subsequent events requiring adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements. </p>

<p><b><a name="toc280704_29"></a>ORGANIZATION OF THE TRUST </b></p>
<p>The Trust is a unit investment trust that issues Units. The Trust is organized under New York law and is governed by an amended and restated trust agreement
between the Trustee and the Sponsor, dated as of January 1, 2004 and effective as of January 27, 2004, as amended (the “Trust Agreement”). The Trust is an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (the “1940 Act”). Units represent an undivided ownership interest in Portfolio Securities of the Trust. </p> <p>The Trust has a specified
lifetime term. The Trust is scheduled to terminate on the first to occur of (a) January 22, 2118 or (b) the date 20 years after the death of the last survivor of eleven persons named in the Trust Agreement, the oldest of whom was born
in 1990 and the youngest of whom was born in 1993. Upon termination, the Trust may be liquidated and pro rata Units of the assets of the Trust, net of certain fees and expenses, distributed to holders of Units. </p>
<p><b><a name="toc280704_30"></a>PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS OF CREATION UNITS </b></p>
<p>The Trust, a registered investment company, is an exchange traded fund or “ETF.” The Trust continuously issues and redeems <font>“in-kind”</font> its Units only in specified large lots of 50,000 Units or multiples thereof, which are referred to as “Creation Units,” at their once-daily NAV. Units are listed individually for
trading on the Exchange at prices established throughout the trading day, like any other listed equity security trading on the Exchange in the secondary market. </p>
<p>ALPS Distributors, Inc., the distributor of the Trust (the “Distributor”), acts as underwriter of Units on an agency basis. The Distributor maintains
records of the Creation Unit orders placed with it and the confirmations of acceptance and furnishes confirmations of acceptance of the orders to those placing such orders. The Distributor also is responsible for delivering a prospectus to
authorized participants creating Units. The Distributor also maintains a record of the delivery instructions in response to Creation Unit orders and may provide certain other administrative services. </p>
<p>For purposes of the disclosure relating to the purchase and redemption of Units below, the “Trustee” may refer to SSBT in its capacity as the
Administrator, Custodian and/or Transfer Agent for the Trustee. </p> <p><b><a name="toc280704_31"></a>Purchase (Creation) </b></p>
<p>Before trading on the Exchange in the secondary market, Units are created at NAV in Creation Units. All orders for Creation Units must be placed with the
Distributor as facilitated through the Trustee. To be eligible to place these orders, an entity or person must be an “Authorized Participant,” which is (a) either a “Participating Party” or a “DTC Participant” and
(b) in each case must have executed an agreement with the Distributor and the Trustee (the “Participant Agreement”). The term </p>
<p> </p> <p>51 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
“Participating Party” means a broker-dealer or other participant in the Clearing Process (as defined below) through the Continuous Net Settlement (“CNS”) System of the
National Securities Clearing Corporation (“NSCC”), a clearing agency registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and the term “DTC Participant” means a participant in DTC. Payment for orders is made
by deposits with the Trustee of a portfolio of securities, substantially similar in composition and weighting to Index Securities, and a cash payment in an amount equal to the Dividend Equivalent Payment (as defined below), plus or minus the
Balancing Amount (as defined below in “Portfolio Adjustments — Adjustments to the Portfolio Deposit”). “Dividend Equivalent Payment” is an amount equal, on a per Creation Unit basis, to the dividends on the Portfolio (with <font>ex-dividend</font> dates within the accumulation period), net of expenses and accrued liabilities for such period (including, without limitation, (i) taxes or other governmental charges against the Trust not
previously deducted, if any, (ii) accrued fees of the Trustee and (iii) other expenses of the Trust (including legal and auditing expenses) not previously deducted), calculated as if all of the Portfolio Securities had been held for the
entire accumulation period for such distribution. The Dividend Equivalent Payment and the Balancing Amount collectively are referred to as the “Cash Component” and the deposit of a portfolio of securities and the Cash Component
collectively are referred to as a “Portfolio Deposit.” Persons placing creation orders must deposit Portfolio Deposits either (i) through the CNS clearing process of NSCC (the “Clearing Process”) or (ii) with the
Trustee outside the Clearing Process (<i>i.e., </i>through the facilities of DTC). </p> <p>The Distributor will reject any order that is not submitted in proper
form. A creation order is deemed received by the Distributor on the date on which it is placed (“Transmittal Date”) if (a) such order is received by the Trustee not later than the Closing Time (as defined below) on such Transmittal
Date and (b) all other procedures set forth in the Participant Agreement are properly followed. The Transaction Fee (as defined below) is charged at the time of creation of a Creation Unit, and an additional amount not to exceed three
(3) times the Transaction Fee applicable for one Creation Unit is charged for creations outside the Clearing Process, in part due to the increased expense associated with settlement. </p>
<p>The Trustee, at the direction of the Sponsor, may increase, reduce or waive the Transaction Fee (and/or the additional amounts charged in connection with
creations and/or redemptions outside the Clearing Process) for certain <font>lot-size</font> creations and/or redemptions of Creation Units. The Sponsor has the right to vary the
<font>lot-size</font> of Creation Units subject to such an increase, a reduction or waiver. The existence of any such variation shall be disclosed in the then current prospectus. </p>
<p>The Trustee makes available to NSCC before the commencement of trading on each business day that the New York Stock Exchange LLC (the “NYSE”) is open
for business (“Business Day”) a list of the names and required number of shares of each of the Index Securities in the current Portfolio Deposit as well as the amount of the Dividend Equivalent Payment for the previous Business Day. The
identity and </p>
<p> </p> <p>52 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
weightings of the Index Securities to be delivered as part of a Portfolio Deposit are determined daily and reflect the relative weighting of the current Index. The value of such Index Securities,
together with the Cash Component, is equal to the net asset value of the Trust on a per Creation Unit basis at the close of business on the day of the creation request. The Sponsor makes available every 15 seconds throughout the trading day at the
Exchange a number representing, on a per Unit basis, the sum of the Dividend Equivalent Payment effective through and including the previous Business Day, plus the current value of the securities portion of a Portfolio Deposit as in effect on such
day (which value occasionally may include a <font><font>cash-in-lieu</font></font> amount to compensate for the omission of a particular Index Security from such Portfolio Deposit). Such
information is calculated based upon the best information available to the Sponsor and may be calculated by other persons designated to do so by the Sponsor. The inability of the Sponsor to provide such information will not by itself result in a
halt in the trading of Units on the Exchange. </p> <p>If the Trustee determines that one or more Index Securities are likely to be unavailable, or available in
insufficient quantity, for delivery upon creation of Creation Units, the Trustee may permit, in lieu thereof, the cash equivalent value of one or more of these Index Securities to be included in the Portfolio Deposit as a part of the Cash Component.
If a creator is restricted by regulation or otherwise from investing or engaging in a transaction in one or more Index Securities, the Trustee may permit, in lieu of the inclusion of such Index Securities in the stock portion of the Portfolio
Deposit, the cash equivalent value of such Index Securities to be included in the Portfolio Deposit based on the market value of such Index Securities as of the closing time of the regular trading session on the NYSE (the “Closing Time”)
(ordinarily 4:00 p.m. New York time) (the “Evaluation Time”) on the date such creation order is deemed received by the Distributor as part of the Cash Component. </p>
<p><i>Procedures for Purchase of Creation Units.</i><b>    </b>All creation orders must be placed in Creation Units and must be received by
the Trustee by no later than the Closing Time (ordinarily 4:00 p.m. New York time) in each case on the date such order is placed, in order for creation to be effected based on the NAV of the Trust as determined on such date. Orders must be
transmitted by telephone, through the Internet or by other transmission method(s) acceptable to the Distributor and the Trustee, pursuant to procedures set forth in the Participant Agreement and/or described in this prospectus. In addition, orders
submitted through the Internet must also comply with the terms and provisions of the State Street Fund Connect <font>Buy-Side</font> User Agreement and other applicable agreements and documents, including but not limited
to the applicable Fund Connect User Guide or successor documents. An affiliate of State Street Global Advisors Funds Distributors, LLC (“SSGA FD”) may assist Authorized Participants in assembling shares to purchase Creation Units (or upon
redemption), for which it may receive commissions or other fees from such Authorized Participants. Severe economic or market disruptions or changes, or telephone or other communication failure, may impede the ability to reach the Distributor, the
Trustee, a Participating Party or a DTC Participant. </p>
<p> </p> <p>53 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>Units may be created in advance of receipt by the Trustee of all or a portion of the Portfolio Deposit. In these
circumstances, the initial deposit will have a value greater than the NAV of the Units on the date the order is placed in proper form, because in addition to available Index Securities, cash collateral must be deposited with the Trustee in an amount
equal to the sum of (a) the Cash Component, plus (b) 115% of the market value of the undelivered Index Securities (“Additional Cash Deposit”). The Trustee holds such Additional Cash Deposit as collateral in an account separate and
apart from the Trust. An order will be deemed received on the Business Day on which it is placed so long as (a) the order is placed in proper form before the Closing Time on such Business Day and (b) federal funds in the appropriate amount
are deposited with the Trustee by 1:00 p.m. New York time or such other time as designated by the Trustee on settlement date. </p> <p>If the order is not placed
in proper form by the Closing Time or federal funds in the appropriate amount are not received by 1:00 p.m. New York time on settlement date, the order may be deemed to be rejected and the Authorized Participant shall be liable to the Trust for any
losses resulting therefrom. An additional amount of cash must be deposited with the Trustee, pending delivery of the missing Index Securities, to the extent necessary to maintain the Additional Cash Deposit with the Trustee in an amount at least
equal to 115% of the daily <font><font>mark-to-market</font></font> value of the missing Index Securities. If the missing Index Securities are not received by 1:00 p.m. New York time on the
prescribed settlement date following the day on which the purchase order is deemed received and if a <font><font>mark-to-market</font></font> payment is not made within one (1) Business Day
following notification by the Distributor that such payment is required, the Trustee may use the Additional Cash Deposit to purchase the missing Index Securities. The Trustee will return any unused portion of the Additional Cash Deposit only once
all of the missing Index Securities of the Portfolio Deposit have been properly received or purchased by the Trustee and deposited into the Trust. In addition, a Transaction Fee will be imposed in an amount not to exceed that charged for creations
outside the Clearing Process as disclosed below. The delivery of Creation Units created as described above will occur no later than the prescribed settlement date. The Participant Agreement for any Participating Party intending to follow these
procedures contains terms and conditions permitting the Trustee to buy the missing portion(s) of a Portfolio Deposit at any time and will subject the Participating Party to liability for any shortfall between the cost to the Trust of purchasing such
stocks and the value of such collateral. The Participating Party is liable to the Trust for the costs incurred by the Trust in connection with any such purchases. The Trust will have no liability for any such shortfall. </p>
<p><i>Acceptance of Orders of Creation Units.</i><b>    </b>All questions as to the number of shares of each Index Security, the amount of the
Cash Component and the validity, form, eligibility (including time of receipt) and acceptance for deposit of any Index Securities to be delivered are resolved by the Trustee. The Trustee may reject a creation order if (a) the depositor or a
group of depositors, upon obtaining the Units ordered, would own 80% or more of the current outstanding Units; (b) the Portfolio Deposit is not in proper form; (c) acceptance of the Portfolio Deposit would have
</p>
<p> </p> <p>54 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
certain adverse tax consequences; (d) the acceptance of the Portfolio Deposit would, in the opinion of counsel, be unlawful; (e) the acceptance of the Portfolio Deposit would otherwise
have an adverse effect on the Trust or the rights of Beneficial Owners; or (f) circumstances outside the control of the Trustee make it for all practical purposes impossible to process creations of Units. The Trustee and the Sponsor are under
no duty to give notification of any defects or irregularities in the delivery of Portfolio Deposits or any component thereof and neither of them will incur any liability for the failure to give any such notification. </p>
<p><i>Creation Transaction Fee.    </i>The transaction fee payable to the Trustee in connection with each creation and redemption of Creation
Units made through the Clearing Process (the “Transaction Fee”) is <font>non-refundable,</font> regardless of the NAV of the Trust. The Transaction Fee is the lesser of $3,000 or 0.10% (10 basis points) of the
value of one Creation Unit at the time of creation (“10 Basis Point Limit”) per Participating Party per day, regardless of the number of Creation Units created or redeemed on such day. The Transaction Fee is currently $3,000. </p>
<p>For creations and redemptions outside the Clearing Process, including orders from a Participating Party restricted from engaging in transactions in one or more
Index Securities, an additional amount not to exceed three (3) times the Transaction Fee applicable for one Creation Unit is charged per Creation Unit per day. </p>
<p><i>Placement of Creation Orders Using Clearing Process.</i><b>    </b>Creation Units created through the Clearing Process must be delivered
through a Participating Party that has executed a Participant Agreement. The Participant Agreement authorizes the Trustee to transmit to the Participating Party such trade instructions as are necessary to effect the creation order. Pursuant to the
trade instructions from the Trustee to NSCC, the Participating Party agrees to transfer the requisite Index Securities (or contracts to purchase such Index Securities that are expected to be delivered through the Clearing Process in a “regular
way” manner by the second day during which NSCC is open for business (each such day, an “NSCC Business Day”)) and the Cash Component to the Trustee, together with such additional information as may be required by the Trustee. </p>
<p><i>Placement of Creation Orders Outside Clearing Process.</i><b>    </b>Creation Units created outside the Clearing Process must be
delivered through a DTC Participant that has executed a Participant Agreement and has stated in its order that it is not using the Clearing Process and that creation will instead be effected through a transfer of stocks and cash. The requisite
number of Index Securities must be delivered through DTC to the account of the Trustee by no later than 1:00 p.m. New York time on settlement date. The Trustee, through the Federal Reserve Bank wire transfer system, must receive the Cash Component
no later than 1:00 p.m. New York time on settlement date. If the Trustee does not receive both the requisite Index Securities and the Cash Component in a timely fashion, the order may be cancelled. Upon written notice to the Distributor, the
cancelled order may be resubmitted the following Business Day using a Portfolio Deposit as newly constituted to reflect the current NAV of the Trust. The delivery of Units so created will occur no later than the prescribed settlement date. </p>
<p> </p> <p>55 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p><b><a name="toc280704_32"></a>Redemption </b></p>
<p>Units may be redeemed <font>in-kind</font> only in Creation Units at their NAV determined after receipt of a redemption request in
proper form by the Trustee through the Depository and relevant DTC Participant and only on a Business Day. Units are not redeemable for cash. EXCEPT UPON LIQUIDATION OF THE TRUST, THE TRUST WILL NOT REDEEM UNITS IN AMOUNTS LESS THAN CREATION UNITS.
Investors must accumulate enough Units in the secondary market to constitute a Creation Unit in order to have such Units redeemed by the Trust, and Units may be redeemed only by or through an Authorized Participant. There can be no assurance,
however, that there will be sufficient liquidity in the public trading market at any time to permit assembly of a Creation Unit. Investors should expect to incur brokerage and other costs in connection with assembling a sufficient number of Units to
constitute a redeemable Creation Unit. </p> <p>With respect to the Trust, the Trustee, through NSCC, makes available immediately prior to the commencement of
trading on the NYSE (currently 9:30 a.m., Eastern time) on each Business Day, a list of the names and required number of shares of each of the Index Securities and the amount of the Dividend Equivalent Payment for the previous Business Day that will
be applicable (subject to possible amendment or correction) to redemption requests received in proper form (as discussed below) on that day. Index Securities received on redemption may not be identical to the stock portion of the Portfolio Deposit
which is applicable to purchases of Creation Units. </p> <p><i>Redemption Transaction Fee.</i>    The Transaction Fee is <font>non-refundable,</font> regardless of the NAV of the Trust. The Transaction Fee is the lesser of $3,000 or the 10 Basis Point Limit per Participating Party per day, regardless of the number of Creation Units created or
redeemed on such day. The Transaction Fee is currently $3,000. </p> <p>For creations and redemptions outside the Clearing Process, including orders from a
Participating Party restricted from engaging in transactions in one or more Index Securities, an additional amount not to exceed three (3) times the Transaction Fee applicable for one Creation Unit is charged per Creation Unit per day. </p>
<p><i>Procedures for Redemption of Creation Units</i>.    Redemption orders must be placed with a Participating Party (for redemptions through
the Clearing Process) or DTC Participant (for redemptions outside the Clearing Process), as applicable, in the form required by such Participating Party or DTC Participant. A particular broker may not have executed a Participant Agreement, and
redemption orders may have to be placed by the broker through a Participating Party or DTC Participant who has executed a Participant Agreement. At any given time, there may be only a limited number of broker-dealers that have executed a Participant
Agreement. Redeemers should afford sufficient time to permit (a) proper submission of the order by a Participating Party or DTC Participant to the Trustee and (b) the receipt by the Trustee of the Units to be redeemed and any Excess Cash
Amounts (as defined below) in a timely manner. Orders for redemption effected outside the Clearing Process are likely to require transmittal by the relevant DTC Participant(s) earlier on the Transmittal Date than
</p>
<p> </p> <p>56 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
orders effected using the Clearing Process. These deadlines vary by institution. Persons redeeming outside the Clearing Process are required to transfer Units through DTC and Excess Cash Amounts,
if any, through the Federal Reserve Bank wire transfer system in a timely manner. </p> <p>An Authorized Participant submitting a redemption request is deemed to
represent to the Trustee that it is in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Participant Agreement. The Trustee reserves the right to verify these representations at its discretion, but will typically require verification with respect to
a redemption request in connection with higher levels of redemption activity and/or short interest in the Trust. If the Authorized Participant, upon receipt of a verification request, does not provide sufficient verification of its representations
as determined by the Trustee, the redemption request will not be considered to have been received in proper form and may be rejected by the Trustee. </p>
<p>Requests for redemption may be made on any Business Day directly to the Trustee (not to the Distributor). In the case of redemptions made through the Clearing
Process, the Transaction Fee is deducted from the amount delivered to the redeemer. In the case of redemptions outside the Clearing Process, the Transaction Fee plus an additional amount not to exceed three (3) times the Transaction Fee
applicable for one Creation Unit per Creation Unit redeemed, and such amount is deducted from the amount delivered to the redeemer. </p> <p>The Trustee transfers
to the redeeming Beneficial Owner via DTC and the relevant DTC Participant(s) a portfolio of Index Securities (based on NAV of the Trust) for each Creation Unit delivered, generally identical in weighting and composition to the stock portion of a
Portfolio Deposit as in effect (a) on the date a request for redemption is deemed received by the Trustee or (b) in the case of the termination of the Trust, on the date that notice of the termination of the Trust is given. The Trustee
also transfers via the relevant DTC Participant(s) to the redeeming Beneficial Owner a “Cash Redemption Payment,” which on any given Business Day is an amount identical to the amount of the Cash Component and is equal to a proportional
amount of the following: dividends on the Portfolio Securities for the period through the date of redemption, net of expenses and liabilities for such period including, without limitation, (i) taxes or other governmental charges against the
Trust not previously deducted, if any, (ii) accrued fees of the Trustee and (iii) other expenses of the Trust (including legal and auditing expenses) not previously deducted, as if the Portfolio Securities had been held for the entire
accumulation period for such distribution, plus or minus the Balancing Amount. The redeeming Beneficial Owner must deliver to the Trustee any amount by which the amount payable to the Trust by such Beneficial Owner exceeds the amount of the Cash
Redemption Payment (“Excess Cash Amounts”). For redemptions through the Clearing Process, the Trustee effects a transfer of the Cash Redemption Payment and stocks to the redeeming Beneficial Owner by the second (2nd) NSCC Business Day
following the date on which request for redemption is deemed received. For redemptions outside the Clearing Process, the Trustee transfers the Cash Redemption Payment and the stocks to the redeeming </p>
<p> </p> <p>57 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
Beneficial Owner by the second (2nd) Business Day following the date on which the request for redemption is deemed received. The Trustee will cancel all Units delivered upon redemption. </p>
<p>If the Trustee determines that an Index Security is likely to be unavailable or available in insufficient quantity for delivery by the Trust upon the
redemption of Creation Units, the Trustee may elect, in lieu thereof, to deliver the cash equivalent value of any such Index Securities, based on its market value as of the Evaluation Time on the date such redemption order is deemed received by the
Trustee, as a part of the Cash Redemption Payment. </p> <p>If a redeemer is restricted by regulation or otherwise from investing or engaging in a transaction in
one or more Index Securities, the Trustee may elect to deliver the cash equivalent value based on the market value of any such Index Securities as of the Evaluation Time on the date of the redemption as a part of the Cash Redemption Payment in lieu
thereof. In such case, the Authorized Participant will pay the Trustee the standard Transaction Fee, and may pay an additional amount equal to the actual amounts incurred in connection with such transaction(s) but in any case not to exceed three
(3) times the Transaction Fee applicable for one Creation Unit. </p> <p>The Trustee, upon the request of a redeeming Authorized Participant, may elect to
redeem Creation Units in whole or in part by providing such redeemer with a portfolio of stocks differing in exact composition from Index Securities but not differing in NAV from the then-current Portfolio Deposit. Such a redemption is likely to be
made only if it were determined that it would be appropriate in order to maintain the Trust’s correspondence to the composition and weighting of the Index. </p>
<p>The Trustee may sell Portfolio Securities to obtain sufficient cash proceeds to deliver to the redeeming Beneficial Owner. To the extent cash proceeds are
received by the Trustee in excess of the required amount, such cash proceeds shall be held by the Trustee and applied in accordance with the guidelines applicable to Misweighting (as defined below under “Portfolio Adjustments”). </p>
<p>All redemption orders must be transmitted to the Trustee by telephone, through the Internet or by other transmission methods acceptable to the Trustee,
pursuant to procedures set forth in the Participant Agreement and/or described in this prospectus, so as to be received by the Trustee not later than the Closing Time on the Transmittal Date. In addition, orders submitted through the Internet must
also comply with the terms and provisions of the State Street Fund Connect <font>Buy-Side</font> User Agreement and other applicable agreements and documents, including but not limited to the applicable Fund Connect User
Guide or successor documents. Severe economic or market disruption or changes, or telephone or other communication failure, may impede the ability to reach the Trustee, a Participating Party, or a DTC Participant. </p>
<p>The calculation of the value of the stocks and the Cash Redemption Payment to be delivered to the redeeming Beneficial Owner is made by the Trustee according
to the procedures set forth under “Purchases and Redemptions of Creation Units — Redemption — Procedures for Redemption of Creation Units,” “Portfolio </p>
<p> </p> <p>58 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
Adjustments — Adjustments to the Portfolio Deposit” and “Determination of Net Asset Value” and is computed as of the Evaluation Time on the Business Day on which a redemption
order is deemed received by the Trustee. Therefore, if a redemption order in proper form is submitted to the Trustee by a DTC Participant not later than the Closing Time on the Transmittal Date, and the requisite Units are delivered to the Trustee
prior to DTC <font>Cut-Off</font> Time (as defined below in “Purchases and Redemptions of Creation Units — Redemption — Placement of Redemption Orders Outside Clearing Process”), then the value of the
stocks and the Cash Redemption Payment to be delivered to the Beneficial Owner will be determined by the Trustee as of the Evaluation Time on such Transmittal Date. If, however, a redemption order is submitted not later than the Closing Time on a
Transmittal Date but the requisite Units are not delivered by DTC <font>Cut-Off</font> Time, the stocks and Cash Redemption Payment will be delivered upon receipt of the requisite Units. If a redemption order is not
submitted in proper form, then the redemption order is not deemed received as of such Transmittal Date and the value of the stocks will be computed as of the Evaluation Time on the Business Day that such order is received in good order by the
Trustee. </p> <p>The Trustee may suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the date of payment of the NAV for more than five (5) Business Days following
the date on which the request for redemption is deemed received by the Trustee, (a) for any period during which the NYSE is closed, (b) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which disposal or evaluation of the
Portfolio Securities is not reasonably practicable, or (c) for such other period as the SEC may by order permit for the protection of Beneficial Owners. Neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee is liable to any person or in any way for any loss or
damages that may result from any such suspension or postponement. </p> <p><i>Placement of Redemption Orders Using Clearing
Process.</i><b>    </b>A redemption order made through the Clearing Process will be deemed received on the Transmittal Date so long as (a) the order is received by the Trustee not later than the Closing Time on such
Transmittal Date and (b) all other procedures set forth in the Participant Agreement are properly followed. The order is effected based on the NAV of the Trust as determined as of the Evaluation Time on the Transmittal Date. A redemption order
made through the Clearing Process and received by the Trustee after the Closing Time will be deemed received on the next Business Day immediately following the Transmittal Date. The Participant Agreement authorizes the Trustee to transmit to NSCC on
behalf of a Participating Party such trade instructions as are necessary to effect the Participating Party’s redemption order. Pursuant to such trade instructions from the Trustee to NSCC, the Trustee will transfer (a) the requisite stocks
(or contracts to purchase such stocks which are expected to be delivered in a “regular way” manner) on settlement date, and (b) the Cash Redemption Payment. </p>
<p><i>Placement of Redemption Orders Outside Clearing Process.</i><b>    </b>A DTC Participant who wishes to place an order for redemption of
Units to be effected outside the Clearing Process need not be a Participating Party, but its order must state that such </p>
<p> </p> <p>59 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
DTC Participant is not using the Clearing Process and that redemption will instead be effected through transfer of Units directly through DTC. An order will be deemed received by the Trustee on
the Transmittal Date if (a) such order is received by the Trustee not later than the Closing Time on such Transmittal Date, (b) such order is preceded or accompanied by the requisite number of Units specified in such order, which delivery
must be made through DTC to the Trustee no later than 1:00 p.m. New York time on the next Business Day immediately following such Transmittal Date (“DTC <font>Cut-Off</font> Time”) and (c) all other
procedures set forth in the Participant Agreement are properly followed. Any Excess Cash Amounts owed by the Beneficial Owner must be delivered no later than 1:00 p.m. New York time on settlement date. </p>
<p>The Trustee initiates procedures to transfer the requisite stocks (or contracts to purchase such stocks) that are expected to be delivered on settlement date
and the Cash Redemption Payment to the redeeming Beneficial Owner on settlement date. </p> <p><b><a name="toc280704_33"></a>BOOK-ENTRY-ONLY SYSTEM
</b></p> <p>DTC acts as securities depository for the Units. Units are represented by one or more global securities, registered in the name of Cede &amp;
Co., as nominee for DTC and deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC. Beneficial ownership of Units is shown on the records of DTC or the DTC Participants (owners of such beneficial interests are referred to herein as “Beneficial Owners”).
</p> <p>DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing
corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. DTC was created to hold securities of
the DTC Participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions among the DTC Participants through electronic book-entry changes in their accounts, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities
certificates. DTC Participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations. Access to the DTC system also is available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust
companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”). </p>
<p>Upon the settlement date of any creation, transfer or redemption of Units, DTC credits or debits, on its book-entry registration and transfer system, the
amount of Units so created, transferred or redeemed to the accounts of the appropriate DTC Participants. The accounts to be credited and charged are designated by the Trustee to NSCC, in the case of a creation or redemption through the Clearing
Process, or by the Trustee and the DTC Participants, in the case of a creation or redemption outside of the Clearing Process. Beneficial ownership of Units is limited to the DTC Participants, Indirect Participants and persons holding interests
through the DTC Participants and Indirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in Units is </p>
<p> </p> <p>60 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
shown on, and the transfer of ownership is effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on the records of DTC Participants (with respect to Indirect
Participants and Beneficial Owners that are not DTC Participants). Beneficial Owners are expected to receive from or through the relevant DTC Participant a written confirmation relating to their purchase of Units. The laws of some jurisdictions may
require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. Such laws may impair the ability of certain investors to acquire beneficial interests in Units. </p>
<p>As long as Cede &amp; Co., as nominee of DTC, is the registered owner of Units, references to the registered or record owner of Units shall mean
Cede &amp; Co. and shall not mean the Beneficial Owners of Units. Beneficial Owners of Units are not entitled to have Units registered in their names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of certificates in definitive
form and will not be considered the record or registered holders thereof under the Trust Agreement. Accordingly, each Beneficial Owner must rely on the procedures of DTC, any DTC Participant and Indirect Participant through which such Beneficial
Owner holds its interests, to exercise any rights under the Trust Agreement. </p> <p>The Trustee recognizes DTC or its nominee as the owner of all Units for all
purposes except as expressly set forth in the Trust Agreement. Pursuant to the agreement between the Trustee and DTC, DTC is required to make available to the Trustee upon request and for a fee to be charged to the Trust a listing of the Unit
holdings of each DTC Participant. The Trustee inquires of each such DTC Participant as to the number of Beneficial Owners holding Units, directly or indirectly, through the relevant DTC Participant. The Trustee provides each such DTC Participant
with copies of any notice, statement or other communication, in the form, number and at the place as such DTC Participant may reasonably request, in order that the notice, statement or communication may be transmitted by such DTC Participant,
directly or indirectly, to the Beneficial Owners. In addition, the Trust pays to each such DTC Participant a fair and reasonable amount as reimbursement for the expense attendant to such transmittal, all subject to applicable statutory and
regulatory requirements. The foregoing interaction between the Trustee and DTC Participants may be direct or indirect (<i>i.e., </i>through a third party). </p>
<p>Distributions are made to DTC or its nominee. DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment of distributions in respect of Units, is required immediately to
credit DTC Participants’ accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in Units, as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. Payments by DTC Participants to Indirect Participants and Beneficial
Owners of Units held through such DTC Participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in a “street name,”
and will be the responsibility of such DTC Participants. Neither the Trustee nor the Sponsor has or will have any responsibility or liability for any aspects of the records relating to or notices to Beneficial Owners, or payments made on account of
beneficial ownership </p>
<p> </p> <p>61 </p>
<p>

<p>
interests in Units, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests or for any other aspect of the relationship between DTC and the DTC
Participants or the relationship between such DTC Participants and the Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners owning through such DTC Participants. </p>
<p>DTC may discontinue providing its service with respect to Units at any time by giving notice to the Trustee and the Sponsor, provided that it discharges its
responsibilities with respect thereto in accordance with applicable law. Under such circumstances, the Trustee and the Sponsor shall take action either to find a replacement for DTC to perform its functions at a comparable cost or, if such a
replacement is unavailable, to terminate the Trust. </p> <p>NSCC is an affiliate of DTC and the Trustee and Sponsor, and/or their affiliates, own shares of DTC.
</p> <p><b><a name="toc280704_34"></a>PORTFOLIO ADJUSTMENTS </b></p>
<p>The Index is a float-adjusted capitalization weighted index of 500 companies calculated under the auspices of the S&amp;P Index Committee of S&amp;P. At any
moment in time, the value of the Index equals the aggregate market value of the available float shares outstanding in each of the component 500 Index Securities, evaluated at their respective last sale prices on their respective listing exchange,
divided by a scaling factor (“divisor”) which yields a resulting index value in the reported magnitude. </p> <p>Periodically (typically, several times
per quarter), S&amp;P may determine that total shares outstanding have changed in one or more component Index Securities due to secondary offerings, repurchases, conversions or other corporate actions. S&amp;P may also determine that the available
float shares of one or more of the Index Securities has changed due to corporate actions, purchases or sales of securities by holders or other events. S&amp;P may periodically (ordinarily, several times per quarter) replace one or more Index
Securities due to mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, or other market conditions, or if the issuers of such Index Securities fail to meet the criteria for inclusion in the Index. In 2021, there were 24 company changes to the Index. Ordinarily,
whenever there is a change in shares outstanding or a change in an Index Security of the Index, S&amp;P adjusts the divisor to ensure that there is no discontinuity in the value of the Index. </p>
<p>The Trustee aggregates certain adjustments and makes conforming changes to the Portfolio at least monthly. The Trustee directs its stock transactions only to
brokers or dealers, which may include affiliates of the Trustee, from whom it expects to obtain the most favorable prices for execution of orders. Adjustments are made more frequently in the case of significant changes to the Index. Specifically,
the Trustee is required to adjust the composition of the Portfolio whenever there is a change in the identity of any Index Security (<i>i.e.</i><i>,</i> a substitution of one security for another) within three (3) Business Days before or after
the day on which the change is scheduled to take effect. If the transaction costs incurred by the Trust in adjusting the Portfolio </p>
<p> </p> <p>62 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
would exceed the expected variation between the composition of the Portfolio and the Index (“Misweighting”), it may not be efficient identically to replicate the share composition of
the Index. Minor Misweighting generally is permitted within the guidelines set forth below. The Trustee is required to adjust the composition of the Portfolio at any time that the weighting of any stock in the Portfolio varies in excess of one
hundred and fifty percent (150%) of a specified percentage, which percentage varies from 0.08% to 0.02%, depending on the net asset value of the Trust (in each case, “Misweighting Amount”), from the weighting of the Index Security in the
Index. For the year ended September 30, 2021, the Misweighting Amount was 0.02%. </p> <p>The Trust is not managed and therefore the adverse financial
condition of an issuer does not require the sale of stocks from the Portfolio. The Trustee on a <font>non-discretionary</font> basis adjusts the composition of the Portfolio to conform to changes in the composition and/or
weighting structure of Index Securities in the Index. To the extent that the method of determining the Index is changed by S&amp;P in a manner that would affect the adjustments provided for herein, the Trustee and the Sponsor have the right to amend
the Trust Agreement, without the consent of DTC or Beneficial Owners, to conform the adjustments to such changes and to maintain the objective of tracking the Index. </p>
<p>The Trustee examines each stock in the Portfolio on each Business Day, comparing its weighting to the weighting of the corresponding Index Security, based on
prices at the close of the market on the preceding Business Day (a “Weighting Analysis”). If there is a Misweighting in any stock in the Portfolio in excess of one hundred and fifty percent (150%) of the applicable Misweighting Amount, the
Trustee calculates an adjustment to the Portfolio in order to bring the Misweighting within the Misweighting Amount, based on prices at the close of the market on the day on which such Misweighting occurs. Also, on a monthly basis, the Trustee
performs a Weighting Analysis for each stock in the Portfolio, and in any case where there exists a Misweighting exceeding one hundred percent (100%) of the applicable Misweighting Amount, the Trustee calculates an adjustment to the Portfolio in
order to bring the Misweighting within the applicable Misweighting Amount, based on prices at the close of the market on the day on which such Misweighting occurs. In the case of any adjustment to the Portfolio because of a Misweighting, the
purchase or sale of stock necessitated by the adjustment is made within three (3) Business Days of the day on which such Misweighting is determined. In addition to the foregoing adjustments, the Trustee may make additional periodic adjustments
to Portfolio Securities that may be misweighted by an amount within the applicable Misweighting Amount. </p> <p>The foregoing guidelines with respect to
Misweighting also apply to any Index Security that (a) is likely to be unavailable for delivery or available in insufficient quantity for delivery or (b) cannot be delivered to the Trustee due to restrictions prohibiting a creator from
engaging in a transaction involving such Index Security. Upon receipt of an order for a Creation Unit that involves such an Index Security, the </p>
<p> </p> <p>63 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
Trustee determines whether the substitution of cash for the stock would cause a Misweighting in the Portfolio. If a Misweighting results, the Trustee will purchase the required number of shares
of the Index Security. If a Misweighting does not result and the Trustee does not hold cash in excess of the permitted amounts, the Trustee may hold the cash or, if such excess would result, make the required adjustments to the Portfolio. </p>
<p>As a result of the purchase and sale of stock in accordance with these requirements, or the creation of Creation Units, the Trust may hold some amount of
residual cash (other than cash held temporarily due to timing differences between the sale and purchase of stock or cash delivered in lieu of Index Securities or undistributed income or undistributed capital gains). This amount may not exceed for
more than two (2) consecutive Business Days 0.5% of the value of the Portfolio. If the Trustee has made all required adjustments and is left with cash in excess of 0.5% of the value of the Portfolio, the Trustee will use such cash to purchase
additional Index Securities that are underweighted in the Portfolio as compared to their relative weightings in the Index, such that the Misweighting of such Index Securities will not be in excess of the applicable Misweighting Amount. </p>
<p>All portfolio adjustments are made as described herein unless such adjustments would cause the Trust to lose its status as a “regulated investment
company” under Subchapter M of the Code. Additionally, the Trustee is required to adjust the composition of the Portfolio at any time to insure the continued qualification of the Trust as a regulated investment company. </p>
<p>The Trustee relies on industry sources for information as to the composition and weightings of Index Securities. If the Trustee becomes incapable of obtaining
or processing such information or NSCC is unable to receive such information from the Trustee on any Business Day, the Trustee shall use the composition and weightings of Index Securities for the most recently effective Portfolio Deposit for the
purposes of all adjustments and determinations (including, without limitation, determination of the stock portion of the Portfolio Deposit) until the earlier of (a) such time as current information with respect to Index Securities is available
or (b) three (3) consecutive Business Days have elapsed. If such current information is not available and three (3) consecutive Business Days have elapsed, the composition and weightings of Portfolio Securities (as opposed to Index
Securities) shall be used for the purposes of all adjustments and determinations (including, without limitation, determination of the stock portion of the Portfolio Deposit) until current information with respect to Index Securities is available.
</p> <p>If the Trustee provides written notice of the termination of the Trust, from and after the date of such notice, the Trustee shall use the composition and
weightings of Portfolio Securities as of such notice date for the determination of all redemptions or other purposes. </p> <p>From time to time S&amp;P may adjust
the composition of the Index because of a merger or acquisition involving one or more Index Securities. In such cases, the Trust, as </p>
<p> </p> <p>64 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
shareholder of an issuer that is the object of such merger or acquisition activity, may receive various offers from <font>would-be</font> acquirors of the issuer. The
Trustee is not permitted to accept any such offers until such time as it has been determined that the stocks of the issuer will be removed from the Index. As stocks of an issuer are often removed from the Index only after the consummation of a
merger or acquisition of such issuer, in selling the securities of such issuer the Trust may receive, to the extent that market prices do not provide a more attractive alternative, whatever consideration is being offered to the shareholders of such
issuer that have not tendered their shares prior to such time. Any cash received in such transactions is reinvested in Index Securities in accordance with the criteria set forth above. Any stocks received as a part of the consideration that are not
Index Securities are sold as soon as practicable and the cash proceeds of such sale are reinvested in accordance with the criteria set forth above. </p> <p><b><a name="toc280704_35">
</a>Adjustments to the Portfolio Deposit </b></p> <p>On each Business Day (each such day, an “Adjustment Day”), the number of shares and identity of
each Index Security required for a Portfolio Deposit are adjusted in accordance with the following procedure. At the close of the market the Trustee calculates the net asset value of the Trust. The net asset value of the Trust is divided by the
number of outstanding Units multiplied by 50,000 Units in one Creation Unit, resulting in the net asset value per Creation Unit (“NAV Amount”). The Trustee then calculates the number of shares (without rounding) of each of the component
stocks of the Index in a Portfolio Deposit for the following Business Day (“Request Day”), such that (a) the market value at the close of the market on the Adjustment Day of the stocks to be included in the Portfolio Deposit on
Request Day, together with the Dividend Equivalent Payment effective for requests to create or redeem on the Adjustment Day, equals the NAV Amount and (b) the identity and weighting of each of the stocks in a Portfolio Deposit mirrors
proportionately the identity and weightings of the stocks in the Index, each as in effect on Request Day. For each stock, the number resulting from such calculation is rounded to the nearest whole share, with a fraction of 0.50 being rounded up. The
identities and weightings of the stocks so calculated constitute the stock portion of the Portfolio Deposit effective on Request Day and thereafter until the next subsequent Adjustment Day, as well as Portfolio Securities to be delivered by the
Trustee in the event of request for redemption on the Request Day and thereafter until the following Adjustment Day. </p> <p>In addition to the foregoing
adjustments, if a corporate action such as a stock split, stock dividend or reverse split occurs with respect to any Index Security that does not result in an adjustment to the Index divisor, the Portfolio Deposit shall be adjusted to take into
account the corporate action in each case rounded to the nearest whole share. </p> <p>On the Request Day and on each day that a request for the creation or
redemption is deemed received, the Trustee calculates the market value of the stock portion of the Portfolio Deposit as in effect on the Request Day as of the close of the market and </p>
<p> </p> <p>65 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
adds to that amount the Dividend Equivalent Payment effective for requests to create or redeem on Request Day (such market value and Dividend Equivalent Payment are collectively referred to
herein as “Portfolio Deposit Amount”). The Trustee then calculates the NAV Amount, based on the close of the market on the Request Day. The difference between the NAV Amount so calculated and the Portfolio Deposit Amount is the
“Balancing Amount.” The Balancing Amount serves the function of compensating for any differences between the value of the Portfolio Deposit Amount and the NAV Amount at the close of trading on Request Day due to, for example,
(a) differences in the market value of the securities in the Portfolio Deposit and the market value of the securities on Request Day and (b) any variances from the proper composition of the Portfolio Deposit. </p>
<p>On any Adjustment Day on which (a) no change in the identity and/or share weighting of any Index Security is scheduled to take effect that would cause the
Index divisor to be adjusted after the close of the market on that Business Day,* and (b) no stock split, stock dividend or reverse stock split with respect to any Index Security has been declared to take effect on the corresponding Request
Day, the Trustee may forego making any adjustment to the stock portion of the Portfolio Deposit and use the composition and weightings of Index Securities for the most recently effective Portfolio Deposit for the Request Day following such
Adjustment Day. In addition, the Trustee may calculate the adjustment to the number of shares and identity of Index Securities in a Portfolio Deposit as described above except that such calculation would be employed two (2) Business Days rather
than one (1) Business Day before the Request Day. </p> <p>The Dividend Equivalent Payment and the Balancing Amount in effect at the close of business on the
Request Date are collectively referred to as the Cash Component or the Cash Redemption Payment. If the Balancing Amount is a positive number (<i>i.e.,</i> if the NAV Amount exceeds the Portfolio Deposit Amount) then, with respect to creation, the
Balancing Amount increases the Cash Component of the then-effective Portfolio Deposit transferred to the Trustee by the creator. With respect to redemptions, the Balancing Amount is added to the cash transferred to the redeemer by the Trustee. If
the Balancing Amount is a negative number (<i>i.e.,</i> if the NAV Amount is less than the Portfolio Deposit Amount) then, with respect to creation, this amount decreases the Cash Component of the then-effective Portfolio Deposit to be transferred
to the Trustee by the creator or, if such cash portion is less than the Balancing Amount, the difference must be paid by the Trustee to the creator. With respect to redemptions, the Balancing Amount is deducted from the cash transferred to the
redeemer or, if such cash is less than the Balancing Amount, the difference must be paid by the redeemer to the Trustee. </p> <p> </p>

<p>If the Trustee has included the cash equivalent value of one or more Index Securities in the Portfolio Deposit
because the Trustee has determined that such Index Securities are likely to be unavailable or available in insufficient quantity for delivery, or if a creator or redeemer is restricted from investing or engaging in transactions in one or more of
such Index Securities, the Portfolio Deposit so constituted shall determine the Index Securities to be delivered in connection with the creation of Units in Creation Unit size aggregations and upon the redemption of Units until the time the stock

<p>The discussion below supplements the Summary with regard to exchange listing and trading matters associated with an investment in the Trust’s Units. </p>
<p><b><a name="toc280704_37"></a>Secondary Trading on Exchanges </b></p>
<p>The Units are listed for secondary trading on the Exchange and individual Units may only be purchased and sold in the secondary market through a broker-dealer.
The secondary markets are closed on weekends and also are generally closed on the following holidays: New Year’s Day, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day (observed), Juneteenth National
Independence Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Exchange may close early on the Business Day before certain holidays and on the day after Thanksgiving Day. Exchange holiday schedules are subject to change. If
you buy or sell Units in the secondary market, you will pay the secondary market price for Units. In addition, you may incur customary brokerage commissions and charges and may pay some or all of the spread between the bid and the offered price in
the secondary market on each leg of a round trip (purchase and sale) transaction. Further, SSGA FD may make payments from its own resources to certain broker-dealers pursuant to arrangements through which those broker-dealers have agreed to offer
Units to their customers and not charge certain of their customers any commissions when those customers purchase or sell Units. Such payments to broker-dealers may create potential conflicts of interest between the broker-dealers and their
customers. </p> <p>There can be no assurance that the requirements of the Exchange necessary to maintain the listing of Units of the Trust will continue to be met
or that Units will always be listed on the Exchange. The Trust will be terminated if Units are delisted. Trading in Units may be halted under certain circumstances as set forth in the Exchange rules and procedures. The Exchange will consider the
suspension of trading in or removal from listing of Units if: (a) the Trust has more than 60 days remaining until termination and there are fewer than 50 record and/or beneficial holders of Units for 30 or more consecutive trading days;
(b) the value of the Index is no longer calculated or available; or (c) such other event occurs or condition exists which, in the opinion of the Exchange, makes further dealings on the Exchange inadvisable. In addition, trading is subject
to trading halts caused by extraordinary </p>
<p> </p> <p>67 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
market volatility pursuant to Exchange “circuit breaker” rules that require trading to be halted for a specified period based on a specified market change. The Exchange also must halt
trading if required intraday valuation information is not disseminated for longer than one (1) Business Day. </p> <p>Units also are listed and traded on the
Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited, the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the Australian Securities Exchange. In the future, Units may be listed and traded on other <font>non-U.S.</font> exchanges. </p>
<p><b><a name="toc280704_38"></a>Trading Prices of Units </b></p> <p>The
trading prices of the Trust’s Units will fluctuate continuously throughout trading hours based on market supply and demand rather than the Trust’s NAV, which is calculated at the end of each Business Day. The Units will trade on the
Exchange at prices that may be above (<i>i.e., </i>at a premium) or below (<i>i.e., </i>at a discount), to varying degrees, the daily NAV of the Units. While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it likely that Units normally will
trade close to the Trust’s NAV, disruptions to creations and redemptions and/or market volatility may result in trading prices that differ significantly from the Trust’s NAV.<i> </i>See the table “Frequency Distribution of Discounts
and Premiums for the Trust: Bid/Ask Price vs. NAV as of 12/31/21” herein. </p> <p>The market price of a Unit should reflect its share of the dividends
accumulated on Portfolio Securities and may be affected by supply and demand, market volatility, sentiment and other factors. </p> <p><b><a name="toc280704_39">
</a>CONTINUOUS OFFERING OF UNITS </b></p> <p>Creation Units are offered continuously to the public by the Trust through the Distributor. Persons making Portfolio
Deposits and creating Creation Units will receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from the Sponsor or the Distributor, and no such person has any obligation or responsibility to the Sponsor or Distributor
to effect any sale or resale of Units. </p> <p>Because new Units can be created and issued on an ongoing basis, at any point during the life of the Trust, a
“distribution,” as such term is used in the Securities Act of 1933, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some of their activities may result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner
which could render them statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus-delivery and liability provisions of the Securities Act of 1933. For example, a broker-dealer firm or its client may be deemed a statutory underwriter if it takes
Creation Units after placing a creation order with a distributor, breaks them down into the constituent Units and sells the Units directly to its customers; or if it chooses to couple the creation of a supply of new Units with an active selling
effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand for Units. A determination of whether one is an underwriter must take into account all the facts and circumstances </p>
<p> </p> <p>68 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
pertaining to the activities of the broker-dealer or its client in the particular case, and the examples mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that
could lead to categorization as an underwriter. </p> <p>Broker-dealer firms should also note that dealers who are not “underwriters” but are effecting
transactions in Units, whether or not participating in the distribution of Units, generally are required to deliver a prospectus. This is because the prospectus delivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 is not
available in respect of such transactions as a result of Section 24(d) of the 1940 Act. As a result, broker-dealer firms should note that dealers who are not “underwriters” but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted with
engaging in ordinary secondary market transactions), and thus dealing with the Units that are part of an overallotment within the meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the Securities Act of 1933 will be unable to take advantage of the prospectus
delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933. For delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of Rule 153 under the Securities Act of 1933 is only available with respect to
transactions on a national exchange. </p> <p>The Sponsor intends to qualify Units in states selected by the Sponsor and through broker-dealers who are members of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”). Persons intending to create or redeem Creation Units in transactions not involving a broker-dealer registered in such person’s state of domicile or residence should consult their
legal adviser regarding applicable broker-dealer or securities regulatory requirements under the state securities laws prior to such creation or redemption. </p>
<p><b><a name="toc280704_40"></a>EXPENSES OF THE TRUST </b></p>
<p>Ordinary operating expenses of the Trust are currently being accrued at an annual rate of 0.0945%. Future accruals will depend primarily on the level of the
Trust’s net assets and the level of Trust expenses. The Trustee has agreed to waive a portion of its fee until February 1, 2023 to the extent total annual operating expenses (excluding extraordinary expenses) exceed 0.0945% after taking
into consideration the earnings credit with respect to uninvested cash balances of the Trust. Thereafter, the Trustee may discontinue this voluntary waiver policy. The Trustee’s fee waiver will be calculated after earnings credits are applied.
The amount of the earnings credit will be equal to the then current Federal Funds Rate, as reported in nationally distributed publications, multiplied by each day’s daily cash balance, if any, in the Trust’s cash account, reduced by the
amount of reserves, if any, for that account required by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Therefore, there is no guarantee that the Trust’s ordinary operating expenses will not exceed 0.0945% of the Trust’s daily net asset value.
</p> <p>Subject to any applicable cap, the Sponsor may charge the Trust a special fee for certain services the Sponsor may provide to the Trust which would
otherwise be provided by the Trustee in an amount not to exceed the actual cost of providing such </p>
<p> </p> <p>69 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
services. The Sponsor or the Trustee from time to time may voluntarily assume some expenses or reimburse the Trust so that total expenses of the Trust are reduced. Neither the Sponsor nor the
Trustee is obligated to do so and either one or both parties may discontinue any voluntary assumption of expenses or reimbursement at any time without notice. </p>
<p>The following charges are or may be accrued and paid by the Trust: (a) the Trustee’s fee; (b) fees payable to transfer agents for the provision
of transfer agency services; (c) fees of the Trustee for extraordinary services performed under the Trust Agreement; (d) various governmental charges; (e) any taxes, fees and charges payable by the Trustee with respect to Units
(whether in Creation Units or otherwise); (f) expenses and costs of any action taken by the Trustee or the Sponsor to protect the Trust and the rights and interests of Beneficial Owners of Units (whether in Creation Units or otherwise); (g)
indemnification of the Trustee or the Sponsor for any losses, liabilities or expenses incurred by it in the administration of the Trust; (h) expenses incurred in contacting Beneficial Owners of Units during the life of the Trust and upon
termination of the Trust; and (i) other <font><font>out-of-pocket</font></font> expenses of the Trust incurred pursuant to actions permitted or required under the Trust Agreement. </p>
<p>In addition, the following expenses are or may be charged to the Trust: (a) reimbursement to the Sponsor of amounts paid by it to S&amp;P in respect of
annual licensing fees pursuant to the License Agreement; (b) federal and state annual registration fees for the issuance of Units; and (c) expenses of the Sponsor relating to the printing and distribution of marketing materials describing
Units and the Trust (including, but not limited to, associated legal, consulting, advertising, and marketing costs and other <font><font>out-of-pocket</font></font> expenses such as printing).
Pursuant to the provisions of an exemptive order, the expenses set forth in this paragraph may be charged to the Trust by the Trustee in an amount equal to the actual costs incurred, but in no case shall such charges exceed 0.20% per annum of the
daily net asset value of the Trust. </p> <p>With respect to the marketing expenses described in item (c) above, the Sponsor has entered into an agreement
with SSGA FD, an affiliate of the Trustee, pursuant to which SSGA FD has agreed to market and promote the Trust. SSGA FD is reimbursed by the Sponsor for the expenses it incurs for providing such services out of amounts that the Trust reimburses the
Sponsor. An affiliate of SSGA FD separately receives fees from the Trustee for providing <font>on-line</font> creation and redemption functionality to Authorized Participants through its Fund Connect application. </p>
<p>If the income received by the Trust in the form of dividends and other distributions on Portfolio Securities is insufficient to cover Trust expenses, the
Trustee may make advances to the Trust to cover such expenses. Otherwise, the Trustee may sell Portfolio Securities in an amount sufficient to pay such expenses. The Trustee may reimburse itself in the amount of any such advance, together with
interest thereon at a percentage rate equal to the then current overnight federal funds rate, by deducting such amounts from (a) dividend payments or other income of the Trust when such </p>
<p> </p> <p>70 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
payments or other income is received, (b) the amounts earned or benefits derived by the Trustee on cash held by the Trustee for the benefit of the Trust, and (c) the sale of Portfolio
Securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any advance remains outstanding for more than forty-five (45) Business Days, the Trustee may sell Portfolio Securities to reimburse itself for such advance and any accrued interest thereon. These
advances will be secured by a lien on the assets of the Trust in favor of the Trustee. The expenses of the Trust are reflected in the NAV of the Trust. </p>
<p>For services performed under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee is paid a fee at an annual rate of 0.06% to 0.10% of the net asset value of the Trust, as shown
below, depending on the net asset value of the Trust, plus or minus the Adjustment Amount (as defined below). The compensation is computed on each Business Day based on the net asset value of the Trust on such day, and the amount thereof is accrued
daily and paid monthly. To the extent that the amount of the Trustee’s compensation, before any adjustment in respect of the Adjustment Amount, is less than specified amounts, the Sponsor has agreed to pay the amount of any such shortfall. The
Trustee also may waive all or a portion of such fee. </p> <p><b><a name="toc280704_41"></a>Trustee Fee Scale </b></p>

$455,220,778,390, respectively. No representation is made as to the actual net asset value of the Trust on any future date, as it is subject to change at any time due to fluctuations in the market value of the Portfolio Securities, or to creations
or redemptions made in the future. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, the aggregate dollar amount of net fees paid to the Trustee was $203,372,449. </p>
<p>The Adjustment Amount is calculated at the end of each quarter and applied against the Trustee’s fee for the following quarter. “Adjustment
Amount” is an amount which is intended, depending upon the circumstances, either to (a) reduce the Trustee’s fee by the amount that the Transaction Fees paid on creation and redemption exceed the costs of those activities, and by the
amount of excess earnings on cash held for the benefit of the Trust** or (b) increase the Trustee’s fee by the amount that the Transaction Fees (plus additional amounts paid in connection with creations or redemptions outside the Clearing
Process), paid on creations or redemptions, falls short of the actual costs of these activities. If in any quarter the </p> <p>Adjustment Amount exceeds the fee
payable to the Trustee as set forth above, the </p>
<p> </p> <p>71 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
Trustee uses such excess amount to reduce other Trust expenses, subject to certain federal tax limitations. To the extent that the amount of such excess exceeds the Trust’s expenses for such
quarter, any remaining excess is retained by the Trustee as part of its compensation. If in any quarter the costs of processing creations and redemptions exceed the amounts charged as a Transaction Fee (plus the additional amounts paid in connection
with creations or redemptions outside the Clearing Process) net of the excess earnings, if any, on cash held for the benefit of the Trust, the Trustee will augment the Trustee’s fee by the resulting Adjustment Amount. The net Adjustment Amount
is usually a credit to the Trust. The amount of the earnings credit will be equal to the then current Federal Funds Rate, as reported in nationally distributed publications, multiplied by each day’s daily cash balance in the Trust’s cash
account, reduced by the amount of reserves for that account required by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. </p> <p>For example, during the year ended
September 30, 2021, the Adjustment Amount included an excess of net transaction fees from processing orders of $5,799,430 and a Trustee earnings credit of $643,681. Thus, the Adjustment Amount reduced the Trustee’s fee by $6,443,111. </p>
<p><b><a name="toc280704_42"></a>DETERMINATION OF NET ASSET VALUE </b></p>
<p>The net asset value of the Trust is computed as of the Evaluation Time, as shown under “Portfolio Adjustments — Adjustments to the Portfolio
Deposit” on each Business Day. The net asset value of the Trust on a per Unit basis is determined by subtracting all liabilities (including accrued expenses and dividends payable) from the total value of the Portfolio and other assets and
dividing the result by the total number of outstanding Units. For the most recent net asset value information, please go to www.spdrs.com. </p> <p>The value of
the Portfolio is determined by the Trustee in good faith in the following manner. If Portfolio Securities are listed on one or more national securities exchanges, such evaluation is generally based on the closing sale price on that day (unless the
Trustee deems such price inappropriate as a basis for evaluation) on the exchange which is deemed to be the principal market therefor or, if there is no such appropriate closing sale price on such exchange, at the last sale price (unless the Trustee
deems such price inappropriate as a basis for evaluation). If the securities are not so listed or, if so listed and the principal market therefor is other than on such exchange or there is no such last sale price available, such evaluation shall
generally be made by the Trustee in good faith based on the closing price on the <font><font>over-the-counter</font></font> market (unless the Trustee deems such price inappropriate as a basis
for evaluation) or if there is no such appropriate closing price, (a) on current bid prices, (b) if bid prices are not available, on the basis of current bid prices for </p>

<p><b><a name="toc280704_43"></a>ADDITIONAL RISK INFORMATION </b></p>
<p>The following section identifies additional risks. Prospective investors should carefully consider the additional information described below together with the
information identified under “Summary — Principal Risks of Investing in the Trust.” </p> <p><i>A liquid trading market for certain Portfolio
Securities may not exist.</i>    Although all of the Portfolio Securities are listed on a national securities exchange, the existence of a liquid trading market for certain Portfolio Securities may depend on whether dealers will
make a market in such stocks. There can be no assurance that a market will be made or maintained for any Portfolio Securities, or that any such market will be or remain liquid. The price at which Portfolio Securities may be sold and the value of the
Portfolio will be adversely affected if trading markets for Portfolio Securities are limited or absent. </p> <p><i>Asset Category
Risk.</i>    The Portfolio Securities may underperform the returns of other securities or indexes that track other industries, groups of industries, markets, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities or indexes tend
to experience cycles of outperformance and underperformance in comparison to the general securities markets. </p> <p><i>Trading
Issues.    </i>Units are listed for trading on the Exchange under the market symbol “SPY” and are listed or traded on certain <font>non-U.S.</font> stock exchanges other than the Exchange.
Trading in Units on the Exchange may be halted due to market conditions or for reasons that, in the view of the Exchange, make trading in Units inadvisable. In addition, trading in Units on the Exchange is subject to trading halts caused by
extraordinary market volatility pursuant to Exchange “circuit breaker” rules. There can be no assurance that the requirements of the Exchange necessary to maintain the listing of the Trust will continue to be met or will remain unchanged
or that the Units will trade with any volume, or at all, on any stock exchange. Investors are subject to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of the market where they or their broker direct their trades for execution. The Trust
will be terminated if the Units are delisted from the Exchange. </p> <p><i>Fluctuation of NAV; Unit Premiums and Discounts.    </i>The NAV of
the Units will generally fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Trust’s securities holdings. The market prices of Units will generally fluctuate in accordance with changes in the Trust’s NAV and supply and demand of Units on the
Exchange or any other exchange on which Units are traded. It cannot be predicted whether Units will trade below, at or above their NAV. Price differences may be due, in large part, to the fact that supply and demand forces at work in the secondary
trading market for Units will be closely related to, but not identical to, the same forces influencing the prices of the securities of the Index trading individually or in the aggregate at any point in time. The market prices of Units may deviate
significantly from the NAV of the </p>
<p> </p> <p>73 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
Units during periods of market volatility. While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it likely that Units normally will trade close to the Trust’s NAV, disruptions to
creations and redemptions and/or market volatility may result in trading prices that differ significantly from the Trust’s NAV. If an investor purchases Units at a time when the market price is at a premium to the NAV of the Units or sells at a
time when the market price is at a discount to the NAV of the Units, then the investor may sustain losses that are in addition to any losses caused by a decrease in NAV. </p>
<p><i>Costs of Buying or Selling Units.    </i>Investors buying or selling Units in the secondary market will pay brokerage commissions or
other charges imposed by brokers as determined by that broker. Brokerage commissions are often a fixed amount and may be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell relatively small amounts of Units. In addition, secondary
market investors will also incur the cost of the difference between the price that an investor is willing to pay for Units (the “bid” price) and the price at which an investor is willing to sell Units (the “ask” price). This
difference in bid and ask prices is often referred to as the “spread” or “bid/ask spread.” The bid/ask spread varies over time for Units based on trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Trust’s
Units have more trading volume and market liquidity and higher if the Trust’s Units have little trading volume and market liquidity. Further, increased market volatility may cause increased bid/ask spreads. Due to the costs of buying or selling
Units, including bid/ask spreads, frequent trading of Units may significantly reduce investment results and an investment in Units may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments. </p>
<p><i>Large Cap Risk</i>.    The Portfolio Securities will generally consist of equity securities of large-capitalization U.S. issuers.
Returns on investments in stocks of large U.S. companies could trail the returns on investments in stocks of smaller and <font>mid-sized</font> companies. </p>
<p><i>Investment in the Trust may have adverse tax consequences</i>.    Investors in the Trust should consider the U.S. federal, state, local
and other tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of Units. For a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of Units, see “Federal Income Taxes.” </p>
<p><i>Clearing and settlement of Creation Units may be delayed or fail</i>.    Even if an order is processed through the continuous net
settlement clearing process of NSCC, Portfolio Securities or Units, as applicable, may not be delivered on settlement date, due to liquidity or other constraints in the clearing process. Orders expected to settle outside of the continuous net
settlement clearing process of NSCC are not covered by NSCC’s guarantee of completion of delivery. </p>

<p><b><a name="toc280704_44"></a>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS
</b></p> <p>The following information supplements and should be read in conjunction with the section included in this prospectus entitled “Dividends and
Distributions.” </p> <p><b><a name="toc280704_45"></a>General Policies </b></p>
<p>The regular quarterly <font>ex-dividend</font> date for Units is the third (3rd) Friday in each of March, June, September and
December, unless such day is not a Business Day, in which case the <font>ex-dividend</font> date is the immediately preceding Business Day <font>(“Ex-Dividend</font> Date”). Beneficial
Owners reflected on the records of DTC and the DTC Participants on the first (1st) Business Day following the <font>Ex-Dividend</font> Date (“Record Date”) are entitled to receive an amount representing dividends
accumulated on Portfolio Securities through the quarterly dividend period which ends on the Business Day preceding such <font>Ex-Dividend</font> Date (including stocks with
<font>ex-dividend</font> dates falling within such quarterly dividend period), net of fees and expenses, accrued daily for such period. For the purposes of all dividend distributions, dividends per Unit are calculated at
least to the nearest 1/1000th of $0.01. The payment of dividends is made on the last Business Day in the calendar month following each <font>Ex-Dividend</font> Date (“Dividend Payment Date”). Dividend payments
are made through DTC and the DTC Participants to Beneficial Owners then of record with funds received from the Trustee. </p> <p>Dividends payable to the Trust in
respect of Portfolio Securities are credited by the Trustee to a <font>non-interest</font> bearing account as of the date on which the Trust receives such dividends. Other moneys received by the Trustee in respect of the
Portfolio, including but not limited to the Cash Component, the Cash Redemption Payment, all moneys realized by the Trustee from the sale of options, warrants or other similar rights received or distributed in respect of Portfolio Securities as
dividends or distributions and capital gains resulting from the sale of Portfolio Securities are credited by the Trustee to a <font>non-interest</font> bearing account. All funds collected or received are held by the
Trustee without interest until distributed in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement. To the extent the amounts credited to the account generate interest income or an equivalent benefit to the Trustee, such interest income or benefit
is used to reduce the Trustee’s annual fee. </p> <p>Any additional distributions the Trust may need to make so as to qualify for an exemption from tax on its
distributed income under the Code and to avoid U.S. federal excise tax would consist of (a) an increase in the distribution scheduled for January to include any amount by which the Trust’s estimated “investment company taxable
income” (determined prior to the deduction for dividends paid by the Trust) and net capital gains for the prior taxable and/or calendar year exceeded the amount of Trust taxable income previously distributed with respect to such taxable year
and/or calendar year or, if greater, the minimum amount required to avoid imposition of such excise tax, and (b) a distribution soon after the computation of the actual annual </p>
<p> </p> <p>75 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
“investment company taxable income” (determined prior to the deduction for dividends paid by the Trust) and net capital gain of the Trust of the amount, if any, by which such actual
income and gain exceeds the distributions already made. The net asset value of the Trust is reduced in direct proportion to the amount of such additional distributions. The magnitude of the additional distributions, if any, depends upon a number of
factors, including the level of redemption activity experienced by the Trust. Because substantially all proceeds from the sale of stocks in connection with adjustments to the Portfolio are used to purchase shares of Index Securities, the Trust may
have no cash or insufficient cash with which to pay such additional distributions. In that case, the Trustee will have to sell shares of Portfolio Securities sufficient to produce the cash required to make such additional distributions. In selecting
the stocks to be sold to produce cash for such distributions, the Trustee chooses among the stocks that are over-weighted in the Portfolio relative to their weightings in the Index first and then from among all other stocks in such a manner to
maintain the weightings of Portfolio Securities within the applicable Misweighting Amount. </p> <p>As specified in the Trust Agreement, the Trustee may declare
special dividends if the Trustee deems such action necessary or advisable to preserve the status of the Trust as a RIC or to avoid imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or deems such action otherwise advantageous to the Trust.
The Trust Agreement also permits the Trustee to vary the frequency with which periodic distributions are made (<i>e.g.</i>, from quarterly to monthly) if it is determined by the Sponsor and the Trustee that such a variance would be advisable to
facilitate compliance with the rules and regulations applicable to RICs or would otherwise be advantageous to the Trust. In addition, the Trust Agreement permits the Trustee to change the regular <font>ex-dividend</font>
date for Units to another date within the month or quarter if it is determined by the Sponsor and the Trustee that such a change would be advantageous to the Trust. Notice of any such variance or change shall be provided to Beneficial Owners via DTC
and the DTC Participants. </p> <p>All distributions are made by the Trustee through DTC and the DTC Participants to Beneficial Owners as recorded on the book
entry system of DTC and the DTC Participants. With each distribution, the Trustee furnishes for distribution to Beneficial Owners a statement setting forth the amount being distributed, expressed as a dollar amount per Unit. </p>
<p>The settlement date for the creation of Units or the purchase of Units in the secondary market must occur on or before the Record Date in order for such
creator or purchaser to receive a distribution on the next Dividend Payment Date. If the settlement date for such creation or a secondary market purchase occurs after the Record Date, the distribution will be made to the prior securityholder or
Beneficial Owner as of such Record Date. </p> <p>As soon as practicable after notice of termination of the Trust, the Trustee will distribute via DTC and the DTC
Participants to each Beneficial Owner redeeming Creation Units before the termination date specified in such notice a portion of </p>
<p> </p> <p>76 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
Portfolio Securities and cash as described above. Otherwise, the Trustee will distribute to each Beneficial Owner (whether in Creation Unit size aggregations or otherwise), as soon as practicable
after termination of the Trust, such Beneficial Owner’s pro rata share of the net asset value of the Trust. </p> <p><b><a name="toc280704_46">
</a>INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS </b></p> <p>The Trust is not actively managed and only holds constituent securities of the Index regardless of the current or
projected performance of a specific security or a particular industry or market sector. Therefore, the Trust is not authorized to invest in the securities of registered investment companies or any other registered or unregistered funds, lend its
portfolio securities or other assets, issue senior securities or borrow money for the purpose of investing in securities, purchase securities on margin, sell securities short or invest in derivative instruments, including, without limitation,
futures contracts, options or swaps. </p> <p><b><a name="toc280704_47"></a>INVESTMENTS BY INVESTMENT COMPANIES </b></p>
<p>Purchases of Units by investment companies and certain private funds are subject to restrictions pursuant to Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act. However,
SEC Rule <font>12d1-4</font> allows, subject to certain conditions (including the entry into an agreement with the Trust), registered investment companies to invest in Units beyond the limits contained in
Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act. Registered investment companies wishing to invest beyond the statutory limits in reliance on Rule <font>12d1-4</font> should contact the Trustee by telephone at 1-866-787-2257. </p>
<p>The Trust itself is also subject to the restrictions of Section 12(d)(1). This means that, notwithstanding the investment restrictions described above,
absent an exemption or SEC relief, (a) the Trust cannot invest in any registered investment company, to the extent that the Trust would own more than 3% of that registered investment company’s outstanding Units, (b) the Trust cannot
invest more than 5% of its total assets in the securities of any one registered investment company, and (c) the Trust cannot invest more than 10% of its total assets in the securities of registered investment companies in the aggregate. </p>
<p><b><a name="toc280704_48"></a>ANNUAL REPORTS </b></p>
<p>Promptly after the end of each fiscal year, the Trustee furnishes to the DTC Participants for distribution to each person who was a Beneficial Owner of Units
at the end of such fiscal year, an annual report of the Trust containing financial statements audited by independent accountants of nationally recognized standing and such other information as may be required by applicable laws, rules and
regulations. </p>

<p><b><a name="toc280704_49"></a>BENEFIT PLAN INVESTOR CONSIDERATIONS </b></p>
<p>In considering the advisability of an investment in Units, fiduciaries of pension, profit sharing or other
<font>tax-qualified</font> retirement plans and funded welfare plans or entities whose underlying assets include “plan assets” within the meaning of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
(“ERISA”) (collectively, “Plans”) subject to the fiduciary responsibility requirements of ERISA, should consider whether an investment in Units (a) is permitted by the documents and instruments governing the Plan,
(b) is made solely in the interest of participants and beneficiaries of the Plans, (c) is consistent with the prudence and diversification requirements of ERISA, and that the acquisition and holding of Units does not result in a <font>non-exempt</font> “prohibited transaction” under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. Individual retirement account (“IRA”) investors and certain other investors not subject to
ERISA, such as Keogh Plans, should consider that such arrangements may make only such investments as are authorized by the governing instruments and that IRAs, Keogh Plans and certain other types of arrangements are subject to the prohibited
transaction rules of Section 4975 of the Code. Employee benefit plans that are government plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and
<font>non-U.S.</font> plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) are not subject to the requirements of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. The fiduciaries of governmental plans should, however, consider the
impact of their respective state pension codes or other applicable law, which may include restrictions similar to ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, on investments in Units and the considerations discussed above, to the extent such
considerations apply. Each purchaser and transferee of a Unit who is subject to ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or any similar laws will be deemed to have represented by its acquisition and holding of each Unit that its acquisition and
holding of any Units does not give rise to a <font>non-exempt</font> prohibited transaction under ERISA, the Code or any similar law. </p>
<p>As described in the preceding paragraph, ERISA imposes certain duties on Plan fiduciaries, and ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain
transactions involving “plan assets” between Plans or IRAs and persons who have certain specified relationships to the Plan or IRA (that is, “parties in interest” as defined in ERISA or “disqualified persons” as defined
in the Code). The fiduciary standards and prohibited transaction rules that apply to an investment in Units by a Plan will not apply to transactions involving the Trust’s assets because the Trust is an investment company registered under the
1940 Act. As such, the Trust’s assets are not deemed to be “plan assets” under ERISA and U.S. Department of Labor regulations by virtue of Plan and/or IRA investments in Units. </p>
<p>Each purchaser or transferee should consult legal counsel before purchasing the Units. Nothing herein shall be construed as a representation that an investment
in the Units would meet any or all of the relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by, or is appropriate for, an employee benefit plan subject to ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar law. </p>

<p><b><a name="toc280704_51"></a>SPONSOR </b></p>
<p>The Sponsor is a Delaware limited liability company incorporated on April 6, 1998 with offices c/o NYSE Holdings LLC, 11 Wall Street, New York, New York
10005. The Sponsor’s Internal Revenue Service Employer Identification Number is <font>26-4126158.</font> The Sponsor’s sole business activity is to act as the sponsor of the Trust and two other ETFs. On
October 1, 2008, the Sponsor became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of NYSE Holdings following the acquisition by NYSE Holdings of the American Stock Exchange LLC and all of its subsidiaries. On November 13, 2013, the Sponsor became an
indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (“ICE”), following the acquisition of NYSE Holdings LLC (the parent company of the Sponsor) by ICE. As the parent company, ICE is the publicly-traded entity, trading on
the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “ICE.” NYSE Holdings is a “control person” of the Sponsor as such term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933. </p>
<p>The Sponsor, at its own expense, may from time to time provide additional promotional incentives to brokers who sell Units to the public. In certain instances,
these incentives may be provided only to those brokers who meet certain threshold requirements for participation in a given incentive program, such as selling a significant number of Units within a specified period. </p>
<p>If at any time the Sponsor fails to undertake or perform or becomes incapable of undertaking or performing any of the duties which by the terms of the Trust
Agreement are required to be undertaken or performed by it, and such failure is not cured within fifteen (15) Business Days following receipt of notice from the Trustee of such failure, or if the Sponsor resigns, or if the Sponsor is adjudged
bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver of the Sponsor or of its property is appointed, or a trustee or liquidator or any public officer takes charge or control of the Sponsor or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation,
conservation or liquidation, the Trustee may appoint a successor Sponsor, agree to act as Sponsor itself, or terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trust. Upon the Trustee’s and a successor Sponsor’s execution of an instrument of
appointment and assumption, the successor Sponsor succeeds to all of the rights, powers, duties and obligations of the original Sponsor. The successor Sponsor shall not be under any liability under the Trust Agreement for occurrences or omissions
prior to the execution of such instrument. Any successor Sponsor may be compensated at rates deemed by the Trustee to be reasonable, but not exceeding the amounts prescribed by the SEC. </p>
<p>The Sponsor may resign by executing and delivering to the Trustee an instrument of resignation. Such resignation shall become effective upon the appointment of
a successor Sponsor and the acceptance of appointment by the successor Sponsor, unless the Trustee either agrees to act as Sponsor or terminates the Trust Agreement and liquidates the Trust. The Trustee shall terminate the Trust Agreement and
liquidate the Trust if, within sixty (60) days following the date on which a notice of resignation was delivered by the Sponsor, a successor Sponsor has not been appointed or the Trustee has not agreed to act as Sponsor. </p>

<p>The Trust Agreement provides that the Sponsor is not liable to the Trustee, the Trust or to the Beneficial Owners
of Units for taking or refraining from taking any action in good faith, or for errors in judgment, but is liable only for its own gross negligence, bad faith, willful misconduct or willful malfeasance in the performance of its duties or its reckless
disregard of its obligations and duties under the Trust Agreement. The Sponsor is not liable or responsible in any way for depreciation or loss incurred by the Trust because of the purchase or sale of any Portfolio Securities. The Trust Agreement
further provides that the Sponsor and its directors, shareholders, officers, employees, subsidiaries and affiliates under common control with the Sponsor shall be indemnified from the assets of the Trust and held harmless against any loss, liability
or expense incurred without gross negligence, bad faith, willful misconduct or willful malfeasance on the part of any such party arising out of or in connection with the performance of its duties or reckless disregard of its obligations and duties
under the Trust Agreement, including the payment of the costs and expenses (including counsel fees) of defending against any claim or liability. </p> <p>As of

</p> <p><b><a name="toc280704_52"></a>TRUSTEE </b></p>
<p>Effective June 16, 2017, SSBT resigned as trustee of the Trust. The Sponsor appointed the Trustee, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SSBT, as trustee of the
Trust. The services received, and the trustee fees paid, by the Trust did not change as a result of the change in the identity of the Trustee. SSBT continues to maintain the Trust’s accounting records, act as custodian and transfer agent to the
Trust, and provide administrative services, including the filing of certain regulatory reports. </p> <p>The Trustee is a limited purpose trust company organized
under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts with its principal place of business at One Iron Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02210. The Trustee is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of SSBT and as such is regulated by the Federal Reserve System
and is subject to applicable federal and state banking and trust laws and to supervision by the Federal Reserve, as well as by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks and the regulatory authorities of those states and countries in which a branch of
the Trustee is located. </p> <p>The Trustee may resign and be discharged of the Trust created by the Trust Agreement by executing a notice of resignation in
writing and filing such notice with the Sponsor and mailing a copy of the notice of resignation to all DTC Participants reflected on the records of DTC as owning Units for distribution to Beneficial Owners as provided above not less than sixty
(60) days before the date such resignation is to take effect. Such resignation becomes effective upon the acceptance of the appointment as Trustee for the Trust by the successor Trustee. The Sponsor, upon receiving notice of such resignation,
is obligated to use its best efforts promptly to appoint a successor Trustee in the manner and meeting the qualifications provided in the Trust Agreement. If no successor is appointed within sixty (60) days after the date such notice of
resignation is given, the Trustee shall terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trust. </p> <p>If the Trustee becomes incapable of acting as such, or
fails to undertake or perform or becomes incapable of undertaking or performing any of the duties which by the terms </p> <p>of the Trust Agreement are required
to be undertaken or performed by it, and such </p>

<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
failure is not cured within fifteen (15) Business Days following receipt of notice from the Sponsor of such failure, or the Trustee is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver of the
Trustee or its property is appointed, or a trustee or liquidator or any public officer takes charge or control of such Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purposes of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, then the Sponsor may remove
the Trustee and appoint a successor Trustee as provided in the Trust Agreement. The Sponsor shall mail notice of such appointment of a successor Trustee via the DTC Participants to Beneficial Owners. Upon a successor Trustee’s execution of a
written acceptance and acknowledgement of an instrument accepting appointment as Trustee for the Trust, the successor Trustee becomes vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of the original Trustee. A successor Trustee must be
(a) a bank, trust company, corporation or national banking association organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or any state thereof; (b) authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers; and
(c) at all times have an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided profits of not less than $50,000,000. </p> <p>Beneficial Owners of 51% of the then
outstanding Units may at any time remove the Trustee by written instrument(s) delivered to the Trustee and the Sponsor. The Sponsor shall thereupon use its best efforts to appoint a successor Trustee as described above and in the Trust Agreement.
</p> <p>The Trust Agreement limits the Trustee’s liabilities. It provides, among other things, that the Trustee is not liable for (a) any action taken
in reasonable reliance on properly executed documents or for the disposition of monies or securities or for the evaluations required to be made thereunder, except by reason of its own gross negligence, bad faith, willful malfeasance, willful
misconduct, or reckless disregard of its duties and obligations; (b) depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale, or the failure to make a sale, by the Trustee of any Portfolio Securities; (c) any action the Trustee takes where the
Sponsor fails to act; and (d) any taxes or other governmental charges imposed upon or in respect of Portfolio Securities or upon the interest thereon or upon it as Trustee or upon or in respect of the Trust which the Trustee may be required to
pay under any present or future law of the United States of America or of any other taxing authority having jurisdiction. </p> <p>The Trustee and its directors,
subsidiaries, shareholders, officers, employees, and affiliates under common control with the Trustee will be indemnified from the assets of the Trust and held harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence, bad
faith, willful misconduct, willful malfeasance on the part of such party or reckless disregard of its duties and obligations arising out of or in connection with its acceptance or administration of the Trust, including the costs and expenses
(including counsel fees) of defending against any claim or liability. </p> <p>The Trustee, directly or through Depository Trust Company or SSBT, as custodian, has
possession of all securities and other property in which the Trust invests, all funds held for such investment, all equalization, redemption, and other special funds of the Trust, and all income upon, accretions to, and proceeds of such property and
funds. The Trustee, directly or through SSBT, as custodian, segregates, by recordation on its </p>

<p>The Distributor is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Colorado and is located at 1290 Broadway, Suite 1000, Denver, CO 80203. The
Distributor is a registered broker-dealer and a member of FINRA. The Sponsor pays the Distributor for its services a flat annual fee of $25,000. The Sponsor will not seek reimbursement for such payment from the Trust without obtaining prior
exemptive relief from the SEC. </p> <p><b><a name="toc280704_55"></a>TRUST AGREEMENT </b></p>
<p>Beneficial Owners shall not (a) have the right to vote concerning the Trust, except with respect to termination and as otherwise expressly set forth in
the Trust Agreement, (b) in any manner control the operation and management of the Trust, or (c) be liable to any other person by reason of any action taken by the Sponsor or the Trustee. The Trustee has the exclusive right to vote all of
the voting stocks in the Trust. The Trustee votes the voting stocks of each issuer in the same proportionate relationship that all other shares of each such issuer are voted (known as “mirror voting”) to the extent permissible and, if not
permitted, abstains from voting. The Trustee shall not be liable to any person for any action or failure to take any action with respect to such voting matters. </p>
<p>The death or incapacity of any Beneficial Owner does not operate to terminate the Trust nor entitle such Beneficial Owner’s legal representatives or heirs
to claim an accounting or to take any action or proceeding in any court for a partition or winding up of the Trust. </p>
<p><b><a name="toc280704_56"></a>Amendments to the Trust Agreement </b></p>
<p>The Trust Agreement may be amended from time to time by the Trustee and the Sponsor without the consent of any Beneficial Owners (a) to cure any ambiguity
or to correct or supplement any provision that may be defective or inconsistent or to make such other provisions as will not adversely affect the interests of Beneficial Owners; (b) to change any provision as may be required by the SEC;
(c) to add or change any provision as may be necessary or advisable for the continuing qualification of the Trust as a “regulated investment company” under the Code; (d) to add or change any provision as may be necessary or
advisable if NSCC or DTC is unable or unwilling to </p>
<p> </p> <p>89 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
continue to perform its functions; and (e) to add or change any provision to conform the adjustments to the Portfolio and the Portfolio Deposit to changes, if any, made by S&amp;P in its
method of determining the Index. The Trust Agreement may also be amended by the Sponsor and the Trustee with the consent of the Beneficial Owners of 51% of the outstanding Units to add provisions to, or change or eliminate any of the provisions of,
the Trust Agreement or to modify the rights of Beneficial Owners, although the Trust Agreement may not be amended without the consent of the Beneficial Owners of all outstanding Units if such amendment would (a) permit the acquisition of any
securities other than those acquired in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Trust Agreement; (b) reduce the interest of any Beneficial Owner in the Trust; or (c) reduce the percentage of Beneficial Owners required to consent to
any such amendment. </p> <p>Promptly after the execution of an amendment, the Trustee inquires of each DTC Participant, either directly or through a third party,
as to the number of Beneficial Owners for whom such DTC Participant holds Units, and provides each such DTC Participant or third party with sufficient copies of a written notice of the substance of such amendment for transmittal by each such DTC
Participant to Beneficial Owners. </p> <p><b><a name="toc280704_57"></a>Termination of the Trust Agreement </b></p>
<p>The Trust Agreement provides that the Sponsor has the discretionary right to direct the Trustee to terminate the Trust if at any time the net asset value of
the Trust is less than $350,000,000, as adjusted for inflation in accordance with the <font>CPI-U</font> at the end of each year from (and including) 1997. </p>
<p>The Trust may be terminated (a) by the agreement of the Beneficial Owners of 66 2/3% of outstanding Units; (b) if DTC is unable or unwilling to
continue to perform its functions as set forth under the Trust Agreement and a comparable replacement is unavailable; (c) if NSCC no longer provides clearance services with respect to Units, or if the Trustee is no longer a participant in NSCC;
(d) if S&amp;P ceases publishing the Index; or (e) if the License Agreement is terminated. The Trust will be terminated if Units are delisted from the Exchange. The Trust is scheduled to terminate on the first to occur of
(a) January 22, 2118 or (b) the date 20 years after the death of the last survivor of eleven persons named in the Trust Agreement, the oldest of whom was born in 1990 and the youngest of whom was born in 1993. </p>
<p>The Trust will terminate if either the Sponsor or the Trustee resigns and a successor is not appointed. The Trust will also terminate if the Trustee is removed
or the Sponsor fails to undertake or perform or becomes incapable of undertaking or performing any of the duties required under the Trust Agreement and a successor is not appointed. The dissolution of the Sponsor or its ceasing to exist as a legal
entity for any cause whatsoever, however, will not cause the termination of the Trust Agreement or the Trust unless the Trust is terminated as described above. </p>
<p>Prior written notice of the termination of the Trust must be given at least twenty (20) days before termination of the Trust to all Beneficial Owners. The
notice must </p>
<p> </p> <p>90 </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<p>
set forth the date on which the Trust will be terminated, the period during which the assets of the Trust will be liquidated, the date on which Beneficial Owners of Units (whether in Creation
Unit size aggregations or otherwise) will receive in cash the NAV of the Units held, and the date upon which the books of the Trust shall be closed. The notice shall further state that, as of the date thereof and thereafter, neither requests to
create additional Creation Units nor Portfolio Deposits will be accepted, and that, as of the date thereof, the portfolio of stocks delivered upon redemption shall be identical in composition and weighting to Portfolio Securities as of such date
rather than the stock portion of the Portfolio Deposit as in effect on the date request for redemption is deemed received. Beneficial Owners of Creation Units may, in advance of the Termination Date, redeem in kind directly from the Trust. </p>
<p>Within a reasonable period after the Termination Date, the Trustee shall, subject to any applicable provisions of law, sell all of the Portfolio Securities not
already distributed to redeeming Beneficial Owners of Creation Units. The Trustee shall not be liable or responsible in any way for depreciation or loss incurred because of any such sale. The Trustee may suspend such sales upon the occurrence of
unusual or unforeseen circumstances, including but not limited to a suspension in trading of a stock, the closing or restriction of trading on a stock exchange, the outbreak of hostilities or the collapse of the economy. The Trustee shall deduct
from the proceeds of sale its fees and all other expenses and transmit the remaining amount to DTC for distribution, together with a final statement setting forth the computation of the gross amount distributed. Units not redeemed before termination
of the Trust will be redeemed in cash at NAV based on the proceeds of the sale of Portfolio Securities, with no minimum aggregation of Units required. </p>

<p><b><a name="toc280704_61"></a>INFORMATION AND COMPARISONS RELATING TO </b></p>
<p><b>SECONDARY MARKET TRADING AND PERFORMANCE </b></p>
<p>One important difference between Units and conventional mutual fund shares is that Units are available for purchase or sale on an intraday basis on the
Exchange at market prices. In contrast, shares in a conventional mutual fund may be purchased or redeemed only at a price at, or related to, the closing net asset value per share, as determined by the fund. The table below illustrates the
distribution relationship of bid/ask spreads to NAV for 2021. This table should help investors evaluate some of the advantages and disadvantages of Units relative to mutual fund shares purchased and redeemed at prices at, or related to, the closing
net asset value per share. Specifically, the table illustrates in an approximate way the risks of purchasing or selling Units at prices less favorable than closing NAV and, correspondingly, the opportunities to purchase or sell at prices more
favorable than closing NAV. </p> <p>For the most recent information regarding the Trust’s NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid/ask spreads,
