Please read this Prospectus carefully before you make any </span><span>investment decisions. Additional information regarding the Funds is available at www.iShares.com.</span></div> <div><span>BFA is the investment adviser to the Funds. Shares of each Fund are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, Inc. (</span><span>“</span><span>NYSE Arca</span><span>”</span><span>). The market price for </span><span>a share of a Fund may be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV. Each Fund has its own CUSIP number and exchange trading symbol.</span></div> <div><span>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly-traded securities and are designed to track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, </span><span>each share of a Fund represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other instruments intended to track a </span><span>market index. Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based </span><span>on NAV, shares of the Funds may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Funds at NAV solely by Authorized Participants and only in </span><span>aggregations of a specified number of shares (</span><span>“</span><span>Creation Units</span><span>”</span><span>). Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of each Fund are listed on a </span><span>national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market prices that change throughout the day.</span></div> <div><span>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of financial instruments, and is not an investment product, while each Fund is an </span><span>actual investment portfolio. The performance of each Fund and its Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, including transaction </span><span>costs, non-U.S. currency valuations, asset valuations, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences </span><span>between each Fund’s portfolio and its Underlying Index resulting from the Funds' use of representative sampling or from legal restrictions </span><span>(such as diversification requirements) that apply to each Fund but not to its Underlying Index. From time to time, the Index Provider may </span><span>make changes to the methodology or other adjustments to a Fund's Underlying Index. Unless otherwise determined by BFA, any such change </span><span>or adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of a Fund's Underlying Index performance on a going-forward basis after the effective date </span><span>of such change or adjustment. Therefore, a Fund's Underlying Index performance shown for periods prior to the effective date of any such </span><span>change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect such change or adjustment.</span><span> </span> <br/><span>“</span><span>Tracking error</span><span>”</span><span> is the divergence of the performance (return) of each Fund's portfolio from that of its Underlying Index. Because each Fund </span><span>uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected to have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing </span><span>strategy. </span><span>“</span><span>Replication</span><span>”</span><span> is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all of the securities in its underlying index in </span><span>approximately the same proportions as in the underlying index.</span></div> <div><span>An investment in a Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other </span><span>government agency, BFA or any of its affiliates.</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund's investment objective and its Underlying Index may be changed without shareholder approval.</span></div> <div><span>Investment Objectives of the Funds</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund seeks investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of an S&amp;P </span><span>Target Risk Index (each, an </span><span>“</span><span>Underlying Index</span><span>”</span><span> and collectively, the </span><span>“</span><span>Underlying Indexes</span><span>”</span><span>). Each Underlying Index is comprised entirely of </span><span>securities of iShares funds (each, an </span><span>“</span><span>Underlying Fund</span><span>”</span><span> and collectively, the </span><span>“</span><span>Underlying Funds</span><span>”</span><span>) that themselves seek investment results </span><span>that correspond generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of their own respective underlying indexes. Each </span><span>Fund is an ETF fund of funds and seeks its investment objective by investing primarily in Underlying Funds that are iShares funds.</span></div> <div>

Each Fund may be exposed to these risks directly or indirectly through </span><span>the Fund's investments in the Underlying Funds. You could lose all or part of your investment in the Funds, and the Funds could underperform </span><span>other investments. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. Each Fund discloses its </span><span>portfolio holdings daily at </span><span>www.iShares.com</span><span>.</span></div> <div><span>Affiliated Fund Risk.</span><span> In managing the Funds, BFA has the ability to select Underlying Funds and substitute Underlying Funds with other ETFs </span><span>that it believes will achieve each Fund’s objective. BFA may be subject to potential conflicts of interest in selecting Underlying Funds and </span><span>substituting Underlying Funds with other ETFs because the fees paid to BFA by some Underlying Funds and other ETFs managed by BFA may </span><span>be higher than the fees paid by other Underlying Funds. If an Underlying Fund or other ETF holds interests in an affiliated fund, the Funds may </span><span>be prohibited from purchasing shares of that Underlying Fund or other ETF.</span></div> <div><span>Allocation Risk.</span><span> Each Fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective depends upon the Index Provider’s ability to develop a model that </span><span>accurately assesses each Fund’s asset class allocation and selects the best mix of Underlying Funds and other ETFs. There is a risk that the </span><span>Index Provider’s evaluations and assumptions regarding asset classes or Underlying Funds, which are utilized as inputs in the model, may be </span><span>incorrect in view of actual market conditions. Each Fund’s Underlying Index may overweight certain asset classes relative to market </span><span>capitalization-weighted benchmarks. Each Fund will underperform such benchmarks when asset classes that are overweighted in each </span><span>Fund’s Underlying Index underperform other asset classes.</span></div> <div><span>Asian Economic Risk.</span><span> Many Asian economies have experienced rapid growth and industrialization in recent years, but there is no assurance </span><span>that this growth rate will be maintained. Other Asian economies, however, have experienced high inflation, high unemployment, currency </span><span>devaluations and restrictions, and over-extension of credit. Geopolitical hostility, political instability, and economic or environmental events </span><span>in any one Asian country may have a significant economic effect on the entire Asian region, as well as on major trading partners outside Asia. </span><span>Any adverse event in the Asian markets may have a significant adverse effect on some or all of the economies of the countries in which a </span><span>Fund or an Underlying Fund invests. In particular, China is a key trading partner of many Asian countries and any changes in trading </span><span>relationships between China and other Asian countries may affect the region as a whole. Many Asian countries are subject to political risk, </span><span>including political instability, corruption and regional conflict with neighboring countries. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial </span><span>military capabilities, and historical tensions between the two countries present the risk of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries </span><span>and any outbreak of hostilities between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect </span><span>on the entire Asian region. Certain Asian countries have developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S. or with China, and if </span><span>these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. or China for trade. In addition, many Asian </span><span>countries are subject to social and labor risks associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions. These risks, </span><span>among others, may adversely affect the value of a Fund's</span><span> </span><span>or an Underlying Fund's investments.</span></div> <div><span>Asset Class Risk.</span><span> The securities</span><span> </span><span>and other assets in the Underlying Indexes or in a Fund’s or an Underlying Fund's portfolio may </span><span>underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries, groups of </span><span>industries, markets, market segments, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, currencies and indexes may experience cycles of </span><span>outperformance and underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets</span><span> </span><span>depending upon a number of factors including, among </span><span>other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental controls. </span><span>This may cause a Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that invest in different asset classes.</span></div> <div><span>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. </span><span>Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly </span><span>with a Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption transactions. Each Fund has a </span><span>limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, on behalf of other market participants). To the </span><span>extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to a Fund and </span><span>no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a </span><span>premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened </span><span>because ETFs, such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S. issuers or other securities or instruments that are less widely </span><span>traded often involve greater settlement and operational issues and capital costs for Authorized Participants, which may limit the availability of </span><span>Authorized Participants.</span></div> <div><span>Calculation Methodology Risk.</span><span> The Underlying Indexes rely on various sources of information to assess the criteria of issuers included in </span><span>the Underlying Index, including information that may be based on assumptions and estimates. Neither the Funds nor BFA can offer </span><span>assurances that the Underlying Indexes' calculation methodology or sources of information will provide an accurate assessment of included </span><span>issuers.</span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>Call Risk.</span><span> During periods of falling interest rates, an issuer of a callable bond held by a Fund and an Underlying Fund may </span><span>“</span><span>call</span><span>”</span><span> or repay the </span><span>security before its stated maturity, and a Fund and an Underlying Fund may have to reinvest the proceeds in securities with lower yields, </span><span>which would result in a decline in a Fund’s income, or in securities with greater risks or with other less favorable features.</span></div> <div><span>Concentration Risk.</span><span> Each Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the </span><span>Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that a Fund's or an Underlying Fund's investments are concentrated in </span><span>the securities and/or other assets a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, </span><span>sector, market segment or asset class. Each Fund may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of those securities and/or other </span><span>assets, may experience increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory </span><span>occurrences affecting those securities and/or other assets than a fund that does not concentrate its investments.</span></div> <div><span>Credit Risk.</span><span> Credit risk is the risk that the issuer or guarantor of a debt instrument or the counterparty to a derivatives contract, repurchase </span><span>agreement or loan of portfolio securities will be unable or unwilling to make its timely interest and/or principal payments when due or </span><span>otherwise honor its obligations. There are varying degrees of credit risk, depending on an issuer’s or counterparty’s financial condition and on </span><span>the terms of an obligation, which may be reflected in the issuer’s or counterparty’s credit rating. There is the chance that a Fund’s or an </span><span>Underlying Fund's portfolio holdings will have their credit ratings downgraded or will default (</span><span>i.e., </span><span>fail to make scheduled interest or principal </span><span>payments), or that the market’s perception of an issuer’s creditworthiness may worsen, potentially reducing such Fund’s or an Underlying </span><span>Fund's income level or share price, which may adversely affect the value of each Fund or an Underlying Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Currency Risk.</span><span> Because the Funds' and the Underlying Funds' NAVs are determined on the basis of the U.S. dollar, investors may lose </span><span>money if a currency of a non-U.S. market in which a Fund or an Underlying Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are </span><span>delays or limits on repatriation of such currency, even if such currency value of the Fund's holdings in that market increases. Currency </span><span>exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, a Fund’s NAV may change quickly and without </span><span>warning.</span></div> <div><span>Cybersecurity Risk.</span><span> Each Fund,</span><span> </span><span>Authorized Participants, service providers and the relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, </span><span>information security and related </span><span>“</span><span>cyber</span><span>”</span><span> risks both directly and through their service providers.  Similar types of cybersecurity risks are also </span><span>present for issuers of securities in which each Fund or the Underlying Funds invest, which could result in material adverse consequences for </span><span>such issuers and may cause a Fund’s or an Underlying Fund's investment in such issuers to lose value. In general, cyber incidents can result </span><span>from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital </span><span>systems (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, through </span><span>“</span><span>hacking</span><span>”</span><span> or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting </span><span>data, or causing operational disruption. Cyberattacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, </span><span>such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users). Recently, </span><span>geopolitical tensions may have increased the scale and sophistication of deliberate attacks, particularly those from nation-states or from </span><span>entities with nation-state backing.</span><span> </span> <br/><span>Cybersecurity failures by, or breaches of, the systems of the Funds' or an Underlying Fund's adviser, distributor and other service providers </span><span>(including, but not limited to, index and benchmark providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market </span><span>makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which each Fund or the Underlying Funds invest have the ability to cause </span><span>disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in: financial losses, interference with a Fund’s or an Underlying Fund's </span><span>ability to calculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of erroneous trades or </span><span>erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of each Fund or each Underlying Fund or their service providers to transact business, </span><span>violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation </span><span>costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyberattacks may render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership </span><span>of Fund shares, and other data integral to the functioning of each Fund or Underlying Fund inaccessible, inaccurate or incomplete. </span><span>Substantial costs may be incurred by each Fund or Underlying Fund in order to resolve or prevent cyber incidents in the future. While each </span><span>Fund and the Underlying Funds have established business continuity plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such </span><span>cyber incidents, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified, </span><span>that prevention and remediation efforts will not be successful or that cyberattacks will go undetected. Furthermore, each Fund cannot </span><span>control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by service providers to each Fund, issuers in which each Fund invests, the Index </span><span>Provider, market makers or Authorized Participants. Each Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result.</span></div> <div><span>Derivatives Risk. </span><span>A derivative is a financial contract, the value of which depends on or is derived from, the value of an underlying asset such </span><span>as a security or an index. Each Fund</span><span> </span><span>and Underlying Fund may invest in certain types of derivatives contracts, including futures, options and </span><span>swaps. Compared to conventional securities, derivatives can be more sensitive to changes in interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in </span><span>market prices and thus a Fund’s or an Underlying Fund's losses may be greater if it invests in derivatives than if it invests only in conventional </span><span>securities.</span></div> <div><span>Equity Securities Risk.</span><span> Certain Underlying Funds invest in equity securities, which are subject to changes in value that may be attributable </span><span>to market perception of a particular issuer or to general stock market fluctuations that affect all issuers. Investments in equity securities may </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>be more volatile than investments in other asset classes. Certain Underlying Funds invest in common stocks, which generally subject</span><span> </span><span>their </span><span>holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders' claims are subordinated to those of holders </span><span>of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</span></div> <div><span>European Economic Risk. </span><span>The Economic and Monetary Union (the </span><span>“</span><span>eurozone</span><span>”</span><span>) of the EU requires compliance by member states that are </span><span>members of the eurozone with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates and debt levels, as well as fiscal and monetary controls, </span><span>each of which may significantly affect every country in Europe, including those countries that are not members of the eurozone. Additionally, </span><span>European countries outside of the eurozone may present economic risks that are independent of the indirect effects that eurozone policies </span><span>have on them. In particular, the United Kingdom's (the </span><span>“</span><span>U.K.</span><span>”</span><span>) economy may be affected by global economic, industrial and financial shifts. </span><span>Changes in imports or exports, changes in governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro (the common </span><span>currency of eurozone countries), the default or threat of default by an EU member state on its sovereign debt and/or an economic recession </span><span>in an EU member state may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of other EU member states and their trading partners. The </span><span>European financial markets have historically experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns or </span><span>government debt levels in several European countries, including, but not limited to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, </span><span>Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. These events have affected and may in the future adversely affect the exchange rate of the euro and may </span><span>significantly affect European countries.</span></div> <div><span>Responses to financial problems by European governments, central banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not </span><span>produce the desired results, may result in social unrest, may limit future growth and economic recovery or may have other unintended </span><span>consequences. Further defaults or restructurings by governments and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on </span><span>economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more countries may abandon the euro and/or </span><span>withdraw from the EU. The U.K. left the EU (</span><span>“</span><span>Brexit</span><span>”</span><span>) on January 31, 2020. The U.K. and EU reached an agreement on the terms of their future </span><span>trading relationship effective January 1, 2021, which principally relates to the trading of goods rather than services, including financial </span><span>services. Further discussions are to be held between the U.K. and the EU in relation to matters not covered by the trade agreement, such as </span><span>financial services. The Funds face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and consequences that may follow Brexit, including with </span><span>respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic </span><span>or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. Brexit has </span><span>also led to legal uncertainty and could lead to politically divergent national laws and regulations as a new relationship between the U.K. and </span><span>EU is defined and the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects could adversely affect any of the </span><span>companies to which a Fund has exposure and any other assets in which the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or an Underlying Fund invests. The political, economic and </span><span>legal consequences of Brexit are not yet fully known. In the short term, financial markets may experience heightened volatility, particularly </span><span>those in the U.K. and Europe, but possibly worldwide. The U.K. and Europe may be less stable than they have been in recent years, and </span><span>investments in the U.K. and the EU may be difficult to value or subject to greater or more frequent volatility. In the longer term, there is likely </span><span>to be a period of significant political, regulatory and commercial uncertainty as the U.K. continues to negotiate the terms of its future trading </span><span>relationships.</span></div> <div><span>Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain and the independence movement in Scotland, as well as governmental or </span><span>other responses to such movements, may also create instability and uncertainty in the region. In addition, the national politics of countries in </span><span>the EU have been unpredictable and subject to influence by disruptive political groups and ideologies. The governments of EU countries may </span><span>be subject to change and such countries may experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments </span><span>may result in sudden and significant investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe or war in the region could </span><span>also impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely affect the </span><span>value and liquidity of a Fund's investments.</span></div> <div><span>Russian Invasion of Ukraine</span><span>. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The extent and duration of the military </span><span>action, resulting sanctions and resulting future market disruptions, including declines in its stock markets and the value of the ruble against </span><span>the U.S. dollar, in the region are impossible to predict, but could be significant. Any such disruptions caused by Russian military action or </span><span>other actions (including cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting actual and threatened responses to such activity, including purchasing and </span><span>financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer or purchaser preferences, sanctions, tariffs or cyberattacks on Russian entities or </span><span>individuals, including politicians could have a severe adverse effect on the region, including significant negative impacts on the economy and </span><span>the markets for certain securities and commodities, such as oil and natural gas, as well as other sectors. How long such military action and </span><span>related events will last cannot be predicted. These and any related events could have significant impact on Fund performance and the value </span><span>of an investment in a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Extension Risk. </span><span>During periods of rising interest rates, certain debt obligations may be paid off substantially more slowly than originally </span><span>anticipated and the value of those securities may fall sharply, resulting in a decline in a Fund’s or an Underlying Fund's income and potentially </span><span>in the value of a Fund’s or an Underlying Fund's investments.</span></div> <div><span>Financials Sector Risk.</span><span> Companies in the financials sector</span><span> </span><span>of an economy are subject to extensive governmental regulation and </span><span>intervention, which may adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge, the amount of capital they must maintain </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>and, potentially, their size. The extent to which the Funds or an Underlying Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related </span><span>activities or banking is limited by applicable law. Governmental regulation may change frequently and may have significant adverse </span><span>consequences for companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by such regulation. Increased risk taking by banks may </span><span>also result in greater overall risk in the U.S. and global financials sector. The impact of changes in capital requirements, or recent or future </span><span>regulation in various countries, on any individual financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted.</span> <br/><span>Certain risks may impact the value of investments in the financials sector more severely than those of investments outside this sector, </span><span>including the risks associated with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage. Companies in the financials sector are </span><span>exposed directly to the credit risk of their borrowers and counterparties, who may be leveraged to an unknown degree, including through </span><span>swaps and other derivatives products. Financial services companies may have significant exposure to the same borrowers and </span><span>counterparties, with the result that a borrower’s or counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations to one company may affect other </span><span>companies with exposure to the same borrower or counterparty. This interconnectedness of risk may result in significant negative impacts to </span><span>companies with direct exposure to the defaulting counterparty as well as adverse cascading effects in the markets and the financials sector </span><span>generally. Companies in the financials sector may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and loan losses, decreases in the </span><span>availability of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades and adverse conditions in other related markets. Insurance companies, in </span><span>particular, may be subject to severe price competition and/or rate regulation, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability. The </span><span>financials sector is particularly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. The financials sector is also a target for cyberattacks, and may </span><span>experience technology malfunctions and disruptions. Cyberattacks and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly </span><span>frequent in this sector and have reportedly caused losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively impact a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Geographic Risk.</span><span> Some of the companies in which the Underlying Funds invest are located in parts of the world that have historically been </span><span>prone to natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, droughts, floods, hurricanes or tsunamis and are economically </span><span>sensitive to environmental events. Any such event may adversely impact the economies of these geographic areas or business operations of </span><span>companies in these geographic areas, causing an adverse impact on the value of a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>High Yield Securities Risk.</span><span> Securities that are rated below investment-grade (commonly referred to as </span><span>“</span><span>junk bonds,</span><span>”</span><span> which may include </span><span>those bonds rated below </span><span>“</span><span>BBB-</span><span>”</span><span> by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch, or below </span><span>“</span><span>Baa3</span><span>”</span><span> by Moody’s), or are unrated, may be deemed speculative, </span><span>may involve greater levels of risk than higher-rated securities of similar maturity and may be more likely to default.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The major risks of high yield securities investments include:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>High yield securities may be issued by less creditworthy issuers. Issuers of high yield securities may have a larger amount of outstanding </span><span>debt relative to their assets than issuers of investment-grade bonds. In the event of an issuer’s bankruptcy, claims of other creditors may </span><span>have priority over the claims of high yield securities holders, leaving few or no assets available to repay high yield securities holders.</span></div> </div> <div></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>Prices of high yield securities are subject to extreme price fluctuations. Adverse changes in an issuer’s industry and general economic </span><span>conditions may have a greater impact on the prices of high yield securities than on other higher rated fixed-income securities. The credit </span><span>rating of a high yield security does not necessarily address its market value risk. Ratings and market value may change from time to time, </span><span>positively or negatively, to reflect new developments regarding the issuer.</span></div> </div> <div></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>Issuers of high yield securities may be unable to meet their interest or principal payment obligations because of an economic downturn, </span><span>specific issuer developments, or the unavailability of additional financing.</span></div> </div> <div></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>High yield securities frequently have redemption features that permit an issuer to repurchase the security from a Fund or an Underlying </span><span>Fund before it matures. If the issuer redeems high yield securities held by a Fund or the Underlying Fund, a Fund or an Underlying Fund </span><span>may have to invest the proceeds in bonds with lower yields and may lose income.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>High yield securities may be less liquid than higher rated fixed-income securities, even under normal economic conditions. There are fewer </span><span>dealers in the high yield securities market, and there may be significant differences in the prices quoted for high yield securities by the </span><span>dealers. Because high yield securities may be less liquid than higher rated fixed-income securities, judgment may play a greater role in </span><span>valuing certain of a Fund's</span><span> </span><span> </span><span>or an Underlying Fund's securities than is the case with securities trading in a more liquid market.</span></div> </div> <div></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>A Fund</span><span> </span><span>or an Underlying Fund may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms with a </span><span>defaulting issuer.</span></div> </div> <div></div> </div> <div><span>Income Risk.</span><span> A Fund’s income may decline when interest rates fall.  This decline can occur because a Fund or an Underlying Fund may </span><span>subsequently invest in lower-yielding bonds as bonds in a Fund's portfolio mature or are called, bonds in the Underlying Index are </span><span>substituted, or a Fund or an Underlying Fund otherwise needs to purchase additional bonds.  The Index Provider’s substitution of bonds in the </span><span>Underlying Index may occur, for example, when the time to maturity for the bond no longer matches the Underlying Index’s stated maturity </span><span>guidelines.</span></div> <div><span>Index-Related Risk.</span><span> The Funds seek to achieve a return that corresponds generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and </span><span>expenses, of the Underlying Indexes, as published by their respective index providers. There is no assurance that the index providers or any </span><span>agents that act on their behalf will compile the Underlying Indexes accurately, or that the Underlying Indexes will be determined, composed </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>or calculated accurately. While the index providers do provide descriptions of what the Underlying Indexes are designed to achieve, neither </span><span>the index providers nor their agents provide any warranty or accept any liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the </span><span>Underlying Indexes or their related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Indexes will be in line with the index providers’ </span><span>described index methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to manage the Funds consistently with the Underlying </span><span>Indexes provided by the index providers to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee against the index providers’ or agents’ </span><span>errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the data used to compile the Underlying Indexes may occur from time </span><span>to time and may not be identified by the index providers and corrected for a period of time or at all, particularly where the indexes are less </span><span>commonly used as benchmarks. Therefore, gains, losses or costs associated with index provider errors will generally be borne by the Funds </span><span>and their shareholders. For example, during a period where a Fund’s Underlying Index contains incorrect constituents, the Funds tracking </span><span>such published Underlying Index would have market exposure to such constituents and would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s </span><span>other constituents. As such, errors may result in a negative or positive performance impact to the Funds and their shareholders. </span><span>Shareholders should understand that any gains from index provider errors will be kept by the Funds and their shareholders and any losses </span><span>resulting from index provider errors will be borne by the Funds and their shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>Unusual market conditions or other unforeseen circumstances (such as natural disasters, political unrest or war) may impact the Index </span><span>Provider or a third-party data provider, and could cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance to the Underlying Indexes. This </span><span>could cause the Underlying Indexes to vary from its normal or expected composition. The postponement of a scheduled rebalance could </span><span>mean that constituents of the Underlying Indexes that would otherwise be removed at rebalance due to changes in market capitalizations, </span><span>issuer credit ratings, or other reasons may remain, causing the performance and constituents of the Underlying Indexes to vary from those </span><span>expected under normal conditions. Apart from scheduled rebalances, the index providers may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the </span><span>Underlying Indexes due to reaching certain weighting constraints, unusual market conditions or corporate events or, for example, to correct </span><span>an error in the selection of index constituents. Where the Underlying Index of a Fund is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances its </span><span>portfolio to attempt to correlate it to its Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio rebalancing </span><span>will be borne directly by the Funds and their shareholders. Unscheduled rebalances to the Underlying Indexes may also expose the Funds to </span><span>tracking error risk, which is the risk that its returns may not track exactly those of the Underlying Indexes. Therefore, errors and additional ad </span><span>hoc rebalances carried out by the index providers to the Underlying Indexes may increase the costs and market exposure risk of the Funds.</span></div> <div><span>Similar risks exist for the Underlying Funds in tracking their benchmarks, which may result in the Funds' performance deviating from the </span><span>return of the Underlying Index.</span></div> <div><span>Infectious Illness Risk. </span><span>A widespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect the </span><span>economies of many nations and the global economy and may impact individual issuers and capital markets in ways that cannot be foreseen.</span></div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in travel restrictions, closed international borders, disruption of healthcare services, prolonged </span><span>quarantines, cancellations, supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, temporary and permanent closures of businesses, layoffs, </span><span>defaults and other significant economic, social and political impacts, as well as general concern and uncertainty.</span></div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in extreme volatility, severe losses, credit deterioration of issuers, and disruptions in markets, which </span><span>could adversely impact a Fund and its investments, including impairing any hedging activity.</span></div> <div><span>Certain local markets may be subject to closures. Any suspension of trading in markets in which the Funds or an Underlying Fund invests will </span><span>have an impact on the Funds</span><span> </span><span>or an Underlying Fund and their investments and will impact the Fund’s</span><span> </span><span>or an Underlying Fund's ability to </span><span>purchase or sell securities in such markets.</span><span> </span><span>Market or economic disruptions could result in elevated tracking error and increased premiums </span><span>or discounts to the Fund's NAV. Additionally, an outbreak could impair the operations of the Fund’s service providers, including BFA, which </span><span>could adversely impact the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Governmental and quasi-governmental authorities and regulators throughout the world may respond to an outbreak and any resulting </span><span>economic disruptions with a variety of fiscal and monetary policy changes, including direct capital infusions into companies and other </span><span>issuers, new monetary policy tools, and changes in interest rates. A reversal of these policies, or the ineffectiveness of such policies, is likely </span><span>to increase market volatility, which could adversely affect a Fund’s</span><span> </span><span>or an Underlying Fund's investments.</span></div> <div><span>An outbreak may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social and economic risks in certain countries or globally, which could adversely </span><span>affect a Fund and its investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Funds' NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Despite the development of vaccines, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects cannot be predicted with certainty.</span></div> <div><span>Interest Rate Risk.</span><span> If interest rates rise, the value of fixed-income securities or other instruments held by the Funds or an Underlying Fund </span><span>would likely decrease. A measure investors commonly use to determine this price sensitivity is called duration. Fixed-income securities with </span><span>longer durations tend to be more sensitive to interest rate changes, usually making their prices more volatile than those of securities with </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>6</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>shorter durations. For example, if a bond has a duration of five years and interest rates rise, the price of the bond will likely decline by a </span><span>greater percentage than if the bond had a one year duration. To the extent the Funds or an Underlying Fund invests a substantial portion of </span><span>its assets in fixed-income securities with longer duration, rising interest rates may cause the value of the Funds' or an Underlying Fund's </span><span>investments to decline significantly, which may adversely affect the value of each Fund or an Underlying Fund. An increase in interest rates </span><span>may lead to heightened volatility in the fixed-income markets and adversely affect certain fixed-income investments, including those held by </span><span>the Funds or an Underlying Fund. Because rates on certain floating rate debt securities typically reset only periodically, changes in prevailing </span><span>interest rates (and particularly sudden and significant changes) can be expected to cause some fluctuations in the net asset value of the </span><span>Fund to the extent that it invests in floating rate debt securities. In addition, decreases in fixed income dealer market-making capacity may </span><span>lead to lower trading volume, heightened volatility, wider bid-ask spreads and less transparent pricing in certain fixed-income markets.</span></div> <div><span>The historically low interest rate environment in recent years was created in part by the world’s major central banks keeping their overnight </span><span>policy interest rates at, near or below zero percent and implementing monetary policy facilities, such as asset purchase programs, to anchor </span><span>longer-term interest rates below historical levels. During periods of very low or negative interest rates, a Fund may be unable to maintain </span><span>positive returns or pay dividends to Fund shareholders. Certain countries have recently experienced negative interest rates on certain fixed-income</span><span> instruments. Very low or negative interest rates may magnify interest rate risk. Changing interest rates, including rates that fall below </span><span>zero, may have unpredictable effects on markets, result in heightened market volatility and detract from a Fund’s performance to the extent </span><span>the Fund is exposed to such interest rates. Additionally, under certain market conditions in which interest rates are set at low levels and the </span><span>market prices of portfolio securities have increased, the Funds or an Underlying Fund may have a very low or even negative yield. A low or </span><span>negative yield would cause the Funds or an Underlying Fund to lose money in certain conditions and over certain time periods. Central banks </span><span>may increase their short-term policy rates or begin phasing out, or </span><span>“</span><span>tapering,</span><span>”</span><span> accommodative monetary policy facilities in the future. The </span><span>timing, coordination, magnitude and effect of such policy changes on various markets are uncertain, and such changes in monetary policy </span><span>may adversely affect the value of a Fund’s investments.</span></div> <div><span>Investment in Underlying Funds Risk.</span><span> Each Fund invests substantially all of its assets in</span><span> </span><span>the Underlying Funds, so each Fund’s investment </span><span>performance is directly related to the performance of the Underlying Funds. Each Fund may also invest in other funds, including money </span><span>market funds. Each Fund’s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying Funds and other securities in which each Fund invests </span><span>based on their market valuations. An investment in a Fund will entail more direct and indirect costs and expenses than a direct investment in </span><span>the Underlying Funds. For example, in addition to the expenses of a Fund, a Fund indirectly pays a portion of the expenses (including </span><span>operating expenses and management fees) incurred by the Underlying Funds, although some of such fees will be offset by the fee waiver by </span><span>BFA.</span></div> <div><span>One Underlying Fund may buy the same securities that another Underlying Fund sells. Also, an investor in a Fund may receive taxable gains </span><span>from portfolio transactions by the Underlying Funds, as well as taxable gains from transactions in shares of the Underlying Funds held by the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> <div><span>As the Underlying Funds, or a Fund's allocations among the Underlying Funds, change from time to time, or to the extent that the total annual </span><span>fund operating expenses of the Underlying Funds change, the weighted average operating expenses borne by a Fund may increase or </span><span>decrease.</span></div> <div><span>Issuer Risk. </span><span>The performance of a Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which a Fund or an Underlying Fund has </span><span>exposure. A Fund may be adversely affected if an issuer of underlying securities held by the Fund or an Underlying Fund is unable or unwilling </span><span>to repay principal or interest when due. Any issuer of these securities may perform poorly, causing the value of its securities to decline. Poor </span><span>performance may be caused by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, expiration of patent protection, </span><span>disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages, corporate restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or other </span><span>factors. Issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock </span><span>prices to decline. An issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in which the issuer resides, invests, </span><span>sells products, or otherwise conducts operations. </span></div> <div><span>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.</span><span> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to </span><span>changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more limited growth potential compared </span><span>with smaller capitalization companies. During different market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the </span><span>overall performance of the broader securities markets.</span></div> <div><span>Management Risk. </span><span>Because BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, each Fund will not fully replicate its Underlying Index and </span><span>may hold securities not included in its Underlying Index. As a result, a Fund is subject to the risk that BFA’s investment strategy, the </span><span>implementation of which is subject to a number of constraints, may not produce the intended results.</span></div> <div><span>Market Risk.</span><span> Each Fund</span><span> </span><span>and the Underlying Funds could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over </span><span>longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The value of a security</span><span> </span><span>or other asset may decline due to changes in general market </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>7</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the issuer of the security</span><span> </span><span>or other asset, or factors that affect a </span><span>particular issuer or issuers, </span><span> </span><span>exchange or exchanges, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or </span><span>asset class. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, </span><span>recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Funds, the Underlying Funds and their investments and could result in </span><span>increased premiums or discounts to a Fund’s</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund's NAV. During a general market downturn, multiple asset classes may be </span><span>negatively affected. Changes in market conditions and interest rates generally do not have the same impact on all types of securities and </span><span>instruments.</span></div> <div><span>The countries in which a Fund invests may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability.</span></div> <div><span>Political and Social Risk.</span><span> Disparities of wealth, the pace and success of democratization and ethnic, religious and racial disaffection, among </span><span>other factors, may exacerbate social unrest, violence and labor unrest in some of the countries in which a Fund may invest. Unanticipated or </span><span>sudden political or social developments may result in sudden and significant investment losses.</span></div> <div><span>Economic Risk.</span><span> Some countries in which a Fund may invest may experience economic instability, including instability resulting from </span><span>substantial rates of inflation or significant devaluations of their currency, or economic recessions, which would have a negative effect on the </span><span>economies and securities markets of their economies. Some of these countries may also impose restrictions on the exchange or export of </span><span>currency or adverse currency exchange rates and may be characterized by a lack of available currency hedging instruments.</span></div> <div><span>Expropriation Risk.</span><span> Investments in certain countries in which a Fund may invest may be subject to loss due to expropriation or nationalization </span><span>of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of capital.</span></div> <div><span>Large Government Debt Risk.</span><span> Chronic structural public sector deficits in some countries in which a Fund may invest may adversely impact </span><span>securities held by a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Market Trading Risk.</span></div> <div><span>Absence of Active Market.</span><span> Although shares of the Funds and the Underlying Funds are listed for trading on one or more stock exchanges, </span><span>there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized </span><span>Participants.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Secondary Listings. </span><span>The Funds' shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock </span><span>exchange where the Funds' primary listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made available to non-U.S. investors through funds or </span><span>structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There can be no assurance that a Fund’s shares will continue to trade on any </span><span>such stock exchange or in any market or that a Fund’s shares will continue to meet the requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or </span><span>in any market. The Funds' shares may be less actively traded in certain markets than in others, and investors are subject to the execution and </span><span>settlement risks and market standards of the market where they or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information </span><span>available to investors who trade Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market hours may not be available to investors </span><span>who trade in other markets, which may result in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</span></div> <div><span>Secondary Market Trading Risk.</span><span> Shares of a Fund</span><span> </span><span>or an Underlying Fund may trade in the secondary market at times when the Fund or the </span><span>Underlying Funds do not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more </span><span>significant premiums or discounts than might be experienced at times when the Funds or the Underlying Funds accept purchase and </span><span>redemption orders. If a Fund purchases shares of an Underlying Fund at a time when the market price of Underlying Fund shares is at a </span><span>premium to their NAV or sells Underlying Fund shares when their market price is at a discount to their NAV, the Fund may incur losses.</span></div> <div><span>Secondary market trading in Fund shares may be halted by a stock exchange because of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, </span><span>trading in Fund shares on a stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility </span><span>pursuant to </span><span>“</span><span>circuit breaker</span><span>”</span><span> rules on the stock exchange or market.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of each Fund or an Underlying Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed on a stock exchange, may be sold short and are therefore </span><span>subject to the risk of increased volatility and price decreases associated with being sold short. In addition, trading activity in derivative </span><span>products based on a Fund or an Underlying Fund may lead to increased trading volume and volatility in the secondary market for the shares </span><span>of a Fund or an Underlying Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of each Fund and the Underlying Funds May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV.</span><span> Shares of a Fund and an Underlying Fund each trade on </span><span>stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s and the Underlying Fund's most recent respective NAV. The NAV of each Fund and </span><span>each Underlying Fund are calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuate with changes in the market value of such Fund’s or an </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>Underlying Fund's holdings. The trading price of each of the Funds' and Underlying Funds' shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading </span><span>hours</span><span> </span><span>based on both market supply of and demand for their shares and the underlying value of their portfolio holdings or NAV. As a result, the </span><span>trading prices of a Fund’s shares may deviate significantly from NAV during periods of market volatility. </span><span>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG </span><span>OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S OR THE UNDERLYING FUNDS' SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</span><span>. </span><span>However, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV </span><span>of a Fund or the Underlying Funds, as applicable, are not likely to be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, </span><span>which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature is </span><span>designed to make it more likely that a Fund’s</span><span> </span><span>or an Underlying Fund's shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the </span><span>Fund’s or an Underlying Fund's next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly with their respective NAV due to </span><span>timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including </span><span>disruptions at market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during periods of significant market volatility, may </span><span>result in trading prices for shares of a Fund or an Underlying Fund that differ significantly from their respective NAV. Authorized Participants </span><span>may be less willing to create or redeem Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for such shares or its underlying investments, which </span><span>may contribute to a Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.</span><span> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange involves two types of costs that apply to all securities </span><span>transactions. When buying or selling shares of a Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage commission and other charges. In </span><span>addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread</span><span>”</span><span>; that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>bid</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>ask</span><span>”</span><span> price).</span><span> </span><span>The spread, which varies over time for shares of a Fund </span><span>based on trading volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume and market liquidity and wider if the </span><span>Fund has less trading volume and market liquidity. In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be </span><span>regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because of the costs inherent in buying or selling Fund shares, </span><span>frequent trading may detract significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be advisable for investors who </span><span>anticipate regularly making small investments through a brokerage account.</span></div> <div><span>Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk.</span><span> Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of large-capitalization </span><span>companies and therefore the share price of an Underlying Fund that invests mostly in mid-capitalization companies may increase or decrease </span><span>by a greater percentage than those of funds that invest solely in stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of mid-capitalization</span><span> companies are also more vulnerable than large-capitalization stocks to adverse business or economic developments and the </span><span>stocks of mid-capitalization companies may be less liquid, making it difficult for a Fund or an Underlying Fund to buy and sell them. In </span><span>addition, mid-capitalization companies generally have less diverse product lines than large-capitalization companies and are more </span><span>susceptible to adverse developments related to their products.</span></div> <div><span>Model Risk.</span><span> Neither the Funds nor BFA can offer any assurance that the allocation model used to calculate the Underlying Indexes will </span><span>achieve its intended results or maximize returns or minimize risks, nor can the Funds or BFA offer assurance that a particular allocation will </span><span>be the appropriate allocation in all circumstances for every investor seeking a particular risk profile or time horizon.</span></div> <div><span>National Closed Market Trading Risk.</span><span> To the extent that the underlying securities and/or other assets held by a Fund</span><span> </span><span>or an Underlying </span><span>Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the Fund’s</span><span> </span><span>or an </span><span>Underlying Fund's shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of an underlying security and the last </span><span>quoted price for the underlying security (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the Fund’s</span><span> </span><span>or an Underlying Fund's quote from the closed foreign market).</span><span> </span><span>The impact of a </span><span>closed foreign market on the Fund or an Underlying Fund is likely to be greater where a large portion of the Fund’s or an Underlying Fund's </span><span>underlying securities and/or other assets trade on that closed foreign market or when the foreign market is closed for unscheduled reasons. </span><span>These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to a Fund’s</span><span> </span><span>or an Underlying Fund's NAV that may be greater than those experienced </span><span>by other ETFs.</span></div> <div><span>Non-U.S. Issuers Risk</span><span>. Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers have different risks from securities issued by U.S. issuers. These risks include </span><span>differences in accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards, the possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation, adverse </span><span>changes in investment or exchange control regulations, political instability which could affect U.S. investments in non-U.S. countries, </span><span>uncertainties of transnational litigation, and potential restrictions on the flow of international capital, including the possible seizure or </span><span>nationalization of the securities issued by non-U.S. issuers held by the Fund or an Underlying Fund. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject to less </span><span>governmental regulation than U.S. issuers. Moreover, individual non-U.S. economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. </span><span>economy in such respects as growth of gross domestic product, rate of inflation, capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency and balance </span><span>of payment positions. Unfavorable political, economic or governmental developments in non-U.S. countries could affect the payment of a </span><span>security’s principal and interest. Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may also be less liquid than, and more difficult to value than, securities </span><span>of U.S. issuers. In addition, the value of these securities may fluctuate due to changes in the exchange rate of the issuer’s local currency </span><span>against the U.S. dollar.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>9</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>Non-U.S. Securities Risk.</span><span> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks of investing in the markets where such </span><span>issuers are located, including heightened risks of inflation, nationalization and market fluctuations caused by economic and political </span><span>developments. The Underlying Funds that invest in non-U.S. securities may be subject to increased risk of loss caused by any of the factors </span><span>listed below:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>Government intervention in issuers' operations or structure;</span></div> </div> <div></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>A lack of market liquidity and market efficiency;</span></div> </div> <div></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>Greater securities price volatility;</span></div> </div> <div></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>Exchange rate fluctuations and exchange controls;</span></div> </div> <div></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>Less availability of public information about issuers;</span></div> </div> <div></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>Limitations on foreign ownership of securities;</span></div> </div> <div></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>Imposition of withholding or other taxes;</span></div> </div> <div></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>Imposition of restrictions on the expatriation of the funds or other assets of an Underlying Fund;</span></div> </div> <div></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>Higher transaction and custody costs and delays in settlement procedures;</span></div> </div> <div></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>Difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations;</span></div> </div> <div></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>Lower levels of regulation of the securities markets;</span></div> </div> <div></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>Weaker accounting, disclosure and reporting requirements and the risk of being delisted from U.S. exchanges; and</span></div> </div> <div></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>Legal principles relating to corporate governance, directors’ fiduciary duties and liabilities and stockholders’ rights in markets in which the </span><span>Underlying Funds may invest may differ from or may not be as extensive or protective as those that apply in the U.S.</span></div> </div> <div></div> </div> <div><span>Withholding Tax Reclaims Risk</span><span>. The Funds or an Underlying Fund may file claims to recover withholding tax on dividend and interest income (if </span><span>any) received from issuers in certain countries where such withholding tax reclaim is possible. Whether or when the Funds or an Underlying </span><span>Fund will receive a withholding tax refund in the future is within the control of the tax authorities in such countries. Where the Funds or an </span><span>Underlying Fund expects to recover withholding tax based on a continuous assessment of probability of recovery, the NAV of the Funds or an </span><span>Underlying Fund generally includes accruals for such tax refunds. The Fund continues to evaluate tax developments for potential impact to </span><span>the probability of recovery. If the likelihood of receiving refunds materially decreases, for example due to a change in tax regulation or </span><span>approach, accruals in the Fund’s or an Underlying Fund's NAV for such refunds may need to be written down partially or in full, which will </span><span>adversely affect that Fund’s or an Underlying Fund's NAV. Investors in the Funds or an Underlying Fund at the time an accrual is written down </span><span>will bear the impact of any resulting reduction in NAV regardless of whether they were investors during the accrual period.  Conversely, if a </span><span>Fund or an Underlying Fund receives a tax refund that has not been previously accrued, investors in the Funds or an Underlying Fund at the </span><span>time the claim is successful will benefit from any resulting increase in the Fund’s NAV. Investors who sold their shares prior to such time will </span><span>not benefit from such NAV or an Underlying Fund's increase.</span></div> <div><span>Operational Risk.</span><span> The Funds</span><span> </span><span>and the Underlying Funds are exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not </span><span>limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Funds' or an Underlying Fund's service providers, counterparties </span><span>or other third parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Funds, the Underlying Funds and BFA seek to </span><span>reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be </span><span>inadequate to address significant operational risks.</span></div> <div><span>Passive Investment Risk.</span><span> The Funds</span><span> </span><span>and the Underlying Funds are not actively managed and may be affected by a general decline in </span><span>market segments related to their Underlying Indexes. Each Fund and each Underlying Fund invest in securities included in, or representative </span><span>of, their respective underlying index, regardless of their investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Funds' or the </span><span>Underlying Funds' assets in defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</span></div> <div><span>Prepayment Risk. </span><span>During periods of falling interest rates, issuers of certain debt obligations may repay principal prior to the security’s </span><span>maturity, which may cause a Fund</span><span> </span><span>or an Underlying Fund to have to reinvest in securities with lower yields or higher risk of default, resulting </span><span>in a decline in a Fund’s or an Underlying Fund's income or return potential. Also, if a security subject to prepayment had been purchased at a </span><span>premium, the value of the premium would be lost in the event of prepayment.</span></div> <div><span>Reinvestment Risk</span><span>. A Fund or an Underlying Fund may invest a portion of its assets in short-term fixed-income instruments and as a result, </span><span>may be adversely affected when interest rates fall because they may have to invest in lower yielding bonds</span><span> </span><span>as bonds mature. This may cause </span><span>a Fund's or an Underlying Fund's income to decline, which may adversely affect the value of the Fund. This risk is typically greater with </span><span>respect to short-term bond funds and lower for long-term bond funds.</span></div> <div><span>Reliance on Trading Partners Risk.</span><span> The economies of many countries or regions in which certain of the Underlying Funds invest are highly </span><span>dependent on trading with certain key trading partners. Reduction in spending on products and services by these key trading partners, </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>institution of tariffs or other trade barriers or a slowdown in the economies of key trading partners may adversely affect the performance of </span><span>any company in which the Underlying Funds invest and have a material adverse effect on the Underlying Funds' performance.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. </span><span>Investment in developed country issuers may subject the Fund or an Underlying Fund to </span><span>regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and other risks associated with developed countries.</span><span> </span><span>Developed countries generally tend to </span><span>rely on services sectors (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> the financial services sector) as the primary means of economic growth. A prolonged slowdown in one or more </span><span>services sectors is likely to have a negative impact on economies of certain developed countries, although economies of individual developed </span><span>countries can be impacted by slowdowns in other sectors. In the past, certain developed countries have been targets of terrorism, and some </span><span>geographic areas in which the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or an Underlying Fund invests have experienced strained international relations due to territorial </span><span>disputes, historical animosities, defense concerns and other security concerns. These situations may cause uncertainty in the financial </span><span>markets in these countries or geographic areas and may adversely affect the performance of the issuers to which the Fund or the Underlying </span><span>Fund has exposure. Heavy regulation of certain markets, including labor and product markets, may have an adverse effect on certain issuers. </span><span>Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause prolonged periods of recession. Many developed countries are heavily </span><span>indebted and face rising healthcare and retirement expenses. In addition, price fluctuations of certain commodities and regulations impacting </span><span>the import of commodities may negatively affect developed country economies.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Russia.</span><span> Investing in Russian securities involves significant risks, in addition to those described under </span><span>“</span><span>Risk of Investing </span><span>in Emerging Markets</span><span>”</span><span> and </span><span>“</span><span>Non-U.S. Securities Risk,</span><span>”</span><span> that are not typically associated with investing in U.S. securities, including:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>The risk of delays in settling portfolio transactions and the risk of loss arising out of the system of share registration and custody used in </span><span>Russia;</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>Risks in connection with the maintenance of an Underlying Fund’s portfolio securities and cash with foreign sub-custodians and securities </span><span>depositories, including the risk that appropriate sub-custody arrangements will not be available to an Underlying Fund;</span></div> </div> <div></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>The risk that an Underlying Fund’s ownership rights in portfolio securities could be lost through fraud or negligence because ownership in </span><span>shares of Russian companies is recorded by the companies themselves and by registrars, rather than by a central registration system;</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>The risk that an Underlying Fund may not be able to pursue claims on behalf of its shareholders because of the system of share </span><span>registration and custody, and because Russian banking institutions and registrars are not guaranteed by the Russian government; and</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>The risk that various responses by other nation-states to alleged Russian cyber activity will impact Russia’s economy and Russian issuers </span><span>of securities in which an Underlying Fund invests.</span></div> </div> <div></div> </div> <div><span>Russian invasion of Ukraine</span><span>. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The extent and duration of the military </span><span>action, resulting sanctions and resulting future market disruptions, including declines in its stock markets and the value of the ruble against </span><span>the U.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but could be significant. Disruptions caused by Russian military action or other actions (including </span><span>cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting actual and threatened responses to such activity, including purchasing and financing restrictions, </span><span>boycotts or changes in consumer or purchaser preferences, sanctions, import and export restrictions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Russian </span><span>government, Russian companies or Russian individuals, including politicians, may impact Russia’s economy and Russian issuers of securities </span><span>in which the Funds </span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Funds invest. Actual and threatened responses to Russian military action may also impact the markets for </span><span>certain Russian commodities, such as oil and natural gas, as well as other sectors of the Russian economy, and are likely to have collateral </span><span>impacts on such sectors globally.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Russia Sanctions.</span><span> Governments in the U.S. and many other countries (collectively, the </span><span>“</span><span>Sanctioning Bodies</span><span>”</span><span>) have imposed economic </span><span>sanctions on certain Russian individuals, including politicians, and Russian corporate and banking entities, including banning Russia from </span><span>global payments systems that facilitate cross-border payments. The Sanctioning Bodies, or others, could also institute broader sanctions on </span><span>Russia. These sanctions, or even the threat of further sanctions, may result in the decline of the value and liquidity of Russian securities, a </span><span>weakening of the ruble or other adverse consequences to the Russian economy. These sanctions could also result in the immediate freeze of </span><span>Russian securities and/or funds invested in prohibited assets, impairing the ability of a Fund or Underlying Fund to buy, sell, receive or </span><span>deliver those securities and/or assets.</span></div> <div><span>The sanctions against certain Russian issuers include prohibitions on transacting in or dealing in issuances of debt or equity of such issuers. </span><span>Compliance with each of these sanctions has and may continue to impair the ability of an Underlying Fund to buy, sell, hold, receive or deliver </span><span>the affected securities or other securities of such issuers. If it becomes impracticable or unlawful for an Underlying Fund to hold securities </span><span>subject to, or otherwise affected by, sanctions (collectively, </span><span>“</span><span>affected securities</span><span>”</span><span>), or if deemed appropriate by BFA, an Underlying Fund may </span><span>prohibit in-kind deposits of the affected securities in connection with creation transactions and instead require a cash deposit, which may </span><span>also increase an Underlying Fund's transaction costs. An Underlying Fund may also be legally required to freeze assets in a blocked account.</span></div> <div><span>Sanctions have resulted in Russia taking counter measures or retaliatory actions, which has impaired the value and liquidity of Russian </span><span>securities.  These retaliatory measures include the immediate freeze of Russian assets held by an Underlying Fund. Due to the freeze of any </span><span>Underlying Fund assets, including depositary receipts, an Underlying Fund may need to liquidate non-restricted assets in order to satisfy any </span><span>Fund redemption orders. The liquidation of Underlying Fund assets during this time may also result in an Underlying Fund receiving </span><span>substantially lower prices for its securities. Russia may implement additional retaliatory measures, which may further impair the value and </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>liquidity of Russian securities and the ability of an Underlying Fund to receive dividend payments. Recently, Russia has issued a number of </span><span>countersanctions, some of which restrict the distribution of profits by limited liability companies (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, dividends), and prohibits Russian </span><span>persons from entering into transactions with designated persons from </span><span>“</span><span>unfriendly states</span><span>”</span><span> as well as the export of raw materials or other </span><span>products from Russia to certain sanctioned persons. Russian companies may be unable to pay dividends and, if they pay dividends, the Fund </span><span>may be unable to receive them.</span> <br/><br/><br/><span>These sanctions, the decision by Russia to suspend trading on the Moscow Exchange (MOEX) and prohibit non-resident investors from </span><span>executing security sales, and other events have led to changes in certain of the Underlying Indexes of the Underlying Funds. The Underlying </span><span>Fund’s Index Providers have removed Russian securities where present in an Underlying Index of an Underlying Fund. To the extent that an </span><span>Underlying Fund rebalances its portfolio and trades in non-Russian securities to seek to track the investment results of its Underlying Index, </span><span>this may result in transaction costs and increased tracking error. The Underlying Funds are currently restricted from trading in Russian </span><span>securities, including those in their portfolios, while an Underlying Fund's Underlying Index has removed Russian securities. For Underlying </span><span>Funds with Russian securities, this disparity will also lead to increased tracking error. The inability of the Underlying Fund to trade in Russian </span><span>securities may adversely affect the Underlying Fund’s ability to meet its investment objective. It is unknown when, or if, sanctions may be </span><span>lifted or the Underlying Fund’s ability to trade in Russian securities will resume.</span></div> <div><span>Also, if an affected security is included in an Underlying Fund's Underlying Index, the Underlying Fund may, where practicable, seek to </span><span>eliminate its holdings of the affected security by employing or augmenting its representative sampling strategy to seek to track the </span><span>investment results of its Underlying Index. The use of (or increased use of) a representative sampling strategy may increase the Underlying </span><span>Fund’s tracking error risk. If the affected securities constitute a significant percentage of an Underlying Fund's Underlying Index, the </span><span>Underlying Fund may not be able to effectively implement a representative sampling strategy, which may result in significant tracking error </span><span>between the Underlying Fund’s performance and the performance of its Underlying Index.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Saudi Arabia.</span><span> The ability of foreign investors (such as a Fund</span><span> </span><span>and Underlying Fund) to invest in the securities of Saudi </span><span>Arabian issuers is relatively new. Such ability could be restricted by the Saudi Arabian government at any time, and unforeseen risks could </span><span>materialize with respect to foreign ownership in such securities. In addition, the Saudi Arabian government places investment limitations on </span><span>the ownership of Saudi Arabian issuers by foreign investors, including a limitation on a Fund’s or an Underlying Fund's ownership of any </span><span>single issuer listed on the Saudi Arabian Stock Exchange, which may prevent a Fund</span><span> </span><span>and Underlying Fund from investing in accordance with </span><span>its strategy and contribute to tracking error against the Underlying Index. Saudi Arabia is highly reliant on income from the sale of petroleum </span><span>and trade with other countries involved in the sale of petroleum, and its economy is therefore vulnerable to changes in foreign currency </span><span>values and the market for petroleum. As global demand for petroleum fluctuates, Saudi Arabia may be significantly impacted. Like most </span><span>Middle Eastern governments, the government of Saudi Arabia exercises substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector. </span><span>Although liberalization in the wider economy is underway, in many areas it has lagged significantly: restrictions on foreign ownership persist, </span><span>and the government has an ownership stake in many key industries. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that Saudi Arabia is governed by </span><span>an absolute monarchy. Saudi Arabia has historically experienced strained relations with economic partners worldwide, including other </span><span>countries in the Middle East due to geopolitical events. Governmental actions in the future could have a significant effect on economic </span><span>conditions in Saudi Arabia, which could affect private sector companies and a Fund (or an Underlying Fund), as well as the value of securities </span><span>in a Fund’s</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund's portfolio. Any economic sanctions on Saudi Arabian individuals or Saudi Arabian corporate entities, or even </span><span>the threat of sanctions, may result in the decline of the value and liquidity of Saudi Arabian securities, a weakening of the Saudi riyal or other </span><span>adverse consequences to the Saudi Arabian economy. In addition, Saudi Arabia’s economy relies heavily on cheap, foreign labor, and </span><span>changes in the availability of this labor supply could have an adverse effect on the economy.</span></div> <div><span>Investments in the securities of Saudi Arabian issuers involve risks not typically associated with investments in securities of issuers in more </span><span>developed countries that may negatively affect the value of a Fund’s</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund's investments. Such heightened risks may include, </span><span>among others, expropriation and/or nationalization of assets, restrictions on and government intervention in international trade, confiscatory </span><span>taxation, political instability, including authoritarian and/or military involvement in governmental decision making, armed conflict, crime and </span><span>instability as a result of religious, ethnic and/or socioeconomic unrest. Although the political situation in Saudi Arabia is largely stable, Saudi </span><span>Arabia has historically experienced political instability, and there remains the possibility that instability in the larger Middle East region could </span><span>adversely impact the economy of Saudi Arabia. Political instability in the larger Middle East region has caused significant disruptions to many </span><span>industries. Continued political and social unrest in these areas may negatively affect the value of securities in a Fund’s</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund's </span><span>portfolio.</span></div> <div><span>Saudi Arabia Broker Risk.</span><span>  There are a number of different ways of conducting transactions in equity securities in the Saudi Arabian </span><span>market.  A Fund (or an Underlying Fund) generally expects to conduct its transactions in a manner in which a Fund (or an Underlying Fund) </span><span>would not be limited by Saudi Arabian regulations to a single broker. However, there may be a limited number of brokers who can provide </span><span>services to a Fund, which may have an adverse impact on the prices, quantity or timing of Fund transactions.  The limited number of brokers </span><span>may impact a Fund’s or an Underlying Fund’s ability to achieve best execution on securities transactions.  In addition, the limited number of </span><span>brokers available to a Fund (or an Underlying Fund) may make a Fund (or an Underlying Fund) more susceptible to credit loss or trading </span><span>disruptions in the event of a default or business disruption by one or more of the available brokers.  Should a Fund’s or an Underlying Fund’s </span><span>ability to use one or more brokers be affected for any reason, this could disrupt the operations of a Fund and affect the ability of a Fund to </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>12</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>track its Underlying Index and/or cause a Fund’s shares to trade at a premium or discount to NAV.  A Fund may also incur losses due to the </span><span>acts or omissions of its brokers in the execution or settlement of any transaction or in the transfer of any funds or securities.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the U.S.</span><span> A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations, inflation and/or an economic recession in the </span><span>U.S. may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed on U.S. exchanges. Proposed and adopted policy and </span><span>legislative changes in the U.S. are changing many aspects of financial, commercial, public health, environmental, and other regulation and </span><span>may have a significant effect on U.S. markets generally, as well as on the value of certain securities. Governmental agencies project that the </span><span>U.S. will continue to maintain elevated public debt levels for the foreseeable future. Although elevated debt levels do not necessarily indicate </span><span>or cause economic problems, elevated public debt service costs may constrain future economic growth.</span> <br/><span>The U.S. has developed increasingly strained relations with a number of foreign countries. If relations with certain countries deteriorate, it </span><span>could adversely affect U.S. issuers as well as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also experienced increased </span><span>internal unrest and discord, as well as significant challenges in managing and containing the outbreak of COVID-19. If these trends were to </span><span>continue, it may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the issuers in which a Fund or an Underlying Fund invests.</span></div> <div><span>Securities Lending Risk.</span><span> The Funds or an Underlying Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the </span><span>Funds</span><span> </span><span>or an Underlying Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner </span><span>or at all. A Fund</span><span> </span><span>or an Underlying Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities </span><span>or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for a </span><span>Fund</span><span> </span><span>or an Underlying Fund. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>BTC</span><span>”</span><span>), the securities lending agent</span><span> </span><span>for the Funds and the </span><span>Underlying Funds, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments for dividends when managing the securities </span><span>lending program</span><span> </span><span>for the Funds and the Underlying Funds.</span></div> <div><span>Tax Risk.</span><span> Because the Funds are expected to invest in the Underlying Funds, a Fund’s realized losses on sales of shares of an Underlying </span><span>Fund may be indefinitely or permanently deferred as </span><span>“</span><span>wash sales.</span><span>”</span><span> Distributions of short-term capital gains by an Underlying Fund will be </span><span>recognized as ordinary income by a Fund and would not be offset by the Fund’s capital loss carryforwards, if any. Capital loss carryforwards </span><span>of an Underlying Fund, if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Tracking Error Risk.</span><span> A Fund</span><span> </span><span>or each of its Underlying Funds may be subject to </span><span>“</span><span>tracking error,</span><span>”</span><span> which is the divergence of a fund’s </span><span>performance from that of its underlying index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities and other instruments </span><span>held in a fund’s portfolio and those included in a Fund's Underlying Index or an Underlying Fund's underlying index, pricing </span><span>differences</span><span> </span><span>(including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the Fund's or an Underlying </span><span>Fund's valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund's or Underlying Fund's NAV, respectively), transaction costs incurred by a </span><span>Fund</span><span> </span><span>or its Underlying Funds, a Fund’s</span><span> </span><span>or its Underlying Funds' holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual or the </span><span>valuation of dividends or interest received by a Fund or distributions paid to a Fund’s or an Underlying Fund’s shareholders, the requirements </span><span>to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, </span><span>acceptance of custom baskets, changes to the Underlying Index or an Underlying Fund's underlying index or the costs to a Fund</span><span> </span><span>or an </span><span>Underlying Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements, among other reasons. This risk may be heightened during </span><span>times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because a fund incurs fees and </span><span>expenses, while such a Fund's underlying index does not.</span></div> <div><span>Treaty/Tax Risk.</span><span> Certain of the Underlying Funds operate, in part, through the Mauritius subsidiaries, which in turn invest in securities of </span><span>Indian issuers.</span></div> <div><span>An investor is required to submit the tax residency certificate as issued in the country of residence and provide other documents and </span><span>information as prescribed by the Government of India to claim benefits under the DTAA.</span></div> <div><span>The revised DTAA provides that capital gains that arise from alienation of shares of an Indian company acquired by a Mauritian tax resident, </span><span>on or after April 1, 2017, would be taxable in India. However, the DTAA also provides for grandfathering of investments in shares made before </span><span>April 1, 2017. The application of such provisions of the DTAA could result in the imposition of withholding and capital gains taxes and/or other </span><span>taxes on the Mauritius subsidiaries by tax authorities in India. This could significantly reduce the return to an Underlying Fund on its </span><span>investments in shares and the return received by an Underlying Fund’s shareholders. The Indian government has notified MLI, which would </span><span>apply and modify tax treaties which have been notified by both the countries, being parties to the tax treaty, as a CTA. However, Mauritius </span><span>has not notified its tax treaty with India as a CTA; therefore the MLI will not apply to the DTAA. India and Mauritius may again renegotiate the </span><span>DTAA, which could impact the returns received by the Fund on its investments and returns received by the shareholders of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Criteria for Residence of Companies in India.</span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>13</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>A foreign company will be considered a resident in India if its place of effective management (</span><span>“</span><span>POEM</span><span>”</span><span>) (defined as a place where key </span><span>management and commercial decisions that are necessary for the conduct of the business of an entity as a whole are in substance made) is </span><span>in India in the relevant financial year. This test is to be applied taking the relevant financial year as a whole into consideration. The Central </span><span>Board of Direct Taxes (</span><span>“</span><span>CBDT</span><span>”</span><span>) has clarified that the provisions in relation to POEM shall not apply to a company having turnover of Indian </span><span>rupee (</span><span>“</span><span>INR</span><span>”</span><span>) 500 million or less in a year.</span></div> <div><span>Indirect Transfers.</span></div> <div><span>The (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (</span><span>“</span><span>IT Act</span><span>”</span><span>) imposes Indian tax and withholding obligations with respect to the transfer of shares and interest </span><span>in an overseas company that derives its value substantially from assets situated in India (</span><span>“</span><span>indirect transfers</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> <div><span>It has been clarified that the share or interest of the foreign entity shall be deemed to derive its value substantially from the assets located in </span><span>India, if the value of such Indian assets exceeds INR 100 million, and represents at least 50% of the value of all the assets owned by the </span><span>foreign entity. The value of an asset shall be the fair market value as of the specified date, of such an asset without reduction of liabilities. </span><span>The fair market value will be determined in accordance with Rule 11UB of the Income Tax Rule, 1962 (</span><span>“</span><span>IT Rules</span><span>”</span><span>). In case all the assets of the </span><span>foreign entity are not located in India, only such part of the income as is reasonably attributable to the Indian assets shall be subject to </span><span>capital gains tax in India.</span></div> <div><span>Further, it provides an exemption from indirect transfer provisions to the small shareholders of such foreign entity in the following cases:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>With respect to a foreign entity that holds the Indian assets directly, if the transferor of share or interest in such a foreign entity (along with </span><span>its associated enterprises), at any time in the twelve months preceding the year of transfer neither holds the right of control or </span><span>management in the foreign entity, nor holds voting power or share capital or interest exceeding 5% of the total voting power or total share </span><span>capital or total interest in such foreign entity.</span></div> </div> <div></div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>◾</span></div> <div><span>With respect to a foreign entity that holds the Indian assets indirectly, if the transferor of share or interest in such foreign entity (along with </span><span>its associated enterprises), at any time in the twelve months preceding the year of transfer does not hold the right of control or </span><span>management in relation to the foreign entity, which would entitle them to the right of control or management in the foreign entity which </span><span>directly holds the Indian assets; or does not hold voting power or share capital or interest exceeding 5% of the total voting power or total </span><span>share capital or total interest in the foreign entity, which results in holding the same share capital or voting power in the entity which </span><span>directly holds the Indian assets.</span></div> </div> <div></div> </div> <div><span>If the gains arising from transfer of shares or interests in a foreign entity are taxable in India in accordance with the aforementioned </span><span>provisions of indirect transfer, the purchaser of the securities will be required to withhold applicable Indian taxes.</span></div> <div><span>Gains realized when a non-resident acquires shares of a foreign company from another non-resident and the foreign company derives </span><span>“</span><span>substantial value</span><span>”</span><span> from Indian assets, (meaning that the value of Indian assets (i) exceeds INR 100 million, and (ii) represents at least 50% of </span><span>the value the company’s assets), such gains are taxable in India and subject to withholding, to the extent that they are reasonably </span><span>attributable to the Indian assets.</span></div> <div><span>Because</span><span> </span><span>certain of the Underlying</span><span> </span><span>Funds invest in Indian securities through the Subsidiary, the Subsidiary or the Underlying</span><span> </span><span>Fund may be </span><span>considered to derive </span><span>“</span><span>substantial value</span><span>”</span><span> from Indian assets, and accordingly, shareholder redemptions of Underlying</span><span> </span><span>Fund/Subsidiary shares </span><span>and sales of Underlying</span><span> </span><span>Fund shares may have been subject to Indian tax and withholding obligations. However, non-resident investors, </span><span>investing directly or indirectly in Category I Foreign Portfolio Investors (</span><span>“</span><span>FPI</span><span>”</span><span>), registered under SEBI (Foreign Portfolio Investors) Regulations, </span><span>2019 (</span><span>“</span><span>2019 Regulations</span><span>”</span><span>), are exempt from the applicability of indirect transfer taxation under the IT Act.

Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial condition or credit rating of a government may cause the </span><span>value of a Fund's or an Underlying Fund's U.S. Treasury obligations to decline. On August 5, 2011, S&amp;P Global Ratings downgraded U.S. </span><span>Treasury securities from AAA rating to AA+ rating. A further downgrade of the ratings of U.S. government debt obligations, which are often </span><span>used as a benchmark for other borrowing arrangements, could result in higher interest rates for individual and corporate borrowers, cause </span><span>disruptions in the international bond markets and have a substantial negative effect on the U.S. economy. A downgrade of U.S. Treasury </span><span>securities from another ratings agency or a further downgrade below AA+ rating by S&amp;P Global Ratings may cause the value of a Fund’s or </span><span>an Underlying Fund's U.S. Treasury obligations to decline.</span></div> <div><span>Valuation Risk.</span><span> The price a Fund or an Underlying Fund could receive upon the sale of a security</span><span> </span><span>or other asset may differ from the Fund's or </span><span>the Underlying Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the value used by its underlying index, particularly for securities or </span><span>other assets that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or </span><span>for other reasons. Because non-U.S. exchanges may be open on days when a Fund or an Underlying Fund does not price its shares, the value </span><span>of the securities or other assets in the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when the </span><span>shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund’s</span><span> </span><span>or the Underlying Fund's shares. In addition, for purposes of calculating a Fund's </span><span>or an Underlying Fund's NAV, the value of assets denominated in non-U.S. currencies is translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market </span><span>rates. This translation may result in a difference between the prices used to calculate a Fund's or an Underlying Fund's NAV and the prices </span><span>used by its underlying index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund's or the Underlying Fund's performance and the </span><span>performance of its underlying index. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem shares</span><span> </span><span>of a Fund or an Underlying Fund on days when </span><span>the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or the Underlying Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, </span><span>than they would have received had the Fund</span><span> </span><span>or the Underlying Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The </span><span>Fund’s</span><span> </span><span>or the Underlying Fund's ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other </span><span>third-party service providers.</span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>15</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated with its investments and investment strategies. The order of the below risk </span><span>factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</span></div> <div><span>Close-Out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.</span><span> Regulations adopted by global prudential regulators require counterparties that are part </span><span>of U.S. or foreign global systemically important banking organizations to include contractual restrictions on close-out and cross-default in </span><span>agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards </span><span>and other derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements. The restrictions prevent the Funds from closing </span><span>out a qualified financial contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution proceedings and also prohibit the </span><span>Funds from exercising default rights due to a receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. These requirements may </span><span>increase credit risk and other risks to the Funds.</span></div> <div><span>Commodity Risk. </span><span>The energy, materials, and agriculture sectors account for a large portion of the exports of certain countries in which an </span><span>Underlying Fund invests. Any changes in these sectors or fluctuations in the commodity markets could have an adverse impact on a </span><span>country's economy. Commodity prices may be influenced or characterized by unpredictable factors, including, where applicable, high </span><span>volatility, changes in supply and demand relationships, weather, agriculture, trade, pestilence, political instability, war, catastrophic events, </span><span>changes in interest rates and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction, including price changes due to trade relations. </span><span>Securities of companies held by an Underlying Fund that are dependent on a single commodity, or are concentrated in a single commodity </span><span>sector, may typically exhibit even higher volatility attributable to commodity prices.</span></div> <div><span>Consumer Discretionary Sector Risk.</span><span> The success of consumer product manufacturers and retailers is tied closely to the performance of </span><span>domestic and international economies, interest rates, exchange rates, supply chains, competition, consumer confidence, changes in </span><span>demographics and consumer preferences. Companies in the consumer discretionary sector depend heavily on disposable household income </span><span>and consumer spending, and may be strongly affected by social trends and marketing campaigns. These companies may be subject to severe </span><span>competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</span></div> <div><span>Currency Hedging Risk.</span><span> When a derivative is used as a hedge against a position that certain Underlying Funds hold, any loss generated by </span><span>the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can reduce or </span><span>eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and its </span><span>reference asset, and there can be no assurance that certain Underlying Funds’ hedging transactions will be effective. Currency hedging </span><span>activity exposes certain Underlying Funds to credit risk due to counterparty exposure, which risk will be higher to the extent that certain </span><span>Underlying Funds trade with a single counterparty or small number of counterparties. In seeking to track the performance of the underlying </span><span>indexes, certain Underlying Funds will attempt to hedge the currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated securities held in their </span><span>portfolios(held directly or indirectly through their investments in certain underlying funds) by investing in foreign currency forward contracts, </span><span>which may include both physically-settled forward contracts and non-deliverable forward (</span><span>“</span><span>NDF</span><span>”</span><span>) contracts. NDFs may be less liquid than </span><span>deliverable forward currency contracts and require a Fund to post variation margin to the counterparty, which can increase costs for a Fund. </span><span>A lack of liquidity in NDFs of the hedged currency could result in certain Underlying Funds being unable to structure their hedging </span><span>transactions as intended. In addition, BFA may seek to limit the size of certain Underlying Funds in order to attempt to reduce the likelihood </span><span>of a situation where certain Underlying Funds are unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in an underlying currency hedge to implement their </span><span>investment objectives.</span></div> <div><span>There is no assurance that certain Underlying Funds’ hedging strategies will be effective in hedging fluctuations in the value of these </span><span>currencies against the U.S. dollar. The effectiveness of certain Underlying Funds’ currency hedging strategies will in general be affected by </span><span>the volatility of both the underlying indexes and the volatility of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies to be hedged, measured on an </span><span>aggregate basis. Increased volatility will generally reduce the effectiveness of certain Underlying Funds’ currency hedging strategies. In </span><span>addition, volatility in one or more of the currencies may offset stability in another currency and reduce the overall effectiveness of the </span><span>hedges. The effectiveness of certain Underlying Funds’ currency hedging strategies may also be affected by interest rates, which may differ </span><span>among the affected countries. Significant differences between U.S. dollar interest rates and some or all of the applicable foreign currency </span><span>interest rates may impact the effectiveness of certain Underlying Funds’ currency hedging strategies. In addition, the currency hedging </span><span>carried out by certain Underlying Funds may result in lower returns than those generated through direct investments in the securities </span><span>comprising the underlying indexes when the local currency appreciates against the U.S. dollar.</span></div> <div><span>Foreign currency forward contracts, including NDFs, do not eliminate movements in the value of non-U.S. currencies and securities but </span><span>rather allow certain Underlying Funds to establish a fixed rate of exchange for a future point in time. Exchange rates may be volatile and may </span><span>change quickly and unpredictably in response to both global economic developments and economic conditions in a geographic region in </span><span>which certain Underlying Funds invest. In addition, in order to minimize transaction costs, or for other reasons, certain Underlying Funds’ </span><span>exposure to the component currencies may not be fully hedged at all times or the hedge may not be effective due to counterparty failures or </span><span>otherwise. At certain times, certain Underlying Funds may use an optimized hedging strategy and will hedge a smaller number of component </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>16</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>currencies to reduce hedging costs. Governments from time to time intervene in the currency markets, directly and by regulation, in order to </span><span>influence prices. From time to time, governments may adopt policies designed to directly influence foreign exchange rates with respect to </span><span>their currency. As a result, certain Underlying Funds may not be able to structure their hedging transactions as anticipated or their hedging </span><span>transactions may not successfully reduce the currency risk included in certain Underlying Funds’ portfolios in a way that tracks their </span><span>respective underlying indexes. To the extent certain Underlying Funds enter into over-the-counter derivative transactions or other </span><span>instruments to pursue their currency hedging strategies, certain Underlying Funds will be subject to counterparty risk as well as market or </span><span>liquidity risk with respect to these transactions. In addition, certain Underlying Funds’ currency hedging activities may involve frequent </span><span>trading of currency instruments, which may increase transaction costs and cause certain Underlying Funds’ returns to deviate from the </span><span>underlying indexes.</span></div> <div><span>Investors, such as certain Underlying Funds, seeking to trade in foreign currencies may have limited access to certain currency markets due </span><span>to a variety of factors, including government regulations, adverse tax treatment, exchange controls, currency convertibility issues and lack of </span><span>market liquidity. These limitations and restrictions may impact the availability, liquidity and pricing of the financial instruments that are </span><span>necessary for certain Underlying Funds to hedge exposure to the currency markets. If certain Underlying Funds’ ability to enter into contracts </span><span>to purchase or sell the currency of a non-U.S. market in which certain Underlying Funds invest is impaired, certain Underlying Funds may not </span><span>be able to achieve their investment objectives. In addition, these foreign currency hedging instruments often involve derivative investments </span><span>and, therefore, expose certain Underlying Funds to the risks described under </span><span>“</span><span>Derivatives Risk.</span><span>”</span></div> <div><span>Custody Risk.</span><span> Custody risk refers to the risks inherent in the process of clearing and settling trades, as well as the holding of securities by </span><span>local banks, agents and depositories. Low trading volumes and volatile prices in less developed markets may make trades harder to complete </span><span>and settle, and governments or trade groups may compel local agents to hold securities in designated depositories that may not be subject </span><span>to independent evaluation. Local agents are held only to the standards of care of their local markets. In general, the less developed a </span><span>country’s securities markets are, the higher the degree of custody risk.</span></div> <div><span>Dividend-Paying Stock Risk.</span><span> Investing in dividend-paying stocks involves the risk that such stocks may fall out of favor with investors and </span><span>underperform the broader market. Companies that issue dividend-paying stocks are not required to pay or continue paying dividends on such </span><span>stocks. It is possible that issuers of the stocks held by a Fund or an Underlying Fund will not declare dividends in the future or will reduce or </span><span>eliminate the payment of dividends (including reducing or eliminating anticipated accelerations or increases in the payment of dividends) in </span><span>the future.</span></div> <div><span>Emerging Markets Exposure Risk.</span><span> Investments in companies that derive revenues from emerging markets are subject to a greater risk of </span><span>loss than investments in companies that derive revenues from more developed markets. This is due to, among other things, the potential for </span><span>greater economic volatility, inflation, political and economic instability and more governmental limitations on foreign investments than </span><span>typically found in more developed markets. Certain emerging market countries may also lack the infrastructure necessary to attract large </span><span>amounts of foreign trade and investment. Because a Fund principally invests in companies in developed markets that derive a relatively high </span><span>proportion of their revenues from emerging markets, and does not invest directly in emerging markets, a Fund may not perform well even </span><span>during times that emerging markets securities are performing well. Local securities markets in emerging market countries may trade a small </span><span>number of securities and may be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of </span><span>holdings difficult or impossible at times. Settlement procedures in emerging market countries are frequently less developed and reliable than </span><span>those in the U.S. (and other developed countries). In addition, significant delays may occur in certain markets in registering the transfer of </span><span>securities. Settlement or registration problems may make it more difficult for a Fund to value its portfolio securities and could cause a Fund </span><span>to miss attractive investment opportunities.</span><span> </span> <br/><span>Investing in emerging market countries involves a higher risk of loss due to expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property </span><span>or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and on repatriation of capital invested by certain emerging market countries.</span></div> <div><span>Illiquid Investments Risk. </span><span>A Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, immediately after the acquisition, a Fund would have invested </span><span>more than 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that a Fund reasonably expects cannot be </span><span>sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the </span><span>investment. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by a Fund, particularly during periods of market turmoil. There can be no </span><span>assurance that a security or instrument that is deemed to be liquid when purchased will continue to be liquid for as long as it is held by a </span><span>Fund, and any security or instrument held by a Fund may be deemed an illiquid investment pursuant to a Fund’s liquidity risk management </span><span>program. To the extent a Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid investments may reduce the returns of a Fund because a Fund may be </span><span>unable to transact at advantageous times or prices. An investment may be illiquid due to, among other things, the reduced number and </span><span>capacity of traditional market participants to make a market in securities or instruments, the lack of an active market for such securities or </span><span>instruments, capital controls, delays or limits on repatriation of local currency, or insolvency of local governments. To the extent that a Fund </span><span>invests in securities or instruments with substantial market and/or credit risk, a Fund will tend to have increased exposure to the risks </span><span>associated with illiquid investments. Illiquid investments may be harder to value, especially in changing markets. Although each Fund </span><span>primarily seeks to redeem shares of a Fund on an in-kind basis, if a Fund is forced to sell underlying investments at reduced prices or under </span><span>unfavorable conditions to meet redemption requests or for other cash needs, a Fund may suffer a loss. This may be magnified in a rising </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>17</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>interest rate environment or other circumstances where redemptions from a Fund may be greater than normal. Other market participants </span><span>may be attempting to liquidate holdings at the same time as a Fund, causing increased supply of a Fund’s underlying investments in the </span><span>market and contributing to illiquid investments risk and downward pricing pressure. In addition, if a Fund is limited in its ability to sell illiquid </span><span>investments during periods when shareholders are redeeming their shares, a Fund will need to sell liquid securities to meet redemption </span><span>requests and illiquid securities will become a larger portion of a Fund’s holdings. During periods of market volatility, liquidity in the market for </span><span>a Fund’s shares may be impacted by the liquidity in the market for the underlying securities or instruments held by a Fund, which could lead </span><span>to a Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Industrials Sector Risk.</span><span> The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by supply and </span><span>demand changes related to their specific products or services and industrials sector products in general. The products of manufacturing </span><span>companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction. Global events, trade </span><span>disputes and changes in government regulations, economic conditions and exchange rates may adversely affect the performance of </span><span>companies in the industrials sector. Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage and </span><span>product liability claims. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be </span><span>influenced by unpredictable factors. Companies in the industrials sector, particularly aerospace and defense companies, may also be </span><span>adversely affected by government spending policies because companies in this sector tend to rely to a significant extent on government </span><span>demand for their products and services.</span></div> <div><span>Large Shareholder and Large-Scale Redemption Risk.</span><span> Certain shareholders, including an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, </span><span>the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, a market maker, or another entity, may from time to time own or manage a substantial </span><span>amount of Fund shares or may invest in the Fund and hold their investment for a limited period of time. These shareholders may also pledge </span><span>or loan Fund shares (to secure financing or otherwise), which may result in the shares becoming concentrated in another party. There can be </span><span>no assurance that any large shareholder or large group of shareholders would not redeem their investment or that the size of the Fund would </span><span>be maintained. Redemptions of a large number of Fund shares by these shareholders may adversely affect the Fund’s liquidity and net </span><span>assets. To the extent the Fund permits redemptions in cash, these redemptions may force the Fund to sell portfolio securities when it might </span><span>not otherwise do so, which may negatively impact the Fund’s NAV, have a material effect on the market price of the Shares and increase the </span><span>Fund’s brokerage costs and/or accelerate the realization of taxable income and/or gains and cause the Fund to make taxable distributions </span><span>to its shareholders earlier than the Fund otherwise would have. In addition, under certain circumstances, non-redeeming shareholders may </span><span>be treated as receiving a disproportionately large taxable distribution during or with respect to such tax year. The Fund also may be required </span><span>to sell its more liquid Fund investments to meet a large redemption, in which case the Fund’s remaining assets may be less liquid, more </span><span>volatile, and more difficult to price. To the extent these large shareholders transact in shares on the secondary market, such transactions </span><span>may account for a large percentage of the trading volume for the shares of the Fund and may, therefore, have a material upward or </span><span>downward effect on the market price of the Fund shares. In addition, large purchases of Fund shares may adversely affect the Fund’s </span><span>performance to the extent that the Fund is delayed in investing new cash and is required to maintain a larger cash position than it ordinarily </span><span>would, diluting its investment returns.</span></div> <div><span>North American Economic Risk</span><span>. A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations or an economic recession in any North </span><span>American country can have a significant economic effect on the entire North American region and on some or all of the North American </span><span>countries in which a Fund</span><span> </span><span>or an Underlying Fund invests.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The U.S. is Canada's and Mexico's largest trading and investment partner. The Canadian and Mexican economies are significantly affected by </span><span>developments in the U.S. economy. Since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (</span><span>“</span><span>NAFTA</span><span>”</span><span>) in 1994 among </span><span>Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, total merchandise trade among the three countries has increased. However, political developments including </span><span>the implementation of tariffs by the U.S. and the renegotiation of NAFTA in the form of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>USMCA</span><span>”</span><span>), which replaced NAFTA on July 1, 2020, could negatively affect North America’s economic outlook and, as a result, the value of </span><span>securities held by a Fund</span><span> </span><span>or an Underlying Fund. Policy and legislative changes in one country may have a significant effect on North </span><span>American markets generally, as well as on the value of certain securities held by a Fund</span><span> </span><span>or an Underlying Fund.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Privatization Risk. </span><span>Some countries in which the Underlying Funds have exposure have privatized, or have begun the process of privatizing, </span><span>certain entities and industries. Newly privatized companies may face strong competition from government-sponsored competitors that have </span><span>not been privatized. In some instances, investors in newly privatized entities have suffered losses due to the inability of the newly privatized </span><span>entities to adjust quickly to a competitive environment or changing regulatory and legal standards or, in some cases, due to re-nationalization </span><span>of such privatized entities. There is no assurance that similar losses will not recur.</span></div> <div><span>Privately Issued Securities Risk. </span><span>A Fund or an Underlying Fund may invest in privately issued securities, including those that are normally </span><span>purchased pursuant to Rule 144A or Regulation S under the 1933 Act. Privately issued securities typically may be resold only to qualified </span><span>institutional buyers, or in a privately negotiated transaction, or to a limited number of purchasers, or in limited quantities after they have been </span><span>held for a specified period of time and other conditions are met for an exemption from registration. Because there may be relatively few </span><span>potential purchasers for such securities, especially under adverse market or economic conditions or in the event of adverse changes in the </span><span>financial condition of the issuer, a Fund and an Underlying Fund may find it more difficult to sell such securities when it may be advisable to </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>18</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>do so or it may be able to sell such securities only at prices lower than if such securities were more widely held and traded. At times, it also </span><span>may be more difficult to determine the fair value of such securities for purposes of computing a Fund’s</span><span> </span><span>or an Underlying Fund's NAV due to </span><span>the absence of an active trading market. There can be no assurance that a privately issued security that is deemed to be liquid when </span><span>purchased will continue to be liquid for as long as it is held by a Fund</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund, and its value may decline as a result.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in China.</span><span> Investments in Chinese securities, including certain Hong Kong-listed and U.S.-listed securities, subject certain </span><span>Underlying Funds to risks specific to China. The Chinese economy is subject to a considerable degree of economic, political and social </span><span>instability.</span></div> <div><span>Political and Social Risk.</span><span> The Chinese government is authoritarian and has periodically used force to suppress civil dissent. Disparities of </span><span>wealth and the pace of economic liberalization may lead to social turmoil, violence and labor unrest. In addition, China continues to </span><span>experience disagreements related to integration with Hong Kong and religious and nationalist disputes in Tibet and Xinjiang. There is also a </span><span>greater risk in China than in many other countries of currency fluctuations, currency non-convertibility, interest rate fluctuations and higher </span><span>rates of inflation as a result of internal social unrest or conflicts with other countries. Unanticipated political or social developments may </span><span>result in sudden and significant investment losses. China's growing income inequality, rapidly aging population and significant environmental </span><span>issues also are factors that may affect the Chinese economy.</span></div> <div><span>Government Control and Regulations.</span><span> The Chinese government has implemented significant economic reforms in order to liberalize trade </span><span>policy, promote foreign investment in the economy, reduce government control of the economy and develop market mechanisms. There can </span><span>be no assurance that these reforms will continue or that they will be effective. Despite recent reform and privatizations, government control </span><span>over certain sectors or enterprises and significant regulation of investment and industry is still pervasive, including restrictions on investment </span><span>in companies or industries deemed to be sensitive to particular national interests, trading of securities of Chinese issuers, foreign ownership </span><span>of Chinese corporations and/or the repatriation of assets by foreign investors. Limitations or restrictions on foreign ownership of securities </span><span>may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of an Underlying Fund and could lead to higher tracking error. Chinese </span><span>government intervention in the market may have a negative impact on market sentiment, which may in turn affect the performance of the </span><span>Chinese economy and the Fund’s investments. Chinese markets generally continue to experience inefficiency, volatility and pricing </span><span>anomalies that may be connected to governmental influence, lack of publicly available information, and political and social instability. </span><span>Chinese companies, such as those in the financial services or technology sectors, and potentially other sectors are also subject to the risk </span><span>that Chinese authorities can intervene in their operations and structure, which may negatively affect the value of a Fund's </span><span> </span><span>or an Underlying </span><span>Fund's investments.</span></div> <div><span>Economic Risk.</span><span> The Chinese economy has grown rapidly in the recent past, and there is no assurance that this growth rate will be maintained. </span><span>In fact, the Chinese economy may experience a significant slowdown as a result of, among other things, a deterioration in global demand for </span><span>Chinese exports, as well as a contraction in spending on domestic goods by Chinese consumers. In addition, China may experience </span><span>substantial rates of inflation or economic recessions, which would have a negative effect on its economy and securities market. Delays in </span><span>enterprise restructuring, slow development of well-functioning financial markets and widespread corruption have also hindered the </span><span>performance of the Chinese economy. China continues to receive substantial pressure from trading partners to liberalize official currency </span><span>exchange rates. Reduction in spending on Chinese products and services, institution of additional tariffs or other trade barriers (including as </span><span>a result of heightened trade tensions between China and the U.S. or in response to actual or alleged Chinese cyber activity) or a downturn in </span><span>any of the economies of China’s key trading partners may have an adverse impact on the Chinese economy and the Chinese issuers of </span><span>securities in which the Fund invests. For example, the U.S. has added certain foreign technology companies to the U.S. Department of </span><span>Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security’s </span><span>“</span><span>Entity List,</span><span>”</span><span> which is a list of companies believed to pose a national security risk to the U.S. </span><span>Actions like these may have unanticipated and disruptive effects on the Chinese economy. Any such response that targets Chinese financial </span><span>markets or securities exchanges could interfere with orderly trading, delay settlement or cause market disruptions.</span></div> <div><span>Expropriation Risk.</span><span> The Chinese government maintains a major role in economic policymaking, and investing in China involves risk of loss due </span><span>to expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and on </span><span>repatriation of capital invested.</span><span> </span> <br/><span>Security Risk.  </span><span>China has strained international relations with Taiwan, Japan, India, Russia and other neighbors due to territorial disputes, </span><span>historical animosities, defense concerns and other security concerns. Heightened tensions or an outbreak of hostilities between China and </span><span>Taiwan may adversely impact China's economy as well as the global economy and the value of the Funds' or the Underlying Funds' </span><span>investments. Additionally, China is alleged to have participated in state-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign companies and foreign </span><span>governments. Actual and threatened responses to such activity and strained international relations, including purchasing restrictions, </span><span>sanctions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Chinese government or Chinese companies, may impact China’s economy and Chinese issuers of </span><span>securities in which a Fund invests. Relations between China's Han ethnic majority and other ethnic groups in China, including Tibetans and </span><span>Uighurs, are also strained and have been marked by protests and violence. These situations may cause uncertainty in the Chinese market </span><span>and may adversely affect the Chinese economy. In addition, conflict on the Korean Peninsula could adversely affect the Chinese economy. </span><span>Such risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of a Fund’s investments.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>19</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>Chinese Equity Markets. </span><span>The issuance of B-shares and H-shares by Chinese companies and the ability to obtain a </span><span>“</span><span>back-door listing</span><span>”</span><span> through </span><span>Red-Chips or P-Chips is still regarded by the Chinese authorities as an experiment in economic reform. </span><span>“</span><span>Back-door listing</span><span>”</span><span> is a means by </span><span>which a mainland Chinese company issues Red-Chips or P-Chips to obtain quick access to international listing and international capital. </span><span>These share mechanisms are  subject to the political and economic policies in China. The iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF may also </span><span>invest in Chinese companies structured as variable interest entities (</span><span>“</span><span>VIEs</span><span>”</span><span>), which are subject to the investment risks of an associated </span><span>China-based operating company. Instead of directly owning the equity securities of a Chinese company, a VIE enters into service contracts </span><span>and other contracts with the Chinese company, which provide the VIE with exposure to the company. Intervention by the Chinese </span><span>government with respect to VIEs could significantly affect the Chinese operating company's performance and the enforceability of the VIE's </span><span>contractual arrangements with the Chinese company.</span> <br/><span>Hong Kong Political Risk.</span><span> Hong Kong reverted to Chinese sovereignty on July 1, 1997 as a Special Administrative Region of the People's </span><span>Republic of China (</span><span>“</span><span>PRC</span><span>”</span><span>) under the principle of </span><span>“</span><span>one country, two systems.</span><span>”</span><span> Although China is obligated to maintain the current capitalist </span><span>economic and social system of Hong Kong through June 30, 2047, the continuation of economic and social freedoms enjoyed in Hong Kong </span><span>is dependent on the government of China. Since 1997, there have been tensions between the Chinese government and many people in Hong </span><span>Kong who perceive China as tightening control over Hong Kong’s semi-autonomous liberal political, economic, legal and social framework. </span><span>Recent protests and unrest have increased tensions even further.  Due to the interconnected nature of the Hong Kong and Chinese </span><span>economies, this instability in Hong Kong may cause uncertainty in the Hong Kong and Chinese markets. In addition, the Hong Kong dollar </span><span>trades at a fixed exchange rate in relation to (or is </span><span>“</span><span>pegged</span><span>”</span><span> to) the U.S. dollar, which has contributed to the growth and stability of the Hong </span><span>Kong economy. However, it is uncertain how long the currency peg will continue or what effect the establishment of an alternative exchange </span><span>rate system would have on the Hong Kong economy. Because the Fund's NAV is denominated in U.S. dollars, the establishment of an </span><span>alternative exchange rate system could result in a decline in the Fund's NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Limited Information and Legal Remedies</span><span>. Chinese companies, including Chinese companies that are listed on U.S. exchanges, are not subject </span><span>to the same degree of regulatory requirements, accounting standards or auditor oversight as companies in more developed countries. As a </span><span>result, information about the Chinese securities in which the Funds</span><span> </span><span>or the Underlying Funds invest may be less reliable or complete. Chinese </span><span>companies with securities listed on U.S. exchanges may be delisted if they do not meet U.S. accounting standards and auditor oversight </span><span>requirements, which would significantly decrease the liquidity and value of the securities. There may be significant obstacles to obtaining </span><span>information necessary for investigations into or litigation against Chinese companies, and shareholders may have limited legal remedies. The </span><span>Funds are not actively managed and do not select investments based on investor protection considerations.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the China Bond Market.</span><span> An Underlying Funds invest directly in the China Interbank Bond Market through the </span><span>northbound trading of Bond Connect. Bond Connect allows investors to trade between the mainland China and Hong Kong markets </span><span>electronically, which eliminates the need for investor status and quotas that were required under previous access models. Under the </span><span>prevailing regulations in the PRC, eligible foreign investors such as the Underlying Fund are allowed to invest in the bonds circulated in the </span><span>China Interbank Bond Market through Bond Connect. The settlement and custody of bonds traded in the China Interbank Bond Market under </span><span>Bond Connect will be effected through the settlement and custody link between CMU, as an offshore custody agent, and CCDC and SCH, as </span><span>onshore custodians and clearing institutions in the PRC. All bonds traded by eligible foreign investors through Bond Connect will be </span><span>registered in the name of CMU, which will hold such bonds as a nominee owner. Therefore, the Underlying Funds will be exposed to custody </span><span>risks with respect to CMU. In addition, as the relevant filings, registration with the People’s Bank of China, and account opening have to be </span><span>carried out by third parties, including CMU, CCDC, and SCH, the Funds are subject to the risks of default or errors and omissions on the part </span><span>of such third parties and may have limited remedies or no legal recourse at all to cure such defaults, errors and omissions.</span></div> <div><span>The precise nature and rights of a Underlying Fund as the beneficial owner of the bonds traded in the China Interbank Bond Market through </span><span>CMU as nominee are relatively new and untested areas of PRC law. The definition of, and distinction between, legal ownership and beneficial </span><span>ownership under PRC law differs from that in the U.S. and other developed market jurisdictions, there have been few cases involving a </span><span>nominee account structure in the PRC courts and, as a result, the rights of beneficial owners are uncertain. The exact nature of the </span><span>Underlying Fund's remedies and methods of the rights and interests of the Underlying Funds under PRC law are also uncertain.</span></div> <div><span>Market volatility and potential lack of liquidity due to low trading volume of certain bonds in the China Interbank Bond Market may result in </span><span>prices of certain bonds traded on such market to fluctuate significantly. The Underlying Funds investing in the China Interbank Bond Market </span><span>are therefore subject to liquidity and volatility risks. The bid-ask spreads of the prices of such securities may be large, and the Underlying </span><span>Funds may therefore incur significant costs and may suffer losses when selling such investments. The bonds traded in the China Interbank </span><span>Bond Market may be difficult or impossible to sell on a timely basis or at all, which may impact the Underlying Fund's ability to acquire or </span><span>dispose of such securities at their expected prices.</span></div> <div><span>Investing in the China Interbank Bond Market through Bond Connect is also subject to regulatory risks. The relevant rules and regulations are </span><span>subject to change, which may have potential retrospective effect, and there can be no assurance that Bond Connect or certain features or </span><span>systems thereof will not be materially altered, suspended, discontinued or abolished. Furthermore, the securities regulation regimes and </span><span>legal systems of the PRC and Hong Kong differ significantly and issues may arise based on these differences. In the event that the relevant </span><span>authorities suspend account opening or trading on the China Interbank Bond Market, the Fund's ability to invest in the China Interbank Bond </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>20</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>Market will be adversely affected, limited, or curtailed altogether. In such event, the Fund's ability to achieve its investment objective will be </span><span>negatively affected and, after exhausting other trading alternatives, the Fund may suffer substantial losses as a result. Further, if Bond </span><span>Connect is not operating, a Fund may not be able to acquire or dispose of bonds through Bond Connect in a timely manner, which could </span><span>adversely affect the Fund's performance.</span></div> <div><span>Trading through Bond Connect is performed through newly developed trading platforms and operational systems. There is no assurance that </span><span>such systems will function as expected or will continue to be adapted to changes and developments in the market. In the event that a </span><span>relevant system does not function as expected, trading through Bond Connect may be disrupted. The Fund's ability to trade through Bond </span><span>Connect (and hence to pursue its investment strategy) may therefore be adversely affected. In addition, where a Fund invests in the China </span><span>Interbank Bond Market through Bond Connect, it may be subject to risks of delays inherent in the order placing and/or settlement systems.</span></div> <div><span>Bond Connect trades are settled in Chinese currency, the renminbi (</span><span>“</span><span>RMB</span><span>”</span><span>). This means that a Fund will be exposed to currency risk, and it </span><span>cannot be guaranteed that investors will have timely access to a reliable supply of RMB. The RMB consists of an onshore RMB (</span><span>“</span><span>CNY</span><span>”</span><span>) and </span><span>an offshore RMB (</span><span>“</span><span>CNH</span><span>”</span><span>). The CNY is the official currency of the PRC and is the currency of denomination for all financial transactions </span><span>between individuals, the state and corporations in the PRC. Hong Kong is the first jurisdiction to allow for the accumulation of RMB deposits </span><span>in the form of CNH outside the PRC. Since 2010, the CNH market is traded officially and regulated jointly by the Hong Kong Monetary </span><span>Authority and the PBOC. While CNY and CNH are the same currency, they are traded in different and separate markets. Therefore, CNY and </span><span>CNH can be subject to different liquidity constraints and market forces, meaning their valuations can vary. The RMB-denominated bonds </span><span>included in the Underlying Index use CNY as the base currency. As a result, to the extent that a Fund holds RMB-denominated instruments in </span><span>CNH, it could be subject to tracking error and potential foreign exchange transaction costs associated with converting from CNH to CNY (and </span><span>vice versa).</span></div> <div><span>Under prevailing tax regulations, a 10% withholding tax is imposed on PRC-sourced dividends and interest from non-government bonds paid </span><span>to the Funds unless the rate is reduced under an applicable tax treaty. Value Added Tax (</span><span>“</span><span>VAT</span><span>”</span><span>) is levied on certain income derived by the </span><span>Funds, including interest income from non-government bonds and trading gains, unless specifically exempted by the PRC tax authorities. VAT </span><span>exemptions currently apply to debt securities traded in the China Interbank Bond Market. On November 22, 2018, the PRC’s Ministry of </span><span>Finance and State Administration of Taxation jointly issued Circular 108 providing foreign institutional investors with a temporary exemption </span><span>from withholding income tax and VAT with respect to interest income derived from non-government bonds in the domestic bond market for </span><span>the period from November 7, 2018 to November 6, 2021. On November 26, 2021, the PRC's Ministry of Finance and State Administration of </span><span>Taxation jointly issued Circular 34 to extend the tax exemption period provided in Circular 108 to December 31, 2025. Circular 108 is silent </span><span>on the PRC tax treatment with respect to non-government bond interest derived prior to November 7, 2018. There is a risk the PRC tax </span><span>authorities may withdraw the temporary tax exemptions in the future and seek to collect withholding income tax and VAT on interest income </span><span>from non-government bonds to the Funds without prior notice. If the tax exemptions are withdrawn, any taxes arising from or to the Funds </span><span>may be directly borne by or indirectly passed on to the Funds, which may result in a substantial impact to its NAV. As with any NAV </span><span>adjustment, investors may be advantaged or disadvantaged depending on when the investors purchased or sold shares of the Funds. Any </span><span>changes in PRC tax law, future clarifications thereof, and/or subsequent retroactive enforcement by the PRC tax authorities may result in a </span><span>loss which could be material to the Fund. BFA will keep the provisioning policy for tax liability under review and may, in its discretion from </span><span>time to time, make a provision for potential tax liabilities if in its opinion such provision is warranted or as further publicly clarified by the </span><span>PRC.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets.</span><span> Investments in emerging market issuers are subject to a greater risk of loss than investments in </span><span>issuers located or operating in more developed markets. This is due to, among other things, the potential for greater market volatility, </span><span>currency devaluations, lower trading volume, higher levels of inflation, political and economic instability, greater risk of a market shutdown </span><span>and more governmental limitations on foreign investments in emerging market countries than are typically found in more developed markets. </span><span> </span><span>Certain emerging markets countries have experienced economic recessions causing a negative effect on the economies and securities </span><span>markets of such emerging countries. Companies in many emerging markets are not subject to the same degree of regulatory requirements, </span><span>accounting standards or auditor oversight as companies in more developed countries, and as a result, information about the securities in </span><span>which the Funds invest may be less reliable or complete. Moreover, emerging markets often have less reliable securities valuations and </span><span>greater risks associated with custody of securities than developed markets. There may be significant obstacles to obtaining information </span><span>necessary for investigations into or litigation against companies and shareholders may have limited legal remedies. The Funds are not </span><span>actively managed and do not select investments based on investor protection considerations.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, emerging markets often have greater risk of capital controls through such measures as taxes or interest rate control than </span><span>developed markets. Certain emerging market countries may also lack the infrastructure necessary to attract large amounts of foreign trade </span><span>and investment. Local securities markets in emerging market countries may trade a small number of securities and may be unable to </span><span>respond effectively to changes in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. </span><span>Settlement procedures in emerging market countries are frequently less developed and reliable than those in the U.S. (and other developed </span><span>countries). In addition, significant delays may occur in certain markets in registering the transfer of securities. Settlement or registration </span><span>problems may make it more difficult for an Underlying Fund to value its portfolio securities and could cause an Underlying Fund to miss </span><span>attractive investment opportunities. </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>21</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>Investing in emerging market countries involves a higher risk of loss due to expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property </span><span>or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and on repatriation of capital invested in certain emerging market countries.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in India.</span><span> India is an emerging market country and exhibits significantly greater market volatility from time to time in </span><span>comparison to more developed markets. Political and legal uncertainty, greater government control over the economy, currency fluctuations </span><span>or blockage, and the risk of nationalization or expropriation of assets may result in higher potential for losses.</span></div> <div><span>Moreover, governmental actions can have a significant effect on the economic conditions in India, which could adversely affect the value and </span><span>liquidity of an Underlying Fund's investments. In November 2016, the Indian government eliminated certain large denomination cash notes as </span><span>legal tender, causing uncertainty in certain financial markets. The securities markets in India are comparatively underdeveloped, and </span><span>stockbrokers and other intermediaries may not perform as well as their counterparts in the U.S. and other more developed securities </span><span>markets. The limited liquidity of the Indian securities markets may also affect an Underlying Fund’s ability to acquire or dispose of securities </span><span>at the price and time that it desires.</span></div> <div><span>Global factors and foreign actions may inhibit the flow of foreign capital on which India is dependent to sustain its growth. In addition, the </span><span>Reserve Bank of India (</span><span>“</span><span>RBI</span><span>”</span><span>) has imposed limits on foreign ownership of Indian securities, which may decrease the liquidity of an Underlying </span><span>Fund’s portfolio and result in extreme volatility in the prices of Indian securities. These factors, coupled with the lack of extensive accounting, </span><span>auditing and financial reporting standards and practices, as compared to the U.S., may increase an Underlying Fund's risk of loss.</span></div> <div><span>Further, certain Indian regulatory approvals, including approvals from the SEBI, the RBI, the central government and the tax authorities (to </span><span>the extent that tax benefits need to be utilized), may be required before an Underlying Fund can make investments in the securities of Indian </span><span>companies. Capital gains from Indian securities may be subject to local taxation.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Japan.</span><span> Japan may be subject to political, economic, nuclear, and labor risks, among others. Any of these risks, </span><span>individually or in the aggregate, can impact an investment made in Japan.</span></div> <div><span>Currency Risk</span><span>. The Japanese yen has fluctuated widely at times, and any increase in its value may cause a decline in exports that could </span><span>weaken the Japanese economy. The Japanese government has, in the past, intervened in the currency markets to attempt to maintain or </span><span>reduce the value of the yen. Japanese intervention in the currency markets could cause the value of the yen to fluctuate sharply and </span><span>unpredictably and could cause losses to investors.</span></div> <div><span>Economic Risk</span><span>. The growth of Japan's economy has recently lagged that of its Asian neighbors and other major developed economies. Since </span><span>2000, Japan’s economic growth rate has generally remained low relative to other advanced economies, and it may remain low in the future. </span><span>The Japanese economy is heavily dependent on international trade and has been adversely affected in the past by trade tariffs, other </span><span>protectionist measures, competition from emerging economies and the economic conditions of its trading partners. Japan is also heavily </span><span>dependent on oil and other commodity imports, and higher commodity prices could therefore have a negative impact on the Japanese </span><span>economy.</span></div> <div><span>Geographic Risk. </span><span>Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, typhoons and tsunamis, could occur in Japan or surrounding </span><span>areas and could negatively affect the Japanese economy, and, in turn, could negatively affect the value of an Underlying Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Labor Risk</span><span>. Japan has an aging workforce and has experienced a significant population decline in recent years. Japan’s labor market appears </span><span>to be undergoing fundamental structural changes, as a labor market traditionally accustomed to lifetime employment adjusts to meet the </span><span>need for increased labor mobility, which may adversely affect Japan’s economic competitiveness.</span></div> <div><span>Large Government and Corporate Debt Risk</span><span>. The Japanese economy faces several concerns, including a financial system with large levels of </span><span>nonperforming loans, over-leveraged corporate balance sheets, extensive cross-ownership by major corporations, a changing corporate </span><span>governance structure, and large government deficits. These issues may cause a slowdown of the Japanese economy.</span></div> <div><span>Political Risk</span><span>. Historically, Japan has had unpredictable national politics and may experience frequent political turnover. Future political </span><span>developments may lead to changes in policy that might adversely affect an Underlying Fund’s investments. In addition, China has become an </span><span>important trading partner with Japan. Japan's political relationship with China, however, is strained and delicate. Should political tension </span><span>increase, it could adversely affect the Japanese economy and destabilize the region as a whole.</span><span> </span> <br/><span>Security Risk.</span><span>  Japan's relations with its neighbors, particularly China, North Korea, South Korea and Russia, have at times been strained due </span><span>to territorial disputes, historical animosities and defense concerns. Most recently, the Japanese government has shown concern over the </span><span>increased nuclear and military activity by North Korea and China. Strained relations may cause uncertainty in the Japanese markets and </span><span>adversely affect the overall Japanese economy, particularly in times of crisis.</span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>22</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>Small-Capitalization Companies Risk. </span><span>Stock prices of small-capitalization companies may be more volatile than those of larger companies </span><span>and, therefore, the share price of an Underlying Fund that invests mostly in small-capitalization companies may be more volatile than those </span><span>of funds that invest a larger percentage of their assets in stocks issued by mid- or large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of small-capitalization</span><span> companies are generally more vulnerable than those of mid- or large-capitalization companies to adverse business and </span><span>economic developments. Securities of small-capitalization companies may be thinly traded, making it difficult for the Underlying Funds to buy </span><span>and sell them. In addition, small-capitalization companies are typically less financially stable than larger, more established companies and </span><span>may depend on a small number of essential personnel, making these companies more vulnerable to experiencing adverse effects due to the </span><span>loss of personnel. Small-capitalization companies also normally have less diverse product lines than those of mid- or large-capitalization </span><span>companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments concerning their products.</span></div> <div><span>Sovereign and Quasi-Sovereign Obligations Risk.</span><span> An investment in sovereign or quasi-sovereign debt obligations involves special risks </span><span>not present in corporate debt obligations. Sovereign debt includes securities issued by or guaranteed by a foreign sovereign government, and </span><span>quasi-sovereign debt includes securities issued by or guaranteed by an entity affiliated with or backed by a sovereign government. The issuer </span><span>of the sovereign debt that controls the repayment of the debt may be unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due, and the </span><span>Funds</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Funds may have limited recourse in the event of a default. Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial condition or </span><span>credit rating of a government may cause the value of a sovereign debt obligation, including U.S. Treasury obligations, to decline. During </span><span>periods of economic uncertainty, the market prices of sovereign debt may be more volatile than prices of U.S. debt obligations and may </span><span>affect an Underlying Fund's</span><span> </span><span>or Underlying Fund's NAV. Quasi-sovereign debt obligations are typically less liquid and less standardized than </span><span>sovereign debt obligations. Several countries in which an Underlying Fund invests have defaulted on their sovereign debt obligations in the </span><span>past or encountered downgrades of their sovereign debt obligations, and those countries (or other countries) may default or risk further </span><span>downgrades in the future.</span></div> <div><span>Technology Sector Risk.</span><span> Technology companies, including information technology companies,</span><span> </span><span>face intense competition, both domestically </span><span>and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on a company’s profit margins. Technology companies may have limited product lines, </span><span>markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of technology companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological </span><span>developments, frequent new product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified </span><span>personnel. Companies in the technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and other intellectual property rights. A technology </span><span>company’s loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the company’s profitability. Companies in the technology sector are facing </span><span>increased government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or regulatory action. The technology sector may </span><span>also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced or characterized by unpredictable factors.</span></div> <div><span>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.</span><span> If certain aggregate and/or fund-level ownership thresholds are reached through transactions </span><span>undertaken by BFA, its affiliates or an Underlying Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions or actions by an issuer or regulator, the </span><span>ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including an Underlying Fund) to purchase or dispose of investments, or exercise rights or </span><span>undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired.  The capacity of an Underlying Fund to make </span><span>investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant threshold limits, and such limitations may have adverse effects on the </span><span>liquidity and performance of an Underlying Fund’s portfolio holdings</span><span> </span><span>compared to the performance of such a fund's underlying index. This </span><span>may increase the risk of an Underlying Fund being underinvested to the Underlying Index and increase the risk of tracking error.</span></div> <div><span>For example, in certain circumstances where an Underlying Fund invests in securities issued by companies that operate in certain regulated </span><span>industries or in certain emerging or international markets, is subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or invests in certain </span><span>futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits on the aggregate and/or fund-level  amount invested or voted by BFA and its </span><span>affiliates for their proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including an Underlying Fund) that may not be exceeded without the grant of </span><span>a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if exceeded, may cause BFA and its affiliates, an Underlying Fund or other client </span><span>accounts to suffer disadvantages or business restrictions.</span></div> <div><span>U.S. Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities Risk. </span><span>Securities backed by pools of mortgages issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or </span><span>one of its agencies or sponsored entities, including Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae or Freddie Mac. While securities guaranteed by Ginnie Mae are </span><span>backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not backed by the full faith </span><span>and credit of the U.S. government, and there can be no assurance that the U.S. government would provide financial support to its agencies or </span><span>sponsored entities where it is not obligated to do so. Bonds or debentures that do not carry the backing of the full faith and credit of the U.S. </span><span>government are subject to more credit risk than securities that are supported by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. To the </span><span>extent that the U.S. government has provided support to a U.S. agency or sponsored entity in the past, there can be no assurance that the </span><span>U.S. government will provide support in the future if it is not obligated to do so. If a U.S. government agency or sponsored entity that is the </span><span>issuer of securities in which an Underlying Fund invests is unable to meet its obligations or ceases to exist and no plan is made for repayment </span><span>of securities, the performance of an Underlying Fund will be adversely affected.</span></div> <div><span>MBS represent interests in </span><span>“</span><span>pools</span><span>”</span><span> of mortgages and, due to the nature of these loans they represent, are subject to prepayment and </span><span>extension risk. Prepayment risk is the risk that, during periods of falling interest rates, an issuer of mortgages and other fixed-income </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>23</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>securities may be able to repay principal prior to the security’s maturity. This may cause an Underlying Fund to have to reinvest in securities </span><span>with a lower yield or higher risk of default, resulting in a decline in an Underlying Fund's income or return potential.</span></div> <div><span>MBS are also subject to extension risk, which is the risk that when interest rates rise, certain MBS will be paid off substantially more slowly </span><span>than originally anticipated and the value of those securities may fall sharply, resulting in a decline in income and potentially in the value of the </span><span>investment.</span></div> <div><span>Because of prepayment and extension risks, MBS react differently to changes in interest rates than other bonds. Small movements in </span><span>interest rates (both increases and decreases) may quickly and significantly reduce the value of certain MBS. These securities are also subject </span><span>to the risk of default on the underlying mortgage loans, particularly during periods of economic downturn.</span></div> <div><span>Certain Underlying Funds seek to obtain exposure to the fixed-rate portion of U.S. agency mortgage pass-through securities primarily </span><span>through TBA securities, or TBA transactions. TBAs refer to a commonly used mechanism for the forward settlement of U.S. agency MBS, and </span><span>not to a separate type of MBS. Default or bankruptcy of a counterparty to a TBA transaction would expose a Fund, through its investments in </span><span>such an Underlying Fund,</span><span> </span><span>to possible losses because of adverse market action, expenses or delays in connection with the purchase or sale of </span><span>the pools of mortgage pass-through securities specified in the TBA transaction.</span></div> <div><span>Certain Underlying Funds intend to invest cash pending settlement of TBA transactions in money market instruments, repurchase </span><span>agreements, or other high quality, liquid short-term instruments, including money market funds advised by BFA. Such Underlying Funds will </span><span>pay their </span><span>pro rata</span><span> share of fees and expenses of any money market fund that it may invest in, in addition to the Underlying Fund’s own fees </span><span>and expenses.</span></div> <div><span>Portfolio Holdings Information</span></div> <div><span>A description of the Trust's policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of each Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Funds' </span><span>combined SAI. Each Fund discloses its portfolio holdings daily at </span><span>www.iShares.com.</span><span> Fund fact sheets provide information regarding each </span><span>Fund's top holdings and may be requested by calling 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737).</span></div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Principal Investment Strategies</span></div> <div><span>Overview</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund allocates and reallocates its assets among the Underlying Funds consistent with the allocation and reallocation of securities in the </span><span>Underlying Indexes as determined by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. In addition to investing in the Underlying Funds, each Fund may borrow, lend </span><span>its portfolio securities to brokers, dealers and financial institutions, and may invest the collateral in certain short-term instruments, either </span><span>directly or through one or more money market funds, as described in greater detail in the Funds' SAI.</span></div> <div><span>Certain Underlying Funds may invest in non-U.S. securities, emerging markets securities and debt instruments, which are subject to </span><span>additional risks, as described in this Prospectus and in the Funds' SAI.

This team approach </span><span>brings together many disciplines and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</span></div> <div><span>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and the Trust (entered into on behalf of the Funds), BFA is responsible for </span><span>substantially all expenses of the Funds, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the </span><span>acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution </span><span>fees or expenses, and litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of the Trustees who are not </span><span>“</span><span>interested persons</span><span>”</span><span> of the Trust).</span></div> <div><span>For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, for its investment advisory services to each Fund, BFA was paid a management fee from a Fund based </span><span>on a percentage of each Fund's average daily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.17%. From August 1, 2021 through October 19, 2021, the </span><span>management fee was 0.25%; effective October 20, 2021, the management fee is 0.15%.

The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to November 30, 2026 only </span><span>upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA. BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses in order to </span><span>limit total annual fund operating expenses (excluding Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement </span><span>may be eliminated by BFA at any time.</span></div> <div><span>BFA is located at 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. It is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (</span><span>“</span><span>BlackRock</span><span>”</span><span>). As </span><span>of September 30, 2022, BFA and its affiliates provided investment advisory services for assets in excess of $8.0 trillion. BFA and its affiliates </span><span>trade and invest for their own accounts in the actual securities and types of securities in which the Funds may also invest, which may affect </span><span>the price of such securities.</span></div> <div><span>A discussion regarding the basis for the approval by the Board of the Investment Advisory Agreement with BFA is available in each Fund's </span><span>Annual Report for the period ended July 31.</span></div> <div><span>Portfolio Managers.</span><span> Jennifer Hsui, Greg Savage and Paul Whitehead are primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Funds. </span><span>The Portfolio Managers are responsible for various functions related to portfolio management, including, but not limited to, investing cash </span><span>inflows, coordinating with members of their respective portfolio management teams to focus on certain asset classes, implementing </span><span>investment strategy, researching and reviewing investment strategy and overseeing members of their respective portfolio management </span><span>teams who have more limited responsibilities.</span></div> <div><span>Jennifer Hsui has been employed by BFA or its affiliates as a senior portfolio manager since 2007. Prior to that, Ms. Hsui was a portfolio </span><span>manager from 2006 to 2007 for Barclays Global Fund Advisors (</span><span>“</span><span>BGFA</span><span>”</span><span>). Ms. Hsui has been a Portfolio Manager of each Fund since 2012.</span></div> <div><span>Greg Savage has been employed by BFA or its affiliates as a senior portfolio manager since 2006.

(</span><span>“</span><span>Citibank</span><span>”</span><span>) is the administrator, custodian and transfer agent for each Fund. </span><span>JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. serves as custodian for the Funds in connection with certain securities lending activities.</span></div> <div><span>Conflicts of Interest. </span><span>The investment activities of BFA and its affiliates (including BlackRock and its subsidiaries (collectively, the </span><span>“</span><span>Affiliates</span><span>”</span><span>)), and their respective directors, officers or employees, in the management of, or their interest in, their own accounts and other </span><span>accounts they manage, may present conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Funds and their shareholders. BFA and its Affiliates </span><span>provide investment management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that may follow investment programs similar </span><span>to that of the Funds. BFA and its Affiliates are involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management </span><span>activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in which their interests or the interests of their clients may conflict </span><span>with those of the Funds. BFA or one or more Affiliates act, or may act, as an investor, research provider, investment manager, commodity </span><span>pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, adviser, trader, lender,</span><span> </span><span>index provider, agent and/or principal, and have </span><span>other direct and indirect interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other instruments in which the Funds may directly </span><span>or indirectly invests. The Funds may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate has </span><span>significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The Funds may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for </span><span>which an Affiliate provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of such issuances. The </span><span>Funds also may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate provides or may in the future </span><span>provide research coverage. An Affiliate may have business relationships with, and purchase or distribute or sell services or products from or </span><span>to, distributors, consultants or others who recommend the Funds or who engage in transactions with or for the Funds, and may receive </span><span>compensation for such services. BFA or one or more Affiliates may engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have </span><span>investment objectives similar to those of the Funds and/or that engage in and compete for transactions in the same types of securities, </span><span>currencies and other instruments as the Funds. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end </span><span>investment companies (which may include investment companies that are affiliated with the Funds and BFA, to the extent permitted under </span><span>the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1940 Act</span><span>”</span><span>)). The trading activities of BFA and these Affiliates are carried out without </span><span>reference to positions held directly or indirectly by the Funds and may result in BFA or an Affiliate having positions in certain securities that </span><span>are senior or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities that are owned by the Funds.</span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>28</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to share any investment opportunity, idea or strategy with the Funds. As a result, </span><span>an Affiliate may compete with the Funds for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Funds' investment activities, therefore, </span><span>may differ from those of an Affiliate and of other accounts managed by BlackRock or an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Funds could </span><span>sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other </span><span>accounts. The opposite result is also possible.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, the Funds may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an Affiliate or</span><span> </span><span>its or their directors, officers, employees </span><span>or clients have an adverse interest. Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or managed by BFA or its Affiliates may </span><span>adversely impact the Funds. Transactions by one or more clients or</span><span> </span><span>by BFA or its Affiliates or their directors, officers or employees may have </span><span>the effect of diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the Funds.</span></div> <div><span>The Funds' activities may be limited because of regulatory restrictions applicable to BFA or one or more Affiliates and/or their internal </span><span>policies designed to comply with such restrictions.</span></div> <div><span>Under a securities lending program approved by the Board, each Fund has retained BTC, an Affiliate of BFA, to serve as the securities lending </span><span>agent for the Fund to the extent that the Fund participates in the securities lending program. For these services, the securities lending agent </span><span>will receive a fee from the Fund, including a fee based on the returns earned on the Fund’s investment of the cash received as collateral for </span><span>the loaned securities. In addition, one or more Affiliates may be among the entities to which the Fund may lend its portfolio securities under </span><span>the securities lending program.</span></div> <div><span>Under an ETF Services Agreement, the Funds have retained BlackRock Investments, LLC (the </span><span>“</span><span>Distributor</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>BRIL</span><span>”</span><span>), an Affiliate of BFA, to </span><span>perform certain order processing, Authorized Participant communications, and related services in connection with the issuance and </span><span>redemption of Creation Units of the Funds (</span><span>“</span><span>ETF Services</span><span>”</span><span>). BRIL will retain a portion of the standard transaction fee received from </span><span>Authorized Participants on each creation or redemption order from the Authorized Participant for the ETF Services provided. BlackRock </span><span>collaborated with, and received payment from, Citibank, on the design and development of the ETF Services platform. Citibank may have, or </span><span>from time to time may develop, additional relationships with BlackRock or funds managed by BFA and its affiliates.</span></div> <div><span>It is also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients (including other funds and separately managed accounts) </span><span>may, subject to compliance with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of the Funds. The price, availability, liquidity, and (in some cases) </span><span>expense ratio of the Funds may be impacted by purchases and sales of the Funds by BlackRock and/or its advisory clients.</span></div> <div><span>The activities of BFA and its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers or employees may give rise to other conflicts of interest that </span><span>could disadvantage the Funds and their shareholders. BFA has adopted policies and procedures designed to address these potential conflicts </span><span>of interest.

Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or </span><span>redemption transactions directly with a Fund. Once created, shares of the Funds generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less </span><span>than a Creation Unit.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of each Fund are listed on a national securities exchange for trading during the trading day. Shares can be bought and sold </span><span>throughout the trading day like shares of other publicly-traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment for shares of </span><span>a Fund purchased on an exchange or otherwise in the secondary market. The Funds' shares trade under the ticker symbols listed on the front </span><span>cover page of this Prospectus.</span></div> <div><span>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary market involves two types of costs that may apply to all securities </span><span>transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Funds through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other charges. The </span><span>commission is frequently a fixed amount and may be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of </span><span>shares. In addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread,</span><span>”</span><span> that is, any difference between the bid price and the ask price. The spread varies </span><span>over time for shares of each Fund based on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund has high trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading volume and market liquidity (which is often the case for funds that are </span><span>newly launched or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity or illiquidity of the underlying securities held by the </span><span>Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller funds or in instances of significant volatility of the underlying securities.</span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>29</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>The Board has adopted a policy of not monitoring for frequent purchases and redemptions of Fund shares (</span><span>“</span><span>frequent trading</span><span>”</span><span>) that appear to </span><span>attempt to take advantage of a potential arbitrage opportunity presented by a lag between a change in the value of a Fund’s portfolio </span><span>securities after the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities and the reflection of that change in the Fund’s NAV </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>market timing</span><span>”</span><span>), because each Fund sells and redeems its shares directly through transactions that are in-kind and/or for cash, subject to </span><span>the conditions described below under </span><span>Creations</span><span> and Redemptions</span><span>. The Board has not adopted a policy of monitoring for other frequent </span><span>trading activity because shares of the Funds are listed for trading on a national securities exchange.</span></div> <div><span>The national securities exchange on which each Fund's shares are listed is open for trading Monday through Friday and is closed on </span><span>weekends and the following holidays (or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents’ Day, </span><span>Good Friday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. Each Fund’s primary listing </span><span>exchange is NYSE Arca.</span></div> <div><span>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act generally restricts investments by investment companies, including foreign and unregistered investment </span><span>companies, in the securities of other investment companies.  For example, a registered investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquired Fund</span><span>”</span><span>), such as </span><span>the Fund, may not knowingly sell or otherwise dispose of any security issued by the Acquired Fund to any investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquiring Fund</span><span>”</span><span>) or any company or companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund if, immediately after such sale or disposition: (i) more than </span><span>3% of the total outstanding voting stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and any company or companies controlled by </span><span>the Acquiring Fund, or (ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding voting stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and other </span><span>investment companies and companies controlled by them. Although SEC rules may permit registered investment companies and unit </span><span>investment trusts (</span><span>“</span><span>Investing Funds</span><span>”</span><span>) that enter into an investment agreement with the Trust to invest in iShares funds beyond the limits set </span><span>forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act subject to certain terms and conditions, the Fund does not permit such investments. Accordingly, </span><span>Investing Funds must adhere to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act when investing in the Fund. In addition, foreign </span><span>investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund only up to the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to any applicable SEC </span><span>no-action relief.</span></div> <div><span>Book Entry.</span><span> Shares of the Funds are held in book-entry form, which means that no stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust </span><span>Company (</span><span>“</span><span>DTC</span><span>”</span><span>) or its nominee is the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of each Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Investors owning shares of the Funds are beneficial owners as shown on the records of DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities </span><span>depository for shares of the Funds. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations </span><span>and other institutions that directly or indirectly maintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not </span><span>entitled to receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your name, and you are not considered a registered </span><span>owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its participants. These </span><span>procedures are the same as those that apply to any other securities that you hold in book-entry or </span><span>“</span><span>street name</span><span>”</span><span> form.</span></div> <div><span>Share Prices.</span><span> The trading prices of a Fund’s shares in the secondary market generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by </span><span>market forces such as the supply of and demand for ETF shares and shares of underlying securities held by the Funds, economic conditions </span><span>and other factors.</span></div> <div><span>Determination of Net Asset Value. </span><span>The NAV of each Fund normally is determined once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the </span><span>close of regular trading hours of the New York Stock Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>NYSE</span><span>”</span><span>) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day that the NYSE is </span><span>open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the </span><span>U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service </span><span>providers. The NAV of each Fund is calculated by dividing the value of the net assets of a Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the value of its total assets, which </span><span>includes the values of the Underlying Fund shares in which the Fund invests, less total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of </span><span>the Fund, generally rounded to the nearest cent.</span></div> <div><span>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities held by each Fund is determined pursuant to BFA’s valuation policies and </span><span>procedures. BFA has been designated by the Board as the valuation designee for the Fund pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment </span><span>Company Act.</span></div> <div><span>Equity securities and other equity instruments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at market value, which is generally </span><span>determined using the last reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the last traded price on the exchange or </span><span>market on which the security or instrument is primarily traded at the time of valuation. Shares of underlying open-end funds (including money </span><span>market funds) are valued at net asset value. Shares of underlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs are valued at their most </span><span>recent closing price.</span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>30</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities and money market instruments is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the </span><span>close of regular trading hours of the NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Funds are determined as of such </span><span>times.</span></div> <div><span>When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, BFA will fair value a Fund’s investments in </span><span>accordance with its policies and procedures. BFA may conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if a security or </span><span>other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its lack of trading or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from </span><span>recent price quotations or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when </span><span>there is a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is listed is </span><span>suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is available. A </span><span>“</span><span>significant event</span><span>”</span><span> is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in </span><span>its reasonable business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing a Fund’s assets or liabilities, that the event is likely to cause a material </span><span>change to the last exchange closing price or closing market price of one or more assets held by, or liabilities of, a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of an asset or liability held by a Fund is the </span><span>amount the Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length</span><span> transaction. Valuing a Fund’s investments using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market valuations </span><span>and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were </span><span>used. Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate a Fund’s </span><span>NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the </span><span>performance of the Underlying Index.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends and Distributions</span></div> <div><span>General Policies.</span><span> Dividends from net investment income, if any, generally are declared and paid at least once a year by each Fund. Each Fund </span><span>generally distributes its net capital gains, if any, to shareholders annually. Distributions of net realized securities gains, if any, generally are </span><span>declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make distributions on a more frequent basis for each Fund. The Trust reserves the right to </span><span>declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to preserve its status as a RIC or to avoid </span><span>imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends and other distributions on shares of each Fund are distributed on a </span><span>pro rata</span><span> basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend </span><span>payments are made through DTC participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds received from a </span><span>Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Dividend Reinvestment Service.</span><span> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry</span><span> Dividend Reinvestment Service for use by beneficial owners of a Fund for reinvestment of their dividend distributions. Beneficial owners </span><span>should contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers may require </span><span>beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income </span><span>and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of a Fund purchased in the secondary market.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes.</span><span> As with any investment, you should consider how your investment in shares of the Funds will be taxed. The tax information in this </span><span>Prospectus is provided as general information, based on current law. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax </span><span>consequences of an investment in shares of the Funds.</span></div> <div><span>Unless your investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an IRA, in which </span><span>case your distributions generally will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when a Fund makes </span><span>distributions or you sell Fund shares.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes on Distributions.</span><span> Distributions from a Fund’s net investment income (other than qualified dividend income), including</span><span> </span><span>distributions of </span><span>income from securities lending and distributions out of a Fund’s net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as ordinary income. </span><span>Distributions by a Fund of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain dividends) are taxable to </span><span>you as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held a Fund’s shares. Distributions by a Fund that qualify as qualified </span><span>dividend income are taxable to you at long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified dividend income are generally </span><span>eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain </span><span>threshold amounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income,</span><span>”</span><span> including, but not </span><span>limited to, interest, dividends, and net gain, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing jointly) </span><span>and of estates and trusts.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends will be qualified dividend income to you if they are attributable to qualified dividend income received by a Fund. Generally, qualified </span><span>dividend income includes dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S. corporations, provided that a Fund satisfies </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>31</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>certain holding period requirements in respect of the stock of such corporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. </span><span>Substitute dividends received by a Fund with respect to dividends paid on securities lent out will not be qualified dividend income. For this </span><span>purpose, a qualified non-U.S. corporation means any non-U.S. corporation that is eligible for benefits under a comprehensive income tax </span><span>treaty with the U.S., which includes an exchange of information program, or if the stock with respect to which the dividend was paid is readily </span><span>tradable on an established U.S. securities market. The term excludes a corporation that is a passive foreign investment company.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends received by a Fund from a RIC generally are qualified dividend income only to the extent such dividend distributions are made out </span><span>of qualified dividend income received by such RIC. Additionally, it is expected that dividends received by a Fund from a REIT and distributed </span><span>to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income. However, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 </span><span>and before January 1, 2026, the Fund may report dividends eligible for a 20% </span><span>“</span><span>qualified business income</span><span>”</span><span> deduction for non-corporate U.S. </span><span>shareholders to the extent the Fund’s income is derived from ordinary REIT dividends, reduced by allocable Fund expenses.</span></div> <div><span>For a dividend to be treated as qualified dividend income, the dividend must be received with respect to a share of stock held without being </span><span>hedged by a Fund, and with respect to a share of a Fund held without being hedged by you, for 61 days during the 121-day period beginning </span><span>at the date which is 60 days before the date on which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of </span><span>certain preferred stock, 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before such date.</span></div> <div><span>In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal income tax for the year when they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, </span><span>however, may be treated as paid on December 31 of the prior year.</span></div> <div><span>Short term capital gains earned by an Underlying Fund will be ordinary income when distributed to the Fund and will not be offset by the </span><span>Fund's capital losses. Because each Fund is expected to invest in its respective Underlying Funds, each Fund’s realized losses on sales of </span><span>shares of an Underlying Fund may be indefinitely or permanently deferred as </span><span>“</span><span>wash sales</span><span>”</span><span>. Capital loss carryforwards of an Underlying Fund, </span><span>if any, would not offset net capital gains of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>If a Fund’s distributions exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits, all or a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year </span><span>may be recharacterized as a return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of a Fund’s minimum distribution requirements, but not </span><span>in excess of a Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return of </span><span>capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder’s cost basis and result in a higher capital gain or lower capital </span><span>loss when those shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is reduced to zero, further </span><span>distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the shareholder holds shares of a Fund as capital assets.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends, interest and capital gains earned by an Underlying Fund with respect to securities issued by non-U.S. issuers may give rise to </span><span>withholding and other taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries and the U.S. may reduce or eliminate </span><span>such taxes. If more than 50% of the total assets of an Underlying Fund at the close of a year consists of non-U.S. stocks or securities </span><span>(generally, for this purpose, depositary receipts, no matter where traded, of non-U.S. companies are treated as </span><span>“</span><span>non-U.S.</span><span>”</span><span>) (and 50% of the </span><span>total assets of a Fund at the close of the year consists of foreign securities, or, at the close of each quarter, shares of Underlying Funds), a </span><span>Fund may </span><span>“</span><span>pass through</span><span>”</span><span> to you certain non-U.S. income taxes (including withholding taxes) paid by the Fund or an Underlying Fund.</span> <br/><span>For purposes of foreign tax credits for U.S. shareholders of each Fund, foreign capital gains taxes may not produce associated foreign source </span><span>income, thereby limiting a U.S. person’s ability to use such credits. </span></div> <div><span>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if you are a non-U.S. corporation (other than a pass-through entity to the extent </span><span>owned by U.S. persons), a Fund’s ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) will generally be </span><span>subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate applies, provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or </span><span>income realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital gains or upon the sale or other disposition of </span><span>shares of a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items paid to (i) foreign financial </span><span>institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS information regarding their direct and </span><span>indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information regarding their direct and indirect </span><span>U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will </span><span>provide the IRS information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders, </span><span>comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts, report to the IRS certain information with respect to </span><span>U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account </span><span>holders who fail to provide the required information, and determine certain other information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the </span><span>event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with </span><span>similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each </span><span>substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless certain exceptions apply.</span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>32</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>If your Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending arrangement, you may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends paid while </span><span>the shares are held by the borrower as qualified dividend income. In addition, you may lose the ability to use foreign tax credits passed </span><span>through by the Fund if your Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending agreement.</span></div> <div><span>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup withholding at a 24% rate will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have </span><span>not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes When Shares Are Sold.</span><span> Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain </span><span>or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares held for one year or </span><span>less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as </span><span>long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to such shares. Any such capital gains, including from </span><span>sales of Fund shares or from capital gain dividends, are included in </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income</span><span>”</span><span> for purposes of the 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare </span><span>contribution tax mentioned above.</span></div> <div><span>The foregoing discussion summarizes some of the consequences under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in a Fund. It is not a </span><span>substitute for personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and sales of shares. Consult your </span><span>personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in shares of a Fund under all applicable tax laws.</span></div> <div><span>Creations and Redemptions.</span><span> Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of each Fund are </span><span>“</span><span>created</span><span>”</span><span> at NAV by market makers, large </span><span>investors and institutions only in block-size Creation Units or multiples thereof. Each </span><span>“</span><span>creator</span><span>”</span><span> or authorized participant (an </span><span>“</span><span>Authorized </span><span>Participant</span><span>”</span><span>) has entered into an agreement with the Funds’ Distributor, an affiliate of BFA. An Authorized Participant is a member or </span><span>participant of a clearing agency registered with the SEC, which has a written agreement with the Fund or one of its service providers that </span><span>allows such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units.</span></div> <div><span>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the Distributor and a Fund, generally takes place when an Authorized Participant </span><span>deposits into a Fund a designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>creation basket</span><span>”</span><span>), and an amount of cash (including any </span><span>cash representing the value of substituted securities, assets or other positions), if any, which together approximate the holdings of a Fund in </span><span>exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. Similarly, shares can be redeemed only in Creation Units, generally for a designated </span><span>portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>redemption basket</span><span>”</span><span>) held by a Fund and an amount of cash (including any portion of such </span><span>securities for which cash may be substituted). The Funds may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units partially or solely for cash. </span><span>Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by a Fund. Creation and redemption baskets may differ and a Fund </span><span>may accept </span><span>“</span><span>custom baskets.</span><span>”</span><span> More information regarding custom baskets is contained in the Funds’ SAI.</span></div> <div><span>The prices at which creations and redemptions occur are based on the next calculation of NAV after a creation or redemption order is </span><span>received in an acceptable form under the authorized participant agreement.</span></div> <div><span>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation Units with a Fund. Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation </span><span>Units for their own accounts or for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>In the event of a system failure or other interruption, including disruptions at market makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or </span><span>redeem Creation Units either may not be executed according to the Fund’s instructions or may not be executed at all, or each Fund may not </span><span>be able to place or change orders.</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund intends to comply with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposits and satisfying redemptions with </span><span>redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any securities accepted for deposits and any securities used to satisfy </span><span>redemption requests will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the 1933 Act. Further, an Authorized </span><span>Participant that is not a </span><span>“</span><span>qualified institutional buyer,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive </span><span>Fund Securities that are restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</span></div> <div><span>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is either a member of the Continuous Net Settlement System of the National </span><span>Securities Clearing Corporation or a DTC participant and has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to creations and </span><span>redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations. Information about the procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including </span><span>the cut-off times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Funds’ SAI.</span></div> <div><span>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing basis, at any point during the life of a Fund a </span><span>“</span><span>distribution,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term is </span><span>used in the 1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on </span><span>the circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters and </span><span>subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any determination of whether one is an underwriter must take into </span><span>account all the relevant facts and circumstances of each particular case.</span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>33</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not </span><span>“</span><span>underwriters</span><span>”</span><span> but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary </span><span>secondary transactions), and thus dealing with shares that are part of an </span><span>“</span><span>unsold allotment</span><span>”</span><span> within the meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the </span><span>1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For delivery </span><span>of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is available only with respect to </span><span>transactions on a national securities exchange.</span></div> <div><span>Householding.</span><span> Householding is an option available to certain Fund investors. Householding is a method of delivery, based on the preference </span><span>of the individual investor, in which a single copy of certain shareholder documents can be delivered to investors who share the same address, </span><span>even if their accounts are registered under different names. Please contact your broker-dealer if you are interested in enrolling in </span><span>householding and receiving a single copy of prospectuses and other shareholder documents, or if you are currently enrolled in householding </span><span>and wish to change your householding status.</span></div> <div><span>Distribution</span></div> <div><span>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for each Fund on an agency basis. The Distributor does not maintain a secondary </span><span>market in shares of the Funds. The Distributor has no role in determining the policies of any Fund or the securities that are purchased or sold </span><span>by any Fund. The Distributor’s principal address is 1 University Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</span></div> <div><span>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers, registered investment advisers, banks or other intermediaries (together, </span><span>“</span><span>intermediaries</span><span>”</span><span>) related to marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of </span><span>technology platforms and reporting systems, data provision services, or their making shares of the Funds and certain other iShares funds </span><span>available to their customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may be significant to the intermediary, are </span><span>not made by the Funds. Rather, such payments are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or indirectly in </span><span>part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments. A financial </span><span>intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or the level of services provided, to its </span><span>customers based on the payments or other financial incentives it is eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial incentives </span><span>offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary </span><span>to recommend the Funds or other iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding these payments is contained in the </span><span>Funds' SAI. </span><span>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such payments </span><span>his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</span></div> <div></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>34</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>Financial Highlights</span></div> <div><span>The financial highlights table is intended to help investors understand each Fund’s financial performance for the past five years.

Please </span><span>read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional </span><span>information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</span></div> <div><span>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund are listed for trading on </span><span>Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (</span><span>“</span><span>Cboe BZX</span><span>”</span><span>). The market price for a share of the Fund may </span><span>be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</span></div> <div><span>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly-traded securities. The Fund is designed to </span><span>track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund </span><span>represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other </span><span>instruments intended to track a market index. Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which </span><span>can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based </span><span>on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at </span><span>NAV solely by Authorized Participants and only in aggregations of a specified number of </span><span>shares (</span><span>“</span><span>Creation Units</span><span>”</span><span>). Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are </span><span>listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market </span><span>prices that change throughout the day.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund invests in a particular segment of the securities markets and seeks to track </span><span>the performance of a securities index that is not representative of the market as a </span><span>whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. </span><span>Accordingly, an investment in the Fund should not constitute a complete investment </span><span>program.</span></div> <div><span>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of financial instruments, and is </span><span>not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The </span><span>performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, </span><span>including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency valuations, asset valuations, corporate </span><span>actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of </span><span>representative sampling or from legal restrictions (such as diversification </span><span>requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to </span><span>time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments </span><span>to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise determined by BFA, any such change or </span><span>adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on </span><span>a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, </span><span>the Underlying Index performance shown for periods prior to the effective date of any </span><span>such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect </span><span>such change or adjustment.</span><span> </span> <br/><span>“</span><span>Tracking error</span><span>”</span><span> is the divergence of the Fund's performance from that of the </span><span>Underlying Index. Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, </span><span>it can be expected to have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing </span><span>strategy. </span><span>“</span><span>Replication</span><span>”</span><span> is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>of the securities in its underlying index in approximately the same proportions as in the </span><span>underlying index.</span></div> <div><span>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not insured or guaranteed by </span><span>the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or </span><span>any of its affiliates.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be changed without </span><span>shareholder approval.</span></div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Principal Risks</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The Fund is subject to various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of </span><span>which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability </span><span>to meet its investment objective. You could lose all or part of your investment in the </span><span>Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments. The order of the below risk </span><span>factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. The Fund </span><span>discloses its portfolio holdings daily at </span><span>www.iShares.com</span><span>.</span></div> <div><span>Asset Class Risk.</span><span> The securities</span><span> </span><span>and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that </span><span>track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries, groups of industries, </span><span>markets, market segments, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, </span><span>currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and </span><span>underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets</span><span> </span><span>depending upon a </span><span>number of factors including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, </span><span>global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental </span><span>controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that </span><span>invest in different asset classes.</span></div> <div><span>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. </span><span>Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of </span><span>those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption </span><span>transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized </span><span>Participants on an agency basis (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, on behalf of other market participants). To the </span><span>extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with </span><span>creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized </span><span>Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares </span><span>may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading </span><span>halts or delisting.</span></div> <div><span>Concentration Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, </span><span>including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than </span><span>the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's investments are concentrated in </span><span>the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of </span><span>countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector, market segment or </span><span>asset class. The Fund may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of </span><span>those securities and/or other assets, may experience increased price volatility and </span><span>may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>occurrences affecting those securities and/or other assets than a fund that does not </span><span>concentrate its investments.</span></div> <div><span>Consumer Staples Sector Risk.</span><span> Companies in the consumer staples sector may be </span><span>affected by the regulation of various product components and production methods, </span><span>marketing campaigns and changes in the global economy, consumer spending and </span><span>consumer demand. Tobacco companies, in particular, may be adversely affected by </span><span>new laws, regulations and litigation. Companies in the consumer staples sector may </span><span>also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be </span><span>influenced by unpredictable factors. These companies may be subject to severe </span><span>competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</span></div> <div><span>Cybersecurity Risk.</span><span> The Fund,</span><span> </span><span>Authorized Participants, service providers and the </span><span>relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information security and </span><span>related </span><span>“</span><span>cyber</span><span>”</span><span> risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of </span><span>cybersecurity risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, </span><span>which could result in material adverse consequences for such issuers and may cause </span><span>the Fund’s investment in such issuers to lose value. In general, cyber incidents can </span><span>result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are </span><span>not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, through </span><span>“</span><span>hacking</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive </span><span>information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyberattacks may also </span><span>be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as </span><span>causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, efforts to make network services </span><span>unavailable to intended users). Recently, geopolitical tensions may have increased the </span><span>scale and sophistication of deliberate attacks, particularly those from nation-states or </span><span>from entities with nation-state backing.</span><span> </span> <br/><br/><span>Cybersecurity failures by, or breaches of, the systems of the Fund's adviser, distributor </span><span>and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index and benchmark </span><span>providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market </span><span>makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests </span><span>have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially </span><span>resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s ability to calculate its NAV, </span><span>disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of </span><span>erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund </span><span>or its service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other </span><span>laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other </span><span>compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyberattacks may </span><span>render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, </span><span>and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund inaccessible, inaccurate or </span><span>incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund in order to resolve or </span><span>prevent cyber incidents in the future. While the Fund has established business </span><span>continuity plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber </span><span>incidents, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the </span><span>possibility that certain risks have not been identified, that prevention and remediation </span><span>efforts will not be successful or that cyberattacks will go undetected. Furthermore, the </span><span>Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by service </span><span> </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span> providers to the Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, market makers or Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively </span><span>impacted as a result.</span></div> <div><span>Energy Sector Risk. </span><span>The success of companies in</span><span>the energy sector may be cyclical </span><span>and highly dependent on energy prices. The market value of securities issued by </span><span>companies in the energy sector may decline for the following reasons, among others: </span><span>changes in the levels and volatility of global energy prices, energy supply and demand, </span><span>and capital expenditures on exploration and production of energy sources; exchange </span><span>rates, interest rates, economic conditions, and tax treatment; the enactment or </span><span>cessation of trade sanctions; war or other geopolitical conflicts; and energy </span><span>conservation efforts, increased competition and technological advances. Companies in </span><span>this sector may be subject to substantial government regulation and contractual fixed </span><span>pricing, which may increase the cost of doing business and limit the earnings of these </span><span>companies. A significant portion of the revenues of these companies may depend on a </span><span>relatively small number of customers, including governmental entities and utilities. As a </span><span>result, governmental budget constraints may have a material adverse effect on the </span><span>stock prices of companies in this sector. Energy companies may also operate in, or </span><span>engage in transactions involving, countries with less developed regulatory regimes or a </span><span>history of expropriation, nationalization or other adverse policies. Energy companies </span><span>also face a significant risk of liability from accidents resulting in injury or loss of life or </span><span>property, pollution or other environmental problems, equipment malfunctions or </span><span>mishandling of materials and a risk of loss from terrorism, cyber incident, political </span><span>strife or natural disasters. Any such event could have serious consequences for the </span><span>general population of the affected area and could have an adverse impact on the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio and the performance of the Fund. Energy companies can be </span><span>significantly affected by the supply of, and demand for, specific products (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, oil and </span><span>natural gas) and services, exploration and production spending, government </span><span>subsidization, world events and general economic conditions. Energy companies may </span><span>have relatively high levels of debt and may be more likely than other companies to </span><span>restructure their businesses if there are downturns in energy markets or in the global </span><span>economy.</span></div> <div><span>In the context of the COVID-19 outbreak and disputes among oil-producing countries </span><span>regarding potential limits on the production of crude oil, the energy sector has </span><span>experienced increased volatility. In particular, significant market volatility in the crude </span><span>oil markets as well as the oil futures markets resulted in the market price of the front </span><span>month WTI crude oil futures contracts falling below zero for a period of time. Russia’s </span><span>large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 has led to further disruptions and </span><span>increased volatility in the energy and commodity futures markets due to actual and </span><span>potential disruptions in the supply and demand for certain commodities, including oil </span><span>and natural gas. In March 2022, the U.S. announced that it would ban imports of oil, </span><span>natural gas and coal from Russia. The effect of the U.S. ban and any similar bans by </span><span>other countries, as well as the extent and duration of the Russian military action, </span><span>resulting sanctions and associated market disruptions on the energy sector, are </span><span>impossible to predict and depend on a number of factors. The effect of these events or </span><span>any related developments could be significant and may have a severe adverse effect </span><span>on the performance of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>Equity Securities Risk.</span><span> The Fund invests in equity securities, which are subject to </span><span>changes in value that may be attributable to market perception of a particular issuer or </span><span>to general stock market fluctuations that affect all issuers. Investments in equity </span><span>securities may be more volatile than investments in other asset classes. The </span><span>Underlying Index is composed of common stocks, which generally subject</span><span> </span><span>their holders </span><span>to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common </span><span>stockholders' claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt </span><span>securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</span></div> <div><span>Healthcare Sector Risk.</span><span> The profitability of companies in the healthcare sector may </span><span>be adversely affected by the following factors, among others: extensive government </span><span>regulations, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising </span><span>costs of medical products and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on </span><span>outpatient services, changes in the demand for medical products and services, a </span><span>limited number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other </span><span>market developments. Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent on patent </span><span>protection. The expiration of a company’s patents may adversely affect that company’s </span><span>profitability. Many healthcare companies are subject to extensive litigation based on </span><span>product liability and similar claims. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive </span><span>forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may result in price </span><span>discounting. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 allows for the negotiation of </span><span>prescription drug prices on behalf of Medicare recipients, which may result in reduced </span><span>prescription prices. This could reduce some healthcare companies’ overall profitability. </span><span>Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. </span><span>The process of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, and such efforts </span><span>ultimately may be unsuccessful. Companies in the healthcare sector may be thinly </span><span>capitalized and may be susceptible to product obsolescence. In addition, a number of </span><span>legislative proposals concerning healthcare have been considered by the U.S. </span><span>Congress in recent years. It is unclear what proposals will ultimately be enacted, if any, </span><span>and what effect they may have on companies in the healthcare sector.</span></div> <div><span>High Portfolio Turnover Risk. </span><span>High portfolio turnover (considered by the Fund to </span><span>mean higher than 100% annually) may result in increased transaction costs to the </span><span>Fund, including brokerage commissions, dealer mark-ups and other transaction costs </span><span>on the sale of the securities and on reinvestment in other securities. Volatile market </span><span>conditions may trigger ad hoc rebalances of the Underlying Index, and the Fund </span><span>anticipates higher portfolio turnover in such conditions. These effects of higher than </span><span>normal portfolio turnover may adversely affect Fund performance.</span></div> <div><span>Index-Related Risk.</span><span> The Fund seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to </span><span>the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as </span><span>published by the Index Provider. Market disruptions or high volatility, other unusual </span><span>market circumstances and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the </span><span>Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the </span><span>Underlying Index, and may cause the Fund to temporarily invest less than the required </span><span>level (under normal conditions) of its assets in the component securities of the </span><span>Underlying Index, particularly during periods in which the Underlying Index rebalances. </span><span>There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any agents that may act on its behalf </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that the Underlying Index will be </span><span>determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the Index Provider provides </span><span>descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to achieve, neither the Index </span><span>Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any liability in relation to the </span><span>quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or its related data, and they </span><span>do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in line with the Index Provider’s </span><span>methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to manage the Fund </span><span>consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider to BFA. BFA does </span><span>not provide any warranty or guarantee against the Index Provider’s or any agent’s </span><span>errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the data used to </span><span>compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not be identified </span><span>and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, particularly where the </span><span>indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or managers. Such errors </span><span>may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its shareholders. For example, during </span><span>a period where the Underlying Index contains incorrect constituents, the Fund would </span><span>have market exposure to such constituents and would be underexposed to the </span><span>Underlying Index’s other constituents. Shareholders should understand that any gains </span><span>from Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund and its shareholders and any losses </span><span>or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will be borne by the Fund and its </span><span>shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>Unusual market conditions or other unforeseen circumstances (such as natural </span><span>disasters, political unrest or war) may impact the Index Provider or a third-party data </span><span>provider, and could cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance to the </span><span>Underlying Index. This could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or </span><span>expected composition. The postponement of a scheduled rebalance could mean that </span><span>constituents of the Underlying Index that would otherwise be removed at rebalance </span><span>due to changes in market capitalizations, issuer credit ratings, or other reasons may </span><span>remain, causing the performance and constituents of the Underlying Index to vary from </span><span>those expected under normal conditions. Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index </span><span>Provider or its agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying </span><span>Index due to reaching certain weighting constraints, unusual market conditions or </span><span>corporate events or, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index </span><span>constituents. Ad hoc rebalances may also be triggered during volatile market </span><span>conditions. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances </span><span>its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the </span><span>Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such </span><span>portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Therefore, </span><span>errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the Index Provider or its agents </span><span>to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Infectious Illness Risk. </span><span>A widespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as the </span><span>COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect the economies of many nations and the </span><span>global economy and may impact individual issuers and capital markets in ways that </span><span>cannot be foreseen.</span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>6</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in travel restrictions, closed international </span><span>borders, disruption of healthcare services, prolonged quarantines, cancellations, </span><span>supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, temporary and permanent closures </span><span>of businesses, layoffs, defaults and other significant economic, social and political </span><span>impacts, as well as general concern and uncertainty.</span></div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in extreme volatility, severe losses, credit </span><span>deterioration of issuers, and disruptions in markets, which could adversely impact the </span><span>Fund and its investments, including impairing any hedging activity.</span></div> <div><span>Certain local markets may be subject to closures. Any suspension of trading in markets </span><span>in which the Fund invests will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and will </span><span>impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities in such markets.</span><span> </span><span>Market or </span><span>economic disruptions could result in elevated tracking error and increased premiums </span><span>or discounts to the Fund's NAV. Additionally, an outbreak could impair the operations </span><span>of the Fund’s service providers, including BFA, which could adversely impact the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Governmental and quasi-governmental authorities and regulators throughout the world </span><span>may respond to an outbreak and any resulting economic disruptions with a variety of </span><span>fiscal and monetary policy changes, including direct capital infusions into companies </span><span>and other issuers, new monetary policy tools, and changes in interest rates. A reversal </span><span>of these policies, or the ineffectiveness of such policies, is likely to increase market </span><span>volatility, which could adversely affect the Fund’s investments.</span></div> <div><span>An outbreak may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social and economic risks in </span><span>certain countries or globally, which could adversely affect the Fund and its investments </span><span>and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Despite the development of vaccines, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its </span><span>effects cannot be predicted with certainty.</span></div> <div><span>Issuer Risk. </span><span>The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual </span><span>securities to which the Fund has exposure. Any issuer of these securities may perform </span><span>poorly, causing the value of its securities to decline. Poor performance may be caused </span><span>by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, </span><span>expiration of patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages, </span><span>corporate restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or </span><span>other factors. Issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to </span><span>reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock prices to decline. An </span><span>issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in </span><span>which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</span></div> <div><span>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.</span><span> Large-capitalization companies may be less </span><span>able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. </span><span>Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more limited </span><span>growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different </span><span>market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the </span><span>overall performance of the broader securities markets.</span></div> <div><span>Management Risk. </span><span>Because BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, </span><span>the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities not </span><span>included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that BFA’s </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>7</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of </span><span>constraints, may not produce the intended results.</span></div> <div><span>Market Risk.</span><span> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market </span><span>movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The </span><span>value of a security</span><span> </span><span>or other asset may decline due to changes in general market </span><span>conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the issuer of </span><span>the security</span><span> </span><span>or other asset, or factors that affect a particular issuer or issuers, </span><span> </span><span>exchange or exchanges, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of </span><span>industries, sector or asset class. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of </span><span>terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, or </span><span>other events could have a significant impact on the Fund</span><span> </span><span>and its investments and could </span><span>result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. During a general market </span><span>downturn, multiple asset classes may be negatively affected. Changes in market </span><span>conditions and interest rates generally do not have the same impact on all types of </span><span>securities and instruments.</span></div> <div><span>The country in which the Fund invests may be subject to considerable degrees of </span><span>economic, political and social instability.</span></div> <div><span>Political and Social Risk.</span><span> Disparities of wealth, the pace and success of democratization </span><span>and ethnic, religious and racial disaffection, among other factors, may exacerbate </span><span>social unrest, violence and labor unrest in some of the countries in which the Fund may </span><span>invest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments may result in sudden </span><span>and significant investment losses.</span></div> <div><span>Economic Risk.</span><span> Some countries in which the Fund may invest may experience </span><span>economic instability, including instability resulting from substantial rates of inflation or </span><span>significant devaluations of their currency, or economic recessions, which would have a </span><span>negative effect on the economies and securities markets of their economies. Some of </span><span>these countries may also impose restrictions on the exchange or export of currency or </span><span>adverse currency exchange rates and may be characterized by a lack of available </span><span>currency hedging instruments.</span></div> <div><span>Expropriation Risk.</span><span> Investments in certain countries in which the Fund may invest may </span><span>be subject to loss due to expropriation or nationalization of assets and property or the </span><span>imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of capital.</span></div> <div><span>Large Government Debt Risk.</span><span> Chronic structural public sector deficits in some </span><span>countries in which the Fund may invest may adversely impact securities held by the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Market Trading Risk.</span></div> <div><span>Absence of Active Market.</span><span> Although shares of the Fund are listed for trading on one or </span><span>more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for </span><span>such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized </span><span>Participants.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Secondary Listings. </span><span>The Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S.</span><span> stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary </span><span>listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made available to non-U.S. investors </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There </span><span>can be no assurance that the Fund’s shares will continue to trade on any such stock </span><span>exchange or in any market or that the Fund’s shares will continue to meet the </span><span>requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's shares </span><span>may be less actively traded in certain markets than in others, and investors are subject </span><span>to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of the market where they </span><span>or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to </span><span>investors who trade Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market </span><span>hours may not be available to investors who trade in other markets, which may result </span><span>in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</span></div> <div><span>Secondary Market Trading Risk.</span><span> Shares of the Fund may trade in the secondary market </span><span>at times when the Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such </span><span>times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more significant premiums or </span><span>discounts than might be experienced at times when the Fund accepts purchase and </span><span>redemption orders.</span></div> <div><span>Secondary market trading in Fund shares may be halted by a stock exchange because </span><span>of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund shares on a </span><span>stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by </span><span>extraordinary market volatility pursuant to </span><span>“</span><span>circuit breaker</span><span>”</span><span> rules on the stock </span><span>exchange or market.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed on a stock exchange, may </span><span>be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price </span><span>decreases associated with being sold short. In addition, trading activity in derivative </span><span>products based on the Fund may lead to increased trading volume and volatility in the </span><span>secondary market for the shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV.</span><span> Shares of the Fund trade on </span><span>stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of </span><span>the Fund is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in </span><span>the market value of the Fund’s holdings. The trading price of the Fund's shares </span><span>fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours</span><span> </span><span>based on both market supply of and </span><span>demand for Fund shares and the underlying value of the Fund's portfolio holdings or </span><span>NAV. As a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s shares may deviate significantly from </span><span>NAV during periods of market volatility. </span><span>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, </span><span>MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO </span><span>NAV</span><span>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at </span><span>NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund are not </span><span>likely to be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, </span><span>which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, </span><span>their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely </span><span>that the Fund’s shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the </span><span>Fund’s next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly with </span><span>the Fund's NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other </span><span>factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at </span><span>market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during </span><span>periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>9</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>Fund that differ significantly from its NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing to </span><span>create or redeem Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for such shares or </span><span>its underlying investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s shares trading at a </span><span>premium or discount to NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.</span><span> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange </span><span>involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or </span><span>selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage </span><span>commission and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread</span><span>”</span><span>; </span><span>that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>bid</span><span>”</span><span> price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>ask</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>price).</span><span> </span><span>The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume </span><span>and market liquidity and wider if the Fund has less trading volume and market liquidity. </span><span>In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be </span><span>regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because </span><span>of the costs inherent in buying or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract </span><span>significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be </span><span>advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a </span><span>brokerage account.</span></div> <div><span>Momentum</span><span> </span><span>Securities Risk.</span><span> Stocks that have previously exhibited high momentum </span><span>characteristics may not experience positive momentum in the future or may </span><span>experience more volatility than the market as a whole. The Index Provider may be </span><span>unsuccessful in creating an index that emphasizes momentum securities. In addition, </span><span>there may be periods when the momentum style of investing is out of favor and the </span><span>investment performance of the Fund may suffer. Neither the Fund nor BFA can offer </span><span>assurances that the Index Provider's model will result in the Fund meeting its </span><span>investment objective.</span></div> <div><span>Operational Risk.</span><span> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of </span><span>factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication </span><span>errors, errors of the Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third parties, </span><span>failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA </span><span>seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, </span><span>these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address </span><span>significant operational risks.</span></div> <div><span>Passive Investment Risk.</span><span> The Fund is not actively managed and may be affected by a </span><span>general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests </span><span>in securities included in, or representative of, the Underlying Index, regardless of their </span><span>investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in </span><span>defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the U.S.</span><span> A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade </span><span>regulations, inflation and/or an economic recession in the U.S. may have a material </span><span>adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed on U.S. exchanges. </span><span>Proposed and adopted policy and legislative changes in the U.S. are changing many </span><span>aspects of financial, commercial, public health, environmental, and other regulation </span><span>and may have a significant effect on U.S. markets generally, as well as on the value of </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>certain securities. Governmental agencies project that the U.S. will continue to </span><span>maintain elevated public debt levels for the foreseeable future. Although elevated debt </span><span>levels do not necessarily indicate or cause economic problems, elevated public debt </span><span>service costs may constrain future economic growth.</span> <br/><span>The U.S. has developed increasingly strained relations with a number of foreign </span><span>countries. If relations with certain countries deteriorate, it could adversely affect U.S. </span><span>issuers as well as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also </span><span>experienced increased internal unrest and discord, as well as significant challenges in </span><span>managing and containing the outbreak of COVID-19. If these trends were to continue, </span><span>it may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the issuers in which the Fund </span><span>invests.</span></div> <div><span>Securities Lending Risk.</span><span> The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities </span><span>lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the </span><span>loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund </span><span>could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for </span><span>loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash </span><span>collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund. </span><span>BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>BTC</span><span>”</span><span>), the</span><span> </span><span>Fund's securities lending </span><span>agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments for </span><span>dividends when managing the</span><span> </span><span>Fund's securities lending program.</span></div> <div><span>Tracking Error Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be subject to </span><span>“</span><span>tracking error,</span><span>”</span><span> which is the </span><span>divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error </span><span>may occur because of differences between the securities and other instruments held in </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences, </span><span>transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, </span><span>differences in timing of the accrual or the valuation of dividends or interest received by </span><span>the Fund or distributions paid to the Fund’s shareholders, the requirements to maintain </span><span>pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the </span><span>distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, changes </span><span>to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or </span><span>existing regulatory requirements, among other reasons. This risk may be heightened </span><span>during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. </span><span>Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the </span><span>Underlying Index does not. </span><span>BFA EXPECTS THAT THE FUND MAY EXPERIENCE </span><span>HIGHER TRACKING ERROR THAN IS TYPICAL FOR SIMILAR INDEX ETFs.</span></div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</span></div> <div><span>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated with its investments </span><span>and investment strategies. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the </span><span>significance of any particular risk factor.</span></div> <div><span>Close-Out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.</span><span> Regulations adopted by global </span><span>prudential regulators require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global </span><span>systemically important banking organizations to include contractual restrictions on </span><span>close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. </span><span>Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>and other derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending </span><span>agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial </span><span>contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution </span><span>proceedings and also prohibit the Fund from exercising default rights due to a </span><span>receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. These </span><span>requirements may increase credit risk and other risks to the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Dividend-Paying Stock Risk.</span><span> Investing in dividend-paying stocks involves the risk </span><span>that such stocks may fall out of favor with investors and underperform the broader </span><span>market. Companies that issue dividend-paying stocks are not required to pay or </span><span>continue paying dividends on such stocks. It is possible that issuers of the stocks held </span><span>by the Fund will not declare dividends in the future or will reduce or eliminate the </span><span>payment of dividends (including reducing or eliminating anticipated accelerations or </span><span>increases in the payment of dividends) in the future.</span></div> <div><span>Financials Sector Risk.</span><span> Companies in the financials sector</span><span> </span><span>of an economy are subject </span><span>to extensive governmental regulation and intervention, which may adversely affect the </span><span>scope of their activities, the prices they can charge, the amount of capital they must </span><span>maintain and, potentially, their size. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a </span><span>company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by </span><span>applicable law. Governmental regulation may change frequently and may have </span><span>significant adverse consequences for companies in the financials sector, including </span><span>effects not intended by such regulation. Increased risk taking by banks may also result </span><span>in greater overall risk in the U.S. and global financials sector. The impact of changes in </span><span>capital requirements, or recent or future regulation in various countries, on any </span><span>individual financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be </span><span>predicted.</span><span> </span> <br/><span>Certain risks may impact the value of investments in the financials sector more </span><span>severely than those of investments outside this sector, including the risks associated </span><span>with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage. Companies in the </span><span>financials sector are exposed directly to the credit risk of their borrowers and </span><span>counterparties, who may be leveraged to an unknown degree, including through swaps </span><span>and other derivatives products. Financial services companies may have significant </span><span>exposure to the same borrowers and counterparties, with the result that a borrower’s </span><span>or counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations to one company may affect other </span><span>companies with exposure to the same borrower or counterparty. This </span><span>interconnectedness of risk may result in significant negative impacts to companies </span><span>with direct exposure to the defaulting counterparty as well as adverse cascading </span><span>effects in the markets and the financials sector generally. Companies in the financials </span><span>sector may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and loan losses, </span><span>decreases in the availability of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades </span><span>and adverse conditions in other related markets. Insurance companies, in particular, </span><span>may be subject to severe price competition and/or rate regulation, which may have an </span><span>adverse impact on their profitability. The financials sector is particularly sensitive to </span><span>fluctuations in interest rates. The financials sector is also a target for cyberattacks, and </span><span>may experience technology malfunctions and disruptions. Cyberattacks and </span><span>technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>12</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>and have reportedly caused losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively </span><span>impact the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Illiquid Investments Risk. </span><span>The Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, </span><span>immediately after the acquisition, the Fund would have invested more than 15% of its </span><span>net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the </span><span>Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in </span><span>seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the </span><span>investment. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, </span><span>particularly during periods of market turmoil. There can be no assurance that a security </span><span>or instrument that is deemed to be liquid when purchased will continue to be liquid for </span><span>as long as it is held by the Fund, and any security or instrument held by the Fund may </span><span>be deemed an illiquid investment pursuant to the Fund’s liquidity risk management </span><span>program. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid investments may </span><span>reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be unable to transact at </span><span>advantageous times or prices. An investment may be illiquid due to, among other </span><span>things, the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a </span><span>market in securities or instruments</span><span> </span><span>or the lack of an active market for such securities </span><span>or instruments. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or instruments with </span><span>substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have increased exposure to </span><span>the risks associated with illiquid investments. Illiquid investments may be harder to </span><span>value, especially in changing markets. Although the Fund primarily seeks to redeem </span><span>shares of the Fund on an in-kind basis, if the Fund is forced to sell underlying </span><span>investments at reduced prices or under unfavorable conditions to meet redemption </span><span>requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. This may be magnified in </span><span>a rising interest rate environment or other circumstances where redemptions from the </span><span>Fund may be greater than normal. Other market participants may be attempting to </span><span>liquidate holdings at the same time as the Fund, causing increased supply of the Fund’s </span><span>underlying investments in the market and contributing to illiquid investments risk and </span><span>downward pricing pressure. In addition, if the Fund is limited in its ability to sell illiquid </span><span>investments during periods when shareholders are redeeming their shares, the Fund </span><span>will need to sell liquid securities to meet redemption requests and illiquid securities will </span><span>become a larger portion of the Fund’s holdings. During periods of market volatility, </span><span>liquidity in the market for the Fund’s shares may be impacted by the liquidity in the </span><span>market for the underlying securities or instruments held by the Fund, which could lead </span><span>to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Large Shareholder and Large-Scale Redemption Risk.</span><span> Certain shareholders, </span><span>including an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an </span><span>affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, a market maker, or another entity, may from time to time </span><span>own or manage a substantial amount of Fund shares or may invest in the Fund and </span><span>hold their investment for a limited period of time. These shareholders may also pledge </span><span>or loan Fund shares (to secure financing or otherwise), which may result in the shares </span><span>becoming concentrated in another party. There can be no assurance that any large </span><span>shareholder or large group of shareholders would not redeem their investment or that </span><span>the size of the Fund would be maintained. Redemptions of a large number of Fund </span><span>shares by these shareholders may adversely affect the Fund’s liquidity and net assets. </span><span>To the extent the Fund permits redemptions in cash, these redemptions may force the </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>13</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>Fund to sell portfolio securities when it might not otherwise do so, which may </span><span>negatively impact the Fund’s NAV, have a material effect on the market price of the </span><span>Shares and increase the Fund’s brokerage costs and/or accelerate the realization of </span><span>taxable income and/or gains and cause the Fund to make taxable distributions to its </span><span>shareholders earlier than the Fund otherwise would have. In addition, under certain </span><span>circumstances, non-redeeming shareholders may be treated as receiving a </span><span>disproportionately large taxable distribution during or with respect to such tax year. </span><span>The Fund also may be required to sell its more liquid Fund investments to meet a large </span><span>redemption, in which case the Fund’s remaining assets may be less liquid, more </span><span>volatile, and more difficult to price. To the extent these large shareholders transact in </span><span>shares on the secondary market, such transactions may account for a large </span><span>percentage of the trading volume for the shares of the Fund and may, therefore, have a </span><span>material upward or downward effect on the market price of the Fund shares. In </span><span>addition, large purchases of Fund shares may adversely affect the Fund’s performance </span><span>to the extent that the Fund is delayed in investing new cash and is required to maintain </span><span>a larger cash position than it ordinarily would, diluting its investment returns.</span></div> <div><span>Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk. </span><span>Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies </span><span>may be more volatile than those of large-capitalization companies and, therefore, the </span><span>Fund’s share price may be more volatile than those of funds that invest a larger </span><span>percentage of their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock </span><span>prices of mid-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization</span><span> companies to adverse business or economic developments, and the </span><span>stocks of mid-capitalization companies may be less liquid than those of large-capitalization</span><span> companies, making it difficult for the Fund to buy and sell shares of mid-capitalization</span><span> companies. In addition, mid-capitalization companies generally have less </span><span>diverse product lines than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to </span><span>adverse developments related to their products.</span></div> <div><span>Technology Sector Risk.</span><span> Technology companies, including information technology </span><span>companies,</span><span> </span><span>face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may </span><span>have an adverse effect on a company’s profit margins. Technology companies may </span><span>have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of </span><span>technology companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological </span><span>developments, frequent new product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth </span><span>rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Companies in the </span><span>technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and other intellectual property </span><span>rights. A technology company’s loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect </span><span>the company’s profitability. Companies in the technology sector are facing increased </span><span>government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or </span><span>regulatory action. The technology sector may also be adversely affected by changes or </span><span>trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced or characterized by </span><span>unpredictable factors.</span></div> <div><span>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.</span><span> If certain aggregate and/or fund-level ownership </span><span>thresholds are reached through transactions undertaken by BFA, its affiliates or the </span><span>Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions or actions by an issuer or regulator, the </span><span>ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to purchase or </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be </span><span>restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make </span><span>investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant threshold limits, and </span><span>such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio holdings</span><span> </span><span>compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This </span><span>may increase the risk of the Fund being underinvested to the Underlying Index and </span><span>increase the risk of tracking error.</span></div> <div><span>For example, in certain circumstances where the Fund invests in securities issued by </span><span>companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or </span><span>international markets, is subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or </span><span>invests in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits on the </span><span>aggregate and/or fund-level amount invested or voted by BFA and its affiliates for their </span><span>proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Fund) that may not be </span><span>exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if </span><span>exceeded, may cause BFA and its affiliates, the Fund or other client accounts to suffer </span><span>disadvantages or business restrictions.</span></div> <div><span>Portfolio Holdings Information</span></div> <div><span>A description of the Trust's policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Fund's Statement of Additional </span><span>Information (</span><span>“</span><span>SAI</span><span>”</span><span>).

BFA provides an investment </span><span>program for the Fund and manages the investment of the Fund’s assets. In managing </span><span>the Fund, BFA may draw upon the research and expertise of its asset management </span><span>affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's </span><span>investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists </span><span>and other investment specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines </span><span>and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</span></div> <div><span>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and the Trust (entered </span><span>into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the </span><span>Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with </span><span>respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of </span><span>portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, </span><span>and litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of </span><span>the Trustees who are not </span><span>“</span><span>interested persons</span><span>”</span><span> of the Trust).</span></div> <div><span>For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, BFA was paid a management fee from the </span><span>Fund, as a percentage of the Fund’s average daily net assets, at the annual rate of </span><span>0.15%.

BFA and its Affiliates provide investment </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>16</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that may </span><span>follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA and its Affiliates are </span><span>involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management </span><span>activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in which their </span><span>interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or </span><span>one or more Affiliates act, or may act, as an investor, research provider, investment </span><span>manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, </span><span>adviser, trader, lender,</span><span> </span><span>index provider, agent and/or principal, and have other direct </span><span>and indirect interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other </span><span>instruments in which the Fund may directly or indirectly invest. The Fund may invest in </span><span>securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate </span><span>has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The Fund may also invest </span><span>in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which an Affiliate provides and is </span><span>compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of </span><span>such issuances. The Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in other </span><span>transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate provides or may in the future </span><span>provide research coverage. An Affiliate may have business relationships with, and </span><span>purchase or distribute or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants </span><span>or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, </span><span>and may receive compensation for such services. BFA or one or more Affiliates may </span><span>engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment </span><span>objectives similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for </span><span>transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the </span><span>Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end</span><span> investment companies (which may include investment companies that are </span><span>affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment </span><span>Company Act of 1940, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1940 Act</span><span>”</span><span>)). The trading activities of BFA and </span><span>these Affiliates are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly </span><span>by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate having positions in certain securities </span><span>that are senior or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities </span><span>that are owned by the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to share any investment </span><span>opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with </span><span>the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's </span><span>investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an Affiliate and of other </span><span>accounts managed by BlackRock or an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could </span><span>sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts </span><span>achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The opposite result is </span><span>also possible.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, the Fund may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an </span><span>Affiliate or</span><span> </span><span>its or their directors, officers, employees or clients have an adverse interest. </span><span>Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or managed by BFA or its </span><span>Affiliates may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or</span><span> </span><span>by </span><span>BFA or its Affiliates or their directors, officers or employees may have the effect of </span><span>diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>17</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>The Fund's activities may be limited because of regulatory restrictions applicable to </span><span>BFA or one or more Affiliates and/or their internal policies designed to comply with </span><span>such restrictions.</span></div> <div><span>Under a securities lending program approved by the Board, the Fund has retained BTC, </span><span>an Affiliate of BFA, to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent </span><span>that the Fund participates in the securities lending program. For these services, the </span><span>securities lending agent will receive a fee from the Fund, including a fee based on the </span><span>returns earned on the Fund’s investment of the cash received as collateral for the </span><span>loaned securities. In addition, one or more Affiliates may be among the entities to </span><span>which the Fund may lend its portfolio securities under the securities lending program.</span></div> <div><span>Under an ETF Services Agreement, the Fund has retained BlackRock Investments, LLC </span><span>(the </span><span>“</span><span>Distributor</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>BRIL</span><span>”</span><span>), an Affiliate of BFA, to perform certain order processing, </span><span>Authorized Participant communications, and related services in connection with the </span><span>issuance and redemption of Creation Units of the Fund (</span><span>“</span><span>ETF Services</span><span>”</span><span>). BRIL will </span><span>retain a portion of the standard transaction fee received from Authorized Participants </span><span>on each creation or redemption order from the Authorized Participant for the ETF </span><span>Services provided. BlackRock collaborated with, and received payment from, Citibank, </span><span>on the design and development of the ETF Services platform. Citibank may have, or </span><span>from time to time may develop, additional relationships with BlackRock or funds </span><span>managed by BFA and its affiliates.</span></div> <div><span>It is also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients </span><span>(including other funds and separately managed accounts) may, subject to compliance </span><span>with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of the Fund. The price, availability, </span><span>liquidity, and (in some cases) expense ratio of the Fund may be impacted by purchases </span><span>and sales of the Fund by BlackRock and/or its advisory clients.</span></div> <div><span>The activities of BFA and its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers or </span><span>employees may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund </span><span>and its shareholders. BFA has adopted policies and procedures designed to address </span><span>these potential conflicts of interest. See the SAI for further information.</span></div> <div><span>Shareholder Information</span></div> <div><span>Additional shareholder information, including how to buy and sell shares of the Fund, is </span><span>available free of charge by calling toll-free: 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or visiting </span><span>our website at www.iShares.com.</span></div> <div><span>Buying and Selling Shares.</span><span> Shares of the Fund may be acquired or redeemed directly </span><span>from the Fund only in Creation Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the </span><span>Creations </span><span>and Redemptions</span><span> section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, </span><span>shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a </span><span>Creation Unit.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange for trading during the </span><span>trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of </span><span>other publicly-traded companies.

The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol </span><span>“</span><span>MTUM.</span><span>”</span></div> <div><span>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary market involves two </span><span>types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling </span><span>shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other </span><span>charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may be a significant </span><span>proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In </span><span>addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread,</span><span>”</span><span> that is, any difference between the </span><span>bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over time for shares of the Fund based </span><span>on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund </span><span>has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity (which is often the case for funds that are newly launched </span><span>or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity or illiquidity </span><span>of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller </span><span>funds or in instances of significant volatility of the underlying securities.</span></div> <div><span>The Board has adopted a policy of not monitoring for frequent purchases and </span><span>redemptions of Fund shares (</span><span>“</span><span>frequent trading</span><span>”</span><span>) that appear to attempt to take </span><span>advantage of a potential arbitrage opportunity presented by a lag between a change in </span><span>the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities after the close of the primary markets for </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio securities and the reflection of that change in the Fund’s NAV </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>market timing</span><span>”</span><span>), because the Fund sells and redeems its shares directly through </span><span>transactions that are in-kind and/or for cash, subject to the conditions described </span><span>below under </span><span>Creations</span><span> and Redemptions</span><span>. The Board has not adopted a policy of </span><span>monitoring for other frequent trading activity because shares of the Fund are listed for </span><span>trading on a national securities exchange.</span></div> <div><span>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed is open for </span><span>trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays </span><span>(or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, </span><span>Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor </span><span>Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is Cboe </span><span>BZX.</span></div> <div><span>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act generally restricts investments by investment </span><span>companies, including foreign and unregistered investment companies, in the securities </span><span>of other investment companies. For example, a registered investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquired Fund</span><span>”</span><span>), such as the Fund, may not knowingly sell or otherwise dispose of any </span><span>security issued by the Acquired Fund to any investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquiring </span><span>Fund</span><span>”</span><span>) or any company or companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund if, immediately </span><span>after such sale or disposition: (i) more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of </span><span>the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and any company or companies </span><span>controlled by the Acquiring Fund, or (ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding voting </span><span>stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and other investment </span><span>companies and companies controlled by them. However, registered investment </span><span>companies are permitted to invest in the Fund beyond the limits set forth in Section </span><span>12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in SEC rules. In order for a </span><span>registered investment company to invest in shares of the Fund beyond the limitations </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>19</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>of Section 12(d)(1) in reliance on Rule 12d1-4 under the 1940 Act, the registered </span><span>investment company must, among other things, enter into an agreement with the </span><span>Trust. Foreign investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund only up to the </span><span>limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to any applicable SEC no-action relief.</span></div> <div><span>Book Entry.</span><span> Shares of the Fund are held in book-entry form, which means that no </span><span>stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (</span><span>“</span><span>DTC</span><span>”</span><span>) or its nominee is </span><span>the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as shown on the records of </span><span>DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. </span><span>DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, </span><span>clearing corporations and other institutions that directly or indirectly maintain a </span><span>custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to </span><span>receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your </span><span>name, and you are not considered a registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise </span><span>any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its </span><span>participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other </span><span>securities that you hold in book-entry or </span><span>“</span><span>street name</span><span>”</span><span> form.</span></div> <div><span>Share Prices.</span><span> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market </span><span>generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as </span><span>the supply of and demand for ETF shares and shares of underlying securities held by </span><span>the Fund, economic conditions and other factors.</span></div> <div><span>Determination of Net Asset Value. </span><span>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined </span><span>once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the close of regular trading hours of </span><span>the New York Stock Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>NYSE</span><span>”</span><span>) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day </span><span>that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that </span><span>any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are </span><span>translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as </span><span>quoted by one or more data service providers. The NAV of the Fund is calculated by </span><span>dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the value of its total assets less </span><span>total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally </span><span>rounded to the nearest cent.</span></div> <div><span>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities held by the Fund is </span><span>determined pursuant to BFA’s valuation policies and procedures. BFA has been </span><span>designated by the Board as the valuation designee for the Fund pursuant to Rule 2a-5 </span><span>under the Investment Company Act.</span></div> <div><span>Equity securities and other equity instruments for which market quotations are readily </span><span>available are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the last </span><span>reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the last </span><span>traded price on the exchange or market on which the security or instrument is </span><span>primarily traded at the time of valuation. Shares of underlying open-end funds </span><span>(including money market funds) are valued at net asset value. Shares of underlying </span><span>exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs are valued at their most recent </span><span>closing price.</span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>20</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities and money market instruments is substantially </span><span>completed each day at various times prior to the close of regular trading hours of the </span><span>NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are </span><span>determined as of such times.</span></div> <div><span>When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be </span><span>unreliable, BFA will fair value the Fund’s investments in accordance with its policies </span><span>and procedures. BFA may conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is </span><span>unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its </span><span>lack of trading or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent </span><span>price quotations or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security </span><span>or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent </span><span>to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is </span><span>listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is </span><span>available. A </span><span>“</span><span>significant event</span><span>”</span><span> is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable </span><span>business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s assets or liabilities, that </span><span>the event is likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or </span><span>closing market price of one or more assets held by, or liabilities of, the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The </span><span>fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might </span><span>reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to </span><span>extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments </span><span>using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market </span><span>valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been </span><span>sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value </span><span>prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the </span><span>prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, </span><span>which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the </span><span>performance of the Underlying Index.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends and Distributions</span></div> <div><span>General Policies.</span><span> Dividends from net investment income, if any, generally are declared </span><span>and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, </span><span>if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make </span><span>distributions on a more frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to </span><span>declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or </span><span>advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company (</span><span>“</span><span>RIC</span><span>”</span><span>) or to avoid </span><span>imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are distributed on a </span><span>pro rata</span><span> </span><span>basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC </span><span>participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds </span><span>received from the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Dividend Reinvestment Service.</span><span> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the </span><span>Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment </span><span>Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend </span><span>distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>21</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers </span><span>may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this </span><span>service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains </span><span>will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in </span><span>the secondary market.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes.</span><span> As with any investment, you should consider how your investment in shares of </span><span>the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general </span><span>information, based on current law. You should consult your own tax professional about </span><span>the tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Unless your investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred</span><span> retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally </span><span>will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax </span><span>consequences when the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes on Distributions.</span><span> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income (other </span><span>than qualified dividend income), including</span><span> </span><span>distributions of income from securities </span><span>lending and distributions out of the Fund’s net short-term capital gains, if any, are </span><span>taxable to you as ordinary income. Distributions by the Fund of net long-term capital </span><span>gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain dividends) are </span><span>taxable to you as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the </span><span>Fund’s shares. Distributions by the Fund that qualify as qualified dividend income are </span><span>taxable to you at long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified </span><span>dividend income are generally eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for </span><span>non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain </span><span>threshold amounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is </span><span>imposed on </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income,</span><span>”</span><span> including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, </span><span>and net gain, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if </span><span>married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends will be qualified dividend income to you if they are attributable to qualified </span><span>dividend income received by the Fund. Generally, qualified dividend income includes </span><span>dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S. corporations, </span><span>provided that the Fund satisfies certain holding period requirements in respect of the </span><span>stock of such corporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. </span><span>Substitute dividends received by the Fund with respect to dividends paid on securities </span><span>lent out will not be qualified dividend income. For this purpose, a qualified non-U.S. </span><span>corporation means any non-U.S. corporation that is eligible for benefits under a </span><span>comprehensive income tax treaty with the U.S., which includes an exchange of </span><span>information program, or if the stock with respect to which the dividend was paid is </span><span>readily tradable on an established U.S. securities market. The term excludes a </span><span>corporation that is a passive foreign investment company.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends received by the Fund from a RIC generally are qualified dividend income only </span><span>to the extent such dividend distributions are made out of qualified dividend income </span><span>received by such RIC. Additionally, it is expected that dividends received by the Fund </span><span>from a REIT and distributed to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the </span><span>shareholder as ordinary income. However, for tax years beginning after December 31, </span><span>2017 and before January 1, 2026, the Fund may report dividends eligible for a 20% </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>22</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>“</span><span>qualified business income</span><span>”</span><span> deduction for non-corporate U.S. shareholders to the </span><span>extent the Fund’s income is derived from ordinary REIT dividends, reduced by allocable </span><span>Fund expenses.</span></div> <div><span>For a dividend to be treated as qualified dividend income, the dividend must be </span><span>received with respect to a share of stock held without being hedged by the Fund, and </span><span>with respect to a share of the Fund held without being hedged by you, for 61 days </span><span>during the 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days before the date on </span><span>which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of </span><span>certain preferred stock, 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before </span><span>such date.</span></div> <div><span>Fund distributions, to the extent attributable to dividends from U.S. corporations, will </span><span>be eligible for the dividends received deduction for Fund shareholders that are </span><span>corporations, subject to certain hedging and holding requirements.</span></div> <div><span>In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal income tax for the year when </span><span>they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on </span><span>December 31 of the prior year.</span></div> <div><span>If the Fund’s distributions exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits, all or </span><span>a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a </span><span>return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum </span><span>distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be </span><span>taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return </span><span>of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder’s </span><span>cost basis and result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those shares on </span><span>which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is </span><span>reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the shareholder </span><span>holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</span></div> <div><span>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if you are a non-U.S. </span><span>corporation (other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the </span><span>Fund’s ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital </span><span>gains) will generally be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate </span><span>applies, provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income </span><span>realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital </span><span>gains or upon the sale or other disposition of shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, </span><span>interest and other income items paid to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S.</span><span> investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the U.S. Internal </span><span>Revenue Service (</span><span>“</span><span>IRS</span><span>”</span><span>) information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account </span><span>holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information </span><span>regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial </span><span>institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will </span><span>provide the IRS information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer </span><span>identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders, comply with due </span><span>diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts, report to the </span><span>IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>23</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account </span><span>holders who fail to provide the required information, and determine certain other </span><span>information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable </span><span>intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local </span><span>revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may </span><span>need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each </span><span>substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless </span><span>certain exceptions apply.</span></div> <div><span>If your Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending arrangement, you </span><span>may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends paid while the shares are held by the </span><span>borrower as qualified dividend income.</span></div> <div><span>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup withholding at a 24% rate </span><span>will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer </span><span>identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes When Shares Are Sold.</span><span> Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale </span><span>of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been </span><span>held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund </span><span>shares held for one year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except </span><span>that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term</span><span> capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to </span><span>such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from </span><span>capital gain dividends, are included in </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income</span><span>”</span><span> for purposes of the </span><span>3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned above.</span></div> <div><span>The foregoing discussion summarizes some of the consequences under current U.S. </span><span>federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. </span><span>You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and sales of </span><span>shares. Consult your personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an </span><span>investment in shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</span></div> <div><span>Creations and Redemptions.</span><span> Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the </span><span>Fund are </span><span>“</span><span>created</span><span>”</span><span> at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in </span><span>block-size Creation Units or multiples thereof. Each </span><span>“</span><span>creator</span><span>”</span><span> or authorized participant </span><span>(an </span><span>“</span><span>Authorized Participant</span><span>”</span><span>) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's </span><span>Distributor, an affiliate of BFA. An Authorized Participant is a member or participant of </span><span>a clearing agency registered with the SEC, which has a written agreement with the </span><span>Fund or one of its service providers that allows such member or participant to place </span><span>orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units.</span></div> <div><span>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the Distributor and the Fund, </span><span>generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a </span><span>designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>creation basket</span><span>”</span><span>), and </span><span>an amount of cash (including any cash representing the value of substituted securities, </span><span>assets or other positions), if any, which together approximate the holdings of the Fund </span><span>in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. Similarly, shares can be </span><span>redeemed only in Creation Units, generally for a designated portfolio of securities, </span><span>assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>redemption basket</span><span>”</span><span>) held by the Fund and an amount of </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>24</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>cash (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted). The </span><span>Fund may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units partially or solely for cash. </span><span>Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by the Fund. </span><span>Creation and redemption baskets may differ and the Fund may accept </span><span>“</span><span>custom </span><span>baskets.</span><span>”</span><span> More information regarding custom baskets is contained in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> <div><span>The prices at which creations and redemptions occur are based on the next calculation </span><span>of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under </span><span>the authorized participant agreement.</span></div> <div><span>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation Units with the Fund. </span><span>Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or </span><span>for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>In the event of a system failure or other interruption, including disruptions at market </span><span>makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either </span><span>may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at </span><span>all, or the Fund may not be able to place or change orders.</span></div> <div><span>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind transactions, the Fund intends to comply </span><span>with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying </span><span>redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any </span><span>securities accepted for deposit and any securities used to satisfy redemption requests </span><span>will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities </span><span>Act of 1933, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1933 Act</span><span>”</span><span>). Further, an Authorized Participant that is </span><span>not a </span><span>“</span><span>qualified institutional buyer,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the </span><span>1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule </span><span>144A.</span></div> <div><span>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is either a member of the </span><span>Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a </span><span>DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to </span><span>creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations. Information about the </span><span>procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off </span><span>times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> <div><span>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing basis, at any point </span><span>during the life of the Fund a </span><span>“</span><span>distribution,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may </span><span>be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on </span><span>their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed </span><span>participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters </span><span>subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any </span><span>determination of whether one is an underwriter must take into account all the relevant </span><span>facts and circumstances of each particular case.</span></div> <div><span>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not </span><span>“</span><span>underwriters</span><span>”</span><span> but are </span><span>participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and </span><span>thus dealing with shares that are part of an </span><span>“</span><span>unsold allotment</span><span>”</span><span> within the meaning of </span><span>Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the 1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the </span><span>prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For </span><span>delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>25</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is available only with respect to transactions on a </span><span>national securities exchange.</span></div> <div><span>Householding.</span><span> Householding is an option available to certain Fund investors. </span><span>Householding is a method of delivery, based on the preference of the individual </span><span>investor, in which a single copy of certain shareholder documents can be delivered to </span><span>investors who share the same address, even if their accounts are registered under </span><span>different names. Please contact your broker-dealer if you are interested in enrolling in </span><span>householding and receiving a single copy of prospectuses and other shareholder </span><span>documents, or if you are currently enrolled in householding and wish to change your </span><span>householding status.</span></div> <div></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>26</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>Distribution</span></div> <div><span>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the Fund on an agency basis. </span><span>The Distributor does not maintain a secondary market in shares of the Fund. The </span><span>Distributor has no role in determining the policies of the Fund or the securities that are </span><span>purchased or sold by the Fund. The Distributor’s principal address is 1 University </span><span>Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</span></div> <div><span>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers, registered investment advisers, </span><span>banks or other intermediaries (together, </span><span>“</span><span>intermediaries</span><span>”</span><span>) related to marketing </span><span>activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the </span><span>development of technology platforms and reporting systems, data provision services, </span><span>or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their </span><span>customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may </span><span>be significant to the intermediary, are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments </span><span>are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or </span><span>indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type </span><span>are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may </span><span>make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or </span><span>the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other </span><span>financial incentives it is eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial </span><span>incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the </span><span>intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the </span><span>Fund or other iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding </span><span>these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. </span><span>Please contact your salesperson or </span><span>other investment professional for more information regarding any such </span><span>payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</span></div> <div></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>27</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>Financial Highlights</span></div> <div><span>The financial highlights table is intended to help investors understand the Fund’s </span><span>financial performance for the past five years.

Please </span><span>read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional </span><span>information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</span></div> <div><span>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund are listed for trading on </span><span>The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (</span><span>“</span><span>Nasdaq</span><span>”</span><span>). The market price for a share of the Fund </span><span>may be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</span></div> <div><span>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly-traded securities. The Fund is designed to </span><span>track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund </span><span>represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other </span><span>instruments intended to track a market index. Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which </span><span>can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based </span><span>on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at </span><span>NAV solely by Authorized Participants and only in aggregations of a specified number of </span><span>shares (</span><span>“</span><span>Creation Units</span><span>”</span><span>). Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are </span><span>listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market </span><span>prices that change throughout the day.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund invests in a particular segment of the securities markets and seeks to track </span><span>the performance of a securities index that is not representative of the market as a </span><span>whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. </span><span>Accordingly, an investment in the Fund should not constitute a complete investment </span><span>program.</span></div> <div><span>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of financial instruments, and is </span><span>not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The </span><span>performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, </span><span>including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency valuations, asset valuations, corporate </span><span>actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of </span><span>representative sampling or from legal restrictions (such as diversification </span><span>requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to </span><span>time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments </span><span>to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise determined by BFA, any such change or </span><span>adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on </span><span>a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, </span><span>the Underlying Index performance shown for periods prior to the effective date of any </span><span>such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect </span><span>such change or adjustment. </span></div> <div><span>“</span><span>Tracking error</span><span>”</span><span> is the divergence of the Fund's performance from that of the </span><span>Underlying Index. Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, </span><span>it can be expected to have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing </span><span>strategy. </span><span>“</span><span>Replication</span><span>”</span><span> is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all </span><span> </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>of the securities in its underlying index in approximately the same proportions as in the underlying index.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund may borrow as a temporary measure for extraordinary or emergency </span><span>purposes, including to meet redemptions or to facilitate the settlement of securities or </span><span>other transactions. The Fund does not intend to borrow money in order to leverage its </span><span>portfolio.</span></div> <div><span>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not insured or guaranteed by </span><span>the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or </span><span>any of its affiliates.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be changed without </span><span>shareholder approval.</span></div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Principal Risks</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The Fund is subject to various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of </span><span>which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability </span><span>to meet its investment objective. You could lose all or part of your investment in the </span><span>Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments. The order of the below risk </span><span>factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. The Fund </span><span>discloses its portfolio holdings daily at </span><span>www.iShares.com</span><span>.</span></div> <div><span>Asset Class Risk.</span><span> The securities</span><span> </span><span>and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that </span><span>track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries, groups of industries, </span><span>markets, market segments, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, </span><span>currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and </span><span>underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a </span><span>number of factors including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, </span><span>global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental </span><span>controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that </span><span>invest in different asset classes. Securities of companies that have positive or </span><span>favorable ESG characteristics may underperform other securities.</span></div> <div><span>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. </span><span>Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of </span><span>those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption </span><span>transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized </span><span>Participants on an agency basis (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, on behalf of other market participants). To the </span><span>extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with </span><span>creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized </span><span>Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares </span><span>may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading </span><span>halts or delisting.</span></div> <div><span>Calculation Methodology Risk.</span><span> The Underlying Index</span><span> </span><span> relies on various sources of </span><span>information to assess the criteria of securities included in the Underlying Index, </span><span>including information that may be based on assumptions and estimates. Neither the </span><span>Fund nor BFA can offer assurances that the Underlying Index's calculation </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>methodology or sources of information will provide an accurate assessment of </span><span>included securities.</span></div> <div><span>Concentration Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, </span><span>including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than </span><span>the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's investments are concentrated in </span><span>the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of </span><span>countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector, market segment or </span><span>asset class. The Fund may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of </span><span>those securities and/or other assets, may experience increased price volatility and </span><span>may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory </span><span>occurrences affecting those securities and/or other assets than a fund that does not </span><span>concentrate its investments.</span></div> <div><span>Cybersecurity Risk.</span><span> The Fund,</span><span> </span><span>Authorized Participants, service providers and the </span><span>relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information security and </span><span>related </span><span>“</span><span>cyber</span><span>”</span><span> risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of </span><span>cybersecurity risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, </span><span>which could result in material adverse consequences for such issuers and may cause </span><span>the Fund’s investment in such issuers to lose value. In general, cyber incidents can </span><span>result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are </span><span>not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, through </span><span>“</span><span>hacking</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive </span><span>information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyberattacks may also </span><span>be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as </span><span>causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, efforts to make network services </span><span>unavailable to intended users). Recently, geopolitical tensions may have increased the </span><span>scale and sophistication of deliberate attacks, particularly those from nation-states or </span><span>from entities with nation-state backing. </span></div> <div><span>Cybersecurity failures by, or breaches of, the systems of the Fund's adviser, distributor </span><span>and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index and benchmark </span><span>providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market </span><span>makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests </span><span>have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially </span><span>resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s ability to calculate its NAV, </span><span>disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of </span><span>erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund </span><span>or its service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other </span><span>laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other </span><span>compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyberattacks may </span><span>render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, </span><span>and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund inaccessible, inaccurate or </span><span>incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund in order to resolve or </span><span>prevent cyber incidents in the future. While the Fund has established business </span><span>continuity plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber </span><span>incidents, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the </span><span>possibility that certain risks have not been identified, that prevention and remediation </span><span> </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>efforts will not be successful or that cyberattacks will go undetected. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by service </span><span>providers to the Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, market </span><span>makers or Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively </span><span>impacted as a result.</span></div> <div><span>Equity Securities Risk.</span><span> The Fund invests in equity securities, which are subject to </span><span>changes in value that may be attributable to market perception of a particular issuer or </span><span>to general stock market fluctuations that affect all issuers. Investments in equity </span><span>securities may be more volatile than investments in other asset classes. The </span><span>Underlying Index is composed of common stocks, which generally subject</span><span> </span><span>their holders </span><span>to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common </span><span>stockholders' claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt </span><span>securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</span></div> <div><span>ESG Risk. </span><span>To the extent that the Underlying Index uses criteria related to the ESG </span><span>characteristics of issuers, this may limit the types and number of investment </span><span>opportunities available to the Fund and, as a result, the Fund may underperform other </span><span>funds whose underlying index does not use ESG criteria. The Underlying Index’s use of </span><span>ESG criteria may result in the Fund investing in, or allocating greater weight to, </span><span>securities or market sectors that underperform the market as a whole or underperform </span><span>other funds that use ESG criteria. In addition, the use of representative sampling may </span><span>result in divergence of the Fund's overall ESG characteristics or ESG risk from those of </span><span>the Underlying Index.</span></div> <div><span>The Index Provider evaluates securities for inclusion and/or weighting in the </span><span>Underlying Index based on ESG criteria and data provided by the Index Provider or </span><span>third parties. The Index Provider’s evaluation of securities’ ESG characteristics depends </span><span>on these criteria and data, which may vary by index provider, and no assurance can be </span><span>given that they will be complete, accurate or current. In addition, the Index Provider </span><span>may evaluate security-level ESG data (including ratings) and, if applicable, ESG </span><span>objectives or constraints that are relevant to the Underlying Index only at index reviews </span><span>or rebalances. Securities included in the Underlying Index may cease to meet the </span><span>relevant ESG criteria but may nevertheless remain in the Underlying Index and the </span><span>Fund until the next review or rebalance by the Index Provider. As a result, certain </span><span>securities in the Underlying Index, or the Underlying Index as a whole, may not meet </span><span>the relevant ESG objectives or constraints at all times. If the ESG assessment of a </span><span>security in the Underlying Index or the Fund changes, neither the Fund nor BFA accepts </span><span>any liability in relation to such change. BFA does not monitor securities in the </span><span>Underlying Index with respect to ESG objectives or constraints applied by the Index </span><span>Provider and is not responsible for changes to the ESG assessment of a security in the </span><span>Underlying Index between rebalances. In addition, BFA does not assess the validity of </span><span>the Index Provider’s evaluation of the ESG characteristics of securities or the criteria </span><span>and data used in such evaluation.</span></div> <div><span>The impacts of risks related to ESG investing are likely to change over time, and new </span><span>ESG risks may be identified as further data and information regarding ESG factors and </span><span> </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>impacts become available. In addition, methodologies for ESG investing continue to develop, and the ESG methodology applied by the Index Provider may change over </span><span>time.</span><br/><br/><span>Index-Related Risk.</span><span> The Fund seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to </span><span>the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as </span><span>published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any </span><span>agents that may act on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that </span><span>the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the </span><span>Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to </span><span>achieve, neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any </span><span>liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or </span><span>its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in line with </span><span>the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to </span><span>manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider </span><span>to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee against the Index Provider’s or </span><span>any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the </span><span>data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not </span><span>be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, </span><span>particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or </span><span>managers. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its </span><span>shareholders. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains </span><span>incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and </span><span>would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Shareholders </span><span>should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund </span><span>and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will </span><span>be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>Unusual market conditions or other unforeseen circumstances (such as natural </span><span>disasters, political unrest or war) may impact the Index Provider or a third-party data </span><span>provider, and could cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance to the </span><span>Underlying Index. This could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or </span><span>expected composition. The postponement of a scheduled rebalance could mean that </span><span>constituents of the Underlying Index that would otherwise be removed at rebalance </span><span>due to changes in market capitalizations, issuer credit ratings, or other reasons may </span><span>remain, causing the performance and constituents of the Underlying Index to vary from </span><span>those expected under normal conditions. Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index </span><span>Provider or its agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying </span><span>Index due to reaching certain weighting constraints, unusual market conditions or </span><span>corporate events or, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index </span><span>constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances </span><span>its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the </span><span>Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such </span><span>portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Therefore, </span><span>errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the Index Provider or its agents </span><span>to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> </div> </div> <div> <div><span>Infectious Illness Risk. </span><span>A widespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as the </span><span>COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect the economies of many nations and the </span><span>global economy and may impact individual issuers and capital markets in ways that </span><span>cannot be foreseen.</span><br/><br/><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in travel restrictions, closed international </span><span>borders, disruption of healthcare services, prolonged quarantines, cancellations, </span><span>supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, temporary and permanent closures </span><span>of businesses, layoffs, defaults and other significant economic, social and political </span><span>impacts, as well as general concern and uncertainty.</span></div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in extreme volatility, severe losses, credit </span><span>deterioration of issuers, and disruptions in markets, which could adversely impact the </span><span>Fund and its investments, including impairing any hedging activity.</span></div> <div><span>Certain local markets may be subject to closures. Any suspension of trading in markets </span><span>in which the Fund invests will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and will </span><span>impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities in such markets.</span><span> </span><span>Market or </span><span>economic disruptions could result in elevated tracking error and increased premiums </span><span>or discounts to the Fund's NAV. Additionally, an outbreak could impair the operations </span><span>of the Fund’s service providers, including BFA, which could adversely impact the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Governmental and quasi-governmental authorities and regulators throughout the world </span><span>may respond to an outbreak and any resulting economic disruptions with a variety of </span><span>fiscal and monetary policy changes, including direct capital infusions into companies </span><span>and other issuers, new monetary policy tools, and changes in interest rates. A reversal </span><span>of these policies, or the ineffectiveness of such policies, is likely to increase market </span><span>volatility, which could adversely affect the Fund’s investments.</span></div> <div><span>An outbreak may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social and economic risks in </span><span>certain countries or globally, which could adversely affect the Fund and its investments </span><span>and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Despite the development of vaccines, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its </span><span>effects cannot be predicted with certainty.</span></div> <div><span>Issuer Risk. </span><span>The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual </span><span>securities to which the Fund has exposure. Any issuer of these securities may perform </span><span>poorly, causing the value of its securities to decline. Poor performance may be caused </span><span>by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, </span><span>expiration of patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages, </span><span>corporate restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or </span><span>other factors. Issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to </span><span>reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock prices to decline. An </span><span>issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in </span><span>which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</span></div> <div><span>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.</span><span> Large-capitalization companies may be less </span><span>able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. </span><span>Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more limited </span><span>growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different </span> <div></div> <div> <div><span>6</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the </span><span>overall performance of the broader securities markets.</span><br/><br/><span>Management Risk. </span><span>Because BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, </span><span>the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities not </span><span>included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that BFA’s </span><span>investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of </span><span>constraints, may not produce the intended results.</span></div> <div><span>Market Risk.</span><span> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market </span><span>movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The </span><span>value of a security, asset, or other instrument may decline due to changes in general </span><span>market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the </span><span>issuer of the security</span><span> </span><span>or other asset, or factors that affect a particular issuer or issuers, </span><span> </span><span>exchange or exchanges, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of </span><span>industries, sector or asset class. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of </span><span>terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, or </span><span>other events could have a significant impact on the Fund</span><span> </span><span>and its investments and could </span><span>result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. During a general market </span><span>downturn, multiple asset classes may be negatively affected. Changes in market </span><span>conditions and interest rates generally do not have the same impact on all types of </span><span>securities and instruments.</span></div> <div><span>Market Trading Risk.</span></div> <div><span>Absence of Active Market.</span><span> Although shares of the Fund are listed for trading on one or </span><span>more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for </span><span>such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized </span><span>Participants.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Secondary Listings. </span><span>The Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S.</span><span> stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary </span><span>listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made available to non-U.S. investors </span><span>through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There </span><span>can be no assurance that the Fund’s shares will continue to trade on any such stock </span><span>exchange or in any market or that the Fund’s shares will continue to meet the </span><span>requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's shares </span><span>may be less actively traded in certain markets than in others, and investors are subject </span><span>to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of the market where they </span><span>or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to </span><span>investors who trade Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market </span><span>hours may not be available to investors who trade in other markets, which may result </span><span>in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</span></div> <div><span>Secondary Market Trading Risk.</span><span> Shares of the Fund may trade in the secondary market </span><span>at times when the Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such </span><span>times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more significant premiums or </span><span>discounts than might be experienced at times when the Fund accepts purchase and </span><span>redemption orders.</span></div> <div><span></span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>7</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>Secondary market trading in Fund shares may be halted by a stock exchange because </span><span>of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund shares on a </span><span>stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by </span><span>extraordinary market volatility pursuant to </span><span>“</span><span>circuit breaker</span><span>”</span><span> rules on the stock </span><span>exchange or market.</span><br/><br/><span>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed on a stock exchange, may </span><span>be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price </span><span>decreases associated with being sold short. In addition, trading activity in derivative </span><span>products based on the Fund may lead to increased trading volume and volatility in the </span><span>secondary market for the shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV.</span><span> Shares of the Fund trade on </span><span>stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of </span><span>the Fund is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in </span><span>the market value of the Fund’s holdings. The trading price of the Fund's shares </span><span>fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours</span><span> </span><span>based on both market supply of and </span><span>demand for Fund shares and the underlying value of the Fund's portfolio holdings or </span><span>NAV. As a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s shares may deviate significantly from </span><span>NAV during periods of market volatility. </span><span>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, </span><span>MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO </span><span>NAV</span><span>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at </span><span>NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund are not </span><span>likely to be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, </span><span>which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, </span><span>their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely </span><span>that the Fund’s shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the </span><span>Fund’s next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly with </span><span>the Fund's NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other </span><span>factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at </span><span>market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during </span><span>periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the </span><span>Fund that differ significantly from its NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing to </span><span>create or redeem Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for such shares or </span><span>its underlying investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s shares trading at a </span><span>premium or discount to NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.</span><span> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange </span><span>involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or </span><span>selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage </span><span>commission and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread</span><span>”</span><span>; </span><span>that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>bid</span><span>”</span><span> price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>ask</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>price).</span><span> </span><span>The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume </span><span>and market liquidity and wider if the Fund has less trading volume and market liquidity. </span><span>In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be </span><span>regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>of the costs inherent in buying or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract </span><span>significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be </span><span>advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a </span><span>brokerage account.</span><br/><br/><span>Non-Diversification Risk.</span><span> The Fund is classified as </span><span>“</span><span>non-diversified.</span><span>”</span><span> This means that, </span><span>compared with other funds that are classified as </span><span>“</span><span>diversified,</span><span>”</span><span> the Fund may invest a </span><span>greater percentage of its assets in securities issued by or representing a small number </span><span>of issuers. As a result, the Fund may be more susceptible to the risks associated with </span><span>these particular issuers or to a single economic, political or regulatory occurrence </span><span>affecting these issuers.</span></div> <div><span>Operational Risk.</span><span> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of </span><span>factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication </span><span>errors, errors of the Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third parties, </span><span>failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA </span><span>seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, </span><span>these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address </span><span>significant operational risks.</span></div> <div><span>Passive Investment Risk.</span><span> The Fund is not actively managed and may be affected by a </span><span>general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests </span><span>in securities included in, or representative of, the Underlying Index, regardless of their </span><span>investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in </span><span>defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the U.S.</span><span> A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade </span><span>regulations, inflation and/or an economic recession in the U.S. may have a material </span><span>adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed on U.S. exchanges. </span><span>Proposed and adopted policy and legislative changes in the U.S. are changing many </span><span>aspects of financial, commercial, public health, environmental, and other regulation </span><span>and may have a significant effect on U.S. markets generally, as well as on the value of </span><span>certain securities. Governmental agencies project that the U.S. will continue to </span><span>maintain elevated public debt levels for the foreseeable future. Although elevated debt </span><span>levels do not necessarily indicate or cause economic problems, elevated public debt </span><span>service costs may constrain future economic growth.</span></div> <div><span>The U.S. has developed increasingly strained relations with a number of foreign </span><span>countries. If relations with certain countries deteriorate, it could adversely affect U.S. </span><span>issuers as well as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also </span><span>experienced increased internal unrest and discord, as well as significant challenges in </span><span>managing and containing the outbreak of COVID-19. If these trends were to continue, </span><span>it may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the issuers in which the Fund </span><span>invests.</span></div> <div><span>Securities Lending Risk.</span><span> The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities </span><span>lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the </span><span>loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund </span><span>could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for </span><span>loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>9</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund. </span><span>BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>BTC</span><span>”</span><span>), the</span><span> </span><span>Fund's securities lending </span><span>agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments for </span><span>dividends when managing the</span><span> </span><span>Fund's securities lending program.</span><br/><br/><span>Technology Sector Risk.</span><span> Technology companies, including information technology </span><span>companies,</span><span> </span><span>face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may </span><span>have an adverse effect on a company’s profit margins. Technology companies may </span><span>have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of </span><span>technology companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological </span><span>developments, frequent new product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth </span><span>rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Companies in the </span><span>technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and other intellectual property </span><span>rights. A technology company’s loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect </span><span>the company’s profitability. Companies in the technology sector are facing increased </span><span>government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or </span><span>regulatory action. The technology sector may also be adversely affected by changes or </span><span>trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced or characterized by </span><span>unpredictable factors.</span></div> <div><span>Tracking Error Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be subject to </span><span>“</span><span>tracking error,</span><span>”</span><span> which is the </span><span>divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error </span><span>may occur because of differences between the securities and other instruments held in </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences, </span><span>transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, </span><span>differences in timing of the accrual or the valuation of dividends or interest received by </span><span>the Fund or distributions paid to the Fund’s shareholders, the requirements to maintain </span><span>pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the </span><span>distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, changes </span><span>to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or </span><span>existing regulatory requirements, among other reasons. This risk may be heightened </span><span>during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. </span><span>Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the </span><span>Underlying Index does not.</span></div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</span></div> <div><span>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated with its investments </span><span>and investment strategies. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the </span><span>significance of any particular risk factor.</span></div> <div><span>Close-Out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.</span><span> Regulations adopted by global </span><span>prudential regulators require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global </span><span>systemically important banking organizations to include contractual restrictions on </span><span>close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. </span><span>Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards </span><span>and other derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending </span><span>agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial </span><span>contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>proceedings and also prohibit the Fund from exercising default rights due to a </span><span>receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. These </span><span>requirements may increase credit risk and other risks to the Fund.</span><br/><br/><span>Consumer Discretionary Sector Risk.</span><span> The success of consumer product </span><span>manufacturers and retailers is tied closely to the performance of domestic and </span><span>international economies, interest rates, exchange rates, supply chains, competition, </span><span>consumer confidence, changes in demographics and consumer preferences. </span><span>Companies in the consumer discretionary sector depend heavily on disposable </span><span>household income and consumer spending, and may be strongly affected by social </span><span>trends and marketing campaigns. These companies may be subject to severe </span><span>competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</span></div> <div><span>Consumer Staples Sector Risk.</span><span> Companies in the consumer staples sector may be </span><span>affected by the regulation of various product components and production methods, </span><span>marketing campaigns and changes in the global economy, consumer spending and </span><span>consumer demand. Companies in the consumer staples sector may also be adversely </span><span>affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by </span><span>unpredictable factors. These companies may be subject to severe competition, which </span><span>may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</span></div> <div><span>Financials Sector Risk.</span><span> Companies in the financials sector</span><span> </span><span>of an economy are subject </span><span>to extensive governmental regulation and intervention, which may adversely affect the </span><span>scope of their activities, the prices they can charge, the amount of capital they must </span><span>maintain and, potentially, their size. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a </span><span>company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by </span><span>applicable law. Governmental regulation may change frequently and may have </span><span>significant adverse consequences for companies in the financials sector, including </span><span>effects not intended by such regulation. Increased risk taking by banks may also result </span><span>in greater overall risk in the U.S. and global financials sector. The impact of changes in </span><span>capital requirements, or recent or future regulation in various countries, on any </span><span>individual financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be </span><span>predicted. </span></div> <div><span>Certain risks may impact the value of investments in the financials sector more </span><span>severely than those of investments outside this sector, including the risks associated </span><span>with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage. Companies in the </span><span>financials sector are exposed directly to the credit risk of their borrowers and </span><span>counterparties, who may be leveraged to an unknown degree, including through swaps </span><span>and other derivatives products. Financial services companies may have significant </span><span>exposure to the same borrowers and counterparties, with the result that a borrower’s </span><span>or counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations to one company may affect other </span><span>companies with exposure to the same borrower or counterparty. This </span><span>interconnectedness of risk may result in significant negative impacts to companies </span><span>with direct exposure to the defaulting counterparty as well as adverse cascading </span><span>effects in the markets and the financials sector generally. Companies in the financials </span><span>sector may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and loan losses, </span><span>decreases in the availability of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades </span><span>and adverse conditions in other related markets. Insurance companies, in particular, </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>may be subject to severe price competition and/or rate regulation, which may have an </span><span>adverse impact on their profitability. The financials sector is particularly sensitive to </span><span>fluctuations in interest rates. The financials sector is also a target for cyberattacks, and </span><span>may experience technology malfunctions and disruptions. Cybersecurity incidents and </span><span>technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector </span><span>and have reportedly caused losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively </span><span>impact the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Healthcare Sector Risk.</span><span> The profitability of companies in the healthcare sector may </span><span>be adversely affected by the following factors, among others: extensive government </span><span>regulations, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising </span><span>costs of medical products and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on </span><span>outpatient services, changes in the demand for medical products and services, a </span><span>limited number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other </span><span>market developments. Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent on patent </span><span>protection. The expiration of a company’s patents may adversely affect that company’s </span><span>profitability. Many healthcare companies are subject to extensive litigation based on </span><span>product liability and similar claims. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive </span><span>forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may result in price </span><span>discounting. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 allows for the negotiation of </span><span>prescription drug prices on behalf of Medicare recipients, which may result in reduced </span><span>prescription prices. This could reduce some healthcare companies’ overall profitability. </span><span>Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. </span><span>The process of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, and such efforts </span><span>ultimately may be unsuccessful. Companies in the healthcare sector may be thinly </span><span>capitalized and may be susceptible to product obsolescence. In addition, a number of </span><span>legislative proposals concerning healthcare have been considered by the U.S. </span><span>Congress in recent years. It is unclear what proposals will ultimately be enacted, if any, </span><span>and what effect they may have on companies in the healthcare sector.</span></div> <div><span>Illiquid Investments Risk. </span><span>The Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, </span><span>immediately after the acquisition, the Fund would have invested more than 15% of its </span><span>net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the </span><span>Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in </span><span>seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the </span><span>investment. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, </span><span>particularly during periods of market turmoil. There can be no assurance that a security </span><span>or instrument that is deemed to be liquid when purchased will continue to be liquid for </span><span>as long as it is held by the Fund, and any security or instrument held by the Fund may </span><span>be deemed an illiquid investment pursuant to the Fund’s liquidity risk management </span><span>program. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid investments may </span><span>reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be unable to transact at </span><span>advantageous times or prices. An investment may be illiquid due to, among other </span><span>things, the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a </span><span>market in securities or instruments</span><span> </span><span>or the lack of an active market for such securities </span><span>or instruments. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or instruments with </span><span>substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have increased exposure to </span><span>the risks associated with illiquid investments. Illiquid investments may be harder to </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>12</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>value, especially in changing markets. Although the Fund primarily seeks to redeem </span><span>shares of the Fund on an in-kind basis, if the Fund is forced to sell underlying </span><span>investments at reduced prices or under unfavorable conditions to meet redemption </span><span>requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. This may be magnified in </span><span>a rising interest rate environment or other circumstances where redemptions from the </span><span>Fund may be greater than normal. Other market participants may be attempting to </span><span>liquidate holdings at the same time as the Fund, causing increased supply of the Fund’s </span><span>underlying investments in the market and contributing to illiquid investments risk and </span><span>downward pricing pressure. In addition, if the Fund is limited in its ability to sell illiquid </span><span>investments during periods when shareholders are redeeming their shares, the Fund </span><span>will need to sell liquid securities to meet redemption requests and illiquid securities will </span><span>become a larger portion of the Fund’s holdings. During periods of market volatility, </span><span>liquidity in the market for the Fund’s shares may be impacted by the liquidity in the </span><span>market for the underlying securities or instruments held by the Fund, which could lead </span><span>to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Industrials Sector Risk.</span><span> The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials </span><span>sector may be adversely affected by supply and demand changes related to their </span><span>specific products or services and industrials sector products in general. The products </span><span>of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological </span><span>developments and frequent new product introduction. Global events, trade disputes </span><span>and changes in government regulations, economic conditions and exchange rates may </span><span>adversely affect the performance of companies in the industrials sector. While the Fund </span><span>seeks to invest in companies with positive or favorable environmental and social </span><span>characteristics, companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by </span><span>liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. The industrials sector </span><span>may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may </span><span>be influenced by unpredictable factors. Companies in the industrials sector, </span><span>particularly aerospace and defense companies, may also be adversely affected by </span><span>government spending policies because companies in this sector tend to rely to a </span><span>significant extent on government demand for their products and services.</span></div> <div><span>Large Shareholder and Large-Scale Redemption Risk.</span><span> Certain shareholders, </span><span>including an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an </span><span>affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, a market maker, or another entity, may from time to time </span><span>own or manage a substantial amount of Fund shares or may invest in the Fund and </span><span>hold their investment for a limited period of time. These shareholders may also pledge </span><span>or loan Fund shares (to secure financing or otherwise), which may result in the shares </span><span>becoming concentrated in another party. There can be no assurance that any large </span><span>shareholder or large group of shareholders would not redeem their investment or that </span><span>the size of the Fund would be maintained. Redemptions of a large number of Fund </span><span>shares by these shareholders may adversely affect the Fund’s liquidity and net assets. </span><span>To the extent the Fund permits redemptions in cash, these redemptions may force the </span><span>Fund to sell portfolio securities when it might not otherwise do so, which may </span><span>negatively impact the Fund’s NAV, have a material effect on the market price of the </span><span>Shares and increase the Fund’s brokerage costs and/or accelerate the realization of </span><span>taxable income and/or gains and cause the Fund to make taxable distributions to its </span><span>shareholders earlier than the Fund otherwise would have. In addition, under certain </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>13</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>circumstances, non-redeeming shareholders may be treated as receiving a </span><span>disproportionately large taxable distribution during or with respect to such tax year. </span><span>The Fund also may be required to sell its more liquid Fund investments to meet a large </span><span>redemption, in which case the Fund’s remaining assets may be less liquid, more </span><span>volatile, and more difficult to price. To the extent these large shareholders transact in </span><span>shares on the secondary market, such transactions may account for a large </span><span>percentage of the trading volume for the shares of the Fund and may, therefore, have a </span><span>material upward or downward effect on the market price of the Fund shares. In </span><span>addition, large purchases of Fund shares may adversely affect the Fund’s performance </span><span>to the extent that the Fund is delayed in investing new cash and is required to maintain </span><span>a larger cash position than it ordinarily would, diluting its investment returns.</span></div> <div><span>Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk. </span><span>Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies </span><span>may be more volatile than those of large-capitalization companies and, therefore, the </span><span>Fund’s share price may be more volatile than those of funds that invest a larger </span><span>percentage of their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock </span><span>prices of mid-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization</span><span> companies to adverse business or economic developments, and the </span><span>stocks of mid-capitalization companies may be less liquid than those of large-capitalization</span><span> companies, making it difficult for the Fund to buy and sell shares of mid-capitalization</span><span> companies. In addition, mid-capitalization companies generally have less </span><span>diverse product lines than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to </span><span>adverse developments related to their products.</span></div> <div><span>Real Estate Investment Risk.</span><span> Companies that invest in real estate (</span><span>“</span><span>Real Estate </span><span>Companies</span><span>”</span><span>), such as real estate investment trusts (</span><span>“</span><span>REITs</span><span>”</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>real estate holding and </span><span>operating companies, and real estate management or development companies, expose </span><span>investors to the risks of owning real estate directly, as well as to risks that relate </span><span>specifically to the way in which Real Estate Companies are organized and operated. </span><span>Real estate is highly sensitive to general and local economic conditions and </span><span>developments and is characterized by intense competition and periodic overbuilding. </span><span>Many Real Estate Companies, including REITs,</span><span> </span><span>utilize leverage (and some may be highly </span><span>leveraged), which increases investment risk and the risk normally associated with debt </span><span>financing, and could potentially increase the Fund’s losses. Rising interest rates could </span><span>result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could negatively </span><span>affect a Real Estate Company's ability to meet its payment obligations or its financing </span><span>activityand could decrease the market prices for REITs and for properties held by such </span><span>REITs. The U.S. residential and commercial real estate markets may, in the future, </span><span>experience and have, in the past, experienced a decline in value, with certain regions </span><span>experiencing significant losses in property values. Exposure to such real estate may </span><span>adversely affect Fund performance. In addition, to the extent a Real Estate Company </span><span>has its own expenses, the Fund (and indirectly, its shareholders) will bear its </span><span>proportionate share of such expenses.</span></div> <div><span>Concentration Risk</span><span>. Real Estate Companies may own a limited number of properties </span><span>and concentrate their investments in a particular geographic region, industry or </span><span>property type. Economic downturns affecting a particular region, industry or property </span><span>type may lead to a high volume of defaults within a short period.</span></div> <div></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>Equity REITs Risk</span><span>. Certain REITs may make direct investments in real estate. These </span><span>REITs are often referred to as </span><span>“</span><span>Equity REITs.</span><span>”</span><span> Equity REITs invest primarily in real </span><span>properties and may earn rental income from leasing those properties. Equity REITs may </span><span>also realize gains or losses from the sale of properties. Equity REITs will be affected by </span><span>conditions in the real estate rental market and by changes in the value of the </span><span>properties they own. A decline in rental income may occur because of extended </span><span>vacancies, limitations on rents, the failure to collect rents, increased competition from </span><span>other properties or poor management. Equity REITs also can be affected by rising </span><span>interest rates. Rising interest rates may cause investors to demand a high annual yield </span><span>from future distributions that, in turn, could decrease the market prices for such REITs </span><span>and for the properties held by such REITs. In addition, rising interest rates also increase </span><span>the costs of obtaining financing for real estate projects. Because many real estate </span><span>projects are dependent upon receiving financing, this could cause the value of the </span><span>Equity REITs in which the Fund invests to decline.</span></div> <div><span>Illiquidity Risk</span><span>. Investing in Real Estate Companies may involve risks similar to those </span><span>associated with investing in small-capitalization companies. Real Estate Company </span><span>securities may be volatile. There may be less trading in Real Estate Company shares, </span><span>which means that purchase and sale transactions in those shares could have a </span><span>magnified impact on share price, resulting in abrupt or erratic price fluctuations. In </span><span>addition, real estate is relatively illiquid and, therefore, a Real Estate Company may </span><span>have a limited ability to vary or liquidate its investments in properties in response to </span><span>changes in economic or other conditions.</span></div> <div><span>Interest Rate Risk</span><span>. Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real </span><span>Estate Companies, which could negatively affect a Real Estate Company’s ability to </span><span>meet its payment obligations. Declining interest rates could result in increased </span><span>prepayment on loans and require redeployment of capital in less desirable </span><span>investments.</span></div> <div><span>Leverage Risk</span><span>. Real Estate Companies may use leverage (and some may be highly </span><span>leveraged), which increases investment risk and the risks normally associated with </span><span>debt financing and could adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s operations and </span><span>market value in periods of rising interest rates. Financial covenants related to a Real </span><span>Estate Company’s leveraging may affect the ability of the Real Estate Company to </span><span>operate effectively. In addition, investments may be subject to defaults by borrowers </span><span>and tenants. Leveraging may also increase repayment risk.</span></div> <div><span>Loan Foreclosure Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may foreclose on loans that the Real </span><span>Estate Company originated and/or acquired. Foreclosure may generate negative </span><span>publicity for the underlying property that affects its market value. In addition to the </span><span>length and expense of such proceedings, the validity of the terms of the applicable </span><span>loan may not be recognized in foreclosure proceedings.</span></div> <div><span>Operational Risk</span><span>. Real Estate Companies are dependent upon management skills and </span><span>may have limited financial resources. Real Estate Companies are generally not </span><span>diversified and may be subject to heavy cash flow dependency, default by borrowers </span><span>and self-liquidation. In addition, transactions between Real Estate Companies and their </span><span>affiliates may be subject to conflicts of interest, which may adversely affect a Real </span><span>Estate Company’s shareholders. A Real Estate Company may also have joint ventures</span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>15</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span> </span><span>in certain of its properties and, consequently, its ability to control decisions relating to </span><span>such properties may be limited.</span><br/><br/><span>Property Risk</span><span>. Real Estate Companies may be subject to risks relating to functional </span><span>obsolescence or reduced desirability of properties; extended vacancies due to </span><span>economic conditions and tenant bankruptcies; property damage due to events such as </span><span>earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, rodent, insect or disease infestations and terrorist </span><span>acts; eminent domain seizures; and casualty or condemnation losses. Real estate </span><span>income and values also may be greatly affected by demographic trends, such as </span><span>population shifts, changing tastes and values, increasing vacancies or declining rents </span><span>resulting from legal, cultural, technological, global or local economic developments and </span><span>changes in tax law.</span></div> <div><span>Regulatory Risk</span><span>. Real estate income and values may be adversely affected by </span><span>applicable domestic and foreign laws (including tax laws). Government actions, such as </span><span>tax increases, zoning law changes, mandated closures or other commercial </span><span>restrictions, reduced funding for schools, parks, garbage collection and other public </span><span>services or environmental regulations also may have a major impact on real estate </span><span>income and values.</span></div> <div><span>Repayment Risk.</span><span> The prices of Real Estate Company securities may drop because of </span><span>the failure of borrowers to repay their loans, poor management, or the inability to </span><span>obtain financing either on favorable terms or at all. If the properties in which Real </span><span>Estate Companies invest do not generate sufficient income to meet operating </span><span>expenses, including, where applicable, debt service, ground lease payments, tenant </span><span>improvements, third-party leasing commissions and other capital expenditures, the </span><span>income and ability of the Real Estate Companies to make payments of interest and </span><span>principal on their loans will be adversely affected.</span></div> <div><span>U.S. Tax Risk. </span><span>Certain U.S. Real Estate Companies are subject to special U.S. federal </span><span>tax requirements. A REIT that fails to comply with such tax requirements may be </span><span>subject to U.S. federal income taxation, which may affect the value of the REIT and the </span><span>characterization of the REIT’s distributions. The U.S. federal tax requirement that a </span><span>REIT distributes substantially all of its net income to its shareholders may result in the </span><span>REIT having insufficient capital for future expenditures. A REIT that successfully </span><span>maintains its qualification may still become subject to U.S. federal, state and local </span><span>taxes, including excise, penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage recording, and transfer </span><span>taxes, both directly and indirectly through its subsidiaries.</span></div> <div><span>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.</span><span> If certain aggregate and/or fund-level ownership </span><span>thresholds are reached through transactions undertaken by BFA, its affiliates or the </span><span>Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions or actions by an issuer or regulator, the </span><span>ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to purchase or </span><span>dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be </span><span>restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make </span><span>investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant threshold limits, and </span><span>such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio holdings</span><span> </span><span>compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This </span><span>may increase the risk of the Fund being underinvested to the Underlying Index and </span><span>increase the risk of tracking error.</span></div> <div></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>16</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>For example, in certain circumstances where the Fund invests in securities issued by </span><span>companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or </span><span>international markets, is subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or </span><span>invests in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits on the </span><span>aggregate and/or fund-level amount invested or voted by BFA and its affiliates for their </span><span>proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Fund) that may not be </span><span>exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if </span><span>exceeded, may cause BFA and its affiliates, the Fund or other client accounts to suffer </span><span>disadvantages or business restrictions.</span></div> <div><span>Portfolio Holdings Information</span></div> <div><span>A description of the Trust's policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Fund's Statement of Additional </span><span>Information (</span><span>“</span><span>SAI</span><span>”</span><span>).

BFA and its Affiliates provide investment </span><span>management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that may </span><span>follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA and its Affiliates are </span><span>involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management </span><span>activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in which their </span><span>interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or </span><span>one or more Affiliates act, or may act, as an investor, research provider, investment </span><span>manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, </span><span>adviser, trader, lender,</span><span> </span><span>index provider, agent and/or principal, and have other direct </span><span>and indirect interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>18</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>instruments in which the Fund may directly or indirectly invest. The Fund may invest in </span><span>securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate </span><span>has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The Fund may also invest </span><span>in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which an Affiliate provides and is </span><span>compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of </span><span>such issuances. The Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in other </span><span>transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate provides or may in the future </span><span>provide research coverage. An Affiliate may have business relationships with, and </span><span>purchase or distribute or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants </span><span>or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, </span><span>and may receive compensation for such services. BFA or one or more Affiliates may </span><span>engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment </span><span>objectives similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for </span><span>transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the </span><span>Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end</span><span> investment companies (which may include investment companies that are </span><span>affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment </span><span>Company Act of 1940, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1940 Act</span><span>”</span><span>)). The trading activities of BFA and </span><span>these Affiliates are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly </span><span>by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate having positions in certain securities </span><span>that are senior or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities </span><span>that are owned by the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to share any investment </span><span>opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with </span><span>the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's </span><span>investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an Affiliate and of other </span><span>accounts managed by BlackRock or an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could </span><span>sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts </span><span>achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The opposite result is </span><span>also possible.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, the Fund may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an </span><span>Affiliate or</span><span> </span><span>its or their directors, officers, employees or clients have an adverse interest. </span><span>Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or managed by BFA or its </span><span>Affiliates may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or</span><span> </span><span>by </span><span>BFA or its Affiliates or their directors, officers or employees may have the effect of </span><span>diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund's activities may be limited because of regulatory restrictions applicable to </span><span>BFA or one or more Affiliates and/or their internal policies designed to comply with </span><span>such restrictions.</span></div> <div><span>Under a securities lending program approved by the Board, the Fund has retained BTC, </span><span>an Affiliate of BFA, to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent </span><span>that the Fund participates in the securities lending program.

Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, </span><span>shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a </span><span>Creation Unit.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange for trading during the </span><span>trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of </span><span>other publicly-traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment </span><span>for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or otherwise in the secondary </span><span>market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol </span><span>“</span><span>USXF.</span><span>”</span></div> <div><span>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary market involves two </span><span>types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling </span><span>shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other </span><span>charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may be a significant </span><span>proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In </span><span>addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread,</span><span>”</span><span> that is, any difference between the </span><span>bid price and the ask price.

The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity or illiquidity </span><span>of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller </span><span>funds or in instances of significant volatility of the underlying securities.</span></div> <div><span>The Board has adopted a policy of not monitoring for frequent purchases and </span><span>redemptions of Fund shares (</span><span>“</span><span>frequent trading</span><span>”</span><span>) that appear to attempt to take </span><span>advantage of a potential arbitrage opportunity presented by a lag between a change in </span><span>the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities after the close of the primary markets for </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio securities and the reflection of that change in the Fund’s NAV </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>market timing</span><span>”</span><span>), because the Fund sells and redeems its shares directly through </span><span>transactions that are in-kind and/or for cash, subject to the conditions described </span><span>below under </span><span>Creations</span><span> and Redemptions</span><span>. The Board has not adopted a policy of </span><span>monitoring for other frequent trading activity because shares of the Fund are listed for </span><span>trading on a national securities exchange.</span></div> <div><span>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed is open for </span><span>trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays </span><span>(or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, </span><span>Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor </span><span>Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is </span><span>Nasdaq.</span></div> <div><span>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act generally restricts investments by investment </span><span>companies, including foreign and unregistered investment companies, in the securities </span><span>of other investment companies. For example, a registered investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquired Fund</span><span>”</span><span>), such as the Fund, may not knowingly sell or otherwise dispose of any </span><span>security issued by the Acquired Fund to any investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquiring </span><span>Fund</span><span>”</span><span>) or any company or companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund if, immediately </span><span>after such sale or disposition: (i) more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of </span><span>the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and any company or companies </span><span>controlled by the Acquiring Fund, or (ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding voting </span><span>stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and other investment </span><span>companies and companies controlled by them. However, registered investment </span><span>companies are permitted to invest in the Fund beyond the limits set forth in Section </span><span>12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in SEC rules. In order for a </span><span>registered investment company to invest in shares of the Fund beyond the limitations </span><span>of Section 12(d)(1) in reliance on Rule 12d1-4 under the 1940 Act, the registered </span><span>investment company must, among other things, enter into an agreement with the </span><span>Trust. Foreign investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund only up to the </span><span>limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to any applicable SEC no-action relief.</span></div> <div><span>Book Entry.</span><span> Shares of the Fund are held in book-entry form, which means that no </span><span>stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (</span><span>“</span><span>DTC</span><span>”</span><span>) or its nominee is </span><span>the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as shown on the records of </span><span>DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>21</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, </span><span>clearing corporations and other institutions that directly or indirectly maintain a </span><span>custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to </span><span>receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your </span><span>name, and you are not considered a registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise </span><span>any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its </span><span>participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other </span><span>securities that you hold in book-entry or </span><span>“</span><span>street name</span><span>”</span><span> form.</span></div> <div><span>Share Prices.</span><span> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market </span><span>generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as </span><span>the supply of and demand for ETF shares and shares of underlying securities held by </span><span>the Fund, economic conditions and other factors.</span></div> <div><span>Determination of Net Asset Value. </span><span>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined </span><span>once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the close of regular trading hours of </span><span>the New York Stock Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>NYSE</span><span>”</span><span>) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day </span><span>that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that </span><span>any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are </span><span>translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as </span><span>quoted by one or more data service providers. The NAV of the Fund is calculated by </span><span>dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the value of its total assets less </span><span>total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally </span><span>rounded to the nearest cent.</span></div> <div><span>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities held by the Fund is </span><span>determined pursuant to BFA’s valuation policies and procedures. BFA has been </span><span>designated by the Board as the valuation designee for the Fund pursuant to Rule 2a-5 </span><span>under the Investment Company Act.</span></div> <div><span>Equity securities and other equity instruments for which market quotations are readily </span><span>available are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the last </span><span>reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the last </span><span>traded price on the exchange or market on which the security or instrument is </span><span>primarily traded at the time of valuation. Shares of underlying open-end funds </span><span>(including money market funds) are valued at net asset value. Shares of underlying </span><span>exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs are valued at their most recent </span><span>closing price.</span></div> <div><span>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities and money market instruments is substantially </span><span>completed each day at various times prior to the close of regular trading hours of the </span><span>NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are </span><span>determined as of such times.</span></div> <div><span>When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be </span><span>unreliable, BFA will fair value the Fund’s investments in accordance with its policies </span><span>and procedures. BFA may conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is </span><span>unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its </span><span>lack of trading or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent </span><span>price quotations or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>22</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent </span><span>to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is </span><span>listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is </span><span>available. A </span><span>“</span><span>significant event</span><span>”</span><span> is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable </span><span>business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s assets or liabilities, that </span><span>the event is likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or </span><span>closing market price of one or more assets held by, or liabilities of, the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The </span><span>fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might </span><span>reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to </span><span>extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments </span><span>using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market </span><span>valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been </span><span>sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value </span><span>prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the </span><span>prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, </span><span>which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the </span><span>performance of the Underlying Index.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends and Distributions</span></div> <div><span>General Policies.</span><span> Dividends from net investment income, if any, generally are declared </span><span>and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, </span><span>if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make </span><span>distributions on a more frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to </span><span>declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or </span><span>advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company (</span><span>“</span><span>RIC</span><span>”</span><span>) or to avoid </span><span>imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are distributed on a </span><span>pro rata</span><span> </span><span>basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC </span><span>participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds </span><span>received from the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Dividend Reinvestment Service.</span><span> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the </span><span>Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment </span><span>Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend </span><span>distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the </span><span>availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers </span><span>may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this </span><span>service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains </span><span>will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in </span><span>the secondary market.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes.</span><span> As with any investment, you should consider how your investment in shares of </span><span>the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general </span><span>information, based on current law. You should consult your own tax professional about </span><span>the tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>23</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>Unless your investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred</span><span> retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally </span><span>will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax </span><span>consequences when the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes on Distributions.</span><span> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income (other </span><span>than qualified dividend income), including</span><span> </span><span>distributions of income from securities </span><span>lending and distributions out of the Fund’s net short-term capital gains, if any, are </span><span>taxable to you as ordinary income. Distributions by the Fund of net long-term capital </span><span>gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain dividends) are </span><span>taxable to you as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the </span><span>Fund’s shares. Distributions by the Fund that qualify as qualified dividend income are </span><span>taxable to you at long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified </span><span>dividend income are generally eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for </span><span>non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain </span><span>threshold amounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is </span><span>imposed on </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income,</span><span>”</span><span> including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, </span><span>and net gain, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if </span><span>married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends will be qualified dividend income to you if they are attributable to qualified </span><span>dividend income received by the Fund. Generally, qualified dividend income includes </span><span>dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S. corporations, </span><span>provided that the Fund satisfies certain holding period requirements in respect of the </span><span>stock of such corporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. </span><span>Substitute dividends received by the Fund with respect to dividends paid on securities </span><span>lent out will not be qualified dividend income. For this purpose, a qualified non-U.S. </span><span>corporation means any non-U.S. corporation that is eligible for benefits under a </span><span>comprehensive income tax treaty with the U.S., which includes an exchange of </span><span>information program, or if the stock with respect to which the dividend was paid is </span><span>readily tradable on an established U.S. securities market. The term excludes a </span><span>corporation that is a passive foreign investment company.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends received by the Fund from a RIC generally are qualified dividend income only </span><span>to the extent such dividend distributions are made out of qualified dividend income </span><span>received by such RIC. Additionally, it is expected that dividends received by the Fund </span><span>from a REIT and distributed to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the </span><span>shareholder as ordinary income. However, for tax years beginning after December 31, </span><span>2017 and before January 1, 2026, the Fund may report dividends eligible for a 20% </span><span>“</span><span>qualified business income</span><span>”</span><span> deduction for non-corporate U.S. shareholders to the </span><span>extent the Fund’s income is derived from ordinary REIT dividends, reduced by allocable </span><span>Fund expenses.</span></div> <div><span>For a dividend to be treated as qualified dividend income, the dividend must be </span><span>received with respect to a share of stock held without being hedged by the Fund, and </span><span>with respect to a share of the Fund held without being hedged by you, for 61 days </span><span>during the 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days before the date on </span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>24</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of </span><span>certain preferred stock, 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before </span><span>such date.</span></div> <div><span>Fund distributions, to the extent attributable to dividends from U.S. corporations, will </span><span>be eligible for the dividends received deduction for Fund shareholders that are </span><span>corporations, subject to certain hedging and holding requirements.</span></div> <div><span>In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal income tax for the year when </span><span>they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on </span><span>December 31 of the prior year.</span></div> <div><span>If the Fund’s distributions exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits, all or </span><span>a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a </span><span>return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum </span><span>distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be </span><span>taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return </span><span>of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder’s </span><span>cost basis and result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those shares on </span><span>which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is </span><span>reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the shareholder </span><span>holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</span></div> <div><span>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if you are a non-U.S. entity </span><span>(other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s </span><span>ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) </span><span>will generally be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate </span><span>applies, provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income </span><span>realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital </span><span>gains or upon the sale or other disposition of shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, </span><span>interest and other income items paid to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S.</span><span> investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the U.S. Internal </span><span>Revenue Service (</span><span>“</span><span>IRS</span><span>”</span><span>) information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account </span><span>holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information </span><span>regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial </span><span>institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will </span><span>provide the IRS information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer </span><span>identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders, comply with due </span><span>diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts, report to the </span><span>IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax </span><span>on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account </span><span>holders who fail to provide the required information, and determine certain other </span><span>information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable </span><span>intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local </span><span>revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may </span><span>need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each </span><span>substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless </span><span>certain exceptions apply.</span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>25</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>If your Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending arrangement, you </span><span>may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends paid while the shares are held by the </span><span>borrower as qualified dividend income.</span></div> <div><span>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup withholding at a 24% rate </span><span>will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer </span><span>identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes When Shares Are Sold.</span><span> Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale </span><span>of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been </span><span>held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund </span><span>shares held for one year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except </span><span>that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term</span><span> capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to </span><span>such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from </span><span>capital gain dividends, are included in </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income</span><span>”</span><span> for purposes of the </span><span>3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned above.</span></div> <div><span>The foregoing discussion summarizes some of the consequences under current U.S. </span><span>federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. </span><span>You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and sales of </span><span>shares. Consult your personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an </span><span>investment in shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</span></div> <div><span>Creations and Redemptions.</span><span> Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the </span><span>Fund are </span><span>“</span><span>created</span><span>”</span><span> at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in </span><span>block-size Creation Units or multiples thereof. Each </span><span>“</span><span>creator</span><span>”</span><span> or authorized participant </span><span>(an </span><span>“</span><span>Authorized Participant</span><span>”</span><span>) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's </span><span>Distributor, an affiliate of BFA. An Authorized Participant is a member or participant of </span><span>a clearing agency registered with the SEC, which has a written agreement with the </span><span>Fund or one of its service providers that allows such member or participant to place </span><span>orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units.</span></div> <div><span>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the Distributor and the Fund, </span><span>generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a </span><span>designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>creation basket</span><span>”</span><span>), and </span><span>an amount of cash (including any cash representing the value of substituted securities, </span><span>assets or other positions), if any, which together approximate the holdings of the Fund </span><span>in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. Similarly, shares can be </span><span>redeemed only in Creation Units, generally for a designated portfolio of securities, </span><span>assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>redemption basket</span><span>”</span><span>) held by the Fund and an amount of </span><span>cash (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted). The </span><span>Fund may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units partially or solely for cash. </span><span>Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by the Fund. </span><span>Creation and redemption baskets may differ and the Fund may accept </span><span>“</span><span>custom </span><span>baskets.</span><span>”</span><span> More information regarding custom baskets is contained in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> <div><span>The prices at which creations and redemptions occur are based on the next calculation </span><span>of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under </span><span>the authorized participant agreement.</span></div> <div><span>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation Units with the Fund. </span><span>Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or </span><span>for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>26</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>In the event of a system failure or other interruption, including disruptions at market </span><span>makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either </span><span>may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at </span><span>all, or the Fund may not be able to place or change orders.</span></div> <div><span>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind transactions, the Fund intends to comply </span><span>with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying </span><span>redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any </span><span>securities accepted for deposit and any securities used to satisfy redemption requests </span><span>will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities </span><span>Act of 1933, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1933 Act</span><span>”</span><span>). Further, an Authorized Participant that is </span><span>not a </span><span>“</span><span>qualified institutional buyer,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the </span><span>1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule </span><span>144A.</span></div> <div><span>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is either a member of the </span><span>Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a </span><span>DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to </span><span>creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations. Information about the </span><span>procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off </span><span>times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> <div><span>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing basis, at any point </span><span>during the life of the Fund a </span><span>“</span><span>distribution,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may </span><span>be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on </span><span>their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed </span><span>participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters </span><span>subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any </span><span>determination of whether one is an underwriter must take into account all the relevant </span><span>facts and circumstances of each particular case.</span></div> <div><span>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not </span><span>“</span><span>underwriters</span><span>”</span><span> but are </span><span>participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and </span><span>thus dealing with shares that are part of an </span><span>“</span><span>unsold allotment</span><span>”</span><span> within the meaning of </span><span>Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the 1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the </span><span>prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For </span><span>delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of </span><span>Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is available only with respect to transactions on a </span><span>national securities exchange.</span></div> <div><span>Householding.</span><span> Householding is an option available to certain Fund investors. </span><span>Householding is a method of delivery, based on the preference of the individual </span><span>investor, in which a single copy of certain shareholder documents can be delivered to </span><span>investors who share the same address, even if their accounts are registered under </span><span>different names. Please contact your broker-dealer if you are interested in enrolling in </span><span>householding and receiving a single copy of prospectuses and other shareholder </span><span>documents, or if you are currently enrolled in householding and wish to change your </span><span>householding status.</span></div> <div></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>27</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>Distribution</span></div> <div><span>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the Fund on an agency basis. </span><span>The Distributor does not maintain a secondary market in shares of the Fund. The </span><span>Distributor has no role in determining the policies of the Fund or the securities that are </span><span>purchased or sold by the Fund. The Distributor’s principal address is 1 University </span><span>Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</span></div> <div><span>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers, registered investment advisers, </span><span>banks or other intermediaries (together, </span><span>“</span><span>intermediaries</span><span>”</span><span>) related to marketing </span><span>activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the </span><span>development of technology platforms and reporting systems, data provision services, </span><span>or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their </span><span>customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may </span><span>be significant to the intermediary, are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments </span><span>are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or </span><span>indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type </span><span>are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may </span><span>make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or </span><span>the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other </span><span>financial incentives it is eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial </span><span>incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the </span><span>intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the </span><span>Fund or other iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding </span><span>these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. </span><span>Please contact your salesperson or </span><span>other investment professional for more information regarding any such </span><span>payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</span></div> <div></div> </div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>28</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div></div> <hr/></div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div></div> <div> <div><span>Financial Highlights</span></div> <div><span>The financial highlights table is intended to help investors understand the Fund’s </span><span>financial performance since inception.

Please </span><span>read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional </span><span>information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</span></div> <div><span>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund are listed for trading on </span><span>The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (</span><span>“</span><span>Nasdaq</span><span>”</span><span>). The market price for a share of the Fund </span><span>may be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</span></div> <div><span>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly-traded securities. The Fund is designed to </span><span>track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund </span><span>represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other </span><span>instruments intended to track a market index. Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which </span><span>can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based </span><span>on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at </span><span>NAV solely by Authorized Participants and only in aggregations of a specified number of </span><span>shares (</span><span>“</span><span>Creation Units</span><span>”</span><span>). Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are </span><span>listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market </span><span>prices that change throughout the day.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund invests in a particular segment of the securities markets and seeks to track </span><span>the performance of a securities index that is not representative of the market as a </span><span>whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. </span><span>Accordingly, an investment in the Fund should not constitute a complete investment </span><span>program.</span></div> <div><span>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of financial instruments, and is </span><span>not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The </span><span>performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, </span><span>including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency valuations, asset valuations, corporate </span><span>actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of </span><span>representative sampling or from legal restrictions (such as diversification </span><span>requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to </span><span>time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments </span><span>to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise determined by BFA, any such change or </span><span>adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on </span><span>a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, </span><span>the Underlying Index performance shown for periods prior to the effective date of any </span><span>such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect </span><span>such change or adjustment. </span></div> <div><span>“</span><span>Tracking error</span><span>”</span><span> is the divergence of the Fund's performance from that of the </span><span>Underlying Index. Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, </span><span>it can be expected to have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing </span><span>strategy. </span><span>“</span><span>Replication</span><span>”</span><span> is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all </span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>of the securities in its underlying index in approximately the same proportions as in the underlying index.</span></div> <div><span>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not insured or guaranteed by </span><span>the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or </span><span>any of its affiliates.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be changed without </span><span>shareholder approval.</span></div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Principal Risks</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The Fund is subject to various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of </span><span>which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability </span><span>to meet its investment objective. You could lose all or part of your investment in the </span><span>Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments. The order of the below risk </span><span>factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. The Fund </span><span>discloses its portfolio holdings daily at </span><span>www.iShares.com</span><span>.</span></div> <div><span>Asset Class Risk.</span><span> The securities</span><span> </span><span>and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that </span><span>track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries, groups of industries, </span><span>markets, market segments, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, </span><span>currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and </span><span>underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a </span><span>number of factors including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, </span><span>global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental </span><span>controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that </span><span>invest in different asset classes. Securities of companies that have positive or </span><span>favorable ESG characteristics may underperform other securities.</span></div> <div><span>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. </span><span>Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of </span><span>those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption </span><span>transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized </span><span>Participants on an agency basis (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, on behalf of other market participants). To the </span><span>extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with </span><span>creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized </span><span>Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares </span><span>may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading </span><span>halts or delisting.</span></div> <div><span>Calculation Methodology Risk.</span><span> The Underlying Index</span><span> </span><span> relies on various sources of </span><span>information to assess the criteria of securities included in the Underlying Index, </span><span>including information that may be based on assumptions and estimates. Neither the </span><span>Fund nor BFA can offer assurances that the Underlying Index's calculation </span><span>methodology or sources of information will provide an accurate assessment of </span><span>included securities.</span></div> <div><span>Concentration Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, </span><span>including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of </span><span>countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector, market segment or </span><span>asset class. The Fund may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of </span><span>those securities and/or other assets, may experience increased price volatility and </span><span>may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory </span><span>occurrences affecting those securities and/or other assets than a fund that does not </span><span>concentrate its investments.</span></div> <div><span>Cybersecurity Risk.</span><span> The Fund,</span><span> </span><span>Authorized Participants, service providers and the </span><span>relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information security and </span><span>related </span><span>“</span><span>cyber</span><span>”</span><span> risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of </span><span>cybersecurity risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, </span><span>which could result in material adverse consequences for such issuers and may cause </span><span>the Fund’s investment in such issuers to lose value. In general, cyber incidents can </span><span>result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are </span><span>not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, through </span><span>“</span><span>hacking</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive </span><span>information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyberattacks may also </span><span>be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as </span><span>causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, efforts to make network services </span><span>unavailable to intended users). Recently, geopolitical tensions may have increased the </span><span>scale and sophistication of deliberate attacks, particularly those from nation-states or </span><span>from entities with nation-state backing. </span></div> <div><span>Cybersecurity failures by, or breaches of, the systems of the Fund's adviser, distributor </span><span>and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index and benchmark </span><span>providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market </span><span>makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests </span><span>have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially </span><span>resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s ability to calculate its NAV, </span><span>disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of </span><span>erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund </span><span>or its service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other </span><span>laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other </span><span>compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyberattacks may </span><span>render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, </span><span>and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund inaccessible, inaccurate or </span><span>incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund in order to resolve or </span><span>prevent cyber incidents in the future. While the Fund has established business </span><span>continuity plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber </span><span>incidents, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the </span><span>possibility that certain risks have not been identified, that prevention and remediation </span><span>efforts will not be successful or that cyberattacks will go undetected. Furthermore, the </span><span>Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by service </span><span>providers to the Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, market </span><span>makers or Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively </span><span>impacted as a result.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Equity Securities Risk.</span><span> The Fund invests in equity securities, which are subject to </span><span>changes in value that may be attributable to market perception of a particular issuer or </span><span>to general stock market fluctuations that affect all issuers. Investments in equity </span><span>securities may be more volatile than investments in other asset classes. The </span><span>Underlying Index is composed of common stocks, which generally subject</span><span> </span><span>their holders </span><span>to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common </span><span>stockholders' claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt </span><span>securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</span></div> <div><span>ESG Risk. </span><span>To the extent that the Underlying Index uses criteria related to the ESG </span><span>characteristics of issuers, this may limit the types and number of investment </span><span>opportunities available to the Fund and, as a result, the Fund may underperform other </span><span>funds whose underlying index does not use ESG criteria. The Underlying Index’s use of </span><span>ESG criteria may result in the Fund investing in, or allocating greater weight to, </span><span>securities or market sectors that underperform the market as a whole or underperform </span><span>other funds that use ESG criteria. In addition, the use of representative sampling may </span><span>result in divergence of the Fund's overall ESG characteristics or ESG risk from those of </span><span>the Underlying Index.</span></div> <div><span>The Index Provider evaluates securities for inclusion and/or weighting in the </span><span>Underlying Index based on ESG criteria and data provided by the Index Provider or </span><span>third parties. The Index Provider’s evaluation of securities’ ESG characteristics depends </span><span>on these criteria and data, which may vary by index provider, and no assurance can be </span><span>given that they will be complete, accurate or current. In addition, the Index Provider </span><span>may evaluate security-level ESG data (including ratings) and, if applicable, ESG </span><span>objectives or constraints that are relevant to the Underlying Index only at index reviews </span><span>or rebalances. Securities included in the Underlying Index may cease to meet the </span><span>relevant ESG criteria but may nevertheless remain in the Underlying Index and the </span><span>Fund until the next review or rebalance by the Index Provider. As a result, certain </span><span>securities in the Underlying Index, or the Underlying Index as a whole, may not meet </span><span>the relevant ESG objectives or constraints at all times. If the ESG assessment of a </span><span>security in the Underlying Index or the Fund changes, neither the Fund nor BFA accepts </span><span>any liability in relation to such change. BFA does not monitor securities in the </span><span>Underlying Index with respect to ESG objectives or constraints applied by the Index </span><span>Provider and is not responsible for changes to the ESG assessment of a security in the </span><span>Underlying Index between rebalances. In addition, BFA does not assess the validity of </span><span>the Index Provider’s evaluation of the ESG characteristics of securities or the criteria </span><span>and data used in such evaluation.</span></div> <div><span>The impacts of risks related to ESG investing are likely to change over time, and new </span><span>ESG risks may be identified as further data and information regarding ESG factors and </span><span>impacts become available. In addition, methodologies for ESG investing continue to </span><span>develop, and the ESG methodology applied by the Index Provider may change over </span><span>time.</span></div> <div><span>Index-Related Risk.</span><span> The Fund seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to </span><span>the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as </span><span>published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any </span><span>agents that may act on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the </span><span>Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to </span><span>achieve, neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any </span><span>liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or </span><span>its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in line with </span><span>the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to </span><span>manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider </span><span>to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee against the Index Provider’s or </span><span>any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the </span><span>data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not </span><span>be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, </span><span>particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or </span><span>managers. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its </span><span>shareholders. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains </span><span>incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and </span><span>would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Shareholders </span><span>should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund </span><span>and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will </span><span>be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>Unusual market conditions or other unforeseen circumstances (such as natural </span><span>disasters, political unrest or war) may impact the Index Provider or a third-party data </span><span>provider, and could cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance to the </span><span>Underlying Index. This could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or </span><span>expected composition. The postponement of a scheduled rebalance could mean that </span><span>constituents of the Underlying Index that would otherwise be removed at rebalance </span><span>due to changes in market capitalizations, issuer credit ratings, or other reasons may </span><span>remain, causing the performance and constituents of the Underlying Index to vary from </span><span>those expected under normal conditions. Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index </span><span>Provider or its agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying </span><span>Index due to reaching certain weighting constraints, unusual market conditions or </span><span>corporate events or, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index </span><span>constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances </span><span>its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the </span><span>Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such </span><span>portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Therefore, </span><span>errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the Index Provider or its agents </span><span>to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Infectious Illness Risk. </span><span>A widespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as the </span><span>COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect the economies of many nations and the </span><span>global economy and may impact individual issuers and capital markets in ways that </span><span>cannot be foreseen.</span></div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in travel restrictions, closed international </span><span>borders, disruption of healthcare services, prolonged quarantines, cancellations, </span><span>supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, temporary and permanent closures </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>of businesses, layoffs, defaults and other significant economic, social and political </span><span>impacts, as well as general concern and uncertainty.</span></div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in extreme volatility, severe losses, credit </span><span>deterioration of issuers, and disruptions in markets, which could adversely impact the </span><span>Fund and its investments, including impairing any hedging activity.</span></div> <div><span>Certain local markets may be subject to closures. Any suspension of trading in markets </span><span>in which the Fund invests will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and will </span><span>impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities in such markets.</span><span> </span><span>Market or </span><span>economic disruptions could result in elevated tracking error and increased premiums </span><span>or discounts to the Fund's NAV. Additionally, an outbreak could impair the operations </span><span>of the Fund’s service providers, including BFA, which could adversely impact the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Governmental and quasi-governmental authorities and regulators throughout the world </span><span>may respond to an outbreak and any resulting economic disruptions with a variety of </span><span>fiscal and monetary policy changes, including direct capital infusions into companies </span><span>and other issuers, new monetary policy tools, and changes in interest rates. A reversal </span><span>of these policies, or the ineffectiveness of such policies, is likely to increase market </span><span>volatility, which could adversely affect the Fund’s investments.</span></div> <div><span>An outbreak may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social and economic risks in </span><span>certain countries or globally, which could adversely affect the Fund and its investments </span><span>and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Despite the development of vaccines, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its </span><span>effects cannot be predicted with certainty.</span></div> <div><span>Issuer Risk. </span><span>The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual </span><span>securities to which the Fund has exposure. Any issuer of these securities may perform </span><span>poorly, causing the value of its securities to decline. Poor performance may be caused </span><span>by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, </span><span>expiration of patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages, </span><span>corporate restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or </span><span>other factors. Issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to </span><span>reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock prices to decline. An </span><span>issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in </span><span>which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</span></div> <div><span>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.</span><span> Large-capitalization companies may be less </span><span>able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. </span><span>Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more limited </span><span>growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different </span><span>market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the </span><span>overall performance of the broader securities markets.</span></div> <div><span>Management Risk. </span><span>Because BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, </span><span>the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities not </span><span>included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that BFA’s </span><span>investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of </span><span>constraints, may not produce the intended results.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>6</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Market Risk.</span><span> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market </span><span>movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The </span><span>value of a security, asset, or other instrument may decline due to changes in general </span><span>market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the </span><span>issuer of the security</span><span> </span><span>or other asset, or factors that affect a particular issuer or issuers, </span><span> </span><span>exchange or exchanges, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of </span><span>industries, sector or asset class. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of </span><span>terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, or </span><span>other events could have a significant impact on the Fund</span><span> </span><span>and its investments and could </span><span>result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. During a general market </span><span>downturn, multiple asset classes may be negatively affected. Changes in market </span><span>conditions and interest rates generally do not have the same impact on all types of </span><span>securities and instruments.</span></div> <div><span>Market Trading Risk.</span></div> <div><span>Absence of Active Market.</span><span> Although shares of the Fund are listed for trading on one or </span><span>more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for </span><span>such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized </span><span>Participants.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Secondary Listings. </span><span>The Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S.</span><span> stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary </span><span>listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made available to non-U.S. investors </span><span>through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There </span><span>can be no assurance that the Fund’s shares will continue to trade on any such stock </span><span>exchange or in any market or that the Fund’s shares will continue to meet the </span><span>requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's shares </span><span>may be less actively traded in certain markets than in others, and investors are subject </span><span>to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of the market where they </span><span>or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to </span><span>investors who trade Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market </span><span>hours may not be available to investors who trade in other markets, which may result </span><span>in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</span></div> <div><span>Secondary Market Trading Risk.</span><span> Shares of the Fund may trade in the secondary market </span><span>at times when the Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such </span><span>times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more significant premiums or </span><span>discounts than might be experienced at times when the Fund accepts purchase and </span><span>redemption orders.</span></div> <div><span>Secondary market trading in Fund shares may be halted by a stock exchange because </span><span>of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund shares on a </span><span>stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by </span><span>extraordinary market volatility pursuant to </span><span>“</span><span>circuit breaker</span><span>”</span><span> rules on the stock </span><span>exchange or market.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed on a stock exchange, may </span><span>be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price </span><span>decreases associated with being sold short. In addition, trading activity in derivative </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>7</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>products based on the Fund may lead to increased trading volume and volatility in the </span><span>secondary market for the shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV.</span><span> Shares of the Fund trade on </span><span>stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of </span><span>the Fund is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in </span><span>the market value of the Fund’s holdings. The trading price of the Fund's shares </span><span>fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours</span><span> </span><span>based on both market supply of and </span><span>demand for Fund shares and the underlying value of the Fund's portfolio holdings or </span><span>NAV. As a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s shares may deviate significantly from </span><span>NAV during periods of market volatility. </span><span>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, </span><span>MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO </span><span>NAV</span><span>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at </span><span>NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund are not </span><span>likely to be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, </span><span>which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, </span><span>their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely </span><span>that the Fund’s shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the </span><span>Fund’s next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly with </span><span>the Fund's NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other </span><span>factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at </span><span>market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during </span><span>periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the </span><span>Fund that differ significantly from its NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing to </span><span>create or redeem Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for such shares or </span><span>its underlying investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s shares trading at a </span><span>premium or discount to NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.</span><span> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange </span><span>involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or </span><span>selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage </span><span>commission and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread</span><span>”</span><span>; </span><span>that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>bid</span><span>”</span><span> price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>ask</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>price).</span><span> </span><span>The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume </span><span>and market liquidity and wider if the Fund has less trading volume and market liquidity. </span><span>In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be </span><span>regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because </span><span>of the costs inherent in buying or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract </span><span>significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be </span><span>advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a </span><span>brokerage account.</span></div> <div><span>Operational Risk.</span><span> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of </span><span>factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication </span><span>errors, errors of the Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third parties, </span><span>failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, </span><span>these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address </span><span>significant operational risks.</span></div> <div><span>Passive Investment Risk.</span><span> The Fund is not actively managed and may be affected by a </span><span>general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests </span><span>in securities included in, or representative of, the Underlying Index, regardless of their </span><span>investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in </span><span>defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the U.S.</span><span> A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade </span><span>regulations, inflation and/or an economic recession in the U.S. may have a material </span><span>adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed on U.S. exchanges. </span><span>Proposed and adopted policy and legislative changes in the U.S. are changing many </span><span>aspects of financial, commercial, public health, environmental, and other regulation </span><span>and may have a significant effect on U.S. markets generally, as well as on the value of </span><span>certain securities. Governmental agencies project that the U.S. will continue to </span><span>maintain elevated public debt levels for the foreseeable future. Although elevated debt </span><span>levels do not necessarily indicate or cause economic problems, elevated public debt </span><span>service costs may constrain future economic growth.</span></div> <div><span>The U.S. has developed increasingly strained relations with a number of foreign </span><span>countries. If relations with certain countries deteriorate, it could adversely affect U.S. </span><span>issuers as well as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also </span><span>experienced increased internal unrest and discord, as well as significant challenges in </span><span>managing and containing the outbreak of COVID-19. If these trends were to continue, </span><span>it may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the issuers in which the Fund </span><span>invests.</span></div> <div><span>Securities Lending Risk.</span><span> The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities </span><span>lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the </span><span>loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund </span><span>could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for </span><span>loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash </span><span>collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund. </span><span>BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>BTC</span><span>”</span><span>), the</span><span> </span><span>Fund's securities lending </span><span>agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments for </span><span>dividends when managing the</span><span> </span><span>Fund's securities lending program.</span></div> <div><span>Technology Sector Risk.</span><span> Technology companies, including information technology </span><span>companies,</span><span> </span><span>face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may </span><span>have an adverse effect on a company’s profit margins. Technology companies may </span><span>have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of </span><span>technology companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological </span><span>developments, frequent new product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth </span><span>rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Companies in the </span><span>technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and other intellectual property </span><span>rights. A technology company’s loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect </span><span>the company’s profitability. Companies in the technology sector are facing increased </span><span>government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>9</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>regulatory action. The technology sector may also be adversely affected by changes or </span><span>trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced or characterized by </span><span>unpredictable factors.</span></div> <div><span>Tracking Error Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be subject to </span><span>“</span><span>tracking error,</span><span>”</span><span> which is the </span><span>divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error </span><span>may occur because of differences between the securities and other instruments held in </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences, </span><span>transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, </span><span>differences in timing of the accrual or the valuation of dividends or interest received by </span><span>the Fund or distributions paid to the Fund’s shareholders, the requirements to maintain </span><span>pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the </span><span>distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, changes </span><span>to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or </span><span>existing regulatory requirements, among other reasons. This risk may be heightened </span><span>during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. </span><span>Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the </span><span>Underlying Index does not.</span></div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</span></div> <div><span>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated with its investments </span><span>and investment strategies. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the </span><span>significance of any particular risk factor.</span></div> <div><span>Close-Out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.</span><span> Regulations adopted by global </span><span>prudential regulators require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global </span><span>systemically important banking organizations to include contractual restrictions on </span><span>close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. </span><span>Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards </span><span>and other derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending </span><span>agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial </span><span>contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution </span><span>proceedings and also prohibit the Fund from exercising default rights due to a </span><span>receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. These </span><span>requirements may increase credit risk and other risks to the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Communication Services Sector Risk.</span><span> The communication services sector consists </span><span>of both companies in the telecommunication services industry as well as those in the </span><span>media and entertainment industry. Examples of companies in the telecommunication </span><span>services industry group include providers of fiber-optic, fixed-line, cellular and wireless </span><span>telecommunications networks. Companies in the media and entertainment industry </span><span>group encompass a variety of services and products including television broadcasting, </span><span>gaming products, social media, networking platforms, online classifieds, online review </span><span>websites, and Internet search engines. Companies in the communication services </span><span>sector may be affected by industry competition, substantial capital requirements, </span><span>government regulation, and obsolescence of communications products and services </span><span>due to technological advancement. Fluctuating domestic and international demand, </span><span>shifting demographics and often unpredictable changes in consumer tastes can </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>drastically affect a communication services company's profitability. In addition, while </span><span>all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies in </span><span>the communication services sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential </span><span>theft of proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could </span><span>have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</span></div> <div><span>The communication services sector of a country’s economy is often subject to </span><span>extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with governmental </span><span>regulations, delays or failure to receive required regulatory approvals, or the </span><span>enactment of new regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of </span><span>communications companies. Government actions around the world, specifically in the </span><span>area of pre-marketing clearance of products and prices, can be arbitrary and </span><span>unpredictable. The communications services industry can also be significantly affected </span><span>by intense competition for market share, including competition with alternative </span><span>technologies such as wireless communications, product compatibility and </span><span>standardization, consumer preferences, rapid product obsolescence, research and </span><span>development of new products, lack of standardization or compatibility with existing </span><span>technologies, and a dependency on patent and copyright protections. Companies in </span><span>the communication services sector may encounter distressed cash flows due to the </span><span>need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition, particularly in </span><span>developing new products and services using new technology. Technological </span><span>innovations may make the products and services of certain communications </span><span>companies obsolete.</span></div> <div><span>Telecommunications providers with exposure to the U.S. are generally required to </span><span>obtain franchises or licenses in order to provide services in a given location. Licensing </span><span>and franchise rights in the telecommunications sector are limited, which may provide </span><span>an advantage to certain participants. Limited availability of such rights, high barriers to </span><span>market entry and regulatory oversight, among other factors, have led to consolidation </span><span>of companies within the sector, which could lead to further regulation or other negative </span><span>effects in the future. Telecommunication providers investing in non-U.S. countries may </span><span>be subject to similar risks. Additional risks include those related to competitive </span><span>challenges in the U.S. from non-U.S. competitors engaged in strategic joint ventures </span><span>with U.S. companies and in non-U.S. markets from both U.S. and non-U.S. </span><span>competitors.</span></div> <div><span>Companies in the media and entertainment industries can be significantly affected by </span><span>several factors, including competition, particularly in formulation of products and </span><span>services using new technologies, cyclicality of revenues and earnings, a potential </span><span>decrease in the discretionary income of targeted individuals, changing consumer </span><span>tastes and interests, and the potential increase in government regulation. Companies </span><span>in the media and entertainment industries may become obsolete quickly. Advertising </span><span>spending can be an important revenue source for media and entertainment companies. </span><span>During economic downturns advertising spending typically decreases and, as a result, </span><span>media and entertainment companies tend to generate less revenue.</span></div> <div><span>Consumer Discretionary Sector Risk.</span><span> The success of consumer product </span><span>manufacturers and retailers is tied closely to the performance of domestic and </span><span>international economies, interest rates, exchange rates, supply chains, competition, </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>consumer confidence, changes in demographics and consumer preferences. </span><span>Companies in the consumer discretionary sector depend heavily on disposable </span><span>household income and consumer spending, and may be strongly affected by social </span><span>trends and marketing campaigns. These companies may be subject to severe </span><span>competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</span></div> <div><span>Consumer Staples Sector Risk.</span><span> Companies in the consumer staples sector may be </span><span>affected by the regulation of various product components and production methods, </span><span>marketing campaigns and changes in the global economy, consumer spending and </span><span>consumer demand. Companies in the consumer staples sector may also be adversely </span><span>affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by </span><span>unpredictable factors. These companies may be subject to severe competition, which </span><span>may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</span></div> <div><span>Financials Sector Risk.</span><span> Companies in the financials sector</span><span> </span><span>of an economy are subject </span><span>to extensive governmental regulation and intervention, which may adversely affect the </span><span>scope of their activities, the prices they can charge, the amount of capital they must </span><span>maintain and, potentially, their size. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a </span><span>company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by </span><span>applicable law. Governmental regulation may change frequently and may have </span><span>significant adverse consequences for companies in the financials sector, including </span><span>effects not intended by such regulation. Increased risk taking by banks may also result </span><span>in greater overall risk in the U.S. and global financials sector. The impact of changes in </span><span>capital requirements, or recent or future regulation in various countries, on any </span><span>individual financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be </span><span>predicted. </span></div> <div><span>Certain risks may impact the value of investments in the financials sector more </span><span>severely than those of investments outside this sector, including the risks associated </span><span>with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage. Companies in the </span><span>financials sector are exposed directly to the credit risk of their borrowers and </span><span>counterparties, who may be leveraged to an unknown degree, including through swaps </span><span>and other derivatives products. Financial services companies may have significant </span><span>exposure to the same borrowers and counterparties, with the result that a borrower’s </span><span>or counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations to one company may affect other </span><span>companies with exposure to the same borrower or counterparty. This </span><span>interconnectedness of risk may result in significant negative impacts to companies </span><span>with direct exposure to the defaulting counterparty as well as adverse cascading </span><span>effects in the markets and the financials sector generally. Companies in the financials </span><span>sector may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and loan losses, </span><span>decreases in the availability of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades </span><span>and adverse conditions in other related markets. Insurance companies, in particular, </span><span>may be subject to severe price competition and/or rate regulation, which may have an </span><span>adverse impact on their profitability. The financials sector is particularly sensitive to </span><span>fluctuations in interest rates. The financials sector is also a target for cyberattacks, and </span><span>may experience technology malfunctions and disruptions. Cybersecurity incidents and </span><span>technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>12</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>and have reportedly caused losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively </span><span>impact the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Healthcare Sector Risk.</span><span> The profitability of companies in the healthcare sector may </span><span>be adversely affected by the following factors, among others: extensive government </span><span>regulations, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising </span><span>costs of medical products and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on </span><span>outpatient services, changes in the demand for medical products and services, a </span><span>limited number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other </span><span>market developments. Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent on patent </span><span>protection. The expiration of a company’s patents may adversely affect that company’s </span><span>profitability. Many healthcare companies are subject to extensive litigation based on </span><span>product liability and similar claims. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive </span><span>forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may result in price </span><span>discounting. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 allows for the negotiation of </span><span>prescription drug prices on behalf of Medicare recipients, which may result in reduced </span><span>prescription prices. This could reduce some healthcare companies’ overall profitability. </span><span>Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. </span><span>The process of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, and such efforts </span><span>ultimately may be unsuccessful. Companies in the healthcare sector may be thinly </span><span>capitalized and may be susceptible to product obsolescence. In addition, a number of </span><span>legislative proposals concerning healthcare have been considered by the U.S. </span><span>Congress in recent years. It is unclear what proposals will ultimately be enacted, if any, </span><span>and what effect they may have on companies in the healthcare sector.</span></div> <div><span>Illiquid Investments Risk. </span><span>The Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, </span><span>immediately after the acquisition, the Fund would have invested more than 15% of its </span><span>net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the </span><span>Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in </span><span>seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the </span><span>investment. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, </span><span>particularly during periods of market turmoil. There can be no assurance that a security </span><span>or instrument that is deemed to be liquid when purchased will continue to be liquid for </span><span>as long as it is held by the Fund, and any security or instrument held by the Fund may </span><span>be deemed an illiquid investment pursuant to the Fund’s liquidity risk management </span><span>program. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid investments may </span><span>reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be unable to transact at </span><span>advantageous times or prices. An investment may be illiquid due to, among other </span><span>things, the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a </span><span>market in securities or instruments</span><span> </span><span>or the lack of an active market for such securities </span><span>or instruments. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or instruments with </span><span>substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have increased exposure to </span><span>the risks associated with illiquid investments. Illiquid investments may be harder to </span><span>value, especially in changing markets. Although the Fund primarily seeks to redeem </span><span>shares of the Fund on an in-kind basis, if the Fund is forced to sell underlying </span><span>investments at reduced prices or under unfavorable conditions to meet redemption </span><span>requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. This may be magnified in </span><span>a rising interest rate environment or other circumstances where redemptions from the </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>13</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span><span>Fund may be greater than normal. Other market participants may be attempting to </span><span>liquidate holdings at the same time as the Fund, causing increased supply of the Fund’s </span> underlying investments in the market and contributing to illiquid investments risk and </span><span>downward pricing pressure. In addition, if the Fund is limited in its ability to sell illiquid </span><span>investments during periods when shareholders are redeeming their shares, the Fund </span><span>will need to sell liquid securities to meet redemption requests and illiquid securities will </span><span>become a larger portion of the Fund’s holdings. During periods of market volatility, </span><span>liquidity in the market for the Fund’s shares may be impacted by the liquidity in the </span><span>market for the underlying securities or instruments held by the Fund, which could lead </span><span>to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Industrials Sector Risk.</span><span> The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials </span><span>sector may be adversely affected by supply and demand changes related to their </span><span>specific products or services and industrials sector products in general. The products </span><span>of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological </span><span>developments and frequent new product introduction. Global events, trade disputes </span><span>and changes in government regulations, economic conditions and exchange rates may </span><span>adversely affect the performance of companies in the industrials sector. While the Fund </span><span>seeks to invest in companies with positive or favorable environmental and social </span><span>characteristics, companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by </span><span>liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. The industrials sector </span><span>may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may </span><span>be influenced by unpredictable factors. Companies in the industrials sector, </span><span>particularly aerospace and defense companies, may also be adversely affected by </span><span>government spending policies because companies in this sector tend to rely to a </span><span>significant extent on government demand for their products and services.</span></div> <div><span>Large Shareholder and Large-Scale Redemption Risk.</span><span> Certain shareholders, </span><span>including an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an </span><span>affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, a market maker, or another entity, may from time to time </span><span>own or manage a substantial amount of Fund shares or may invest in the Fund and </span><span>hold their investment for a limited period of time. These shareholders may also pledge </span><span>or loan Fund shares (to secure financing or otherwise), which may result in the shares </span><span>becoming concentrated in another party. There can be no assurance that any large </span><span>shareholder or large group of shareholders would not redeem their investment or that </span><span>the size of the Fund would be maintained. Redemptions of a large number of Fund </span><span>shares by these shareholders may adversely affect the Fund’s liquidity and net assets. </span><span>To the extent the Fund permits redemptions in cash, these redemptions may force the </span><span>Fund to sell portfolio securities when it might not otherwise do so, which may </span><span>negatively impact the Fund’s NAV, have a material effect on the market price of the </span><span>Shares and increase the Fund’s brokerage costs and/or accelerate the realization of </span><span>taxable income and/or gains and cause the Fund to make taxable distributions to its </span><span>shareholders earlier than the Fund otherwise would have. In addition, under certain </span><span>circumstances, non-redeeming shareholders may be treated as receiving a </span><span>disproportionately large taxable distribution during or with respect to such tax year. </span><span>The Fund also may be required to sell its more liquid Fund investments to meet a large </span><span>redemption, in which case the Fund’s remaining assets may be less liquid, more </span><span>volatile, and more difficult to price. To the extent these large shareholders transact in </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span><span>shares on the secondary market, such transactions may account for a large </span><span>percentage of the trading volume for the shares of the Fund and may, therefore, have a </span> material upward or downward effect on the market price of the Fund shares. In </span><span>addition, large purchases of Fund shares may adversely affect the Fund’s performance </span><span>to the extent that the Fund is delayed in investing new cash and is required to maintain </span><span>a larger cash position than it ordinarily would, diluting its investment returns.</span></div> <div><span>Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk. </span><span>Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies </span><span>may be more volatile than those of large-capitalization companies and, therefore, the </span><span>Fund’s share price may be more volatile than those of funds that invest a larger </span><span>percentage of their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock </span><span>prices of mid-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization</span><span> companies to adverse business or economic developments, and the </span><span>stocks of mid-capitalization companies may be less liquid than those of large-capitalization</span><span> companies, making it difficult for the Fund to buy and sell shares of mid-capitalization</span><span> companies. In addition, mid-capitalization companies generally have less </span><span>diverse product lines than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to </span><span>adverse developments related to their products.</span></div> <div><span>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.</span><span> If certain aggregate and/or fund-level ownership </span><span>thresholds are reached through transactions undertaken by BFA, its affiliates or the </span><span>Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions or actions by an issuer or regulator, the </span><span>ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to purchase or </span><span>dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be </span><span>restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make </span><span>investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant threshold limits, and </span><span>such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio holdings</span><span> </span><span>compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This </span><span>may increase the risk of the Fund being underinvested to the Underlying Index and </span><span>increase the risk of tracking error.</span></div> <div><span>For example, in certain circumstances where the Fund invests in securities issued by </span><span>companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or </span><span>international markets, is subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or </span><span>invests in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits on the </span><span>aggregate and/or fund-level amount invested or voted by BFA and its affiliates for their </span><span>proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Fund) that may not be </span><span>exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if </span><span>exceeded, may cause BFA and its affiliates, the Fund or other client accounts to suffer </span><span>disadvantages or business restrictions.</span></div> <div><span>Portfolio Holdings Information</span></div> <div><span>A description of the Trust's policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Fund's Statement of Additional </span><span>Information (</span><span>“</span><span>SAI</span><span>”</span><span>).

In managing </span><span>the Fund, BFA may draw upon the research and expertise of its asset management </span><span>affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's </span><span>investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists </span><span>and other investment specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines </span><span>and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</span></div> <div><span>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and the Trust (entered </span><span>into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the </span><span>Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with </span><span>respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of </span><span>portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, </span><span>and litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of </span><span>the Trustees who are not </span><span>“</span><span>interested persons</span><span>”</span><span> of the Trust).</span></div> <div><span>For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022, BFA was paid a management fee from the </span><span>Fund, as a percentage of the Fund's average daily net assets, at the annual rate of </span><span>0.15%. BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or </span><span>expenses in order to limit total annual fund operating expenses (excluding acquired </span><span>fund fees and expenses, if any). Any such voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be </span><span>eliminated by BFA at any time.</span></div> <div><span>BFA is located at 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.

As of September 30, 2022, BFA </span><span>and its affiliates provided investment advisory services for assets in excess of $8.0 </span><span>trillion. BFA and its affiliates trade and invest for their own accounts in the actual </span><span>securities and types of securities in which the Fund may also invest, which may affect </span><span>the price of such securities.</span></div> <div><span>A discussion regarding the basis for the approval by the Trust's Board of Trustees (the </span><span>“</span><span>Board</span><span>”</span><span>) of the Investment Advisory Agreement with BFA is available in the Fund's </span><span>Annual Report for the period ended August 31.</span></div> <div><span>Portfolio Managers.</span><span> Jennifer Hsui, Greg Savage and Paul Whitehead are primarily </span><span>responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund.

BFA and its Affiliates provide investment </span><span>management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that may </span><span>follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA and its Affiliates are </span><span>involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management </span><span>activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in which their </span><span>interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or </span><span>one or more Affiliates act, or may act, as an investor, research provider, investment </span><span>manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, </span><span>adviser, trader, lender,</span><span> </span><span>index provider, agent and/or principal, and have other direct </span><span>and indirect interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other </span><span>instruments in which the Fund may directly or indirectly invest. The Fund may invest in </span><span>securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate </span><span>has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The Fund may also invest </span><span>in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which an Affiliate provides and is </span><span>compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of </span><span>such issuances. The Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in other </span><span>transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate provides or may in the future </span><span>provide research coverage. An Affiliate may have business relationships with, and </span><span>purchase or distribute or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants </span><span>or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, </span><span>and may receive compensation for such services. BFA or one or more Affiliates may </span><span>engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment </span><span>objectives similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for </span><span>transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the </span><span>Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end</span><span> investment companies (which may include investment companies that are </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>17</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment </span><span>Company Act of 1940, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1940 Act</span><span>”</span><span>)). The trading activities of BFA and </span><span>these Affiliates are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly </span><span>by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate having positions in certain securities </span><span>that are senior or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities </span><span>that are owned by the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to share any investment </span><span>opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with </span><span>the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's </span><span>investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an Affiliate and of other </span><span>accounts managed by BlackRock or an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could </span><span>sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts </span><span>achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The opposite result is </span><span>also possible.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, the Fund may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an </span><span>Affiliate or</span><span> </span><span>its or their directors, officers, employees or clients have an adverse interest. </span><span>Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or managed by BFA or its </span><span>Affiliates may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or</span><span> </span><span>by </span><span>BFA or its Affiliates or their directors, officers or employees may have the effect of </span><span>diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund's activities may be limited because of regulatory restrictions applicable to </span><span>BFA or one or more Affiliates and/or their internal policies designed to comply with </span><span>such restrictions.</span></div> <div><span>Under a securities lending program approved by the Board, the Fund has retained BTC, </span><span>an Affiliate of BFA, to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent </span><span>that the Fund participates in the securities lending program. For these services, the </span><span>securities lending agent will receive a fee from the Fund, including a fee based on the </span><span>returns earned on the Fund’s investment of the cash received as collateral for the </span><span>loaned securities. In addition, one or more Affiliates may be among the entities to </span><span>which the Fund may lend its portfolio securities under the securities lending program.</span></div> <div><span>Under an ETF Services Agreement, the Fund has retained BlackRock Investments, LLC </span><span>(the </span><span>“</span><span>Distributor</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>BRIL</span><span>”</span><span>), an Affiliate of BFA, to perform certain order processing, </span><span>Authorized Participant communications, and related services in connection with the </span><span>issuance and redemption of Creation Units of the Fund (</span><span>“</span><span>ETF Services</span><span>”</span><span>).

Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, </span><span>shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a </span><span>Creation Unit.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange for trading during the </span><span>trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of </span><span>other publicly-traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment </span><span>for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or otherwise in the secondary </span><span>market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol </span><span>“</span><span>ESGU.</span><span>”</span></div> <div><span>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary market involves two </span><span>types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling </span><span>shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other </span><span>charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may be a significant </span><span>proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In </span><span>addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread,</span><span>”</span><span> that is, any difference between the </span><span>bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over time for shares of the Fund based </span><span>on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund </span><span>has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity (which is often the case for funds that are newly launched </span><span>or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity or illiquidity </span><span>of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller </span><span>funds or in instances of significant volatility of the underlying securities.</span></div> <div><span>The Board has adopted a policy of not monitoring for frequent purchases and </span><span>redemptions of Fund shares (</span><span>“</span><span>frequent trading</span><span>”</span><span>) that appear to attempt to take </span><span>advantage of a potential arbitrage opportunity presented by a lag between a change in </span><span>the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities after the close of the primary markets for </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio securities and the reflection of that change in the Fund’s NAV </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>market timing</span><span>”</span><span>), because the Fund sells and redeems its shares directly through </span><span>transactions that are in-kind and/or for cash, subject to the conditions described </span><span>below under </span><span>Creations</span><span> and Redemptions</span><span>.

The Fund’s primary listing exchange is </span><span>Nasdaq.</span></div> <div><span>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act generally restricts investments by investment </span><span>companies, including foreign and unregistered investment companies, in the securities </span><span>of other investment companies. For example, a registered investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquired Fund</span><span>”</span><span>), such as the Fund, may not knowingly sell or otherwise dispose of any </span><span>security issued by the Acquired Fund to any investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquiring </span><span>Fund</span><span>”</span><span>) or any company or companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund if, immediately </span><span>after such sale or disposition: (i) more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of </span><span>the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and any company or companies </span><span>controlled by the Acquiring Fund, or (ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding voting </span><span>stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and other investment </span><span>companies and companies controlled by them. However, registered investment </span><span>companies are permitted to invest in the Fund beyond the limits set forth in Section </span><span>12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in SEC rules. In order for a </span><span>registered investment company to invest in shares of the Fund beyond the limitations </span><span>of Section 12(d)(1) in reliance on Rule 12d1-4 under the 1940 Act, the registered </span><span>investment company must, among other things, enter into an agreement with the </span><span>Trust. Foreign investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund only up to the </span><span>limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to any applicable SEC no-action relief.</span></div> <div><span>Book Entry.</span><span> Shares of the Fund are held in book-entry form, which means that no </span><span>stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (</span><span>“</span><span>DTC</span><span>”</span><span>) or its nominee is </span><span>the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as shown on the records of </span><span>DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. </span><span>DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, </span><span>clearing corporations and other institutions that directly or indirectly maintain a </span><span>custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to </span><span>receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your </span><span>name, and you are not considered a registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise </span><span>any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its </span><span>participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other </span><span>securities that you hold in book-entry or </span><span>“</span><span>street name</span><span>”</span><span> form.</span></div> <div><span>Share Prices.</span><span> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market </span><span>generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as </span><span>the supply of and demand for ETF shares and shares of underlying securities held by </span><span>the Fund, economic conditions and other factors.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>20</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Determination of Net Asset Value. </span><span>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined </span><span>once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the close of regular trading hours of </span><span>the New York Stock Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>NYSE</span><span>”</span><span>) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day </span><span>that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that </span><span>any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are </span><span>translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as </span><span>quoted by one or more data service providers. The NAV of the Fund is calculated by </span><span>dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the value of its total assets less </span><span>total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally </span><span>rounded to the nearest cent.</span></div> <div><span>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities held by the Fund is </span><span>determined pursuant to BFA’s valuation policies and procedures. BFA has been </span><span>designated by the Board as the valuation designee for the Fund pursuant to Rule 2a-5 </span><span>under the Investment Company Act.</span></div> <div><span>Equity securities and other equity instruments for which market quotations are readily </span><span>available are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the last </span><span>reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the last </span><span>traded price on the exchange or market on which the security or instrument is </span><span>primarily traded at the time of valuation. Shares of underlying open-end funds </span><span>(including money market funds) are valued at net asset value. Shares of underlying </span><span>exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs are valued at their most recent </span><span>closing price.</span></div> <div><span>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities and money market instruments is substantially </span><span>completed each day at various times prior to the close of regular trading hours of the </span><span>NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are </span><span>determined as of such times.</span></div> <div><span>When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be </span><span>unreliable, BFA will fair value the Fund’s investments in accordance with its policies </span><span>and procedures. BFA may conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is </span><span>unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its </span><span>lack of trading or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent </span><span>price quotations or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security </span><span>or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent </span><span>to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is </span><span>listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is </span><span>available. A </span><span>“</span><span>significant event</span><span>”</span><span> is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable </span><span>business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s assets or liabilities, that </span><span>the event is likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or </span><span>closing market price of one or more assets held by, or liabilities of, the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The </span><span>fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might </span><span>reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to </span><span>extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments </span><span>using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market </span><span>valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>21</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value </span><span>prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the </span><span>prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, </span><span>which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the </span><span>performance of the Underlying Index.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends and Distributions</span></div> <div><span>General Policies.</span><span> Dividends from net investment income, if any, generally are declared </span><span>and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, </span><span>if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make </span><span>distributions on a more frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to </span><span>declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or </span><span>advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company (</span><span>“</span><span>RIC</span><span>”</span><span>) or to avoid </span><span>imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are distributed on a </span><span>pro rata</span><span> </span><span>basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC </span><span>participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds </span><span>received from the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Dividend Reinvestment Service.</span><span> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the </span><span>Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment </span><span>Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend </span><span>distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the </span><span>availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers </span><span>may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this </span><span>service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains </span><span>will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in </span><span>the secondary market.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes.</span><span> As with any investment, you should consider how your investment in shares of </span><span>the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general </span><span>information, based on current law. You should consult your own tax professional about </span><span>the tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Unless your investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred</span><span> retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally </span><span>will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax </span><span>consequences when the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes on Distributions.</span><span> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income (other </span><span>than qualified dividend income), including</span><span> </span><span>distributions of income from securities </span><span>lending and distributions out of the Fund’s net short-term capital gains, if any, are </span><span>taxable to you as ordinary income. Distributions by the Fund of net long-term capital </span><span>gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain dividends) are </span><span>taxable to you as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the </span><span>Fund’s shares. Distributions by the Fund that qualify as qualified dividend income are </span><span>taxable to you at long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified </span><span>dividend income are generally eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for </span><span>non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>22</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>threshold amounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is </span><span>imposed on </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income,</span><span>”</span><span> including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, </span><span>and net gain, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if </span><span>married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends will be qualified dividend income to you if they are attributable to qualified </span><span>dividend income received by the Fund. Generally, qualified dividend income includes </span><span>dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S. corporations, </span><span>provided that the Fund satisfies certain holding period requirements in respect of the </span><span>stock of such corporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. </span><span>Substitute dividends received by the Fund with respect to dividends paid on securities </span><span>lent out will not be qualified dividend income. For this purpose, a qualified non-U.S. </span><span>corporation means any non-U.S. corporation that is eligible for benefits under a </span><span>comprehensive income tax treaty with the U.S., which includes an exchange of </span><span>information program, or if the stock with respect to which the dividend was paid is </span><span>readily tradable on an established U.S. securities market. The term excludes a </span><span>corporation that is a passive foreign investment company.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends received by the Fund from a RIC generally are qualified dividend income only </span><span>to the extent such dividend distributions are made out of qualified dividend income </span><span>received by such RIC. Additionally, it is expected that dividends received by the Fund </span><span>from a REIT and distributed to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the </span><span>shareholder as ordinary income. However, for tax years beginning after December 31, </span><span>2017 and before January 1, 2026, the Fund may report dividends eligible for a 20% </span><span>“</span><span>qualified business income</span><span>”</span><span> deduction for non-corporate U.S. shareholders to the </span><span>extent the Fund’s income is derived from ordinary REIT dividends, reduced by allocable </span><span>Fund expenses.</span></div> <div><span>For a dividend to be treated as qualified dividend income, the dividend must be </span><span>received with respect to a share of stock held without being hedged by the Fund, and </span><span>with respect to a share of the Fund held without being hedged by you, for 61 days </span><span>during the 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days before the date on </span><span>which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of </span><span>certain preferred stock, 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before </span><span>such date.</span></div> <div><span>Fund distributions, to the extent attributable to dividends from U.S. corporations, will </span><span>be eligible for the dividends received deduction for Fund shareholders that are </span><span>corporations, subject to certain hedging and holding requirements.</span></div> <div><span>In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal income tax for the year when </span><span>they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on </span><span>December 31 of the prior year.</span></div> <div><span>If the Fund’s distributions exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits, all or </span><span>a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a </span><span>return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum </span><span>distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be </span><span>taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return </span><span>of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder’s </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>23</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>cost basis and result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those shares on </span><span>which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is </span><span>reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the shareholder </span><span>holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</span></div> <div><span>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if you are a non-U.S. entity </span><span>(other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s </span><span>ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) </span><span>will generally be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate </span><span>applies, provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income </span><span>realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital </span><span>gains or upon the sale or other disposition of shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, </span><span>interest and other income items paid to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S.</span><span> investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the U.S. Internal </span><span>Revenue Service (</span><span>“</span><span>IRS</span><span>”</span><span>) information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account </span><span>holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information </span><span>regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial </span><span>institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will </span><span>provide the IRS information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer </span><span>identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders, comply with due </span><span>diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts, report to the </span><span>IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax </span><span>on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account </span><span>holders who fail to provide the required information, and determine certain other </span><span>information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable </span><span>intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local </span><span>revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may </span><span>need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each </span><span>substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless </span><span>certain exceptions apply.</span></div> <div><span>If your Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending arrangement, you </span><span>may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends paid while the shares are held by the </span><span>borrower as qualified dividend income.</span></div> <div><span>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup withholding at a 24% rate </span><span>will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer </span><span>identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes When Shares Are Sold.</span><span> Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale </span><span>of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been </span><span>held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund </span><span>shares held for one year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except </span><span>that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term</span><span> capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to </span><span>such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from </span><span>capital gain dividends, are included in </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income</span><span>”</span><span> for purposes of the </span><span>3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned above.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>24</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The foregoing discussion summarizes some of the consequences under current U.S. </span><span>federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. </span><span>You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and sales of </span><span>shares. Consult your personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an </span><span>investment in shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</span></div> <div><span>Creations and Redemptions.</span><span> Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the </span><span>Fund are </span><span>“</span><span>created</span><span>”</span><span> at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in </span><span>block-size Creation Units or multiples thereof. Each </span><span>“</span><span>creator</span><span>”</span><span> or authorized participant </span><span>(an </span><span>“</span><span>Authorized Participant</span><span>”</span><span>) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's </span><span>Distributor, an affiliate of BFA. An Authorized Participant is a member or participant of </span><span>a clearing agency registered with the SEC, which has a written agreement with the </span><span>Fund or one of its service providers that allows such member or participant to place </span><span>orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units.</span></div> <div><span>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the Distributor and the Fund, </span><span>generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a </span><span>designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>creation basket</span><span>”</span><span>), and </span><span>an amount of cash (including any cash representing the value of substituted securities, </span><span>assets or other positions), if any, which together approximate the holdings of the Fund </span><span>in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. Similarly, shares can be </span><span>redeemed only in Creation Units, generally for a designated portfolio of securities, </span><span>assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>redemption basket</span><span>”</span><span>) held by the Fund and an amount of </span><span>cash (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted). The </span><span>Fund may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units partially or solely for cash. </span><span>Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by the Fund. </span><span>Creation and redemption baskets may differ and the Fund may accept </span><span>“</span><span>custom </span><span>baskets.</span><span>”</span><span> More information regarding custom baskets is contained in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> <div><span>The prices at which creations and redemptions occur are based on the next calculation </span><span>of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under </span><span>the authorized participant agreement.</span></div> <div><span>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation Units with the Fund. </span><span>Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or </span><span>for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>In the event of a system failure or other interruption, including disruptions at market </span><span>makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either </span><span>may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at </span><span>all, or the Fund may not be able to place or change orders.</span></div> <div><span>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind transactions, the Fund intends to comply </span><span>with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying </span><span>redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any </span><span>securities accepted for deposit and any securities used to satisfy redemption requests </span><span>will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities </span><span>Act of 1933, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1933 Act</span><span>”</span><span>). Further, an Authorized Participant that is </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>25</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>not a </span><span>“</span><span>qualified institutional buyer,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the </span><span>1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule </span><span>144A.</span></div> <div><span>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is either a member of the </span><span>Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a </span><span>DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to </span><span>creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations. Information about the </span><span>procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off </span><span>times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> <div><span>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing basis, at any point </span><span>during the life of the Fund a </span><span>“</span><span>distribution,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may </span><span>be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on </span><span>their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed </span><span>participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters </span><span>subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any </span><span>determination of whether one is an underwriter must take into account all the relevant </span><span>facts and circumstances of each particular case.</span></div> <div><span>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not </span><span>“</span><span>underwriters</span><span>”</span><span> but are </span><span>participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and </span><span>thus dealing with shares that are part of an </span><span>“</span><span>unsold allotment</span><span>”</span><span> within the meaning of </span><span>Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the 1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the </span><span>prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For </span><span>delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of </span><span>Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is available only with respect to transactions on a </span><span>national securities exchange.</span></div> <div><span>Householding.</span><span> Householding is an option available to certain Fund investors. </span><span>Householding is a method of delivery, based on the preference of the individual </span><span>investor, in which a single copy of certain shareholder documents can be delivered to </span><span>investors who share the same address, even if their accounts are registered under </span><span>different names. Please contact your broker-dealer if you are interested in enrolling in </span><span>householding and receiving a single copy of prospectuses and other shareholder </span><span>documents, or if you are currently enrolled in householding and wish to change your </span><span>householding status.</span></div> <div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>26</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Distribution</span></div> <div><span>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the Fund on an agency basis. </span><span>The Distributor does not maintain a secondary market in shares of the Fund. The </span><span>Distributor has no role in determining the policies of the Fund or the securities that are </span><span>purchased or sold by the Fund. The Distributor’s principal address is 1 University </span><span>Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</span></div> <div><span>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers, registered investment advisers, </span><span>banks or other intermediaries (together, </span><span>“</span><span>intermediaries</span><span>”</span><span>) related to marketing </span><span>activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the </span><span>development of technology platforms and reporting systems, data provision services, </span><span>or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their </span><span>customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may </span><span>be significant to the intermediary, are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments </span><span>are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or </span><span>indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type </span><span>are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may </span><span>make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or </span><span>the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other </span><span>financial incentives it is eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial </span><span>incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the </span><span>intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the </span><span>Fund or other iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding </span><span>these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. </span><span>Please contact your salesperson or </span><span>other investment professional for more information regarding any such </span><span>payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</span></div> <div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>27</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Financial Highlights</span></div> <div><span>The financial highlights table is intended to help investors understand the Fund’s </span><span>financial performance for the past five years.
