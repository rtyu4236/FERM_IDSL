China</span></span>. Investments in Chinese securities, including certain Hong Kong-listed and U.S.-listed securities, subject the Fund to risks specific to China. China may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability. China is an emerging market and demonstrates significantly higher volatility from time to time in comparison to developed markets. Over the last few decades, the Chinese government has undertaken reform of economic and market practices and has expanded the sphere of private ownership of property in China. However, Chinese markets generally continue to experience inefficiency, volatility and pricing anomalies resulting from governmental influence, a lack of publicly available information and/or political and social instability. Chinese companies are also subject to the risk that Chinese authorities can intervene in their operations and structure. Internal social unrest or confrontations with neighboring countries, including military conflicts in response to such events, may also disrupt economic development in China and result in a greater risk of currency fluctuations, currency non‑convertibility, interest rate fluctuations and higher rates of inflation. </span></div> </ix:continuation> </ix:continuation> </ix:continuation> </ix:continuation> </ix:continuation> </ix:continuation> </ix:continuation> </ix:continuation> </ix:continuation> </ix:continuation> </ix:continuation> </ix:continuation> </ix:continuation> </ix:continuation> </ix:continuation> </ix:continuation> </ix:continuation> </ix:continuation> </ix:continuation> <ix:continuation continuedat="t_1_828eea30_6b61_5278_8b93_8e116d48f82e_12"> <ix:continuation continuedat="t_2_a43da002_2f02_c846_9a1d_183045496ee8_12"> <ix:continuation continuedat="t_3_48b63e02_cb78_cfed_c68d_018db3466cce_12"> <ix:continuation continuedat="t_4_2f626d58_36e8_d98c_2940_dbb941d02ab3_12"> <ix:continuation continuedat="t_5_df42a9dd_4fb5_350c_efa0_5a1222c9a766_12"> <ix:continuation continuedat="t_6_b9ae0519_a7de_7b15_30e0_2399a7b83f94_12"> <ix:continuation continuedat="t_7_3b463594_4244_5f94_ff94_7e16df1b9b49_12"> <ix:continuation continuedat="t_8_2b73aa9a_bd8c_1ef4_144a_9bbe59bd4d28_12"> <ix:continuation continuedat="t_10_fef5e0e5_dd9d_bdcc_0379_11eec8e85b74_12"> <ix:continuation continuedat="t_11_29440538_281f_d204_89eb_a0697fa4531f_12"> <ix:continuation continuedat="t_12_b107122a_ea76_6756_4f46_682bd8267e6c_12"> <ix:continuation continuedat="t_13_6cb0eb86_8981_e453_cf5a_0736364e43b7_12"> <ix:continuation continuedat="t_14_5b4c08cc_67f2_1fb4_980c_50a5eca77883_12"> <ix:continuation continuedat="t_15_96dd534f_be88_b0fd_8b3e_862dbba0bd91_12"> <ix:continuation continuedat="t_16_c91c1571_aec8_7ff4_fd44_3d88355a9edd_12"> <ix:continuation continuedat="t_17_3c783871_d21f_86da_61fe_04c2ee1ad7f6_12"> <ix:continuation continuedat="t_18_03cfda9c_d480_4036_0e1c_2e37bbb6dec5_12"> <ix:continuation continuedat="t_19_8a98b488_7374_a43e_86ff_5e115b6f4bc4_12"> <ix:continuation continuedat="t_20_98c013b4_db6d_9306_2f64_b5c157725c2f_12"> <div><span>China has experienced security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations.

Investments in Chinese securities, including certain Hong Kong-listed and U.S.-listed securities, subject the Fund to </span></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div><span> risks specific to China. The Chinese economy is subject to a considerable degree of economic, political and social instability. </span></div> <div><span><span>Political and Social Risk</span>. The Chinese government is authoritarian and has periodically used force to suppress civil dissent. Disparities of wealth and the pace of economic liberalization may lead to social turmoil, violence and labor unrest. In addition, China continues to experience disagreements related to integration with Hong Kong and religious and nationalist disputes in Tibet and Xinjiang. There is also a greater risk in China than in many other countries of currency fluctuations, currency non‑convertibility, interest rate fluctuations and higher rates of inflation as a result of internal social unrest or conflicts with other countries. Unanticipated political or social developments may result in sudden and significant investment losses. China’s growing income inequality, rapidly aging population and significant environmental issues also are factors that may affect the Chinese economy. </span></div> <div><span><span>Government Control and Regulations</span>. The Chinese government has implemented significant economic reforms in order to liberalize trade policy, promote foreign investment in the economy, reduce government control of the economy and develop market mechanisms. There can be no assurance that these reforms will continue or that they will be effective. Despite recent reform and privatizations, government control over certain sectors or enterprises and significant regulation of investment and industry is still pervasive, including restrictions on investment in companies or industries deemed to be sensitive to particular national interests, trading of securities of Chinese issuers, foreign ownership of Chinese corporations and/or the repatriation of assets by foreign investors. Limitations or restrictions on foreign ownership of securities may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the Fund and could lead to higher tracking error. Chinese government intervention in the market may have a negative impact on market sentiment, which may in turn affect the performance of the Chinese economy and the Fund’s investments. Chinese markets generally continue to experience inefficiency, volatility and pricing anomalies that may be connected to governmental influence, lack of publicly available information, and political and social instability. Chinese companies, such as those in the financial services or technology sectors, and potentially other sectors in the future, are also subject to the risk that Chinese authorities can intervene in their operations and structure, which may negatively affect the value of the Fund’s investments. </span></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div><span><span>Economic Risk</span>. The Chinese economy has grown rapidly in the recent past, and there is no assurance that this growth rate will be maintained. In fact, the Chinese economy may experience a significant slowdown as a result of, among other things, a deterioration in global demand for Chinese exports, as well as a contraction in spending on domestic goods by Chinese consumers. In addition, China may experience substantial rates of inflation or economic recessions, which would have a negative effect on its economy and securities market. Delays in enterprise restructuring, slow development of well-functioning financial markets and widespread corruption have also hindered the performance of the Chinese economy. China continues to receive substantial pressure from trading partners to liberalize official currency exchange rates. Reduction in spending on Chinese products and services, institution of additional tariffs or other trade barriers (including as a result of heightened trade tensions between China and the U.S. or in response to actual or alleged Chinese cyber activity) or a downturn in any of the economies of China’s key trading partners may have an adverse impact on the Chinese economy and the Chinese issuers of securities in which the Fund invests. For example, the U.S. has added certain foreign technology companies to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security’s “Entity List,” which is a list of companies believed to pose a national security risk to the U.S. Actions like these may have unanticipated and disruptive effects on the Chinese economy. Any such response that targets Chinese financial markets or securities exchanges could interfere with orderly trading, delay settlement or cause market disruptions. </span></div> <div><span><span>Expropriation Risk</span>. The Chinese government maintains a major role in economic policymaking, and investing in China involves risk of loss due to expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and on repatriation of capital invested. </span></div> <div><span><span>Security Risk</span>. China has strained international relations with Taiwan, India, Russia and other neighbors due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense concerns and other security concerns. Additionally, China is alleged to have participated in state-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign companies and foreign governments. Actual and threatened responses to such activity and strained international relations, including purchasing restrictions, sanctions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Chinese government or Chinese companies, may impact China’s economy and Chinese issuers of securities in which the Fund invests. Relations between China’s Han ethnic majority and other ethnic groups in China, including Tibetans and Uighurs, are also </span></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div><span> strained and have been marked by protests and violence. These situations may cause uncertainty in the Chinese market and may adversely affect the Chinese economy. In addition, conflict on the Korean Peninsula could adversely affect the Chinese economy. </span></div> <div><span><span>Chinese Equity Markets</span>. The Fund invests in Chinese securities, including H‑shares, A‑shares, B‑shares, Red‑Chips and/or P‑Chips. The issuance of B‑shares and H‑shares by Chinese companies and the ability to obtain a “back-door listing” through Red‑Chips or P‑Chips is still regarded by the Chinese authorities as an experiment in economic reform. “Back-door listing” is a means by which a mainland Chinese company issues Red‑Chips or P‑Chips to obtain quick access to international listing and international capital. These share mechanisms are subject to the political and economic policies in China. The Fund may also invest in Chinese companies listed on U.S. exchanges, such as American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”) or variable interest entities (“VIEs”), which are subject to the investment risks associated with the underlying Chinese issuer or operating company. Instead of directly owning the equity securities of a Chinese company, a VIE enters into service contracts and other contracts with the Chinese company, which provide the VIE with exposure to the company. Intervention by the Chinese government with respect to VIEs could significantly affect the Chinese operating company’s performance and the enforceability of the VIE’s contractual arrangements with the Chinese company. </span></div> <div><span><span>Hong Kong Political Risk</span>. Hong Kong reverted to Chinese sovereignty on July 1, 1997 as a Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China under the principle of “one country, two systems.” Although China is obligated to maintain the current capitalist economic and social system of Hong Kong through June 30, 2047, the continuation of economic and social freedoms enjoyed in Hong Kong is dependent on the government of China. Since 1997, there have been tensions between the Chinese government and many people in Hong Kong who perceive China as tightening control over Hong Kong’s semi-autonomous liberal political, economic, legal and social framework. Recent protests and unrest have increased tensions even further. Due to the interconnected nature of the Hong Kong and Chinese economies, this instability in Hong Kong may cause uncertainty in the Hong Kong and Chinese markets. In addition, the Hong Kong dollar trades at a fixed exchange rate in relation to (or is “pegged” to) the U.S. dollar, which has contributed to the growth and stability of the Hong Kong economy. However, it is uncertain how long the currency peg will continue or what effect the establishment of an alternative exchange rate system would have on the Hong Kong economy. Because the Fund’s NAV is </span></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div><span> denominated in U.S. dollars, the establishment of an alternative exchange rate system could result in a decline in the Fund’s NAV. </span></div> <div><span><span>Limited Information and Legal Remedies</span>. Chinese companies, including Chinese companies that are listed on U.S. exchanges, are not subject to the same degree of regulatory requirements, accounting standards or auditor oversight as companies in more developed countries. As a result, information about the Chinese securities in which the Fund invests may be less reliable or complete. Chinese companies with securities listed on U.S. exchanges may be delisted if they do not meet U.S. accounting standards and auditor oversight requirements, which would significantly decrease the liquidity and value of the securities. There may be significant obstacles to obtaining information necessary for investigations into or litigation against Chinese companies, and shareholders may have limited legal remedies. The Fund is not actively managed and does not select investments based on investor protection considerations. </span></div> <div><span><span></span><span><span>Change in “General Considerations and Risks” of each Fund listed in Appendix A, Appendix B and Appendix C </span></span></span></div> <div><span><span>In the “General Considerations and Risks” section of the SAI of each Fund listed in Appendix A and Appendix B, the sections entitled “</span><span><span>Risk of Investing in China</span></span><span>” and, as applicable, the “</span><span><span>Risk of Investing in the Chinese Equity Markets</span></span><span>” are hereby deleted in their entirety and replaced with the following, and the following is hereby added to the “General Considerations and Risks” section of the SAI of each Fund listed in Appendix C, except that the “</span><span><span>Risk of Investing in the Chinese Equity Markets</span></span><span>” section is <span>not</span> added to the SAI for each of the iShares China Large-Cap ETF, iShares Emerging Markets Dividend ETF, iShares MSCI Pacific ex Japan ETF, iShares Asia/Pacific Dividend ETF and iShares MSCI Hong Kong ETF: </span></span></div> <div><span><span>Risk of Investing in China</span>. Investments in securities of companies domiciled in China involve a high degree of risk and special considerations not typically associated with investing in the U.S. securities markets. Such heightened risks include, among others, an authoritarian government, popular unrest associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions, the impact of regional conflict on the economy and hostile relations with neighboring countries. </span></div> <div><span>Military conflicts, either in response to internal social unrest or conflicts with other countries, could disrupt economic development. The Chinese economy is vulnerable to the long-running disagreements and religious and nationalist disputes with Tibet and the Xinjiang region. Since 1997, there have been tensions between the Chinese government and many </span></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div><span> people in Hong Kong who perceive China as tightening control over Hong Kong’s semi-autonomous liberal political, economic, legal, and social framework. Recent protests and unrest have increased tensions even further. Due to the interconnected nature of the Hong Kong and Chinese economies, this instability in Hong Kong may cause uncertainty in the Hong Kong and Chinese markets. China has a complex territorial dispute regarding the sovereignty of Taiwan and has made threats of invasion. Taiwan-based companies and individuals are significant investors in China. Military conflict between China and Taiwan may adversely affect securities of Chinese issuers. In addition, China has strained international relations with Japan, India, Russia and other neighbors due to territorial disputes, historical animosities and other defense concerns. Additionally, China is alleged to have participated in state-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign companies and foreign governments. Actual and threatened responses to such activity and strained international relations, including purchasing restrictions, sanctions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Chinese government or Chinese companies, may impact China’s economy and Chinese issuers of securities in which the Fund invests. China could be affected by military events on the Korean peninsula or internal instability within North Korea. These situations may cause uncertainty in the Chinese market and may adversely affect the performance of the Chinese economy. </span></div> <div><span>The Chinese government has implemented significant economic reforms in order to liberalize trade policy, promote foreign investment in the economy, reduce government control of the economy and develop market mechanisms. However, there can be no assurance that these reforms will continue or that they will be effective. Despite reforms and privatizations of companies in certain sectors, the Chinese government still exercises substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector and may own or control many companies. Chinese companies, such as those in the financial services or technology sectors, and potentially other sectors in the future, are subject to the risk that Chinese authorities can intervene in their operations and structure. The Chinese government continues to maintain a major role in economic policymaking. Investing in China involves risk of loss due to expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and on repatriation of capital invested. </span></div> <div><span>In addition, there is less regulation and monitoring of Chinese securities markets and the activities of investors, brokers and other participants than in the U.S. Accordingly, issuers of securities in China, including Chinese companies that are listed on U.S. exchanges, are not subject to </span></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div><span> the same degree of regulation as are U.S. issuers with respect to such matters as insider trading rules, tender offer regulation, accounting standards or auditor oversight, stockholder proxy requirements and the requirements mandating timely and accurate disclosure of information. Securities markets in China are in the process of change and further development. This may lead to trading volatility, difficulty in the settlement and recording of transactions and difficulty in interpreting and applying the relevant regulation. </span></div> <div><span>The Chinese government has taken positions that prevent the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) from inspecting the audit work and practices of accounting firms in mainland China and Hong Kong for compliance with U.S. law and professional standards. Audits performed by PCAOB-registered accounting firms in mainland China and Hong Kong may be less reliable than those performed by firms subject to PCAOB inspection. Accordingly, information about the Chinese securities in which the Fund invests may be less reliable or complete. Under amendments to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act enacted in December 2020, which requires that the PCAOB be permitted to inspect the accounting firm of a U.S.-listed Chinese issuer, Chinese companies with securities listed on U.S. exchanges may be delisted if the PCAOB is unable to inspect the accounting firm. </span></div> <div><span>There may be significant obstacles to obtaining information necessary for investigations into or litigation against Chinese companies, and shareholders may have limited legal remedies. The Fund is not actively managed and does not select investments based on investor protection considerations. </span></div> <div><span>While the Chinese economy has experienced past periods of rapid growth, there is no assurance that such growth rates will recur. China may experience substantial rates of inflation or economic recessions, causing a negative effect on the economy and securities market. China’s economy is heavily dependent on export growth. Reduction in spending on Chinese products and services, institution of additional tariffs or other trade barriers (including as a result of heightened trade tensions between China and the U.S. or in response to actual or alleged Chinese cyber activity) or a downturn in any of the economies of China’s key trading partners may have an adverse impact on the Chinese economy and the Chinese issuers of securities in which the Fund invests. For example, the U.S. has added certain foreign technology companies to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security’s “Entity List,” which is a list of companies believed to pose a national security risk to the U.S. Actions like these may have unanticipated and disruptive effects on the Chinese economy. </span></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div><span> Any such response that targets Chinese financial markets or securities exchanges could interfere with orderly trading, delay settlement or cause market disruptions. </span></div> <div><span>The tax laws and regulations in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) are subject to change, including the issuance of authoritative guidance or enforcement, possibly with retroactive effect. The interpretation, applicability and enforcement of such laws by PRC tax authorities are not as consistent and transparent as those of more developed nations and may vary over time and from region to region. The application and enforcement of PRC tax rules could have a significant adverse effect on the Fund and its investors, particularly in relation to capital gains withholding tax imposed upon non‑residents. In addition, the accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and practices applicable to Chinese companies may be less rigorous and may result in significant differences between financial statements prepared in accordance with PRC accounting standards and practice and those prepared in accordance with international accounting standards. </span></div> <div><span><span>Risk of Investing in the Chinese Equity Markets</span>. The Fund may invest in H‑shares (securities of companies incorporated in the PRC that are denominated in Hong Kong dollars and listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (“SEHK”)), A‑shares (securities of companies incorporated in the PRC that are denominated in renminbi and listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange (“SSE”) and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (“SZSE”)) and/or B‑shares (securities of companies incorporated in the PRC that are denominated in U.S. dollars (in the case of the SSE) or Hong Kong dollars (in the case of the SZSE) and listed on the SSE and the SZSE). The Fund may also invest in certain Hong Kong-listed securities known as Red‑Chips (securities issued by companies that are incorporated in certain foreign jurisdictions and that are controlled, directly or indirectly, by entities owned by the national government or local governments in the PRC and derive substantial revenues from or allocate substantial assets in the PRC) and P‑Chips (securities issued by companies that are incorporated in certain foreign jurisdictions and that are controlled, directly or indirectly, by individuals in the PRC and derive substantial revenues from or allocate substantial assets in the PRC). </span></div> <div><span>The Fund may also invest in Chinese companies listed on U.S. exchanges, such as ADRs or variable interest entities (“VIEs”), which are subject to the investment risks associated with the underlying Chinese issuer or operating company. Chinese operating companies listed on U.S. exchanges are often structured as VIEs. Instead of directly owning the equity securities of a Chinese company, a VIE enters into service contracts and other contracts with the Chinese company, which provide </span></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div><span> the VIE with exposure to the company. Although the VIE has no equity ownership of the Chinese operating company, the contractual arrangements permit the VIE to consolidate the Chinese operating company into its financial statements. Intervention by the Chinese government with respect to VIEs could significantly affect the Chinese operating company’s performance and the enforceability of the VIE’s contractual arrangements with the Chinese company. </span></div> <div><span>Securities listed on the SSE or the SZSE are divided into two classes: A‑shares, which are mostly limited to domestic investors, and B‑shares, which are allocated for both international and domestic investors. The A‑shares market is generally subject to greater government restrictions, including trading suspensions, which may lead to increased liquidity risks. The B‑shares market is generally smaller and less liquid and has a smaller issuer base than the A‑shares market, which may lead to significant price volatility. B‑shares, H‑shares, P‑Chips or Red‑Chips of issuers that also issue A‑shares may trade at significant discounts to their A‑shares counterparts. The issuance of B‑shares and H‑shares by Chinese companies and the ability to obtain a “back-door listing” through Red‑Chips or P‑Chips is still regarded by the Chinese authorities as an experiment in economic reform. “Back-door listing” is a means by which a mainland Chinese company issues Red‑Chips or P‑Chips to obtain quick access to international listing and international capital. These share mechanisms are subject to the political and economic policies in China. Market developments, adverse investor perceptions, regulatory and government intervention (including the possibility of widespread trading suspensions implemented by regulators) and other factors may make it difficult to acquire, dispose of or value Chinese securities, which would lead to adverse effects to the Fund. </span></div> <div><span><span>Risk of Investing in A‑shares through Stock Connect</span>. </span></div> <div><span>The Fund may invest in A‑shares through the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect program (“Shanghai Connect”) or the Shenzhen‑Hong Kong Stock Connect program (“Shenzhen Connect,” and together with Shanghai Connect, “Stock Connect”). Stock Connect is a securities trading and clearing program with an aim to achieve mutual stock market access between the PRC and Hong Kong. Stock Connect was developed by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, the SSE (in the case of Shanghai Connect) or the SZSE (in the case of Shenzhen Connect), and China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation Limited (“CSDCC”). Under Stock Connect, the Fund’s trading of eligible A‑shares listed on the SSE or the SZSE, as applicable, would be effectuated through its Hong Kong brokers. Investing in A‑shares </span></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div><span> through Stock Connect is subject to trading, clearance, settlement and other procedures, which could pose risks to the Fund. </span></div> <div><span>Although no individual investment quotas or licensing requirements apply to investors in Stock Connect, trading through Stock Connect is subject to a daily quota (the “Daily Quota”), which limits the maximum net purchases under Stock Connect each day. The Daily Quota does not belong to the Fund and is utilized on a first-come-first-serve basis. As such, buy orders for A‑shares would be rejected once the Daily Quota is exceeded (although the Fund will be permitted to sell A‑shares regardless of the Daily Quota balance). The Daily Quota may restrict the Fund’s ability to invest in A‑shares through Stock Connect on a timely basis, which could affect the Fund’s ability to effectively pursue its investment strategy. The Daily Quota is also subject to change. A‑shares purchased through Stock Connect generally may only be sold or otherwise transferred through Stock Connect and in accordance with applicable rules. In order to comply with applicable local market rules and to facilitate orderly operations of the Fund, including the timely settlement of Stock Connect trades placed by or on behalf of the Fund, BFA utilizes an operating model that will only be used by iShares ETFs with investments in A‑shares through Stock Connect. Such operating model may reduce the risks of trade failures; however, it will also allow Stock Connect trades to be settled without prior verification by the Fund. Accordingly, this operating model may subject the Fund to additional risks, including an increased risk of inadvertently exceeding certain trade or other restrictions or limits placed on the Fund and/or its affiliates, and a heightened risk of erroneous trades, which may negatively impact the Fund. </span></div> <div><span>While A‑shares must be designated as eligible to be traded through Stock Connect (such eligible A‑shares listed on the SSE, the “SSE Securities,” and such eligible A‑shares listed on the SZSE, the “SZSE Securities”), those A‑shares may also lose such designation, and if this occurs, such A‑shares may be sold but could no longer be purchased through Stock Connect. With respect to sell orders through Stock Connect, the SEHK carries out pre‑trade checks to ensure an investor has sufficient A‑shares in its account before the market opens on the trading day. Accordingly, if there are insufficient A‑shares in an investor’s account before the market opens on the trading day, the sell order will be rejected, which may adversely impact the Fund’s performance. </span></div> <div><span>In addition, Stock Connect operates only on days when both the Chinese and the Hong Kong markets are open for trading and when banking services are available in both markets on the corresponding settlement days. Therefore, an investment in A‑shares through Stock </span></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div><span> Connect may subject the Fund to the risk of price fluctuations on days when the Chinese markets are open, but Stock Connect is not trading. Each of the SEHK, SSE and SZSE reserves the right to suspend trading through Stock Connect under certain circumstances. Where such a suspension of trading is effected, the Fund’s ability to access A‑shares through Stock Connect will be adversely affected. In addition, if one or both of the Chinese and the Hong Kong markets are closed on a U.S. trading day, the Fund may not be able to acquire or dispose of A‑shares through Stock Connect in a timely manner, which could adversely affect the Fund’s performance. </span></div> <div><span>The Fund’s investments in A‑shares though Stock Connect are held by its custodian in accounts in the Central Clearing and Settlement System (“CCASS”) maintained by the Hong Kong Securities Clearing Company Limited (“HKSCC”), which in turn holds the A‑shares, as the nominee holder, through an omnibus securities account in its name registered with the CSDCC. The precise nature and rights of the Fund as the beneficial owner of SSE Securities or SZSE Securities through HKSCC as nominee is not well defined under PRC law. There is a lack of a clear definition of, and distinction between, legal ownership and beneficial ownership under PRC law, and there have been few cases involving a nominee account structure in the PRC courts. The exact nature and methods of enforcement of the rights and interests of the Fund under PRC law are also uncertain. In the unlikely event that HKSCC becomes subject to winding‑up proceedings in Hong Kong, there is a risk that SSE Securities or SZSE Securities may not be regarded as held for the beneficial ownership of the Fund or as part of the general assets of HKSCC available for general distribution to its creditors. </span></div> <div><span>Notwithstanding the fact that HKSCC does not claim proprietary interests in the SSE Securities or SZSE Securities held in its omnibus stock account in the CSDCC, the CSDCC as the share registrar for SSE‑ or SZSE-listed companies will still treat HKSCC as one of the shareholders when it handles corporate actions in respect of such SSE Securities or SZSE Securities. HKSCC monitors the corporate actions affecting SSE Securities and SZSE Securities and keeps participants of CCASS informed of all such corporate actions that require CCASS participants to take steps in order to participate in them. The Fund will therefore depend on HKSCC for both settlement and notification and implementation of corporate actions. </span></div> <div><span>The HKSCC is responsible for the clearing, settlement and provision of depositary, nominee and other related services of the trades executed by Hong Kong market participants and investors. Accordingly, investors do not hold SSE Securities or SZSE Securities directly; rather, they are </span></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div><span> held through their brokers’ or custodians’ accounts with CCASS. The HKSCC and the CSDCC establish clearing links, and each has become a participant of the other to facilitate clearing and settlement of cross-border trades. Should CSDCC default and the CSDCC be declared as a defaulter, HKSCC’s liabilities in Stock Connect under its market contracts with clearing participants will be limited to assisting clearing participants in pursuing their claims against the CSDCC. In that event, the Fund may suffer delays in the recovery process or may not be able to fully recover its losses from the CSDCC. </span></div> <div><span>Market participants are able to participate in Stock Connect subject to meeting certain information technology capability, risk management and other requirements as may be specified by the relevant exchange and/or clearing house. Further, the “connectivity” in Stock Connect requires the routing of orders across the borders of Hong Kong and the PRC. This requires the development of new information technology systems on the part of the SEHK and exchange participants. There is no assurance that these systems will function properly or will continue to be adapted to changes and developments in both markets. In the event that the relevant systems fail to function properly, trading in A‑shares through Stock Connect could be disrupted, and the Fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective may be adversely affected. </span></div> <div><span>The Shanghai Connect program, launched in November 2014, and the Shenzhen Connect program, launched in December 2016, do not have an extensive operating history. Stock Connect is subject to regulations promulgated by regulatory authorities and implementation rules made by the stock exchanges in the PRC and Hong Kong. There is no certainty as to how the current regulations will be applied or interpreted going forward, and new or revised regulations may be issued from time to time by the regulators and stock exchanges in China and Hong Kong in connection with operations, legal enforcement and cross-border trades under Stock Connect. In addition, there can be no assurance that Stock Connect will not be discontinued. The Fund may be adversely affected as a result of such changes. Furthermore, the securities regimes and legal systems of China and Hong Kong differ significantly, and issues may arise based on these differences. Further, different fees, costs and taxes are imposed on foreign investors acquiring A‑shares through Stock Connect, and these fees, costs and taxes may be higher than comparable fees, costs and taxes imposed on owners of other Chinese securities providing similar investment exposure. </span></div> <div><span><span>A‑Share Market Suspension Risk. </span></span></div> <div><span>A‑shares may only be bought from, or sold to, the Fund at times when the relevant A‑shares may be sold or purchased on the relevant Chinese </span></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div><span> stock exchange. The A‑shares market can have a higher propensity for trading suspensions than many other global equity markets. Trading suspensions in certain stocks could lead to greater market execution risk, valuation risks, and liquidity risks and costs for the Fund as well as for Authorized Participants that create and redeem Creation Units of the Fund. The SSE and SZSE currently apply a daily limit, set at 10%, of the amount of fluctuation permitted in the prices of A‑shares during a single trading day. The daily limit refers to price movements only and does not restrict trading within the relevant limit. There can be no assurance that a liquid market on an exchange will exist for any particular A‑share or for any particular time. This could increase the Fund’s tracking error and/or cause the Fund to trade in the market at greater bid‑ask spreads or greater premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. Given that the A‑shares market is considered volatile and unstable (with the risk of widespread trading suspensions or government intervention), the creation and redemption of Creation Units may also be disrupted. </span></div> <ix:continuation continuedat="t_1_828eea30_6b61_5278_8b93_8e116d48f82e_15"> <ix:continuation continuedat="t_9_1c1e7196_9d38_10e8_af9a_b0ae68c59c2a_9"> <div><span><span></span><span><span>Change in “Summary of Principal Risks” for each Fund listed in Appendix D </span></span></span></div> </ix:continuation> </ix:continuation> <ix:continuation continuedat="t_1_828eea30_6b61_5278_8b93_8e116d48f82e_16"> <ix:continuation continuedat="t_9_1c1e7196_9d38_10e8_af9a_b0ae68c59c2a_10"> <div><span><span>The following is hereby added to the section entitled “</span><span><span>Summary of Principal Risks</span></span><span>” of the Prospectus and Summary Prospectus of each Fund listed in Appendix D: </span></span></div> </ix:continuation> </ix:continuation> <ix:continuation continuedat="t_1_828eea30_6b61_5278_8b93_8e116d48f82e_17"> <ix:continuation continuedat="t_9_1c1e7196_9d38_10e8_af9a_b0ae68c59c2a_11"> <div><span><span><span>Risk of Investing in China</span></span>. Investments in bonds of Chinese issuers subject the Fund to risks specific to China. China may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability. China is an emerging market and demonstrates significantly higher volatility from time to time in comparison to developed markets. Over the last few decades, the Chinese government has undertaken reform of economic and market practices and has expanded the sphere of private ownership of property in China. However, Chinese markets generally continue to experience inefficiency, volatility and pricing anomalies resulting from governmental influence, a lack of publicly available information and/or political and social instability. Chinese issuers are also subject to the risk that Chinese authorities can intervene in their operations and structure. Internal social unrest or confrontations with neighboring countries, including military conflicts in response to such events, may also disrupt economic development in China and result in a greater risk of currency fluctuations, currency non‑convertibility, interest rate fluctuations and higher rates of inflation. </span></div> </ix:continuation> </ix:continuation> <ix:continuation continuedat="t_1_828eea30_6b61_5278_8b93_8e116d48f82e_18"> <ix:continuation continuedat="t_9_1c1e7196_9d38_10e8_af9a_b0ae68c59c2a_12"> <div><span>China has experienced security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations.

Actual and threatened responses to such activity and strained international relations, including purchasing restrictions, sanctions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Chinese government or Chinese companies, may impact China’s economy and Chinese issuers of securities in which the Fund invests. Incidents involving China’s or the region’s security may cause uncertainty in Chinese markets and may adversely affect the Chinese economy and the Fund’s investments. Export growth continues to be a major driver of China’s rapid economic growth. Reduction in spending on Chinese products and services, institution of additional tariffs or other trade barriers (including as a result of heightened trade tensions or a trade war between China and the U.S. or in response to actual or alleged Chinese cyber activity) or a downturn in any of the economies of China’s key trading partners may have an adverse impact on the Chinese economy. </span></div> </ix:continuation> </ix:continuation> <ix:continuation continuedat="t_1_828eea30_6b61_5278_8b93_8e116d48f82e_20"> <ix:continuation continuedat="t_9_1c1e7196_9d38_10e8_af9a_b0ae68c59c2a_14"> <div><span>Chinese issuers are not subject to the same degree of regulatory requirements, accounting standards or auditor oversight as issuers in more developed countries.

Investments in bonds of Chinese issuers (including variable interest entities associated with an underlying Chinese operating company) subject the Fund to risks specific to China. The Chinese economy is subject to a considerable degree of economic, political and social instability. </span></div> <div><span><span>Political and Social Risk</span>. The Chinese government is authoritarian and has periodically used force to suppress civil dissent. Disparities of wealth and the pace of economic liberalization may lead to social turmoil, violence and labor unrest. In addition, China continues to experience disagreements related to integration with Hong Kong and religious and nationalist disputes in Tibet and Xinjiang. There is also a greater risk in China than in many other countries of currency fluctuations, currency non-convertibility, interest rate fluctuations and </span></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div><span> higher rates of inflation as a result of internal social unrest or conflicts with other countries. Unanticipated political or social developments may result in sudden and significant investment losses. China’s growing income inequality, rapidly aging population and significant environmental issues also are factors that may affect the Chinese economy. </span></div> <div><span><span>Government Control and Regulations</span>. The Chinese government has implemented significant economic reforms in order to liberalize trade policy, promote foreign investment in the economy, reduce government control of the economy and develop market mechanisms. There can be no assurance that these reforms will continue or that they will be effective. Despite recent reform and privatizations, government control over certain sectors or enterprises and significant regulation of investment and industry is still pervasive, including restrictions on investment in companies or industries deemed to be sensitive to particular national interests, trading of securities of Chinese issuers, foreign ownership of Chinese corporations and/or the repatriation of assets by foreign investors. Limitations or restrictions on foreign ownership of securities may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the Fund and could lead to higher tracking error. Chinese government intervention in the market may have a negative impact on market sentiment, which may in turn affect the performance of the Chinese economy and the Fund’s investments. Chinese markets generally continue to experience inefficiency, volatility and pricing anomalies that may be connected to governmental influence, lack of publicly available information, and political and social instability. Chinese issuers, such as those in the financial services or technology sectors, and potentially other sectors in the future, are also subject to the risk that Chinese authorities can intervene in their operations and structure, which may negatively affect the value of the Fund’s investments. </span></div> <div><span>The Fund may invest in securities issued by variable interest entities (“VIEs”), which are subject to the investment risks associated with the underlying Chinese operating company. A VIE enters into service contracts and other contracts with the Chinese operating company, which provide the VIE with exposure to the company. Although the VIE has no equity ownership of the Chinese operating company, the contractual arrangements permit the VIE to consolidate the Chinese operating company into its financial statements. Intervention by the Chinese government with respect to VIEs could significantly affect the Chinese operating company’s performance and the enforceability of the VIE’s contractual arrangements with the Chinese company. </span></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div><span><span>Economic Risk</span>. The Chinese economy has grown rapidly in the recent past, and there is no assurance that this growth rate will be maintained. In fact, the Chinese economy may experience a significant slowdown as a result of, among other things, a deterioration in global demand for Chinese exports, as well as a contraction in spending on domestic goods by Chinese consumers. In addition, China may experience substantial rates of inflation or economic recessions, which would have a negative effect on its economy and securities market. Delays in enterprise restructuring, slow development of well-functioning financial markets and widespread corruption have also hindered the performance of the Chinese economy. China continues to receive substantial pressure from trading partners to liberalize official currency exchange rates. Reduction in spending on Chinese products and services, institution of additional tariffs or other trade barriers (including as a result of heightened trade tensions between China and the U.S. or in response to actual or alleged Chinese cyber activity) or a downturn in any of the economies of China’s key trading partners may have an adverse impact on the Chinese economy and the Chinese issuers of securities in which the Fund invests. For example, the U.S. has added certain foreign technology companies to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security’s “Entity List,” which is a list of companies believed to pose a national security risk to the U.S. Actions like these may have unanticipated and disruptive effects on the Chinese economy. Any such response that targets Chinese financial markets or securities exchanges could interfere with orderly trading, delay settlement or cause market disruptions. </span></div> <div><span><span>Expropriation Risk</span>. The Chinese government maintains a major role in economic policymaking, and investing in China involves risk of loss due to expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and on repatriation of capital invested. </span></div> <div><span><span>Security Risk</span>. China has strained international relations with Taiwan, India, Russia and other neighbors due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, defense concerns and other security concerns. Additionally, China is alleged to have participated in state-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign companies and foreign governments. Actual and threatened responses to such activity and strained international relations, including purchasing restrictions, sanctions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Chinese government or Chinese companies, may impact China’s economy and Chinese issuers of securities in which the Fund invests. Relations between China’s Han ethnic majority and other ethnic groups in China, including Tibetans and Uighurs, are also </span></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div><span> strained and have been marked by protests and violence. These situations may cause uncertainty in the Chinese market and may adversely affect the Chinese economy. In addition, conflict on the Korean Peninsula could adversely affect the Chinese economy. </span></div> <div><span><span>Hong Kong Political Risk</span>. Hong Kong reverted to Chinese sovereignty on July 1, 1997 as a Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China under the principle of “one country, two systems.” Although China is obligated to maintain the current capitalist economic and social system of Hong Kong through June 30, 2047, the continuation of economic and social freedoms enjoyed in Hong Kong is dependent on the government of China. Since 1997, there have been tensions between the Chinese government and many people in Hong Kong who perceive China as tightening control over Hong Kong’s semi-autonomous liberal political, economic, legal and social framework. Recent protests and unrest have increased tensions even further. Due to the interconnected nature of the Hong Kong and Chinese economies, this instability in Hong Kong may cause uncertainty in the Hong Kong and Chinese markets. In addition, the Hong Kong dollar trades at a fixed exchange rate in relation to (or is “pegged” to) the U.S. dollar, which has contributed to the growth and stability of the Hong Kong economy. However, it is uncertain how long the currency peg will continue or what effect the establishment of an alternative exchange rate system would have on the Hong Kong economy. Because the Fund’s NAV is denominated in U.S. dollars, the establishment of an alternative exchange rate system could result in a decline in the Fund’s NAV. </span></div> <div><span><span>Limited Information and Legal Remedies</span>. Chinese issuers are not subject to the same degree of regulatory requirements, accounting standards or auditor oversight as issuers in more developed countries. As a result, information about the Chinese securities in which the Fund invests may be less reliable or complete. There may be significant obstacles to obtaining information necessary for investigations into or litigation against Chinese issuers, and investors may have limited legal remedies. The Fund is not actively managed and does not select investments based on investor protection considerations. </span></div> <div><span><span></span><span><span>Change in “General Considerations and Risks” of each Fund listed in Appendix D and iShares Global Green Bond ETF </span></span></span></div> <div><span><span>The following is hereby added to the section entitled “General Considerations and Risks” of the SAI of each Fund listed in Appendix D and the SAI of iShares Global Green Bond ETF: </span></span></div> <div><span><span>Risk of Investing in China</span>. Investments in bonds of Chinese issuers (including variable interest entities associated with an underlying </span></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div><span> Chinese operating company) involve a high degree of risk and special considerations not typically associated with investing in the U.S. securities markets. Such heightened risks include, among others, an authoritarian government, popular unrest associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions, the impact of regional conflict on the economy and hostile relations with neighboring countries. </span></div> <div><span>Military conflicts, either in response to internal social unrest or conflicts with other countries, could disrupt economic development. The Chinese economy is vulnerable to the long-running disagreements and religious and nationalist disputes with Tibet and the Xinjiang region. Since 1997, there have been tensions between the Chinese government and many people in Hong Kong who perceive China as tightening control over Hong Kong’s semi-autonomous liberal political, economic, legal, and social framework. Recent protests and unrest have increased tensions even further. Due to the interconnected nature of the Hong Kong and Chinese economies, this instability in Hong Kong may cause uncertainty in the Hong Kong and Chinese markets. China has a complex territorial dispute regarding the sovereignty of Taiwan and has made threats of invasion. Taiwan-based companies and individuals are significant investors in China. Military conflict between China and Taiwan may adversely affect securities of Chinese issuers. In addition, China has strained international relations with Japan, India, Russia and other neighbors due to territorial disputes, historical animosities and other defense concerns. Additionally, China is alleged to have participated in state-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign companies and foreign governments. Actual and threatened responses to such activity and strained international relations, including purchasing restrictions, sanctions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Chinese government or Chinese companies, may impact China’s economy and Chinese issuers of securities in which the Fund invests. China could be affected by military events on the Korean peninsula or internal instability within North Korea. These situations may cause uncertainty in the Chinese market and may adversely affect the performance of the Chinese economy. </span></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div><span>The Chinese government has implemented significant economic reforms in order to liberalize trade policy, promote foreign investment in the economy, reduce government control of the economy and develop market mechanisms. However, there can be no assurance that these reforms will continue or that they will be effective. Despite reforms and privatizations of companies in certain sectors, the Chinese government still exercises substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector and may own or control many companies. Chinese issuers, such as those in the financial services or technology sectors, and potentially other sectors in the future, are subject to the risk that Chinese authorities can intervene in their operations and structure. The Chinese government continues to maintain a major role in economic policymaking. Investing in China involves risk of loss due to expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments, trading of securities of Chinese issuers and repatriation of capital invested. </span></div> <div><span>The Fund may invest in securities issued by variable interest entities (“VIEs”), which are subject to the investment risks associated with the underlying Chinese operating company. A VIE enters into service contracts and other contracts with the Chinese operating company, which provide the VIE with exposure to the company. Although the VIE has no equity ownership of the Chinese operating company, the contractual arrangements permit the VIE to consolidate the Chinese operating company into its financial statements. Intervention by the Chinese government with respect to VIEs could significantly affect the Chinese operating company’s performance and the enforceability of the VIE’s contractual arrangements with the Chinese company.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, there is less regulation and monitoring of Chinese securities markets and the activities of investors, brokers and other participants than in the U.S. Accordingly, Chinese issuers are not subject to the same degree of regulation as are U.S. issuers with respect to such matters as insider trading rules, tender offer regulation, accounting standards or auditor oversight, stockholder proxy requirements and the requirements mandating timely and accurate disclosure of information. Securities markets in China are in the process of change and further development. This may lead to trading volatility, difficulty in the settlement and recording of transactions and difficulty in interpreting and applying the relevant regulation. </span></div> <div><span>The Chinese government has taken positions that prevent the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) from inspecting the audit work and practices of accounting firms in mainland China and Hong Kong for compliance with U.S. law and professional standards. Audits performed by PCAOB-registered accounting firms in mainland China and Hong Kong may be less reliable than those performed by firms subject to PCAOB inspection. Accordingly, information about the Chinese securities in which the Fund invests may be less reliable or complete. Under amendments to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act enacted in December 2020, which requires that the PCAOB be permitted to inspect the accounting firm of a U.S.-listed Chinese issuer, </span></div> <div></div> <hr/> <div><span> Chinese companies with securities listed on U.S. exchanges may be delisted if the PCAOB is unable to inspect the accounting firm. </span></div> <div><span>There may be significant obstacles to obtaining information necessary for investigations into or litigation against Chinese issuers, and investors may have limited legal remedies. The Fund is not actively managed and does not select investments based on investor protection considerations. </span></div> <div><span>While the Chinese economy has experienced past periods of rapid growth, there is no assurance that such growth rates will recur. China may experience substantial rates of inflation or economic recessions, causing a negative effect on the economy and securities market. China’s economy is heavily dependent on export growth. Reduction in spending on Chinese products and services, institution of additional tariffs or other trade barriers (including as a result of heightened trade tensions between China and the U.S. or in response to actual or alleged Chinese cyber activity) or a downturn in any of the economies of China’s key trading partners may have an adverse impact on the Chinese economy and the Chinese issuers of securities in which the Fund invests. For example, the U.S. has added certain foreign technology companies to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security’s “Entity List,” which is a list of companies believed to pose a national security risk to the U.S. Actions like these may have unanticipated and disruptive effects on the Chinese economy. Any such response that targets Chinese financial markets or securities exchanges could interfere with orderly trading, delay settlement or cause market disruptions. The tax laws and regulations in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) are subject to change, including the issuance of authoritative guidance or enforcement, possibly with retroactive effect. The interpretation, applicability and enforcement of such laws by PRC tax authorities are not as consistent and transparent as those of more developed nations and may vary over time and from region to region. The application and enforcement of PRC tax rules could have a significant adverse effect on the Fund and its investors, particularly in relation to capital gains withholding tax imposed upon non-residents. In addition, the accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and practices applicable to Chinese issuers may be less rigorous and may result in significant differences between financial statements prepared in accordance with PRC accounting standards and practice and those prepared in accordance with international accounting standards. </span></div> <div></div> <hr/> <ix:continuation
