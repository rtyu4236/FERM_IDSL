<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you
will incur if you buy, hold and sell shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides
that BFA will pay all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions,
including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses.</div>
<div>You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and other
fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the tables and examples below.</div> <div>

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund
may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are
held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 46% of the
average value of its portfolio.</font></div> <div>Principal
Investment Strategies</div> <div>The Fund seeks to track the
investment results of the MSCI USA Small Cap Diversified Multiple-Factor Index (the “Underlying Index”), which has been developed by MSCI Inc. (the “Index Provider” or “MSCI”). The Underlying Index is designed to
select equity securities from the MSCI USA Small Cap Index (the “Parent Index”) that have high exposure to four investment style factors – value, quality, momentum and low size – while maintaining a level of risk similar to
that of the Parent Index. The Underlying Index is also constrained in its construction to limit turnover and extreme exposures to particular sectors, component weights or other investment style factors. Small-capitalization companies, as defined by
MSCI, represent approximately the bottom 14% of the free float-adjusted market capitalization in the U.S. securities market, as determined by MSCI.</div>
<div>MSCI, in selecting equity securities from the Parent Index,
assigns a composite score for a security through a proprietary model based on four</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>equally-weighted investment style factors. The value score is calculated from
a company’s valuation ratios, such as forward and trailing earnings to share price, cash earnings to share price, book value to share price and enterprise value to earnings before interest and taxes. The quality score is calculated from a
company’s underlying metrics, including profitability metrics (asset turnover, gross profitability, gross margin and return on assets), investment quality metrics (total assets growth rate, issuance growth and capital expenditure growth),
leverage ratios (market leverage, book leverage and debt-to-assets ratio) and earnings variability (measured by volatility of earnings, cash flow, sales, and forward earnings estimates to share price). The momentum score aims to measure a security's
sustained relative performance against the global market over a two-year period and against other securities based in the same country over the previous 12 months (with a one-month lag). The low size score seeks to measure the market capitalization
of a company as compared to other companies based in the same country.</div>
<div>As of July 31, 2021, the Underlying Index consisted of
securities from approximately 478 companies from the U.S. As of July 31, 2021, a significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the consumer discretionary, healthcare and information technology industries or
sectors. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-2</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary
defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover
low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to that of an applicable underlying index. The securities
selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar
to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 80% of its assets in
the component securities of its Underlying Index and in investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities of its Underlying Index (<font>i.e</font>., depositary
receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index) and may invest up to 20% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>its affiliates, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index,
but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash equivalent investments associated with a derivative position will be treated as part of that position for the purposes of calculating investments not included in the
Underlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of
the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index and Parent Index are sponsored by MSCI,
which is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and Parent Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the
Underlying Index and Parent Index.</div> <div>Industry
Concentration Policy.<font> The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a
particular industry or group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase
agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</font></div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-3</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks,
including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share (“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk
factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or other asset
classes.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this
prospectus (the “Prospectus”)) may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption transactions. The Fund has a limited
number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that
Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, Fund shares may be more likely to trade
at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting.</font></div>
<div>Calculation Methodology Risk. <font>The Underlying Index relies on various sources of information to assess the criteria of issuers included in the Underlying Index, including information that may be based on assumptions and</font></div>
</div> <div type="Block">
<div>estimates. Neither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances that the Underlying
Index’s calculation methodology or sources of information will provide an accurate assessment of included issuers.</div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector, market segment or asset class.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Discretionary Sector Risk.<font> The consumer discretionary sector may be affected by changes in domestic and international economies, exchange and interest rates, competition, consumers' disposable income, consumer preferences,
social trends and marketing campaigns.</font></div> <div>Cybersecurity
Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, the Index Provider and other service providers, market
makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the Fund and its
shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the
cybersecurity plans and systems of the Fund’s Index Provider and other</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of
securities in which the Fund invests.</div> <div>Equity Securities
Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is
composed of common stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon
the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div> <div>Healthcare Sector Risk<font>.</font><font> The profitability of companies in the healthcare sector may be affected by government regulations and government healthcare programs, increases or decreases in
the cost of medical products and services, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, demand for medical products and services and product liability claims, among other factors. Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent on patent
protection, and the expiration of a company’s patent may adversely affect that company’s profitability. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive forces that may result in price discounting, and may be thinly capitalized and
susceptible to product obsolescence.</font></div> <div>Index-Related
Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective.
Market disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index
data, index computations or the construction of the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an
adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market conditions may cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance, which could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition.</div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk. <font>An outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus has resulted in travel restrictions, disruption of healthcare systems, prolonged quarantines, cancellations,
supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings downgrades, defaults and other significant economic impacts. Certain markets have experienced temporary closures, extreme volatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity and increased
trading costs. These events will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and could impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities or cause elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV. Other
infectious illness outbreaks in the future may result in similar impacts.</font></div>
<div>Information Technology Sector Risk.<font> Information technology companies face intense competition and potentially rapid product obsolescence. They are also heavily dependent on intellectual property rights and may be adversely affected by
the loss or impairment of those rights. Companies in the information technology sector are facing increased government and</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<p>

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or regulatory
action. Companies in the software industry may be adversely affected by, among other things, the decline or fluctuation of subscription renewal rates for their products and services and actual or perceived vulnerabilities in their products or
services.</div> <div>Issuer
Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or
credit rating of an issuer of those securities may cause the value of the securities to decline.</font></div>
<div>Low Size Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> The Underlying Index is designed to select stocks, in part, based on whether they are low size. The stocks of smaller companies within the Fund’s capitalization range (“low size
companies”) may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse developments, and their securities may be more volatile and less liquid, than those on the larger end of the Fund’s capitalization range. The Fund will invest in low size
companies to approximately the same extent that they are represented in the Underlying Index.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of
terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>significant impact on the Fund and its investments and could result in
increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV.</div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruptions in
the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>Model Risk<font>.</font><font> Neither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances that the Index Provider’s model will result in the Fund meeting its investment objective. The Fund may underperform other funds that do not similarly
invest.</font></div> <div>Momentum Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Stocks that previously exhibited high momentum characteristics may not experience positive momentum or may experience more volatility than the market as a
whole.</font></div> <div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors,
errors of the Fund’s service providers, counterparties or other third parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However,
these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-6</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</div>
<div>Quality Stocks Risk<font>.</font><font> Stocks included in the Underlying Index are deemed by the Index Provider to be quality stocks, but there is no guarantee that the past performance of these stocks will continue. Companies that issue
these stocks may experience lower than expected returns or may experience negative growth, as well as increased leverage, resulting in lower than expected or negative returns to Fund shareholders. Many factors can affect a stock’s quality and
performance, and the impact of these factors on a stock or its price can be difficult to predict.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the
U.S<font>.</font><font> Certain changes in the U.S. economy, such as when the U.S. economy weakens or when its financial markets decline, may have an adverse effect on the
securities to which the Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax
consequences for the Fund.</font></div> <div>Small-Capitalization
Companies Risk<font>.</font><font> Compared to mid- and large-capitalization companies, small-capitalization companies may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse
developments. In addition, the securities of small-capitalization companies may be more volatile and</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>less liquid than those of mid- and large-capitalization companies.</div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences, transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the
accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest received by the Fund or distributions paid to the Fund’s shareholders, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the
distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of
increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not.</font></div>
<div>Value Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Securities issued by companies that may be perceived as undervalued may fail to appreciate for long periods of time and may never realize their full potential value. The Index Provider may be
unsuccessful in applying a factor that emphasizes such securities. Although the value style of investing has generally outperformed non-value investing styles during periods of economic recovery, there may be periods when the value style of
investing is out of favor, thus causing the Fund’s performance to suffer.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an exchange-traded fund (commonly referred to as an
“ETF”). Individual shares of the Fund may only be bought and sold in the secondary market through a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or
less than NAV (a discount). An investor may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for shares of the Fund
(ask) when buying or selling shares in the secondary market (the “bid-ask spread”).<br/> </div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make distributions that may be taxable to
you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA, in which case, your distributions generally will be taxed when withdrawn.</div>
<div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial
Intermediaries</div> <div>If you purchase shares of the Fund through
a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms
and reporting systems or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another
investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.<br/> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
