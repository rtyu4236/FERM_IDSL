to the risk that raw materials are accidentally or maliciously contaminated or that products are contaminated through the supply chain due to human error or equipment failure. Such incidents may result in loss of market share and loss of revenue for
companies in the consumer staples sector. Companies in the consumer staples sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. These companies may be subject to severe
competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability. </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>The section of the Prospectus of IYC entitled “A Further Discussion of

</font></p> <p><font size="2">The Russell 1000 Index is constructed to provide a comprehensive and unbiased barometer for the large- and <font>mid-</font>
capitalization segments of the investable U.S. equity market. It is a float-adjusted capitalization-weighted index consisting approximately 1000 of the largest issuers in the Russell 3000 Index. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">For the Russell
3000<font size="1"><sup>®</sup></font> Index and the Russell 1000<font size="1"><sup>®</sup></font> Index, the weights of component issuers are adjusted based on available float-weighted capitalization according to the market value of their available outstanding
shares. The impact of a component security’s price change is proportional to the issuer’s total market value, which is the share price times the number of shares available. Each Russell Index is adjusted to reflect changes in
capitalization resulting from mergers, acquisitions, stock rights, substitutions and other capital events. </font></p> <p><font size="2">Frank Russell Company uses a probability
measure to assign stocks to the growth and value style indexes. The probability measure is used to indicate the degree of certainty that a stock is value or growth, based on three fundamental indicators: relative <font><font>price-to-book</font></font> (“PB”) ratio, Institutional Brokers’ Estimate System forecast medium-term growth (2 years) and sales per share historical growth (5 years). This method allows stocks to be
represented as having both growth and value characteristics, while preserving the additive nature of the indexes. As a result, a stock may be a component of a Russell growth style index and also a component of the corresponding value style index,
although the stock would likely have a different weight in each index. </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>Issue Changes. </b>Securities that leave the Russell Indexes between
reconstitution dates are not replaced. Thus, the number of securities in the investments over the year will fluctuate according to corporate activity. When a stock is acquired, delisted or moves to the pink sheets or OTC bulletin boards, the stock
is deleted from the relevant indexes. </font></p> <p><font size="2">When acquisitions or mergers take place, the stock’s capitalization moves to the acquiring stock, hence,
mergers have no effect on index total capitalization if the acquiring stock is part of the index. The only additions between reconstitution dates are as a result of spin-offs and IPOs. </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>Index Maintenance. </b>Maintaining the Russell indexes includes monitoring and completing the adjustments for company additions and deletions, share changes, stock splits, stock dividends, and stock price
adjustments due to restructuring and spin-offs and quarterly initial </font></p>

public offerings. In addition, significant share capital changes are made at <font>month-end.</font> The divisor is adjusted for all changes in company market value to
leave the value of the investments unaffected. All divisor adjustments are made after the close of trading and after the calculation of the closing value of the Russell indexes. </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b>Index Availability. </b>The Russell indexes are calculated continuously and are available from major data vendors. </font></p>
