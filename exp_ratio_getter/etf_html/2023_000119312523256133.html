Please </span><span>read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional </span><span>information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</span></div> <div><span>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund are listed for trading on </span><span>The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (</span><span>“</span><span>Nasdaq</span><span>”</span><span>). The market price for a share of the Fund </span><span>may be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</span></div> <div><span>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly-traded securities. The Fund is designed to </span><span>track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund </span><span>represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other </span><span>instruments intended to track a market index. Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which </span><span>can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based </span><span>on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at </span><span>NAV solely by Authorized Participants and only in aggregations of a specified number of </span><span>shares (</span><span>“</span><span>Creation Units</span><span>”</span><span>). Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are </span><span>listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market </span><span>prices that change throughout the day.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund invests in a particular segment of the securities markets and seeks to track </span><span>the performance of a securities index that is not representative of the market as a </span><span>whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. </span><span>Accordingly, an investment in the Fund should not constitute a complete investment </span><span>program.</span></div> <div><span>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of financial instruments, and is </span><span>not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The </span><span>performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, </span><span>including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency valuations, asset valuations, corporate </span><span>actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of </span><span>representative sampling or from legal restrictions (such as diversification </span><span>requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to </span><span>time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments </span><span>to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise determined by BFA, any such change or </span><span>adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on </span><span>a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, </span><span>the Underlying Index performance shown for periods prior to the effective date of any </span><span>such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect </span><span>such change or adjustment. </span></div> <div><span>“</span><span>Tracking error</span><span>”</span><span> is the divergence of the Fund's performance from that of the </span><span>Underlying Index. Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, </span><span>it can be expected to have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing </span><span>strategy. </span><span>“</span><span>Replication</span><span>”</span><span> is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>of the securities in its underlying index in approximately the same proportions as in the </span><span>underlying index.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund may borrow as a temporary measure for extraordinary or emergency </span><span>purposes, including to meet redemptions or to facilitate the settlement of securities or </span><span>other transactions. The Fund does not intend to borrow money in order to leverage its </span><span>portfolio.</span></div> <div><span>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not insured or guaranteed by </span><span>the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or </span><span>any of its affiliates.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be changed without </span><span>shareholder approval.</span></div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Principal Risks</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The Fund is subject to various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of </span><span>which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability </span><span>to meet its investment objective. You could lose all or part of your investment in the </span><span>Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments. The order of the below risk </span><span>factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. The Fund </span><span>discloses its portfolio holdings daily at </span><span>www.iShares.com</span><span>.</span></div> <div><span>Asset Class Risk.</span><span> The securities</span><span> </span><span>and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that </span><span>track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries, groups of industries, </span><span>markets, market segments, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, </span><span>currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and </span><span>underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a </span><span>number of factors including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, </span><span>global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental </span><span>controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that </span><span>invest in different asset classes. Securities of companies that have positive or </span><span>favorable ESG characteristics may underperform other securities.</span></div> <div><span>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. </span><span>Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of </span><span>those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption </span><span>transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized </span><span>Participants on an agency basis (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, on behalf of other market participants). To the </span><span>extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with </span><span>creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized </span><span>Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares </span><span>may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading </span><span>halts or delisting.</span></div> <div><span>Calculation Methodology Risk.</span><span> The Underlying Index</span><span> </span><span> relies on various sources of </span><span>information to assess the criteria of securities included in the Underlying Index, </span><span>including information that may be based on assumptions and estimates. Neither the </span><span>Fund nor BFA can offer assurances that the Underlying Index's calculation </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>methodology or sources of information will provide an accurate assessment of </span><span>included securities.</span></div> <div><span>Concentration Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, </span><span>including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than </span><span>the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's investments are concentrated in </span><span>the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of </span><span>countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector, market segment or </span><span>asset class. The Fund may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of </span><span>those securities and/or other assets, may experience increased price volatility and </span><span>may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory </span><span>occurrences affecting those securities and/or other assets than a fund that does not </span><span>concentrate its investments.</span></div> <div><span>Cybersecurity Risk.</span><span> The Fund,</span><span> </span><span>Authorized Participants, service providers and the </span><span>relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information security and </span><span>related </span><span>“</span><span>cyber</span><span>”</span><span> risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of </span><span>cybersecurity risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, </span><span>which could result in material adverse consequences for such issuers and may cause </span><span>the Fund’s investment in such issuers to lose value. In general, cyber incidents can </span><span>result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are </span><span>not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, through </span><span>“</span><span>hacking</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive </span><span>information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyberattacks may also </span><span>be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as </span><span>causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, efforts to make network services </span><span>unavailable to intended users). Recently, geopolitical tensions may have increased the </span><span>scale and sophistication of deliberate attacks, particularly those from nation-states or </span><span>from entities with nation-state backing. </span></div> <div><span>Cybersecurity failures by, or breaches of, the systems of the Fund's adviser, distributor </span><span>and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index and benchmark </span><span>providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market </span><span>makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests </span><span>have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially </span><span>resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s ability to calculate its NAV, </span><span>disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of </span><span>erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund </span><span>or its service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other </span><span>laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other </span><span>compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyberattacks may </span><span>render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, </span><span>and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund inaccessible, inaccurate or </span><span>incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund in order to resolve or </span><span>prevent cyber incidents in the future. While the Fund has established business </span><span>continuity plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber </span><span>incidents, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the </span><span>possibility that certain risks have not been identified, that prevention and remediation </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>efforts will not be successful or that cyberattacks will go undetected. Furthermore, the </span><span>Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by service </span><span>providers to the Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, market </span><span>makers or Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively </span><span>impacted as a result.</span></div> <div><span>Equity Securities Risk.</span><span> The Fund invests in equity securities, which are subject to </span><span>changes in value that may be attributable to market perception of a particular issuer or </span><span>to general stock market fluctuations that affect all issuers. Investments in equity </span><span>securities may be more volatile than investments in other asset classes. The </span><span>Underlying Index is composed of common stocks, which generally subject</span><span> </span><span>their holders </span><span>to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common </span><span>stockholders' claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt </span><span>securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</span></div> <div><span>ESG Risk. </span><span>To the extent that the Underlying Index uses criteria related to the ESG </span><span>characteristics of issuers, this may limit the types and number of investment </span><span>opportunities available to the Fund and, as a result, the Fund may underperform other </span><span>funds whose underlying index does not use ESG criteria. The Underlying Index’s use of </span><span>ESG criteria may result in the Fund investing in, or allocating greater weight to, </span><span>securities or market sectors that underperform the market as a whole or underperform </span><span>other funds that use ESG criteria. In addition, the use of representative sampling may </span><span>result in divergence of the Fund's overall ESG characteristics or ESG risk from those of </span><span>the Underlying Index.</span></div> <div><span>The Index Provider evaluates securities for inclusion and/or weighting in the </span><span>Underlying Index based on ESG criteria and data provided by the Index Provider or </span><span>third parties. The Index Provider’s evaluation of securities’ ESG characteristics depends </span><span>on these criteria and data, which may vary by index provider, and no assurance can be </span><span>given that they will be complete, accurate or current. In addition, the Index Provider </span><span>may evaluate security-level ESG data (including ratings) and, if applicable, ESG </span><span>objectives or constraints that are relevant to the Underlying Index only at index reviews </span><span>or rebalances. Securities included in the Underlying Index may cease to meet the </span><span>relevant ESG criteria but may nevertheless remain in the Underlying Index and the </span><span>Fund until the next review or rebalance by the Index Provider. As a result, certain </span><span>securities in the Underlying Index, or the Underlying Index as a whole, may not meet </span><span>the relevant ESG objectives or constraints at all times. If the ESG assessment of a </span><span>security in the Underlying Index or the Fund changes, neither the Fund nor BFA accepts </span><span>any liability in relation to such change. BFA does not monitor securities in the </span><span>Underlying Index with respect to ESG objectives or constraints applied by the Index </span><span>Provider and is not responsible for changes to the ESG assessment of a security in the </span><span>Underlying Index between rebalances. In addition, BFA does not assess the validity of </span><span>the Index Provider’s evaluation of the ESG characteristics of securities or the criteria </span><span>and data used in such evaluation.</span></div> <div><span>The impacts of risks related to ESG investing are likely to change over time, and new </span><span>ESG risks may be identified as further data and information regarding ESG factors and </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>impacts become available. In addition, methodologies for ESG investing continue to </span><span>develop, and the ESG methodology applied by the Index Provider may change over </span><span>time.</span></div> <div><span>Index-Related Risk.</span><span> The Fund seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to </span><span>the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as </span><span>published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any </span><span>agents that may act on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that </span><span>the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the </span><span>Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to </span><span>achieve, neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any </span><span>liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or </span><span>its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in line with </span><span>the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to </span><span>manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider </span><span>to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee against the Index Provider’s or </span><span>any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the </span><span>data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not </span><span>be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, </span><span>particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or </span><span>managers. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its </span><span>shareholders. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains </span><span>incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and </span><span>would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Shareholders </span><span>should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund </span><span>and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will </span><span>be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>Unusual market conditions or other unforeseen circumstances (such as natural </span><span>disasters, political unrest or war) may impact the Index Provider or a third-party data </span><span>provider, and could cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance to the </span><span>Underlying Index. This could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or </span><span>expected composition. The postponement of a scheduled rebalance could mean that </span><span>constituents of the Underlying Index that would otherwise be removed at rebalance </span><span>due to changes in market capitalizations, issuer credit ratings, or other reasons may </span><span>remain, causing the performance and constituents of the Underlying Index to vary from </span><span>those expected under normal conditions. Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index </span><span>Provider or its agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying </span><span>Index due to reaching certain weighting constraints, unusual market conditions or </span><span>corporate events or, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index </span><span>constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances </span><span>its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the </span><span>Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such </span><span>portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Therefore, </span><span>errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the Index Provider or its agents </span><span>to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Infectious Illness Risk. </span><span>A widespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as the </span><span>COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect the economies of many nations and the </span><span>global economy and may impact individual issuers and capital markets in ways that </span><span>cannot be foreseen.</span></div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in travel restrictions, closed international </span><span>borders, disruption of healthcare services, prolonged quarantines, cancellations, </span><span>supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, temporary and permanent closures </span><span>of businesses, layoffs, defaults and other significant economic, social and political </span><span>impacts, as well as general concern and uncertainty.</span></div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in extreme volatility, severe losses, credit </span><span>deterioration of issuers, and disruptions in markets, which could adversely impact the </span><span>Fund and its investments, including impairing any hedging activity.</span></div> <div><span>Certain local markets may be subject to closures. Any suspension of trading in markets </span><span>in which the Fund invests will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and will </span><span>impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities in such markets.</span><span> </span><span>Market or </span><span>economic disruptions could result in elevated tracking error and increased premiums </span><span>or discounts to the Fund's NAV. Additionally, an outbreak could impair the operations </span><span>of the Fund’s service providers, including BFA, which could adversely impact the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Governmental and quasi-governmental authorities and regulators throughout the world </span><span>may respond to an outbreak and any resulting economic disruptions with a variety of </span><span>fiscal and monetary policy changes, including direct capital infusions into companies </span><span>and other issuers, new monetary policy tools, and changes in interest rates. A reversal </span><span>of these policies, or the ineffectiveness of such policies, is likely to increase market </span><span>volatility, which could adversely affect the Fund’s investments.</span></div> <div><span>An outbreak may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social and economic risks in </span><span>certain countries or globally, which could adversely affect the Fund and its investments </span><span>and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Despite the development of vaccines, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its </span><span>effects cannot be predicted with certainty.</span></div> <div><span>Issuer Risk. </span><span>The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual </span><span>securities to which the Fund has exposure. Any issuer of these securities may perform </span><span>poorly, causing the value of its securities to decline. Poor performance may be caused </span><span>by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, </span><span>expiration of patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages, </span><span>corporate restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or </span><span>other factors. Issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to </span><span>reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock prices to decline. An </span><span>issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in </span><span>which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</span></div> <div><span>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.</span><span> Large-capitalization companies may be less </span><span>able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. </span><span>Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more limited </span><span>growth potential compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>6</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>market cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the </span><span>overall performance of the broader securities markets.</span></div> <div><span>Management Risk. </span><span>Because BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, </span><span>the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities not </span><span>included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that BFA’s </span><span>investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of </span><span>constraints, may not produce the intended results.</span></div> <div><span>Market Risk.</span><span> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market </span><span>movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The </span><span>value of a security, asset, or other instrument may decline due to changes in general </span><span>market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the </span><span>issuer of the security</span><span> </span><span>or other asset, or factors that affect a particular issuer or issuers, </span><span> </span><span>exchange or exchanges, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of </span><span>industries, sector or asset class. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of </span><span>terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, or </span><span>other events could have a significant impact on the Fund</span><span> </span><span>and its investments and could </span><span>result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. During a general market </span><span>downturn, multiple asset classes may be negatively affected. Changes in market </span><span>conditions and interest rates generally do not have the same impact on all types of </span><span>securities and instruments.</span></div> <div><span>Market Trading Risk.</span></div> <div><span>Absence of Active Market.</span><span> Although shares of the Fund are listed for trading on one or </span><span>more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for </span><span>such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized </span><span>Participants.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Secondary Listings. </span><span>The Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S.</span><span> stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary </span><span>listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made available to non-U.S. investors </span><span>through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There </span><span>can be no assurance that the Fund’s shares will continue to trade on any such stock </span><span>exchange or in any market or that the Fund’s shares will continue to meet the </span><span>requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's shares </span><span>may be less actively traded in certain markets than in others, and investors are subject </span><span>to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of the market where they </span><span>or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to </span><span>investors who trade Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market </span><span>hours may not be available to investors who trade in other markets, which may result </span><span>in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</span></div> <div><span>Secondary Market Trading Risk.</span><span> Shares of the Fund may trade in the secondary market </span><span>at times when the Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such </span><span>times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more significant premiums or </span><span>discounts than might be experienced at times when the Fund accepts purchase and </span><span>redemption orders.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>7</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Secondary market trading in Fund shares may be halted by a stock exchange because </span><span>of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund shares on a </span><span>stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by </span><span>extraordinary market volatility pursuant to </span><span>“</span><span>circuit breaker</span><span>”</span><span> rules on the stock </span><span>exchange or market.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed on a stock exchange, may </span><span>be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price </span><span>decreases associated with being sold short. In addition, trading activity in derivative </span><span>products based on the Fund may lead to increased trading volume and volatility in the </span><span>secondary market for the shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV.</span><span> Shares of the Fund trade on </span><span>stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of </span><span>the Fund is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in </span><span>the market value of the Fund’s holdings. The trading price of the Fund's shares </span><span>fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours</span><span> </span><span>based on both market supply of and </span><span>demand for Fund shares and the underlying value of the Fund's portfolio holdings or </span><span>NAV. As a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s shares may deviate significantly from </span><span>NAV during periods of market volatility. </span><span>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, </span><span>MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO </span><span>NAV</span><span>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at </span><span>NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund are not </span><span>likely to be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, </span><span>which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, </span><span>their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely </span><span>that the Fund’s shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the </span><span>Fund’s next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly with </span><span>the Fund's NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other </span><span>factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at </span><span>market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during </span><span>periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the </span><span>Fund that differ significantly from its NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing to </span><span>create or redeem Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for such shares or </span><span>its underlying investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s shares trading at a </span><span>premium or discount to NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.</span><span> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange </span><span>involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or </span><span>selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage </span><span>commission and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread</span><span>”</span><span>; </span><span>that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>bid</span><span>”</span><span> price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>ask</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>price).</span><span> </span><span>The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume </span><span>and market liquidity and wider if the Fund has less trading volume and market liquidity. </span><span>In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be </span><span>regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>of the costs inherent in buying or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract </span><span>significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be </span><span>advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a </span><span>brokerage account.</span></div> <div><span>Operational Risk.</span><span> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of </span><span>factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication </span><span>errors, errors of the Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third parties, </span><span>failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA </span><span>seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, </span><span>these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address </span><span>significant operational risks.</span></div> <div><span>Passive Investment Risk.</span><span> The Fund is not actively managed and may be affected by a </span><span>general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests </span><span>in securities included in, or representative of, the Underlying Index, regardless of their </span><span>investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in </span><span>defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the U.S.</span><span> A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade </span><span>regulations, inflation and/or an economic recession in the U.S. may have a material </span><span>adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed on U.S. exchanges. </span><span>Proposed and adopted policy and legislative changes in the U.S. are changing many </span><span>aspects of financial, commercial, public health, environmental, and other regulation </span><span>and may have a significant effect on U.S. markets generally, as well as on the value of </span><span>certain securities. Governmental agencies project that the U.S. will continue to </span><span>maintain elevated public debt levels for the foreseeable future. Although elevated debt </span><span>levels do not necessarily indicate or cause economic problems, elevated public debt </span><span>service costs may constrain future economic growth.</span></div> <div><span>The U.S. has developed increasingly strained relations with a number of foreign </span><span>countries. If relations with certain countries deteriorate, it could adversely affect U.S. </span><span>issuers as well as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also </span><span>experienced increased internal unrest and discord, as well as significant challenges in </span><span>managing and containing the outbreak of COVID-19. If these trends were to continue, </span><span>it may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the issuers in which the Fund </span><span>invests.</span></div> <div><span>Securities Lending Risk.</span><span> The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities </span><span>lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the </span><span>loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund </span><span>could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for </span><span>loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash </span><span>collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund. </span><span>BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>BTC</span><span>”</span><span>), the</span><span> </span><span>Fund's securities lending </span><span>agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments for </span><span>dividends when managing the</span><span> </span><span>Fund's securities lending program.</span></div> <div><span>Technology Sector Risk.</span><span> Technology companies, including information technology </span><span>companies,</span><span> </span><span>face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>9</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>have an adverse effect on a company’s profit margins. Technology companies may </span><span>have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of </span><span>technology companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological </span><span>developments, frequent new product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth </span><span>rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Companies in the </span><span>technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and other intellectual property </span><span>rights. A technology company’s loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect </span><span>the company’s profitability. Companies in the technology sector are facing increased </span><span>government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or </span><span>regulatory action. The technology sector may also be adversely affected by changes or </span><span>trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced or characterized by </span><span>unpredictable factors.</span></div> <div><span>Tracking Error Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be subject to </span><span>“</span><span>tracking error,</span><span>”</span><span> which is the </span><span>divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error </span><span>may occur because of differences between the securities and other instruments held in </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences, </span><span>transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, </span><span>differences in timing of the accrual or the valuation of dividends or interest received by </span><span>the Fund or distributions paid to the Fund’s shareholders, the requirements to maintain </span><span>pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the </span><span>distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, changes </span><span>to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or </span><span>existing regulatory requirements, among other reasons. This risk may be heightened </span><span>during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. </span><span>Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the </span><span>Underlying Index does not.</span></div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</span></div> <div><span>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated with its investments </span><span>and investment strategies. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the </span><span>significance of any particular risk factor.</span></div> <div><span>Close-Out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.</span><span> Regulations adopted by global </span><span>prudential regulators require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global </span><span>systemically important banking organizations to include contractual restrictions on </span><span>close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. </span><span>Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards </span><span>and other derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending </span><span>agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial </span><span>contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution </span><span>proceedings and also prohibit the Fund from exercising default rights due to a </span><span>receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. These </span><span>requirements may increase credit risk and other risks to the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Consumer Discretionary Sector Risk.</span><span> The success of consumer product </span><span>manufacturers and retailers is tied closely to the performance of domestic and </span><span>international economies, interest rates, exchange rates, supply chains, competition, </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>consumer confidence, changes in demographics and consumer preferences. </span><span>Companies in the consumer discretionary sector depend heavily on disposable </span><span>household income and consumer spending, and may be strongly affected by social </span><span>trends and marketing campaigns. These companies may be subject to severe </span><span>competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</span></div> <div><span>Consumer Staples Sector Risk.</span><span> Companies in the consumer staples sector may be </span><span>affected by the regulation of various product components and production methods, </span><span>marketing campaigns and changes in the global economy, consumer spending and </span><span>consumer demand. Companies in the consumer staples sector may also be adversely </span><span>affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by </span><span>unpredictable factors. These companies may be subject to severe competition, which </span><span>may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</span></div> <div><span>Financials Sector Risk.</span><span> Companies in the financials sector</span><span> </span><span>of an economy are subject </span><span>to extensive governmental regulation and intervention, which may adversely affect the </span><span>scope of their activities, the prices they can charge, the amount of capital they must </span><span>maintain and, potentially, their size. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a </span><span>company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by </span><span>applicable law. Governmental regulation may change frequently and may have </span><span>significant adverse consequences for companies in the financials sector, including </span><span>effects not intended by such regulation. Increased risk taking by banks may also result </span><span>in greater overall risk in the U.S. and global financials sector. The impact of changes in </span><span>capital requirements, or recent or future regulation in various countries, on any </span><span>individual financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be </span><span>predicted. </span></div> <div><span>Certain risks may impact the value of investments in the financials sector more </span><span>severely than those of investments outside this sector, including the risks associated </span><span>with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage. Companies in the </span><span>financials sector are exposed directly to the credit risk of their borrowers and </span><span>counterparties, who may be leveraged to an unknown degree, including through swaps </span><span>and other derivatives products. Financial services companies may have significant </span><span>exposure to the same borrowers and counterparties, with the result that a borrower’s </span><span>or counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations to one company may affect other </span><span>companies with exposure to the same borrower or counterparty. This </span><span>interconnectedness of risk may result in significant negative impacts to companies </span><span>with direct exposure to the defaulting counterparty as well as adverse cascading </span><span>effects in the markets and the financials sector generally. Companies in the financials </span><span>sector may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and loan losses, </span><span>decreases in the availability of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades </span><span>and adverse conditions in other related markets. Insurance companies, in particular, </span><span>may be subject to severe price competition and/or rate regulation, which may have an </span><span>adverse impact on their profitability. The financials sector is particularly sensitive to </span><span>fluctuations in interest rates. The financials sector is also a target for cyberattacks, and </span><span>may experience technology malfunctions and disruptions. Cybersecurity incidents and </span><span>technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>and have reportedly caused losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively </span><span>impact the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Healthcare Sector Risk.</span><span> The profitability of companies in the healthcare sector may </span><span>be adversely affected by the following factors, among others: extensive government </span><span>regulations, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising </span><span>costs of medical products and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on </span><span>outpatient services, changes in the demand for medical products and services, a </span><span>limited number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other </span><span>market developments. Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent on patent </span><span>protection. The expiration of a company’s patents may adversely affect that company’s </span><span>profitability. Many healthcare companies are subject to extensive litigation based on </span><span>product liability and similar claims. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive </span><span>forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may result in price </span><span>discounting. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 allows for the negotiation of </span><span>prescription drug prices on behalf of Medicare recipients, which may result in reduced </span><span>prescription prices. This could reduce some healthcare companies’ overall profitability. </span><span>Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. </span><span>The process of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, and such efforts </span><span>ultimately may be unsuccessful. Companies in the healthcare sector may be thinly </span><span>capitalized and may be susceptible to product obsolescence. In addition, a number of </span><span>legislative proposals concerning healthcare have been considered by the U.S. </span><span>Congress in recent years. It is unclear what proposals will ultimately be enacted, if any, </span><span>and what effect they may have on companies in the healthcare sector.</span></div> <div><span>Illiquid Investments Risk. </span><span>The Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, </span><span>immediately after the acquisition, the Fund would have invested more than 15% of its </span><span>net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the </span><span>Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in </span><span>seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the </span><span>investment. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, </span><span>particularly during periods of market turmoil. There can be no assurance that a security </span><span>or instrument that is deemed to be liquid when purchased will continue to be liquid for </span><span>as long as it is held by the Fund, and any security or instrument held by the Fund may </span><span>be deemed an illiquid investment pursuant to the Fund’s liquidity risk management </span><span>program. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid investments may </span><span>reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be unable to transact at </span><span>advantageous times or prices. An investment may be illiquid due to, among other </span><span>things, the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a </span><span>market in securities or instruments</span><span> </span><span>or the lack of an active market for such securities </span><span>or instruments. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or instruments with </span><span>substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have increased exposure to </span><span>the risks associated with illiquid investments. Illiquid investments may be harder to </span><span>value, especially in changing markets. Although the Fund primarily seeks to redeem </span><span>shares of the Fund on an in-kind basis, if the Fund is forced to sell underlying </span><span>investments at reduced prices or under unfavorable conditions to meet redemption </span><span>requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. This may be magnified in </span><span>a rising interest rate environment or other circumstances where redemptions from the </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>12</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fund may be greater than normal. Other market participants may be attempting to </span><span>liquidate holdings at the same time as the Fund, causing increased supply of the Fund’s </span><span>underlying investments in the market and contributing to illiquid investments risk and </span><span>downward pricing pressure. In addition, if the Fund is limited in its ability to sell illiquid </span><span>investments during periods when shareholders are redeeming their shares, the Fund </span><span>will need to sell liquid securities to meet redemption requests and illiquid securities will </span><span>become a larger portion of the Fund’s holdings. During periods of market volatility, </span><span>liquidity in the market for the Fund’s shares may be impacted by the liquidity in the </span><span>market for the underlying securities or instruments held by the Fund, which could lead </span><span>to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Industrials Sector Risk.</span><span> The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials </span><span>sector may be adversely affected by supply and demand changes related to their </span><span>specific products or services and industrials sector products in general. The products </span><span>of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological </span><span>developments and frequent new product introduction. Global events, trade disputes </span><span>and changes in government regulations, economic conditions and exchange rates may </span><span>adversely affect the performance of companies in the industrials sector. While the Fund </span><span>seeks to invest in companies with positive or favorable environmental and social </span><span>characteristics, companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by </span><span>liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. The industrials sector </span><span>may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may </span><span>be influenced by unpredictable factors. Companies in the industrials sector, </span><span>particularly aerospace and defense companies, may also be adversely affected by </span><span>government spending policies because companies in this sector tend to rely to a </span><span>significant extent on government demand for their products and services.</span></div> <div><span>Large Shareholder and Large-Scale Redemption Risk.</span><span> Certain shareholders, </span><span>including an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an </span><span>affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, a market maker, or another entity, may from time to time </span><span>own or manage a substantial amount of Fund shares or may invest in the Fund and </span><span>hold their investment for a limited period of time. These shareholders may also pledge </span><span>or loan Fund shares (to secure financing or otherwise), which may result in the shares </span><span>becoming concentrated in another party. There can be no assurance that any large </span><span>shareholder or large group of shareholders would not redeem their investment or that </span><span>the size of the Fund would be maintained. Redemptions of a large number of Fund </span><span>shares by these shareholders may adversely affect the Fund’s liquidity and net assets. </span><span>To the extent the Fund permits redemptions in cash, these redemptions may force the </span><span>Fund to sell portfolio securities when it might not otherwise do so, which may </span><span>negatively impact the Fund’s NAV, have a material effect on the market price of the </span><span>Shares and increase the Fund’s brokerage costs and/or accelerate the realization of </span><span>taxable income and/or gains and cause the Fund to make taxable distributions to its </span><span>shareholders earlier than the Fund otherwise would have. In addition, under certain </span><span>circumstances, non-redeeming shareholders may be treated as receiving a </span><span>disproportionately large taxable distribution during or with respect to such tax year. </span><span>The Fund also may be required to sell its more liquid Fund investments to meet a large </span><span>redemption, in which case the Fund’s remaining assets may be less liquid, more </span><span>volatile, and more difficult to price. To the extent these large shareholders transact in </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>13</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>shares on the secondary market, such transactions may account for a large </span><span>percentage of the trading volume for the shares of the Fund and may, therefore, have a </span><span>material upward or downward effect on the market price of the Fund shares. In </span><span>addition, large purchases of Fund shares may adversely affect the Fund’s performance </span><span>to the extent that the Fund is delayed in investing new cash and is required to maintain </span><span>a larger cash position than it ordinarily would, diluting its investment returns.</span></div> <div><span>Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk. </span><span>Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies </span><span>may be more volatile than those of large-capitalization companies and, therefore, the </span><span>Fund’s share price may be more volatile than those of funds that invest a larger </span><span>percentage of their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock </span><span>prices of mid-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization</span><span> companies to adverse business or economic developments, and the </span><span>stocks of mid-capitalization companies may be less liquid than those of large-capitalization</span><span> companies, making it difficult for the Fund to buy and sell shares of mid-capitalization</span><span> companies. In addition, mid-capitalization companies generally have less </span><span>diverse product lines than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to </span><span>adverse developments related to their products.</span></div> <div><span>Real Estate Investment Risk.</span><span> Companies that invest in real estate (</span><span>“</span><span>Real Estate </span><span>Companies</span><span>”</span><span>), such as real estate investment trusts (</span><span>“</span><span>REITs</span><span>”</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>real estate holding and </span><span>operating companies, and real estate management or development companies, expose </span><span>investors to the risks of owning real estate directly, as well as to risks that relate </span><span>specifically to the way in which Real Estate Companies are organized and operated. </span><span>Real estate is highly sensitive to general and local economic conditions and </span><span>developments and is characterized by intense competition and periodic overbuilding. </span><span>Many Real Estate Companies, including REITs,</span><span> </span><span>utilize leverage (and some may be highly </span><span>leveraged), which increases investment risk and the risk normally associated with debt </span><span>financing, and could potentially increase the Fund’s losses. Rising interest rates could </span><span>result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could negatively </span><span>affect a Real Estate Company's ability to meet its payment obligations or its financing </span><span>activityand could decrease the market prices for REITs and for properties held by such </span><span>REITs. The U.S. residential and commercial real estate markets may, in the future, </span><span>experience and have, in the past, experienced a decline in value, with certain regions </span><span>experiencing significant losses in property values. Exposure to such real estate may </span><span>adversely affect Fund performance. In addition, to the extent a Real Estate Company </span><span>has its own expenses, the Fund (and indirectly, its shareholders) will bear its </span><span>proportionate share of such expenses.</span></div> <div><span>Concentration Risk</span><span>. Real Estate Companies may own a limited number of properties </span><span>and concentrate their investments in a particular geographic region, industry or </span><span>property type. Economic downturns affecting a particular region, industry or property </span><span>type may lead to a high volume of defaults within a short period.</span></div> <div><span>Equity REITs Risk</span><span>. Certain REITs may make direct investments in real estate. These </span><span>REITs are often referred to as </span><span>“</span><span>Equity REITs.</span><span>”</span><span> Equity REITs invest primarily in real </span><span>properties and may earn rental income from leasing those properties. Equity REITs may </span><span>also realize gains or losses from the sale of properties. Equity REITs will be affected by </span><span>conditions in the real estate rental market and by changes in the value of the </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>properties they own. A decline in rental income may occur because of extended </span><span>vacancies, limitations on rents, the failure to collect rents, increased competition from </span><span>other properties or poor management. Equity REITs also can be affected by rising </span><span>interest rates. Rising interest rates may cause investors to demand a high annual yield </span><span>from future distributions that, in turn, could decrease the market prices for such REITs </span><span>and for the properties held by such REITs. In addition, rising interest rates also increase </span><span>the costs of obtaining financing for real estate projects. Because many real estate </span><span>projects are dependent upon receiving financing, this could cause the value of the </span><span>Equity REITs in which the Fund invests to decline.</span></div> <div><span>Illiquidity Risk</span><span>. Investing in Real Estate Companies may involve risks similar to those </span><span>associated with investing in small-capitalization companies. Real Estate Company </span><span>securities may be volatile. There may be less trading in Real Estate Company shares, </span><span>which means that purchase and sale transactions in those shares could have a </span><span>magnified impact on share price, resulting in abrupt or erratic price fluctuations. In </span><span>addition, real estate is relatively illiquid and, therefore, a Real Estate Company may </span><span>have a limited ability to vary or liquidate its investments in properties in response to </span><span>changes in economic or other conditions.</span></div> <div><span>Interest Rate Risk</span><span>. Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real </span><span>Estate Companies, which could negatively affect a Real Estate Company’s ability to </span><span>meet its payment obligations. Declining interest rates could result in increased </span><span>prepayment on loans and require redeployment of capital in less desirable </span><span>investments.</span></div> <div><span>Leverage Risk</span><span>. Real Estate Companies may use leverage (and some may be highly </span><span>leveraged), which increases investment risk and the risks normally associated with </span><span>debt financing and could adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s operations and </span><span>market value in periods of rising interest rates. Financial covenants related to a Real </span><span>Estate Company’s leveraging may affect the ability of the Real Estate Company to </span><span>operate effectively. In addition, investments may be subject to defaults by borrowers </span><span>and tenants. Leveraging may also increase repayment risk.</span></div> <div><span>Loan Foreclosure Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may foreclose on loans that the Real </span><span>Estate Company originated and/or acquired. Foreclosure may generate negative </span><span>publicity for the underlying property that affects its market value. In addition to the </span><span>length and expense of such proceedings, the validity of the terms of the applicable </span><span>loan may not be recognized in foreclosure proceedings.</span></div> <div><span>Operational Risk</span><span>. Real Estate Companies are dependent upon management skills and </span><span>may have limited financial resources. Real Estate Companies are generally not </span><span>diversified and may be subject to heavy cash flow dependency, default by borrowers </span><span>and self-liquidation. In addition, transactions between Real Estate Companies and their </span><span>affiliates may be subject to conflicts of interest, which may adversely affect a Real </span><span>Estate Company’s shareholders. A Real Estate Company may also have joint ventures </span><span>in certain of its properties and, consequently, its ability to control decisions relating to </span><span>such properties may be limited.</span></div> <div><span>Property Risk</span><span>. Real Estate Companies may be subject to risks relating to functional </span><span>obsolescence or reduced desirability of properties; extended vacancies due to </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>15</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>economic conditions and tenant bankruptcies; property damage due to events such as </span><span>earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, rodent, insect or disease infestations and terrorist </span><span>acts; eminent domain seizures; and casualty or condemnation losses. Real estate </span><span>income and values also may be greatly affected by demographic trends, such as </span><span>population shifts, changing tastes and values, increasing vacancies or declining rents </span><span>resulting from legal, cultural, technological, global or local economic developments and </span><span>changes in tax law.</span></div> <div><span>Regulatory Risk</span><span>. Real estate income and values may be adversely affected by </span><span>applicable domestic and foreign laws (including tax laws). Government actions, such as </span><span>tax increases, zoning law changes, mandated closures or other commercial </span><span>restrictions, reduced funding for schools, parks, garbage collection and other public </span><span>services or environmental regulations also may have a major impact on real estate </span><span>income and values.</span></div> <div><span>Repayment Risk.</span><span> The prices of Real Estate Company securities may drop because of </span><span>the failure of borrowers to repay their loans, poor management, or the inability to </span><span>obtain financing either on favorable terms or at all. If the properties in which Real </span><span>Estate Companies invest do not generate sufficient income to meet operating </span><span>expenses, including, where applicable, debt service, ground lease payments, tenant </span><span>improvements, third-party leasing commissions and other capital expenditures, the </span><span>income and ability of the Real Estate Companies to make payments of interest and </span><span>principal on their loans will be adversely affected.</span></div> <div><span>U.S. Tax Risk. </span><span>Certain U.S. Real Estate Companies are subject to special U.S. federal </span><span>tax requirements. A REIT that fails to comply with such tax requirements may be </span><span>subject to U.S. federal income taxation, which may affect the value of the REIT and the </span><span>characterization of the REIT’s distributions. The U.S. federal tax requirement that a </span><span>REIT distributes substantially all of its net income to its shareholders may result in the </span><span>REIT having insufficient capital for future expenditures. A REIT that successfully </span><span>maintains its qualification may still become subject to U.S. federal, state and local </span><span>taxes, including excise, penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage recording, and transfer </span><span>taxes, both directly and indirectly through its subsidiaries.</span></div> <div><span>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.</span><span> If certain aggregate and/or fund-level ownership </span><span>thresholds are reached through transactions undertaken by BFA, its affiliates or the </span><span>Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions or actions by an issuer or regulator, the </span><span>ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to purchase or </span><span>dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be </span><span>restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make </span><span>investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant threshold limits, and </span><span>such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio holdings</span><span> </span><span>compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This </span><span>may increase the risk of the Fund being underinvested to the Underlying Index and </span><span>increase the risk of tracking error.</span></div> <div><span>For example, in certain circumstances where the Fund invests in securities issued by </span><span>companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or </span><span>international markets, is subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or </span><span>invests in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits on the </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>16</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>aggregate and/or fund-level amount invested or voted by BFA and its affiliates for their </span><span>proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Fund) that may not be </span><span>exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if </span><span>exceeded, may cause BFA and its affiliates, the Fund or other client accounts to suffer </span><span>disadvantages or business restrictions.</span></div> <div><span>Portfolio Holdings Information</span></div> <div><span>A description of the Trust's policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Fund's Statement of Additional </span><span>Information (</span><span>“</span><span>SAI</span><span>”</span><span>).

In managing </span><span>the Fund, BFA may draw upon the research and expertise of its asset management </span><span>affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's </span><span>investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists </span><span>and other investment specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines </span><span>and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</span></div> <div><span>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and the Trust (entered </span><span>into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the </span><span>Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with </span><span>respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of </span><span>portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, </span><span>and litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of </span><span>the Trustees who are not </span><span>“</span><span>interested persons</span><span>”</span><span> of the Trust).</span></div> <div><span>For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022, BFA was paid a management fee from the </span><span>Fund, as a percentage of the Fund's average daily net assets, at the annual rate of </span><span>0.10%.

BFA and its Affiliates provide investment </span><span>management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that may </span><span>follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA and its Affiliates are </span><span>involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management </span><span>activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in which their </span><span>interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or </span><span>one or more Affiliates act, or may act, as an investor, research provider, investment </span><span>manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, </span><span>adviser, trader, lender,</span><span> </span><span>index provider, agent and/or principal, and have other direct </span><span>and indirect interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other </span><span>instruments in which the Fund may directly or indirectly invest.

The Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in other </span><span>transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate provides or may in the future </span><span>provide research coverage. An Affiliate may have business relationships with, and </span><span>purchase or distribute or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants </span><span>or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, </span><span>and may receive compensation for such services. BFA or one or more Affiliates may </span><span>engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment </span><span>objectives similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for </span><span>transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the </span><span>Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end</span><span> investment companies (which may include investment companies that are </span><span>affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment </span><span>Company Act of 1940, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1940 Act</span><span>”</span><span>)). The trading activities of BFA and </span><span>these Affiliates are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly </span><span>by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate having positions in certain securities </span><span>that are senior or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities </span><span>that are owned by the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to share any investment </span><span>opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with </span><span>the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's </span><span>investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an Affiliate and of other </span><span>accounts managed by BlackRock or an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could </span><span>sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts </span><span>achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The opposite result is </span><span>also possible.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, the Fund may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an </span><span>Affiliate or</span><span> </span><span>its or their directors, officers, employees or clients have an adverse interest. </span><span>Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or managed by BFA or its </span><span>Affiliates may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or</span><span> </span><span>by </span><span>BFA or its Affiliates or their directors, officers or employees may have the effect of </span><span>diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund's activities may be limited because of regulatory restrictions applicable to </span><span>BFA or one or more Affiliates and/or their internal policies designed to comply with </span><span>such restrictions.</span></div> <div><span>Under a securities lending program approved by the Board, the Fund has retained BTC, </span><span>an Affiliate of BFA, to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent </span><span>that the Fund participates in the securities lending program.

For example, a registered investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquired Fund</span><span>”</span><span>), such as the Fund, may not knowingly sell or otherwise dispose of any </span><span>security issued by the Acquired Fund to any investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquiring </span><span>Fund</span><span>”</span><span>) or any company or companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund if, immediately </span><span>after such sale or disposition: (i) more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of </span><span>the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and any company or companies </span><span>controlled by the Acquiring Fund, or (ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding voting </span><span>stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and other investment </span><span>companies and companies controlled by them. However, registered investment </span><span>companies are permitted to invest in the Fund beyond the limits set forth in Section </span><span>12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in SEC rules. In order for a </span><span>registered investment company to invest in shares of the Fund beyond the limitations </span><span>of Section 12(d)(1) in reliance on Rule 12d1-4 under the 1940 Act, the registered </span><span>investment company must, among other things, enter into an agreement with the </span><span>Trust. Foreign investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund only up to the </span><span>limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to any applicable SEC no-action relief.</span></div> <div><span>Book Entry.</span><span> Shares of the Fund are held in book-entry form, which means that no </span><span>stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (</span><span>“</span><span>DTC</span><span>”</span><span>) or its nominee is </span><span>the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as shown on the records of </span><span>DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. </span><span>DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, </span><span>clearing corporations and other institutions that directly or indirectly maintain a </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>21</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to </span><span>receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your </span><span>name, and you are not considered a registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise </span><span>any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its </span><span>participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other </span><span>securities that you hold in book-entry or </span><span>“</span><span>street name</span><span>”</span><span> form.</span></div> <div><span>Share Prices.</span><span> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market </span><span>generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as </span><span>the supply of and demand for ETF shares and shares of underlying securities held by </span><span>the Fund, economic conditions and other factors.</span></div> <div><span>Determination of Net Asset Value. </span><span>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined </span><span>once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the close of regular trading hours of </span><span>the New York Stock Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>NYSE</span><span>”</span><span>) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day </span><span>that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that </span><span>any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are </span><span>translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as </span><span>quoted by one or more data service providers. The NAV of the Fund is calculated by </span><span>dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the value of its total assets less </span><span>total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally </span><span>rounded to the nearest cent.</span></div> <div><span>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities held by the Fund is </span><span>determined pursuant to BFA’s valuation policies and procedures. BFA has been </span><span>designated by the Board as the valuation designee for the Fund pursuant to Rule 2a-5 </span><span>under the Investment Company Act.</span></div> <div><span>Equity securities and other equity instruments for which market quotations are readily </span><span>available are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the last </span><span>reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the last </span><span>traded price on the exchange or market on which the security or instrument is </span><span>primarily traded at the time of valuation. Shares of underlying open-end funds </span><span>(including money market funds) are valued at net asset value. Shares of underlying </span><span>exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs are valued at their most recent </span><span>closing price.</span></div> <div><span>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities and money market instruments is substantially </span><span>completed each day at various times prior to the close of regular trading hours of the </span><span>NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are </span><span>determined as of such times.</span></div> <div><span>When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be </span><span>unreliable, BFA will fair value the Fund’s investments in accordance with its policies </span><span>and procedures. BFA may conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is </span><span>unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its </span><span>lack of trading or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent </span><span>price quotations or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security </span><span>or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent </span><span>to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>22</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is </span><span>available. A </span><span>“</span><span>significant event</span><span>”</span><span> is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable </span><span>business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s assets or liabilities, that </span><span>the event is likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or </span><span>closing market price of one or more assets held by, or liabilities of, the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The </span><span>fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might </span><span>reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to </span><span>extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments </span><span>using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market </span><span>valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been </span><span>sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value </span><span>prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the </span><span>prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, </span><span>which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the </span><span>performance of the Underlying Index.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends and Distributions</span></div> <div><span>General Policies.</span><span> Dividends from net investment income, if any, generally are declared </span><span>and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, </span><span>if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make </span><span>distributions on a more frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to </span><span>declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or </span><span>advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company (</span><span>“</span><span>RIC</span><span>”</span><span>) or to avoid </span><span>imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are distributed on a </span><span>pro rata</span><span> </span><span>basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC </span><span>participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds </span><span>received from the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Dividend Reinvestment Service.</span><span> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the </span><span>Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment </span><span>Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend </span><span>distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the </span><span>availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers </span><span>may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this </span><span>service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains </span><span>will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in </span><span>the secondary market.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes.</span><span> As with any investment, you should consider how your investment in shares of </span><span>the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general </span><span>information, based on current law. You should consult your own tax professional about </span><span>the tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Unless your investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred</span><span> retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>23</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax </span><span>consequences when the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes on Distributions.</span><span> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income (other </span><span>than qualified dividend income), including</span><span> </span><span>distributions of income from securities </span><span>lending and distributions out of the Fund’s net short-term capital gains, if any, are </span><span>taxable to you as ordinary income. Distributions by the Fund of net long-term capital </span><span>gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain dividends) are </span><span>taxable to you as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the </span><span>Fund’s shares. Distributions by the Fund that qualify as qualified dividend income are </span><span>taxable to you at long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified </span><span>dividend income are generally eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for </span><span>non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain </span><span>threshold amounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is </span><span>imposed on </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income,</span><span>”</span><span> including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, </span><span>and net gain, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if </span><span>married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends will be qualified dividend income to you if they are attributable to qualified </span><span>dividend income received by the Fund. Generally, qualified dividend income includes </span><span>dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S. corporations, </span><span>provided that the Fund satisfies certain holding period requirements in respect of the </span><span>stock of such corporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. </span><span>Substitute dividends received by the Fund with respect to dividends paid on securities </span><span>lent out will not be qualified dividend income. For this purpose, a qualified non-U.S. </span><span>corporation means any non-U.S. corporation that is eligible for benefits under a </span><span>comprehensive income tax treaty with the U.S., which includes an exchange of </span><span>information program, or if the stock with respect to which the dividend was paid is </span><span>readily tradable on an established U.S. securities market. The term excludes a </span><span>corporation that is a passive foreign investment company.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends received by the Fund from a RIC generally are qualified dividend income only </span><span>to the extent such dividend distributions are made out of qualified dividend income </span><span>received by such RIC. Additionally, it is expected that dividends received by the Fund </span><span>from a REIT and distributed to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the </span><span>shareholder as ordinary income. However, for tax years beginning after December 31, </span><span>2017 and before January 1, 2026, the Fund may report dividends eligible for a 20% </span><span>“</span><span>qualified business income</span><span>”</span><span> deduction for non-corporate U.S. shareholders to the </span><span>extent the Fund’s income is derived from ordinary REIT dividends, reduced by allocable </span><span>Fund expenses.</span></div> <div><span>For a dividend to be treated as qualified dividend income, the dividend must be </span><span>received with respect to a share of stock held without being hedged by the Fund, and </span><span>with respect to a share of the Fund held without being hedged by you, for 61 days </span><span>during the 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days before the date on </span><span>which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of </span><span>certain preferred stock, 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before </span><span>such date.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>24</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fund distributions, to the extent attributable to dividends from U.S. corporations, will </span><span>be eligible for the dividends received deduction for Fund shareholders that are </span><span>corporations, subject to certain hedging and holding requirements.</span></div> <div><span>In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal income tax for the year when </span><span>they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on </span><span>December 31 of the prior year.</span></div> <div><span>If the Fund’s distributions exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits, all or </span><span>a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a </span><span>return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum </span><span>distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be </span><span>taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return </span><span>of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder’s </span><span>cost basis and result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those shares on </span><span>which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is </span><span>reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the shareholder </span><span>holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</span></div> <div><span>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if you are a non-U.S. entity </span><span>(other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s </span><span>ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) </span><span>will generally be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate </span><span>applies, provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income </span><span>realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital </span><span>gains or upon the sale or other disposition of shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, </span><span>interest and other income items paid to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S.</span><span> investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the U.S. Internal </span><span>Revenue Service (</span><span>“</span><span>IRS</span><span>”</span><span>) information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account </span><span>holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information </span><span>regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial </span><span>institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will </span><span>provide the IRS information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer </span><span>identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders, comply with due </span><span>diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts, report to the </span><span>IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax </span><span>on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account </span><span>holders who fail to provide the required information, and determine certain other </span><span>information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable </span><span>intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local </span><span>revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may </span><span>need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each </span><span>substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless </span><span>certain exceptions apply.</span></div> <div><span>If your Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending arrangement, you </span><span>may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends paid while the shares are held by the </span><span>borrower as qualified dividend income.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>25</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup withholding at a 24% rate </span><span>will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer </span><span>identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes When Shares Are Sold.</span><span> Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale </span><span>of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been </span><span>held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund </span><span>shares held for one year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except </span><span>that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term</span><span> capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to </span><span>such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from </span><span>capital gain dividends, are included in </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income</span><span>”</span><span> for purposes of the </span><span>3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned above.</span></div> <div><span>The foregoing discussion summarizes some of the consequences under current U.S. </span><span>federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. </span><span>You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and sales of </span><span>shares. Consult your personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an </span><span>investment in shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</span></div> <div><span>Creations and Redemptions.</span><span> Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the </span><span>Fund are </span><span>“</span><span>created</span><span>”</span><span> at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in </span><span>block-size Creation Units or multiples thereof. Each </span><span>“</span><span>creator</span><span>”</span><span> or authorized participant </span><span>(an </span><span>“</span><span>Authorized Participant</span><span>”</span><span>) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's </span><span>Distributor, an affiliate of BFA. An Authorized Participant is a member or participant of </span><span>a clearing agency registered with the SEC, which has a written agreement with the </span><span>Fund or one of its service providers that allows such member or participant to place </span><span>orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units.</span></div> <div><span>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the Distributor and the Fund, </span><span>generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a </span><span>designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>creation basket</span><span>”</span><span>), and </span><span>an amount of cash (including any cash representing the value of substituted securities, </span><span>assets or other positions), if any, which together approximate the holdings of the Fund </span><span>in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. Similarly, shares can be </span><span>redeemed only in Creation Units, generally for a designated portfolio of securities, </span><span>assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>redemption basket</span><span>”</span><span>) held by the Fund and an amount of </span><span>cash (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted). The </span><span>Fund may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units partially or solely for cash. </span><span>Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by the Fund. </span><span>Creation and redemption baskets may differ and the Fund may accept </span><span>“</span><span>custom </span><span>baskets.</span><span>”</span><span> More information regarding custom baskets is contained in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> <div><span>The prices at which creations and redemptions occur are based on the next calculation </span><span>of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under </span><span>the authorized participant agreement.</span></div> <div><span>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation Units with the Fund. </span><span>Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or </span><span>for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>In the event of a system failure or other interruption, including disruptions at market </span><span>makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either </span><span>may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at </span><span>all, or the Fund may not be able to place or change orders.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>26</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind transactions, the Fund intends to comply </span><span>with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying </span><span>redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any </span><span>securities accepted for deposit and any securities used to satisfy redemption requests </span><span>will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities </span><span>Act of 1933, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1933 Act</span><span>”</span><span>). Further, an Authorized Participant that is </span><span>not a </span><span>“</span><span>qualified institutional buyer,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the </span><span>1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule </span><span>144A.</span></div> <div><span>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is either a member of the </span><span>Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a </span><span>DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to </span><span>creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations. Information about the </span><span>procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off </span><span>times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> <div><span>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing basis, at any point </span><span>during the life of the Fund a </span><span>“</span><span>distribution,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may </span><span>be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on </span><span>their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed </span><span>participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters </span><span>subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any </span><span>determination of whether one is an underwriter must take into account all the relevant </span><span>facts and circumstances of each particular case.</span></div> <div><span>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not </span><span>“</span><span>underwriters</span><span>”</span><span> but are </span><span>participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and </span><span>thus dealing with shares that are part of an </span><span>“</span><span>unsold allotment</span><span>”</span><span> within the meaning of </span><span>Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the 1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the </span><span>prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For </span><span>delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of </span><span>Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is available only with respect to transactions on a </span><span>national securities exchange.</span></div> <div><span>Householding.</span><span> Householding is an option available to certain Fund investors. </span><span>Householding is a method of delivery, based on the preference of the individual </span><span>investor, in which a single copy of certain shareholder documents can be delivered to </span><span>investors who share the same address, even if their accounts are registered under </span><span>different names. Please contact your broker-dealer if you are interested in enrolling in </span><span>householding and receiving a single copy of prospectuses and other shareholder </span><span>documents, or if you are currently enrolled in householding and wish to change your </span><span>householding status.</span></div> <div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>27</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Distribution</span></div> <div><span>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the Fund on an agency basis. </span><span>The Distributor does not maintain a secondary market in shares of the Fund. The </span><span>Distributor has no role in determining the policies of the Fund or the securities that are </span><span>purchased or sold by the Fund. The Distributor’s principal address is 1 University </span><span>Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</span></div> <div><span>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers, registered investment advisers, </span><span>banks or other intermediaries (together, </span><span>“</span><span>intermediaries</span><span>”</span><span>) related to marketing </span><span>activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the </span><span>development of technology platforms and reporting systems, data provision services, </span><span>or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their </span><span>customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may </span><span>be significant to the intermediary, are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments </span><span>are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or </span><span>indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type </span><span>are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may </span><span>make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or </span><span>the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other </span><span>financial incentives it is eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial </span><span>incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the </span><span>intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the </span><span>Fund or other iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding </span><span>these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. </span><span>Please contact your salesperson or </span><span>other investment professional for more information regarding any such </span><span>payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</span></div> <div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>28</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Financial Highlights</span></div> <div><span>The financial highlights table is intended to help investors understand the Fund’s </span><span>financial performance since inception.

Please </span><span>read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional </span><span>information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</span></div> <div><span>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund are listed for trading on </span><span>Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (</span><span>“</span><span>Cboe BZX</span><span>”</span><span>). The market price for a share of the Fund may </span><span>be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</span></div> <div><span>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly traded securities. The Fund is designed to </span><span>track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund </span><span>represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other </span><span>instruments intended to track a market index. Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which </span><span>can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based </span><span>on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at </span><span>NAV solely by Authorized Participants and only in aggregations of a specified number of </span><span>shares (</span><span>“</span><span>Creation Units</span><span>”</span><span>). Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are </span><span>listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market </span><span>prices that change throughout the day.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund invests in a particular segment of the securities markets and seeks to track </span><span>the performance of a securities index that is not representative of the market as a </span><span>whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. </span><span>Accordingly, an investment in the Fund should not constitute a complete investment </span><span>program.</span></div> <div><span>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of financial instruments, and is </span><span>not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The </span><span>performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, </span><span>including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency valuations, asset valuations, corporate </span><span>actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of </span><span>representative sampling or from legal restrictions (such as diversification </span><span>requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to </span><span>time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments </span><span>to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise determined by BFA, any such change or </span><span>adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on </span><span>a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, </span><span>the Underlying Index performance shown for periods prior to the effective date of any </span><span>such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect </span><span>such change or adjustment. </span></div> <div><span>Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected </span><span>to have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. </span><span>“</span><span>Replication</span><span>”</span><span> is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all of the </span><span>securities in its underlying index in approximately the same proportions as in the </span><span>underlying index.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not insured or guaranteed by </span><span>the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or </span><span>any of its affiliates.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be changed without </span><span>shareholder approval.</span></div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Principal Risks</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The Fund is subject to various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of </span><span>which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability </span><span>to meet its investment objective. You could lose all or part of your investment in the </span><span>Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments. The order of the below risk </span><span>factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. The Fund </span><span>discloses its portfolio holdings daily at www.iShares.com.</span></div> <div><span>Asset Class Risk.</span><span> The securities</span><span> </span><span>and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that </span><span>track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries, groups of industries, </span><span>markets, market segments, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, </span><span>currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and </span><span>underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a </span><span>number of factors including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, </span><span>global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental </span><span>controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that </span><span>invest in different asset classes. Securities of companies that have positive or </span><span>favorable ESG characteristics may underperform other securities.</span></div> <div><span>Assets Under Management (AUM) Risk.</span><span> From time to time, an Authorized </span><span>Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s </span><span>adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a specific period </span><span>of time to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</span><span> </span><span>can be no assurance that any </span><span>such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund would be </span><span>maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. </span><span>Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of </span><span>those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption </span><span>transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized </span><span>Participants on an agency basis (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, on behalf of other market participants). To the </span><span>extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with </span><span>creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized </span><span>Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares </span><span>may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading </span><span>halts or delisting.</span></div> <div><span>Concentration Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, </span><span>including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's investments are concentrated in </span><span>the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of </span><span>countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, project types, group of project </span><span>types, sector, market segment or asset class. The Fund may be more adversely </span><span>affected by the underperformance of those securities and/or other assets, may </span><span>experience increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse </span><span>economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting those securities and/or</span><span> other assets than a fund that does not concentrate its investments.</span></div> <div><span>Cybersecurity Risk.</span><span> The Fund,</span><span> </span><span>Authorized Participants, service providers and the </span><span>relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information security and </span><span>related </span><span>“</span><span>cyber</span><span>”</span><span> risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of </span><span>cybersecurity risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, </span><span>which could result in material adverse consequences for such issuers and may cause </span><span>the Fund’s investment in such issuers to lose value. In general, cyber incidents can </span><span>result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are </span><span>not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, through </span><span>“</span><span>hacking</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive </span><span>information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyberattacks may also </span><span>be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as </span><span>causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, efforts to make network services </span><span>unavailable to intended users). Geopolitical tensions may increase the scale and </span><span>sophistication of deliberate attacks, particularly those from nation-states or from </span><span>entities with nation-state backing. </span></div> <div><span>Cybersecurity failures by, or breaches of, the systems of the Fund's adviser, distributor </span><span>and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index and benchmark </span><span>providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market </span><span>makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests </span><span>have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially </span><span>resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s ability to calculate its NAV, </span><span>disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of </span><span>erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund </span><span>or its service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other </span><span>laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other </span><span>compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyberattacks may </span><span>render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, </span><span>and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund inaccessible, inaccurate or </span><span>incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund in order to resolve or </span><span>prevent cyber incidents. While the Fund has established business continuity plans in </span><span>the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber incidents, there are </span><span>inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain </span><span>risks have not been identified, that prevention and remediation efforts will not be </span><span>successful or that cyberattacks will go undetected. Furthermore, the Fund cannot </span><span>control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by service providers to the </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, market makers or </span><span>Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as </span><span>a result.</span></div> <div><span>Equity Securities Risk.</span><span> The Fund invests in equity securities, which are subject to </span><span>changes in value that may be attributable to market perception of a particular issuer or </span><span>to general stock market fluctuations that affect all issuers. Investments in equity </span><span>securities may be more volatile than investments in other asset classes. The </span><span>Underlying Index is composed of common stocks, which generally subject</span><span> </span><span>their holders </span><span>to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common </span><span>stockholders' claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt </span><span>securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</span></div> <div><span>ESG Risk. </span><span>To the extent that the Underlying Index uses criteria related to the ESG </span><span>characteristics of issuers, this may limit the types and number of investment </span><span>opportunities available to the Fund and, as a result, the Fund may underperform other </span><span>funds whose underlying index does not use ESG criteria. The Underlying Index’s use of </span><span>ESG criteria may result in the Fund investing in, or allocating greater weight to, </span><span>securities or market sectors that underperform the market as a whole or underperform </span><span>other funds that use ESG criteria. In addition, the use of representative sampling may </span><span>result in divergence of the Fund's overall ESG characteristics or ESG risk from those of </span><span>the Underlying Index.</span></div> <div><span>The Index Provider evaluates securities for inclusion and/or weighting in the </span><span>Underlying Index based on ESG criteria and data provided by the Index Provider or </span><span>third parties. The Index Provider’s evaluation of securities’ ESG characteristics depends </span><span>on these criteria and data, which may vary by index provider, and no assurance can be </span><span>given that they will be complete, accurate or current. In addition, the Index Provider </span><span>may evaluate security-level ESG data (including ratings) and, if applicable, ESG </span><span>objectives or constraints that are relevant to the Underlying Index only at index reviews </span><span>or rebalances. Securities included in the Underlying Index may cease to meet the </span><span>relevant ESG criteria but may nevertheless remain in the Underlying Index and the </span><span>Fund until the next review or rebalance by the Index Provider. As a result, certain </span><span>securities in the Underlying Index, or the Underlying Index as a whole, may not meet </span><span>the relevant ESG objectives or constraints at all times. If the ESG assessment of a </span><span>security in the Underlying Index or the Fund changes, neither the Fund nor BFA accepts </span><span>any liability in relation to such change. BFA does not monitor securities in the </span><span>Underlying Index with respect to ESG objectives or constraints applied by the Index </span><span>Provider and is not responsible for changes to the ESG assessment of a security in the </span><span>Underlying Index between rebalances. In addition, BFA does not assess the validity of </span><span>the Index Provider’s evaluation of the ESG characteristics of securities or the criteria </span><span>and data used in such evaluation.</span></div> <div><span>The impacts of risks related to ESG investing are likely to change over time, and new </span><span>ESG risks may be identified as further data and information regarding ESG factors and </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>impacts become available. In addition, methodologies for ESG investing continue to </span><span>develop, and the ESG methodology applied by the Index Provider may change over </span><span>time.</span></div> <div><span>Financials Sector Risk.</span><span> Companies in the financials sector are subject to extensive </span><span>governmental regulation and intervention, which may adversely affect the scope of </span><span>their activities, the prices they can charge, the amount of capital and liquid assets they </span><span>must maintain and, potentially, their size. Governmental regulation may change </span><span>frequently and may have significant adverse consequences for companies in the </span><span>financials sector, including effects not intended by such regulation. Increased risk </span><span>taking by financial companies may also result in greater overall risk in the U.S. and </span><span>global financials sector. The impact of changes in capital requirements, or recent or </span><span>future regulation in various countries, on any individual financial company or on the </span><span>financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. </span></div> <div><span>Certain risks may impact the value of investments in the financials sector more </span><span>severely than those of investments outside this sector, including the risks associated </span><span>with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage. Companies in the </span><span>financials sector are exposed directly to the credit risk of their borrowers and </span><span>counterparties, who may be leveraged to an unknown degree, including through swaps </span><span>and other derivatives products. Financial services companies may have significant </span><span>exposure to the same borrowers and counterparties, with the result that a borrower’s </span><span>or counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations to one company may affect other </span><span>companies with exposure to the same borrower or counterparty. This </span><span>interconnectedness of risk may result in significant negative impacts to companies </span><span>with direct exposure to the defaulting counterparty as well as adverse cascading </span><span>effects in the markets and the financials sector generally. Companies in the financials </span><span>sector may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and loan losses, </span><span>decreases in the availability of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades, </span><span>adverse public perception and adverse conditions in other related markets. Insurance </span><span>companies, in particular, may be subject to severe price competition and/or rate </span><span>regulation, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability. The financials </span><span>sector is particularly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. The financials sector is </span><span>also a target for cyberattacks. Cybersecurity incidents and technology malfunctions </span><span>and failures have become increasingly frequent and have caused significant losses to </span><span>companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund. The extent to which </span><span>the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or </span><span>banking is limited by applicable law.</span></div> <div><span>Index-Related Risk.</span><span> The Fund seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to </span><span>the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as </span><span>published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any </span><span>agents that may act on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that </span><span>the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the </span><span>Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to </span><span>achieve, neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or </span><span>its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in line with </span><span>the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to </span><span>manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider </span><span>to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee against the Index Provider’s or </span><span>any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the </span><span>data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not </span><span>be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, </span><span>particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or </span><span>managers. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its </span><span>shareholders. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains </span><span>incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and </span><span>would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Shareholders </span><span>should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund </span><span>and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will </span><span>be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>Unusual market conditions or other unforeseen circumstances (such as natural </span><span>disasters, political unrest or war) may impact the Index Provider or a third-party data </span><span>provider, and could cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance to the </span><span>Underlying Index. This could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or </span><span>expected composition. The postponement of a scheduled rebalance could mean that </span><span>constituents of the Underlying Index that would otherwise be removed at rebalance </span><span>due to changes in market capitalizations, issuer credit ratings, or other reasons may </span><span>remain, causing the performance and constituents of the Underlying Index to vary from </span><span>those expected under normal conditions. Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index </span><span>Provider or its agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying </span><span>Index due to reaching certain weighting constraints, unusual market conditions or </span><span>corporate events or, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index </span><span>constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances </span><span>its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the </span><span>Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such </span><span>portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Therefore, </span><span>errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the Index Provider or its agents </span><span>to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Indexing Investment Risk.</span><span> The Fund is not actively managed and may be affected by </span><span>a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests </span><span>in securities included in, or representative of, the Underlying Index, regardless of their </span><span>investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in </span><span>defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</span></div> <div><span>Industrials Sector Risk.</span><span> The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials </span><span>sector may be adversely affected by supply and demand changes related to their </span><span>specific products or services and industrials sector products in general. The products </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>6</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological </span><span>developments and frequent new product introduction. Global events, trade disputes </span><span>and changes in government regulations, economic conditions and exchange rates may </span><span>adversely affect the performance of companies in the industrials sector. Companies in </span><span>the industrials sector may be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage </span><span>and product liability claims. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by </span><span>changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable </span><span>factors. Companies in the industrials sector, particularly aerospace and defense </span><span>companies, may also be adversely affected by government spending policies because </span><span>companies in this sector tend to rely to a significant extent on government demand for </span><span>their products and services.</span></div> <div><span>Infectious Illness Risk. </span><span>A widespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as the </span><span>COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect the economies of many nations and the </span><span>global economy and may impact individual issuers and capital markets in ways that </span><span>cannot be foreseen.</span></div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in travel restrictions, closed international </span><span>borders, disruption of healthcare services, prolonged quarantines, cancellations, </span><span>supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, temporary and permanent closures </span><span>of businesses, layoffs, defaults and other significant economic, social and political </span><span>impacts, as well as general concern and uncertainty.</span></div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in extreme volatility, severe losses, credit </span><span>deterioration of issuers, and disruptions in markets, which could adversely impact the </span><span>Fund and its investments, including impairing any hedging activity.</span></div> <div><span>Certain local markets may be subject to closures. Any suspension of trading in markets </span><span>in which the Fund invests will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and will </span><span>impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities in such markets.</span><span> </span><span>Market or </span><span>economic disruptions could result in elevated tracking error and increased premiums </span><span>or discounts to the Fund's NAV. Additionally, an outbreak could impair the operations </span><span>of the Fund’s service providers, including BFA, which could adversely impact the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Governmental and quasi-governmental authorities and regulators throughout the world </span><span>may respond to an outbreak and any resulting economic disruptions with a variety of </span><span>fiscal and monetary policy changes, including direct capital infusions into companies </span><span>and other issuers, new monetary policy tools, and changes in interest rates. A reversal </span><span>of these policies, or the ineffectiveness of such policies, is likely to increase market </span><span>volatility, which could adversely affect the Fund’s investments.</span></div> <div><span>An outbreak may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social and economic risks in </span><span>certain countries or globally, which could adversely affect the Fund and its investments </span><span>and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Despite the development of vaccines, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its </span><span>effects cannot be predicted with certainty.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>7</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Issuer Risk. </span><span>The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual </span><span>securities to which the Fund has exposure. Any issuer of these securities may perform </span><span>poorly, causing the value of its securities to decline. Poor performance may be caused </span><span>by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, </span><span>expiration of patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages, </span><span>corporate restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or </span><span>other factors. Issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to </span><span>reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock prices to decline. An </span><span>issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in </span><span>which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</span></div> <div><span>Management Risk. </span><span>Because BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, </span><span>the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities not </span><span>included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that BFA’s </span><span>investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of </span><span>constraints, may not produce the intended results.</span></div> <div><span>Market Risk.</span><span> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market </span><span>movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The </span><span>value of a financial instrument or other asset may decline due to changes in general </span><span>market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the </span><span>particular instrument or asset, or factors that affect one or more issuers, </span><span>counterparties, exchanges, countries, regions, markets, industries, sectors or asset </span><span>classes, as applicable. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, </span><span>public health issues, recessions, the prospect or occurrence of a sovereign default or </span><span>other financial crisis, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund</span><span> </span><span>and </span><span>its investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. </span><span>Changes in market and economic conditions generally do not have the same impact on </span><span>all types of instruments and assets.</span></div> <div><span>Market Trading Risk.</span></div> <div><span>Absence of Active Market.</span><span> Although shares of the Fund are listed for trading on one or </span><span>more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for </span><span>such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized </span><span>Participants.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Secondary Listings. </span><span>The Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S.</span><span> stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary </span><span>listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made available to non-U.S. investors </span><span>through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There </span><span>can be no assurance that the Fund’s shares will continue to trade on any such stock </span><span>exchange or in any market or that the Fund’s shares will continue to meet the </span><span>requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's shares </span><span>may be less actively traded in certain markets than in others, and investors are subject </span><span>to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of the market where they </span><span>or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to </span><span>investors who trade Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>hours may not be available to investors who trade in other markets, which may result </span><span>in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</span></div> <div><span>Secondary Market Trading Risk.</span><span> Shares of the Fund may trade in the secondary market </span><span>at times when the Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such </span><span>times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more significant premiums or </span><span>discounts than might be experienced at times when the Fund accepts purchase and </span><span>redemption orders.</span></div> <div><span>Secondary market trading in Fund shares may be halted by a stock exchange because </span><span>of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund shares on a </span><span>stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by </span><span>extraordinary market volatility pursuant to </span><span>“</span><span>circuit breaker</span><span>”</span><span> rules on the stock </span><span>exchange or market.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed on a stock exchange, may </span><span>be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price </span><span>decreases associated with being sold short. In addition, trading activity in derivative </span><span>products based on the Fund may lead to increased trading volume and volatility in the </span><span>secondary market for the shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV.</span><span> Shares of the Fund trade on </span><span>stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of </span><span>the Fund is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in </span><span>the market value of the Fund’s holdings. The trading price of the Fund's shares </span><span>fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours</span><span> </span><span>based on both market supply of and </span><span>demand for Fund shares and the underlying value of the Fund's portfolio holdings or </span><span>NAV. As a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s shares may deviate significantly from </span><span>NAV during periods of market volatility. </span><span>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, </span><span>MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO </span><span>NAV</span><span>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at </span><span>NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund are not </span><span>likely to be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, </span><span>which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, </span><span>their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely </span><span>that the Fund’s shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the </span><span>Fund’s next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly with </span><span>the Fund's NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other </span><span>factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at </span><span>market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during </span><span>periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the </span><span>Fund that differ significantly from its NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing to </span><span>create or redeem Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for such shares or </span><span>its underlying investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s shares trading at a </span><span>premium or discount to NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.</span><span> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange </span><span>involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>9</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage </span><span>commission and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread</span><span>”</span><span>; </span><span>that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>bid</span><span>”</span><span> price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>ask</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>price).</span><span> </span><span>The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume </span><span>and market liquidity and wider if the Fund has less trading volume and market liquidity. </span><span>In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be </span><span>regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because </span><span>of the costs inherent in buying or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract </span><span>significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be </span><span>advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a </span><span>brokerage account.</span></div> <div><span>Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk. </span><span>Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies </span><span>may be more volatile than those of large-capitalization companies and, therefore, the </span><span>Fund’s share price may be more volatile than those of funds that invest a larger </span><span>percentage of their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock </span><span>prices of mid-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization</span><span> companies to adverse business or economic developments, and the </span><span>stocks of mid-capitalization companies may be less liquid than those of large-capitalization</span><span> companies, making it difficult for the Fund to buy and sell shares of mid-capitalization</span><span> companies. In addition, mid-capitalization companies generally have less </span><span>diverse product lines than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to </span><span>adverse developments related to their products.</span></div> <div><span>Operational Risk.</span><span> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of </span><span>factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication </span><span>errors, errors of the Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third parties, </span><span>failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA </span><span>seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, </span><span>these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address </span><span>significant operational risks.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the U.S.</span><span> A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade </span><span>regulations, inflation and/or an economic recession in the U.S. may have a material </span><span>adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed on U.S. exchanges. </span><span>Proposed and adopted policy and legislative changes in the U.S. are changing many </span><span>aspects of financial, commercial, public health, environmental, and other regulation </span><span>and may have a significant effect on U.S. markets generally, as well as on the value of </span><span>certain securities. Governmental agencies project that the U.S. will continue to </span><span>maintain elevated public debt levels for the foreseeable future. Although elevated debt </span><span>levels do not necessarily indicate or cause economic problems, elevated public debt </span><span>service costs may constrain future economic growth. Circumstances could arise that </span><span>could prevent the timely payment of interest or principal on U.S. government debt, </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>such as reaching the legislative </span><span>“</span><span>debt ceiling.</span><span>”</span><span> Such non-payment would result in </span><span>substantial negative consequences for the U.S. economy and the global financial </span><span>system.</span></div> <div><span>If U.S. relations with certain countries deteriorate, it could adversely affect U.S. issuers </span><span>as well as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also </span><span>experienced increased internal unrest and discord. If these trends were to continue, it </span><span>may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the issuers in which the Fund </span><span>invests.</span></div> <div><span>Securities Lending Risk.</span><span> The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities </span><span>lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the </span><span>loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund </span><span>could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for </span><span>loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash </span><span>collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund. </span><span>BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>BTC</span><span>”</span><span>), the</span><span> </span><span>Fund's securities lending </span><span>agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments for </span><span>dividends when managing the</span><span> </span><span>Fund's securities lending program.</span></div> <div><span>Tracking Error Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be subject to </span><span>“</span><span>tracking error,</span><span>”</span><span> which is the </span><span>divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error </span><span>may occur because of differences between the securities and other instruments held in </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences, </span><span>transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, </span><span>differences in timing of the accrual or the valuation of dividends or interest received by </span><span>the Fund or distributions paid to the Fund’s shareholders, the requirements to maintain </span><span>pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the </span><span>distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, changes </span><span>to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or </span><span>existing regulatory requirements, among other reasons. This risk may be heightened </span><span>during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. </span><span>Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the </span><span>Underlying Index does not. </span><span>BFA EXPECTS THAT THE FUND MAY EXPERIENCE </span><span>HIGHER TRACKING ERROR THAN IS TYPICAL FOR SIMILAR INDEX ETFs, </span><span>ESPECIALLY BEFORE THE FUND REACHES SUFFICIENT SCALE AND FURTHER </span><span>BROADENS ITS HOLDINGS.</span></div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</span></div> <div><span>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated with its investments </span><span>and investment strategies. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the </span><span>significance of any particular risk factor.</span></div> <div><span>Close-Out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.</span><span> Regulations adopted by global </span><span>prudential regulators require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global </span><span>systemically important banking organizations to include contractual restrictions on </span><span>close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards </span><span>and other derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending </span><span>agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial </span><span>contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution </span><span>proceedings and also prohibit the Fund from exercising default rights due to a </span><span>receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. These </span><span>requirements may increase credit risk and other risks to the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Consumer Discretionary Sector Risk.</span><span> The success of consumer product </span><span>manufacturers and retailers is tied closely to the performance of domestic and </span><span>international economies, interest rates, exchange rates, supply chains, competition, </span><span>consumer confidence, changes in demographics and consumer preferences. </span><span>Companies in the consumer discretionary sector depend heavily on disposable </span><span>household income and consumer spending, and may be strongly affected by social </span><span>trends and marketing campaigns. These companies may be subject to severe </span><span>competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</span></div> <div><span>Dividend-Paying Stock Risk.</span><span> Investing in dividend-paying stocks involves the risk </span><span>that such stocks may fall out of favor with investors and underperform the broader </span><span>market. Companies that issue dividend-paying stocks are not required to pay or </span><span>continue paying dividends on such stocks. It is possible that issuers of the stocks held </span><span>by the Fund will not declare dividends in the future or will reduce or eliminate the </span><span>payment of dividends (including reducing or eliminating anticipated accelerations or </span><span>increases in the payment of dividends) in the future.</span></div> <div><span>Healthcare Sector Risk.</span><span> The profitability of companies in the healthcare sector may </span><span>be adversely affected by the following factors, among others: extensive government </span><span>regulations, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising </span><span>costs of medical products and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on </span><span>outpatient services, changes in the demand for medical products and services, a </span><span>limited number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other </span><span>market developments. Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent on patent </span><span>protection. The expiration of a company’s patents may adversely affect that company’s </span><span>profitability. Many healthcare companies are subject to extensive litigation based on </span><span>product liability and similar claims. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive </span><span>forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may result in price </span><span>discounting. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 allows for the negotiation of </span><span>prescription drug prices on behalf of Medicare recipients, which may result in reduced </span><span>prescription prices. This could reduce some healthcare companies’ overall profitability. </span><span>Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. </span><span>The process of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, and such efforts </span><span>ultimately may be unsuccessful. Companies in the healthcare sector may be thinly </span><span>capitalized and may be susceptible to product obsolescence. In addition, a number of </span><span>legislative proposals concerning healthcare have been considered by the U.S. </span><span>Congress in recent years. It is unclear what proposals will ultimately be enacted, if any, </span><span>and what effect they may have on companies in the healthcare sector.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>12</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Illiquid Investments Risk. </span><span>The Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, </span><span>immediately after the acquisition, the Fund would have invested more than 15% of its </span><span>net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the </span><span>Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in </span><span>seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the </span><span>investment. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, </span><span>particularly during periods of market turmoil. There can be no assurance that a security </span><span>or instrument that is deemed to be liquid when purchased will continue to be liquid for </span><span>as long as it is held by the Fund, and any security or instrument held by the Fund may </span><span>be deemed an illiquid investment pursuant to the Fund’s liquidity risk management </span><span>program. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid investments may </span><span>reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be unable to transact at </span><span>advantageous times or prices. An investment may be illiquid due to, among other </span><span>things, the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a </span><span>market in securities or instruments</span><span> </span><span>or the lack of an active market for such securities </span><span>or instruments. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or instruments with </span><span>substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have increased exposure to </span><span>the risks associated with illiquid investments. Illiquid investments may be harder to </span><span>value, especially in changing markets. Although the Fund primarily seeks to redeem </span><span>shares of the Fund on an in-kind basis, if the Fund is forced to sell underlying </span><span>investments at reduced prices or under unfavorable conditions to meet redemption </span><span>requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. This may be magnified in </span><span>a rising interest rate environment or other circumstances where redemptions from the </span><span>Fund may be greater than normal. Other market participants may be attempting to </span><span>liquidate holdings at the same time as the Fund, causing increased supply of the Fund’s </span><span>underlying investments in the market and contributing to illiquid investments risk and </span><span>downward pricing pressure. In addition, if the Fund is limited in its ability to sell illiquid </span><span>investments during periods when shareholders are redeeming their shares, the Fund </span><span>will need to sell liquid securities to meet redemption requests and illiquid securities will </span><span>become a larger portion of the Fund’s holdings. During periods of market volatility, </span><span>liquidity in the market for the Fund’s shares may be impacted by the liquidity in the </span><span>market for the underlying securities or instruments held by the Fund, which could lead </span><span>to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Information Technology Sector Risk.</span><span> Information technology companies face </span><span>intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse </span><span>effect on their profit margins. Like other technology companies, information </span><span>technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or </span><span>personnel. The products of information technology companies may face obsolescence </span><span>due to rapid technological developments, frequent new product introduction, </span><span>unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified </span><span>personnel. Companies in the information technology sector are heavily dependent on </span><span>patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may </span><span>adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Companies in the information </span><span>technology sector are facing increased government and regulatory scrutiny and may be </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>13</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>subject to adverse government or regulatory action. Companies in the application </span><span>software industry, in particular, may also be negatively affected by the decline or </span><span>fluctuation of subscription renewal rates for their products and services, which may </span><span>have an adverse effect on profit margins. Companies in the systems software industry </span><span>may be adversely affected by, among other things, actual or perceived security </span><span>vulnerabilities in their products and services, which may result in individual or class </span><span>action lawsuits, state or federal enforcement actions and other remediation costs.</span></div> <div><span>Large Shareholder and Large-Scale Redemption Risk.</span><span> Certain shareholders, </span><span>including an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an </span><span>affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, a market maker, or another entity, may from time to time </span><span>own or manage a substantial amount of Fund shares or may invest in the Fund and </span><span>hold their investment for a limited period of time. These shareholders may also pledge </span><span>or loan Fund shares (to secure financing or otherwise), which may result in the shares </span><span>becoming concentrated in another party. There can be no assurance that any large </span><span>shareholder or large group of shareholders would not redeem their investment or that </span><span>the size of the Fund would be maintained. Redemptions of a large number of Fund </span><span>shares by these shareholders may adversely affect the Fund’s liquidity and net assets. </span><span>To the extent the Fund permits redemptions in cash, these redemptions may force the </span><span>Fund to sell portfolio securities when it might not otherwise do so, which may </span><span>negatively impact the Fund’s NAV, have a material effect on the market price of the </span><span>Shares and increase the Fund’s brokerage costs and/or accelerate the realization of </span><span>taxable income and/or gains and cause the Fund to make taxable distributions to its </span><span>shareholders earlier than the Fund otherwise would have. In addition, under certain </span><span>circumstances, non-redeeming shareholders may be treated as receiving a </span><span>disproportionately large taxable distribution during or with respect to such tax year. </span><span>The Fund also may be required to sell its more liquid Fund investments to meet a large </span><span>redemption, in which case the Fund’s remaining assets may be less liquid, more </span><span>volatile, and more difficult to price. To the extent these large shareholders transact in </span><span>shares on the secondary market, such transactions may account for a large </span><span>percentage of the trading volume for the shares of the Fund and may, therefore, have a </span><span>material upward or downward effect on the market price of the Fund shares. In </span><span>addition, large purchases of Fund shares may adversely affect the Fund’s performance </span><span>to the extent that the Fund is delayed in investing new cash and is required to maintain </span><span>a larger cash position than it ordinarily would, diluting its investment returns.</span></div> <div><span>Materials Sector Risk.</span><span> Companies in the materials sector may be adversely affected </span><span>by commodity price volatility, exchange rate fluctuations, social and political unrest, </span><span>war, import or export controls, increased competition, depletion of resources, </span><span>technical advances, labor relations, over-production, decreases in the demand for </span><span>materials, litigation and government regulations, among other factors. Companies in </span><span>the materials sector are also at risk of liability for environmental damage and product </span><span>liability claims and may incur significant environmental remediation costs in complying </span><span>with environmental laws. Production of materials may exceed demand as a result of </span><span>market imbalances or economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Real Estate Investment Risk.</span><span> Companies that invest in real estate (</span><span>“</span><span>Real Estate </span><span>Companies</span><span>”</span><span>), such as real estate investment trusts (</span><span>“</span><span>REITs</span><span>”</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>real estate holding and </span><span>operating companies, and real estate management or development companies, expose </span><span>investors to the risks of owning real estate directly, as well as to risks that relate </span><span>specifically to the way in which Real Estate Companies are organized and operated. </span><span>Real estate is highly sensitive to general and local economic conditions and </span><span>developments and is characterized by intense competition and periodic overbuilding. </span><span>Many Real Estate Companies, including REITs,</span><span> </span><span>utilize leverage (and some may be highly </span><span>leveraged), which increases investment risk and the risk normally associated with debt </span><span>financing, and could potentially increase the Fund’s losses. Rising interest rates could </span><span>result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could negatively </span><span>affect a Real Estate Company's ability to meet its payment obligations or its financing </span><span>activity and could decrease the market prices for REITs and for properties held by such </span><span>REITs. In addition, to the extent a Real Estate Company has its own expenses, the Fund </span><span>(and indirectly, its shareholders) will bear its proportionate share of such expenses.</span></div> <div><span>Concentration Risk</span><span>. Real Estate Companies may own a limited number of properties </span><span>and concentrate their investments in a particular geographic region, industry or </span><span>property type. Economic downturns affecting a particular region, industry or property </span><span>type may lead to a high volume of defaults within a short period.</span></div> <div><span>Equity REITs Risk. </span><span>Certain REITs may make direct investments in real estate. These </span><span>REITs are often referred to as </span><span>“</span><span>Equity REITs.</span><span>”</span><span> Equity REITs invest primarily in real </span><span>properties and may earn rental income from leasing those properties. Equity REITs may </span><span>also realize gains or losses from the sale of properties. Equity REITs will be affected by </span><span>conditions in the real estate rental market and by changes in the value of the </span><span>properties they own. A decline in rental income may occur because of extended </span><span>vacancies, limitations on rents, the failure to collect rents, increased competition from </span><span>other properties or poor management. Equity REITs also can be affected by rising </span><span>interest rates. Rising interest rates may cause investors to demand a high annual yield </span><span>from future distributions that, in turn, could decrease the market prices for such REITs </span><span>and for the properties held by such REITs. In addition, rising interest rates also increase </span><span>the costs of obtaining financing for real estate projects. Because many real estate </span><span>projects are dependent upon receiving financing, this could cause the value of the </span><span>Equity REITs in which the Fund invests to decline.</span></div> <div><span>Illiquidity Risk</span><span>. Investing in Real Estate Companies may involve risks similar to those </span><span>associated with investing in small-capitalization companies. Real Estate Company </span><span>securities may be volatile. There may be less trading in Real Estate Company shares, </span><span>which means that purchase and sale transactions in those shares could have a </span><span>magnified impact on share price, resulting in abrupt or erratic price fluctuations. In </span><span>addition, real estate is relatively illiquid and, therefore, a Real Estate Company may </span><span>have a limited ability to vary or liquidate its investments in properties in response to </span><span>changes in economic or other conditions.</span></div> <div><span>Interest Rate Risk</span><span>. Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real </span><span>Estate Companies, which could negatively affect a Real Estate Company’s ability to </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>15</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>meet its payment obligations. Declining interest rates could result in increased </span><span>prepayment on loans and require redeployment of capital in less desirable </span><span>investments.</span></div> <div><span>Leverage Risk</span><span>. Real Estate Companies may use leverage (and some may be highly </span><span>leveraged), which increases investment risk and the risks normally associated with </span><span>debt financing and could adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s operations and </span><span>market value in periods of rising interest rates. Financial covenants related to a Real </span><span>Estate Company’s leveraging may affect the ability of the Real Estate Company to </span><span>operate effectively. In addition, investments may be subject to defaults by borrowers </span><span>and tenants. Leveraging may also increase repayment risk.</span></div> <div><span>Loan Foreclosure Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may foreclose on loans that the Real </span><span>Estate Company originated and/or acquired. Foreclosure may generate negative </span><span>publicity for the underlying property that affects its market value. In addition to the </span><span>length and expense of such proceedings, the validity of the terms of the applicable </span><span>loan may not be recognized in foreclosure proceedings.</span></div> <div><span>Operational Risk</span><span>. Real Estate Companies are dependent upon management skills and </span><span>may have limited financial resources. Real Estate Companies are generally not </span><span>diversified and may be subject to heavy cash flow dependency, default by borrowers </span><span>and self-liquidation. In addition, transactions between Real Estate Companies and their </span><span>affiliates may be subject to conflicts of interest, which may adversely affect a Real </span><span>Estate Company’s shareholders. A Real Estate Company may also have joint ventures </span><span>in certain of its properties and, consequently, its ability to control decisions relating to </span><span>such properties may be limited.</span></div> <div><span>Property Risk</span><span>. Real Estate Companies may be subject to risks relating to functional </span><span>obsolescence or reduced desirability of properties; extended vacancies due to </span><span>economic conditions and tenant bankruptcies; property damage due to events such as </span><span>earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, rodent, insect or disease infestations and terrorist </span><span>acts; eminent domain seizures; and casualty or condemnation losses. Real estate </span><span>income and values also may be greatly affected by demographic trends, such as </span><span>population shifts, changes in consumer preferences and values, increasing vacancies </span><span>or declining rents resulting from legal, cultural, technological, global or local economic </span><span>developments and changes in tax law.</span></div> <div><span>Regulatory Risk</span><span>. Real estate income and values may be adversely affected by </span><span>applicable domestic and foreign laws (including tax laws). Government actions, such as </span><span>tax increases, zoning law changes, mandated closures or other commercial </span><span>restrictions, reduced funding for schools, parks, garbage collection and other public </span><span>services or environmental regulations also may have a major impact on real estate </span><span>income and values.</span></div> <div><span>Repayment Risk.</span><span> The prices of Real Estate Company securities may drop because of </span><span>the failure of borrowers to repay their loans, poor management, or the inability to </span><span>obtain financing either on favorable terms or at all. If the properties in which Real </span><span>Estate Companies invest do not generate sufficient income to meet operating </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>16</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>expenses, including, where applicable, debt service, ground lease payments, tenant </span><span>improvements, third-party leasing commissions and other capital expenditures, the </span><span>income and ability of the Real Estate Companies to make payments of interest and </span><span>principal on their loans will be adversely affected.</span></div> <div><span>U.S. Tax Risk. </span><span>Certain U.S. Real Estate Companies are subject to special U.S. federal </span><span>tax requirements. A REIT that fails to comply with such tax requirements may be </span><span>subject to U.S. federal income taxation, which may affect the value of the REIT and the </span><span>characterization of the REIT’s distributions. The U.S. federal tax requirement that a </span><span>REIT distributes substantially all of its net income to its shareholders may result in the </span><span>REIT having insufficient capital for future expenditures. A REIT that successfully </span><span>maintains its qualification may still become subject to U.S. federal, state and local </span><span>taxes, including excise, penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage recording, and transfer </span><span>taxes, both directly and indirectly through its subsidiaries.</span></div> <div><span>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.</span><span> If certain aggregate and/or fund-level ownership </span><span>thresholds are reached through transactions undertaken by BFA, its affiliates or the </span><span>Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions or actions by an issuer or regulator, the </span><span>ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to purchase or </span><span>dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be </span><span>restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make </span><span>investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant threshold limits, and </span><span>such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio holdings</span><span> </span><span>compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This </span><span>may increase the risk of the Fund being underinvested to the Underlying Index and </span><span>increase the risk of tracking error.</span></div> <div><span>For example, in certain circumstances where the Fund invests in securities issued by </span><span>companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or </span><span>international markets, is subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or </span><span>invests in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits on the </span><span>aggregate and/or fund-level amount invested or voted by BFA and its affiliates for their </span><span>proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Fund) that may not be </span><span>exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if </span><span>exceeded, may cause BFA and its affiliates, the Fund or other client accounts to suffer </span><span>disadvantages or business restrictions.</span></div> <div><span>Portfolio Holdings Information</span></div> <div><span>A description of the Trust's policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Fund's Statement of Additional </span><span>Information (</span><span>“</span><span>SAI</span><span>”</span><span>).

In managing </span><span>the Fund, BFA may draw upon the research and expertise of its asset management </span><span>affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's </span><span>investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists </span><span>and other investment specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines </span><span>and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</span></div> <div><span>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and the Trust (entered </span><span>into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the </span><span>Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with </span><span>respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of </span><span>portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, </span><span>and litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of </span><span>the Trustees who are not </span><span>“</span><span>interested persons</span><span>”</span><span> of the Trust).

An Affiliate may have business relationships with, and </span><span>purchase or distribute or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants </span><span>or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>19</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>and may receive compensation for such services. BFA or one or more Affiliates may </span><span>engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment </span><span>objectives similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for </span><span>transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the </span><span>Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end</span><span> investment companies (which may include investment companies that are </span><span>affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment </span><span>Company Act of 1940, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1940 Act</span><span>”</span><span>)). The trading activities of BFA and </span><span>these Affiliates are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly </span><span>by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate having positions in certain securities </span><span>that are senior or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities </span><span>that are owned by the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to share any investment </span><span>opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with </span><span>the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's </span><span>investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an Affiliate and of other </span><span>accounts managed by BlackRock or an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could </span><span>sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts </span><span>achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The opposite result is </span><span>also possible.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, the Fund may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an </span><span>Affiliate or</span><span> </span><span>its or their directors, officers, employees or clients have an adverse interest. </span><span>Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or managed by BFA or its </span><span>Affiliates may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or</span><span> </span><span>by </span><span>BFA or its Affiliates or their directors, officers or employees may have the effect of </span><span>diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund's activities may be limited because of regulatory restrictions applicable to </span><span>BFA or one or more Affiliates and/or their internal policies designed to comply with </span><span>such restrictions.</span></div> <div><span>Under a securities lending program approved by the Board, the Fund has retained BTC, </span><span>an Affiliate of BFA, to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent </span><span>that the Fund participates in the securities lending program. For these services, the </span><span>securities lending agent will receive a fee from the Fund, including a fee based on the </span><span>returns earned on the Fund’s investment of the cash received as collateral for the </span><span>loaned securities. In addition, one or more Affiliates may be among the entities to </span><span>which the Fund may lend its portfolio securities under the securities lending program.</span></div> <div><span>Under an ETF Services Agreement, the Fund has retained BlackRock Investments, LLC </span><span>(the </span><span>“</span><span>Distributor</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>BRIL</span><span>”</span><span>), an Affiliate of BFA, to perform certain order processing, </span><span>Authorized Participant communications, and related services in connection with the </span><span>issuance and redemption of Creation Units of the Fund (</span><span>“</span><span>ETF Services</span><span>”</span><span>).

Citibank </span><span>may have, or from time to time may develop, additional relationships with BlackRock or </span><span>funds managed by BFA and its affiliates.</span></div> <div><span>It is also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients </span><span>(including other funds and separately managed accounts) may, subject to compliance </span><span>with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of the Fund. The price, availability, </span><span>liquidity, and (in some cases) expense ratio of the Fund may be impacted by purchases </span><span>and sales of the Fund by BlackRock and/or its advisory clients.</span></div> <div><span>The activities of BFA and its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers or </span><span>employees may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund </span><span>and its shareholders. BFA has adopted policies and procedures designed to address </span><span>these potential conflicts of interest. See the SAI for further information.</span></div> <div><span>Shareholder Information</span></div> <div><span>Additional shareholder information, including how to buy and sell shares of the Fund, is </span><span>available free of charge by calling toll-free: 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or visiting </span><span>our website at www.iShares.com.</span></div> <div><span>Buying and Selling Shares.</span><span> Shares of the Fund may be acquired or redeemed directly </span><span>from the Fund only in Creation Units or multiples thereof, as discussed in the </span><span>Creations </span><span>and Redemptions</span><span> section of this Prospectus. Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, </span><span>shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a </span><span>Creation Unit.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange for trading during the </span><span>trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of </span><span>other publicly traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment </span><span>for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or otherwise in the secondary </span><span>market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol </span><span>“</span><span>XJH.</span><span>”</span></div> <div><span>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary market involves two </span><span>types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling </span><span>shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other </span><span>charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may be a significant </span><span>proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In </span><span>addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread,</span><span>”</span><span> that is, any difference between the </span><span>bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over time for shares of the Fund based </span><span>on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund </span><span>has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity (which is often the case for funds that are newly launched </span><span>or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity or illiquidity </span><span>of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller </span><span>funds or in instances of significant volatility of the underlying securities.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>21</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Fund does not impose restrictions on the frequency of purchases and redemptions </span><span>of Fund shares directly with the Fund. The Board determined not to adopt policies and </span><span>procedures designed to prevent or monitor for frequent purchases and redemptions of </span><span>Fund shares because the Fund generally sells and redeems its shares directly through </span><span>transactions that are in-kind and/or for cash, with a deadline for placing cash-related </span><span>transactions no later than the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio </span><span>securities. However, the Fund has taken certain measures (</span><span>e.g</span><span>., imposing transaction </span><span>fees on purchases and redemptions of Creation Units and reserving the right to reject </span><span>purchases of Creation Units under certain circumstances) to minimize the potential </span><span>consequences of frequent cash purchases and redemptions by Authorized Participants, </span><span>such as increased tracking error, disruption of portfolio management, dilution to the </span><span>Fund, and/or increased transaction costs. Further, the vast majority of trading in Fund </span><span>shares occurs on the secondary market, which does not involve the Fund directly, and </span><span>such trading is unlikely to cause many of the harmful effects of frequent cash </span><span>purchases or redemptions of Fund shares.</span></div> <div><span>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed is open for </span><span>trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays </span><span>(or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, </span><span>Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor </span><span>Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is Cboe </span><span>BZX.</span></div> <div><span>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act generally restricts investments by investment </span><span>companies, including foreign and unregistered investment companies, in the securities </span><span>of other investment companies. For example, a registered investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquired Fund</span><span>”</span><span>), such as the Fund, may not knowingly sell or otherwise dispose of any </span><span>security issued by the Acquired Fund to any investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquiring </span><span>Fund</span><span>”</span><span>) or any company or companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund if, immediately </span><span>after such sale or disposition: (i) more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of </span><span>the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and any company or companies </span><span>controlled by the Acquiring Fund, or (ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding voting </span><span>stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and other investment </span><span>companies and companies controlled by them. However, registered investment </span><span>companies are permitted to invest in the Fund beyond the limits set forth in Section </span><span>12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in SEC rules. In order for a </span><span>registered investment company to invest in shares of the Fund beyond the limitations </span><span>of Section 12(d)(1) in reliance on Rule 12d1-4 under the 1940 Act, the registered </span><span>investment company must, among other things, enter into an agreement with the </span><span>Trust. Foreign investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund only up to the </span><span>limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to any applicable SEC no-action relief.</span></div> <div><span>Book Entry.</span><span> Shares of the Fund are held in book-entry form, which means that no </span><span>stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (</span><span>“</span><span>DTC</span><span>”</span><span>) or its nominee is </span><span>the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>22</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as shown on the records of </span><span>DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. </span><span>DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, </span><span>clearing corporations and other institutions that directly or indirectly maintain a </span><span>custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to </span><span>receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your </span><span>name, and you are not considered a registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise </span><span>any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its </span><span>participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other </span><span>securities that you hold in book-entry or </span><span>“</span><span>street name</span><span>”</span><span> form.</span></div> <div><span>Share Prices.</span><span> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market </span><span>generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as </span><span>the supply of and demand for ETF shares and shares of underlying securities held by </span><span>the Fund, economic conditions and other factors.</span></div> <div><span>Determination of Net Asset Value. </span><span>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined </span><span>once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the close of regular trading hours of </span><span>the New York Stock Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>NYSE</span><span>”</span><span>) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day </span><span>that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that </span><span>any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are </span><span>translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as </span><span>quoted by one or more data service providers. The NAV of the Fund is calculated by </span><span>dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the value of its total assets less </span><span>total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally </span><span>rounded to the nearest cent.</span></div> <div><span>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities held by the Fund is </span><span>determined pursuant to BFA’s valuation policies and procedures. BFA has been </span><span>designated by the Board as the valuation designee for the Fund pursuant to Rule 2a-5 </span><span>under the 1940 Act.</span></div> <div><span>Equity securities and other equity instruments for which market quotations are readily </span><span>available are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the last </span><span>reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the last </span><span>traded price on the exchange or market on which the security or instrument is </span><span>primarily traded at the time of valuation. Shares of underlying open-end funds </span><span>(including money market funds) are valued at net asset value. Shares of underlying </span><span>exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs are valued at their most recent </span><span>closing price.</span></div> <div><span>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities and money market instruments is substantially </span><span>completed each day at various times prior to the close of regular trading hours of the </span><span>NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are </span><span>determined as of such times.</span></div> <div><span>When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be </span><span>unreliable, BFA will fair value the Fund’s investments in accordance with its policies </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>23</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>and procedures. BFA may conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is </span><span>unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its </span><span>lack of trading or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent </span><span>price quotations or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security </span><span>or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent </span><span>to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is </span><span>listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is </span><span>available. A </span><span>“</span><span>significant event</span><span>”</span><span> is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable </span><span>business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s assets or liabilities, that </span><span>the event is likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or </span><span>closing market price of one or more assets held by, or liabilities of, the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The </span><span>fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might </span><span>reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to </span><span>extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments </span><span>using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market </span><span>valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been </span><span>sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value </span><span>prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the </span><span>prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, </span><span>which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the </span><span>performance of the Underlying Index.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends and Distributions.</span></div> <div><span>General Policies.</span><span> Dividends from net investment income, if any, generally are declared </span><span>and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, </span><span>if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make </span><span>distributions on a more frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to </span><span>declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or </span><span>advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company (</span><span>“</span><span>RIC</span><span>”</span><span>) or to avoid </span><span>imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are distributed on a </span><span>pro rata</span><span> </span><span>basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC </span><span>participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds </span><span>received from the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Dividend Reinvestment Service.</span><span> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the </span><span>Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment </span><span>Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend </span><span>distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the </span><span>availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers </span><span>may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this </span><span>service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains </span><span>will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in </span><span>the secondary market.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>24</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Note on Tax Information.</span><span> The following sections summarize some of the consequences </span><span>under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for </span><span>personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund </span><span>distributions and sales of shares. Certain states and localities may exempt from tax </span><span>distributions attributable to interest from U.S. federal government obligations. Consult </span><span>your personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in </span><span>shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes.</span><span> As with any investment, you should consider how your investment in shares of </span><span>the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general </span><span>information, based on current law. You should consult your own tax professional about </span><span>the tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Unless your investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred</span><span> retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally </span><span>will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax </span><span>consequences when the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes on Distributions.</span><span> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income (other </span><span>than qualified dividend income), including</span><span> </span><span>distributions of income from securities </span><span>lending and distributions out of the Fund’s net short-term capital gains, if any, are </span><span>taxable to you as ordinary income. Distributions by the Fund of net long-term capital </span><span>gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain dividends) are </span><span>taxable to you as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the </span><span>Fund’s shares. Distributions by the Fund that qualify as qualified dividend income are </span><span>taxable to you at long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified </span><span>dividend income are generally eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for </span><span>non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain </span><span>threshold amounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is </span><span>imposed on </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income,</span><span>”</span><span> including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, </span><span>and net gain, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if </span><span>married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends will be qualified dividend income to you if they are attributable to qualified </span><span>dividend income received by the Fund. Generally, qualified dividend income includes </span><span>dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S. corporations, </span><span>provided that the Fund satisfies certain holding period requirements in respect of the </span><span>stock of such corporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. </span><span>Substitute dividends received by the Fund with respect to dividends paid on securities </span><span>lent out will not be qualified dividend income. For this purpose, a qualified non-U.S. </span><span>corporation means any non-U.S. corporation that is eligible for benefits under a </span><span>comprehensive income tax treaty with the U.S., which includes an exchange of </span><span>information program, or if the stock with respect to which the dividend was paid is </span><span>readily tradable on an established U.S. securities market. The term excludes a </span><span>corporation that is a passive foreign investment company.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends received by the Fund from a RIC generally are qualified dividend income only </span><span>to the extent such dividend distributions are made out of qualified dividend income </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>25</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>received by such RIC. Additionally, it is expected that dividends received by the Fund </span><span>from a REIT and distributed to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the </span><span>shareholder as ordinary income. However, for tax years beginning after December 31, </span><span>2017 and before January 1, 2026, the Fund may report dividends eligible for a 20% </span><span>“</span><span>qualified business income</span><span>”</span><span> deduction for non-corporate U.S. shareholders to the </span><span>extent the Fund’s income is derived from ordinary REIT dividends, reduced by allocable </span><span>Fund expenses.</span></div> <div><span>For a dividend to be treated as qualified dividend income, the dividend must be </span><span>received with respect to a share of stock held without being hedged by the Fund, and </span><span>with respect to a share of the Fund held without being hedged by you, for 61 days </span><span>during the 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days before the date on </span><span>which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of </span><span>certain preferred stock, 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before </span><span>such date.</span></div> <div><span>Fund distributions, to the extent attributable to dividends from U.S. corporations, will </span><span>be eligible for the dividends received deduction for Fund shareholders that are </span><span>corporations, subject to certain hedging and holding requirements.</span></div> <div><span>In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal income tax for the year when </span><span>they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on </span><span>December 31 of the prior year.</span></div> <div><span>If the Fund’s distributions exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits, all or </span><span>a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a </span><span>return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum </span><span>distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be </span><span>taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return </span><span>of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder’s </span><span>cost basis and result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those shares on </span><span>which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is </span><span>reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the shareholder </span><span>holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</span></div> <div><span>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if you are a non-U.S. entity </span><span>(other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s </span><span>ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) </span><span>will generally be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate </span><span>applies, provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income </span><span>realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital </span><span>gains or upon the sale or other disposition of shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, </span><span>interest and other income items paid to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S.</span><span> investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the U.S. Internal </span><span>Revenue Service (</span><span>“</span><span>IRS</span><span>”</span><span>) information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account </span><span>holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>26</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial </span><span>institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will </span><span>provide the IRS information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer </span><span>identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders, comply with due </span><span>diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts, report to the </span><span>IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax </span><span>on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account </span><span>holders who fail to provide the required information, and determine certain other </span><span>information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable </span><span>intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local </span><span>revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may </span><span>need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each </span><span>substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless </span><span>certain exceptions apply.</span></div> <div><span>If your Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending arrangement, you </span><span>may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends paid while the shares are held by the </span><span>borrower as qualified dividend income.</span></div> <div><span>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup withholding at a 24% rate </span><span>will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer </span><span>identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes When Shares Are Sold.</span><span> Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale </span><span>of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been </span><span>held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund </span><span>shares held for one year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except </span><span>that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term</span><span> capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to </span><span>such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from </span><span>capital gain dividends, are included in </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income</span><span>”</span><span> for purposes of the </span><span>3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned above.</span></div> <div><span>Creations and Redemptions.</span><span> Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the </span><span>Fund are </span><span>“</span><span>created</span><span>”</span><span> at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in </span><span>block-size Creation Units or multiples thereof. Each </span><span>“</span><span>creator</span><span>”</span><span> or authorized participant </span><span>(an </span><span>“</span><span>Authorized Participant</span><span>”</span><span>) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's </span><span>Distributor, an affiliate of BFA. An Authorized Participant is a member or participant of </span><span>a clearing agency registered with the SEC, which has a written agreement with the </span><span>Fund or one of its service providers that allows such member or participant to place </span><span>orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units.</span></div> <div><span>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the Distributor and the Fund, </span><span>generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a </span><span>designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>creation basket</span><span>”</span><span>), and </span><span>an amount of cash (including any cash representing the value of substituted securities, </span><span>assets or other positions), if any, which together approximate the holdings of the Fund </span><span>in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. Similarly, shares can be </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>27</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>redeemed only in Creation Units, generally for a designated portfolio of securities, </span><span>assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>redemption basket</span><span>”</span><span>) held by the Fund and an amount of </span><span>cash (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted). The </span><span>Fund may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units partially or solely for cash. </span><span>Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by the Fund. </span><span>Creation and redemption baskets may differ and the Fund may accept </span><span>“</span><span>custom </span><span>baskets.</span><span>”</span><span> More information regarding custom baskets is contained in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> <div><span>The prices at which creations and redemptions occur are based on the next calculation </span><span>of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under </span><span>the authorized participant agreement.</span></div> <div><span>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation Units with the Fund. </span><span>Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or </span><span>for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>In the event of a system failure or other interruption, including disruptions at market </span><span>makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either </span><span>may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at </span><span>all, or the Fund may not be able to place or change orders.</span></div> <div><span>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind transactions, the Fund intends to comply </span><span>with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying </span><span>redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any </span><span>securities accepted for deposit and any securities used to satisfy redemption requests </span><span>will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities </span><span>Act of 1933, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1933 Act</span><span>”</span><span>). Further, an Authorized Participant that is </span><span>not a </span><span>“</span><span>qualified institutional buyer,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the </span><span>1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule </span><span>144A.</span></div> <div><span>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is either a member of the </span><span>Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a </span><span>DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to </span><span>creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations. Information about the </span><span>procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off </span><span>times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> <div><span>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing basis, at any point </span><span>during the life of the Fund a </span><span>“</span><span>distribution,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may </span><span>be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on </span><span>their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed </span><span>participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters </span><span>subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any </span><span>determination of whether one is an underwriter must take into account all the relevant </span><span>facts and circumstances of each particular case.</span></div> <div><span>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not </span><span>“</span><span>underwriters</span><span>”</span><span> but are </span><span>participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>28</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>thus dealing with shares that are part of an </span><span>“</span><span>unsold allotment</span><span>”</span><span> within the meaning of </span><span>Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the 1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the </span><span>prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For </span><span>delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of </span><span>Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is available only with respect to transactions on a </span><span>national securities exchange.</span></div> <div><span>Householding.</span><span> Householding is an option available to certain Fund investors. </span><span>Householding is a method of delivery, based on the preference of the individual </span><span>investor, in which a single copy of certain shareholder documents can be delivered to </span><span>investors who share the same address, even if their accounts are registered under </span><span>different names. Please contact your broker-dealer if you are interested in enrolling in </span><span>householding and receiving a single copy of prospectuses and other shareholder </span><span>documents, or if you are currently enrolled in householding and wish to change your </span><span>householding status.</span></div> <div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>29</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Distribution</span></div> <div><span>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the Fund on an agency basis. </span><span>The Distributor does not maintain a secondary market in shares of the Fund. The </span><span>Distributor has no role in determining the policies of the Fund or the securities that are </span><span>purchased or sold by the Fund. The Distributor’s principal address is 50 Hudson Yards, </span><span>New York, NY 10001.</span></div> <div><span>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers, registered investment advisers, </span><span>banks or other intermediaries (together, </span><span>“</span><span>intermediaries</span><span>”</span><span>) related to marketing </span><span>activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the </span><span>development of technology platforms and reporting systems, data provision services, </span><span>or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their </span><span>customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may </span><span>be significant to the intermediary, are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments </span><span>are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or </span><span>indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type </span><span>are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may </span><span>make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or </span><span>the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other </span><span>financial incentives it is eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial </span><span>incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the </span><span>intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the </span><span>Fund or other iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding </span><span>these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. </span><span>Please contact your salesperson or </span><span>other investment professional for more information regarding any such </span><span>payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</span></div> <div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>30</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Financial Highlights</span></div> <div><span>The financial highlights table is intended to help investors understand the Fund’s </span><span>financial performance since inception.

Ask your </span><span>salesperson or visit your financial </span><span>intermediary’s website for more </span><span>information.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>S-10</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>More Information About the Fund</span></div> <div><span>This Prospectus contains important information about investing in the Fund. Please </span><span>read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional </span><span>information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</span></div> <div><span>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund are listed for trading on </span><span>Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (</span><span>“</span><span>Cboe BZX</span><span>”</span><span>). The market price for a share of the Fund may </span><span>be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</span></div> <div><span>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly traded securities. The Fund is designed to </span><span>track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund </span><span>represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other </span><span>instruments intended to track a market index. Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which </span><span>can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based </span><span>on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at </span><span>NAV solely by Authorized Participants and only in aggregations of a specified number of </span><span>shares (</span><span>“</span><span>Creation Units</span><span>”</span><span>). Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are </span><span>listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market </span><span>prices that change throughout the day.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund invests in a particular segment of the securities markets and seeks to track </span><span>the performance of a securities index that is not representative of the market as a </span><span>whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. </span><span>Accordingly, an investment in the Fund should not constitute a complete investment </span><span>program.</span></div> <div><span>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of financial instruments, and is </span><span>not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The </span><span>performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, </span><span>including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency valuations, asset valuations, corporate </span><span>actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of </span><span>representative sampling or from legal restrictions (such as diversification </span><span>requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to </span><span>time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments </span><span>to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise determined by BFA, any such change or </span><span>adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on </span><span>a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, </span><span>the Underlying Index performance shown for periods prior to the effective date of any </span><span>such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect </span><span>such change or adjustment. </span></div> <div><span>Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected </span><span>to have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. </span><span>“</span><span>Replication</span><span>”</span><span> is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all of the </span><span>securities in its underlying index in approximately the same proportions as in the </span><span>underlying index.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not insured or guaranteed by </span><span>the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or </span><span>any of its affiliates.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be changed without </span><span>shareholder approval.</span></div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Principal Risks</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The Fund is subject to various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of </span><span>which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability </span><span>to meet its investment objective. You could lose all or part of your investment in the </span><span>Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments. The order of the below risk </span><span>factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. The Fund </span><span>discloses its portfolio holdings daily at www.iShares.com.</span></div> <div><span>Asset Class Risk.</span><span> The securities</span><span> </span><span>and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that </span><span>track other countries, groups of countries, regions, industries, groups of industries, </span><span>markets, market segments, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities, </span><span>currencies and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and </span><span>underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets depending upon a </span><span>number of factors including, among other things, inflation, interest rates, productivity, </span><span>global demand for local products or resources, and regulation and governmental </span><span>controls. This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that </span><span>invest in different asset classes. Securities of companies that have positive or </span><span>favorable ESG characteristics may underperform other securities.</span></div> <div><span>Assets Under Management (AUM) Risk.</span><span> From time to time, an Authorized </span><span>Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s </span><span>adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a specific period </span><span>of time to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</span><span> </span><span>can be no assurance that any </span><span>such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund would be </span><span>maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk. </span><span>Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of </span><span>those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption </span><span>transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized </span><span>Participants on an agency basis (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, on behalf of other market participants). To the </span><span>extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with </span><span>creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized </span><span>Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, Fund shares </span><span>may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading </span><span>halts or delisting.</span></div> <div><span>Concentration Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, </span><span>including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's investments are concentrated in </span><span>the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of </span><span>countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, project types, group of project </span><span>types, sector, market segment or asset class. The Fund may be more adversely </span><span>affected by the underperformance of those securities and/or other assets, may </span><span>experience increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse </span><span>economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting those securities and/or</span><span> other assets than a fund that does not concentrate its investments.</span></div> <div><span>Cybersecurity Risk.</span><span> The Fund,</span><span> </span><span>Authorized Participants, service providers and the </span><span>relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information security and </span><span>related </span><span>“</span><span>cyber</span><span>”</span><span> risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of </span><span>cybersecurity risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, </span><span>which could result in material adverse consequences for such issuers and may cause </span><span>the Fund’s investment in such issuers to lose value. In general, cyber incidents can </span><span>result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are </span><span>not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, through </span><span>“</span><span>hacking</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive </span><span>information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyberattacks may also </span><span>be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as </span><span>causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, efforts to make network services </span><span>unavailable to intended users). Geopolitical tensions may increase the scale and </span><span>sophistication of deliberate attacks, particularly those from nation-states or from </span><span>entities with nation-state backing. </span></div> <div><span>Cybersecurity failures by, or breaches of, the systems of the Fund's adviser, distributor </span><span>and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index and benchmark </span><span>providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market </span><span>makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests </span><span>have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially </span><span>resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s ability to calculate its NAV, </span><span>disclosure of confidential trading information, impediments to trading, submission of </span><span>erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund </span><span>or its service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other </span><span>laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other </span><span>compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyberattacks may </span><span>render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, </span><span>and other data integral to the functioning of the Fund inaccessible, inaccurate or </span><span>incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund in order to resolve or </span><span>prevent cyber incidents. While the Fund has established business continuity plans in </span><span>the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber incidents, there are </span><span>inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain </span><span>risks have not been identified, that prevention and remediation efforts will not be </span><span>successful or that cyberattacks will go undetected. Furthermore, the Fund cannot </span><span>control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by service providers to the </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index Provider, market makers or </span><span>Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as </span><span>a result.</span></div> <div><span>Equity Securities Risk.</span><span> The Fund invests in equity securities, which are subject to </span><span>changes in value that may be attributable to market perception of a particular issuer or </span><span>to general stock market fluctuations that affect all issuers. Investments in equity </span><span>securities may be more volatile than investments in other asset classes. The </span><span>Underlying Index is composed of common stocks, which generally subject</span><span> </span><span>their holders </span><span>to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common </span><span>stockholders' claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt </span><span>securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</span></div> <div><span>ESG Risk. </span><span>To the extent that the Underlying Index uses criteria related to the ESG </span><span>characteristics of issuers, this may limit the types and number of investment </span><span>opportunities available to the Fund and, as a result, the Fund may underperform other </span><span>funds whose underlying index does not use ESG criteria. The Underlying Index’s use of </span><span>ESG criteria may result in the Fund investing in, or allocating greater weight to, </span><span>securities or market sectors that underperform the market as a whole or underperform </span><span>other funds that use ESG criteria. In addition, the use of representative sampling may </span><span>result in divergence of the Fund's overall ESG characteristics or ESG risk from those of </span><span>the Underlying Index.</span></div> <div><span>The Index Provider evaluates securities for inclusion and/or weighting in the </span><span>Underlying Index based on ESG criteria and data provided by the Index Provider or </span><span>third parties. The Index Provider’s evaluation of securities’ ESG characteristics depends </span><span>on these criteria and data, which may vary by index provider, and no assurance can be </span><span>given that they will be complete, accurate or current. In addition, the Index Provider </span><span>may evaluate security-level ESG data (including ratings) and, if applicable, ESG </span><span>objectives or constraints that are relevant to the Underlying Index only at index reviews </span><span>or rebalances. Securities included in the Underlying Index may cease to meet the </span><span>relevant ESG criteria but may nevertheless remain in the Underlying Index and the </span><span>Fund until the next review or rebalance by the Index Provider. As a result, certain </span><span>securities in the Underlying Index, or the Underlying Index as a whole, may not meet </span><span>the relevant ESG objectives or constraints at all times. If the ESG assessment of a </span><span>security in the Underlying Index or the Fund changes, neither the Fund nor BFA accepts </span><span>any liability in relation to such change. BFA does not monitor securities in the </span><span>Underlying Index with respect to ESG objectives or constraints applied by the Index </span><span>Provider and is not responsible for changes to the ESG assessment of a security in the </span><span>Underlying Index between rebalances. In addition, BFA does not assess the validity of </span><span>the Index Provider’s evaluation of the ESG characteristics of securities or the criteria </span><span>and data used in such evaluation.</span></div> <div><span>The impacts of risks related to ESG investing are likely to change over time, and new </span><span>ESG risks may be identified as further data and information regarding ESG factors and </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>impacts become available. In addition, methodologies for ESG investing continue to </span><span>develop, and the ESG methodology applied by the Index Provider may change over </span><span>time.</span></div> <div><span>Financials Sector Risk.</span><span> Companies in the financials sector are subject to extensive </span><span>governmental regulation and intervention, which may adversely affect the scope of </span><span>their activities, the prices they can charge, the amount of capital and liquid assets they </span><span>must maintain and, potentially, their size. Governmental regulation may change </span><span>frequently and may have significant adverse consequences for companies in the </span><span>financials sector, including effects not intended by such regulation. Increased risk </span><span>taking by financial companies may also result in greater overall risk in the U.S. and </span><span>global financials sector. The impact of changes in capital requirements, or recent or </span><span>future regulation in various countries, on any individual financial company or on the </span><span>financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. </span></div> <div><span>Certain risks may impact the value of investments in the financials sector more </span><span>severely than those of investments outside this sector, including the risks associated </span><span>with companies that operate with substantial financial leverage. Companies in the </span><span>financials sector are exposed directly to the credit risk of their borrowers and </span><span>counterparties, who may be leveraged to an unknown degree, including through swaps </span><span>and other derivatives products. Financial services companies may have significant </span><span>exposure to the same borrowers and counterparties, with the result that a borrower’s </span><span>or counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations to one company may affect other </span><span>companies with exposure to the same borrower or counterparty. This </span><span>interconnectedness of risk may result in significant negative impacts to companies </span><span>with direct exposure to the defaulting counterparty as well as adverse cascading </span><span>effects in the markets and the financials sector generally. Companies in the financials </span><span>sector may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and loan losses, </span><span>decreases in the availability of money or asset valuations, credit rating downgrades, </span><span>adverse public perception and adverse conditions in other related markets. Insurance </span><span>companies, in particular, may be subject to severe price competition and/or rate </span><span>regulation, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability. The financials </span><span>sector is particularly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates. The financials sector is </span><span>also a target for cyberattacks. Cybersecurity incidents and technology malfunctions </span><span>and failures have become increasingly frequent and have caused significant losses to </span><span>companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund. The extent to which </span><span>the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or </span><span>banking is limited by applicable law.</span></div> <div><span>Index-Related Risk.</span><span> The Fund seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to </span><span>the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as </span><span>published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any </span><span>agents that may act on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that </span><span>the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the </span><span>Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to </span><span>achieve, neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or </span><span>its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in line with </span><span>the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to </span><span>manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider </span><span>to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee against the Index Provider’s or </span><span>any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the </span><span>data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not </span><span>be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, </span><span>particularly where the indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or </span><span>managers. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its </span><span>shareholders. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains </span><span>incorrect constituents, the Fund would have market exposure to such constituents and </span><span>would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Shareholders </span><span>should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund </span><span>and its shareholders and any losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will </span><span>be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>Unusual market conditions or other unforeseen circumstances (such as natural </span><span>disasters, political unrest or war) may impact the Index Provider or a third-party data </span><span>provider, and could cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance to the </span><span>Underlying Index. This could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or </span><span>expected composition. The postponement of a scheduled rebalance could mean that </span><span>constituents of the Underlying Index that would otherwise be removed at rebalance </span><span>due to changes in market capitalizations, issuer credit ratings, or other reasons may </span><span>remain, causing the performance and constituents of the Underlying Index to vary from </span><span>those expected under normal conditions. Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index </span><span>Provider or its agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying </span><span>Index due to reaching certain weighting constraints, unusual market conditions or </span><span>corporate events or, for example, to correct an error in the selection of index </span><span>constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances </span><span>its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the </span><span>Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such </span><span>portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Therefore, </span><span>errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the Index Provider or its agents </span><span>to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Indexing Investment Risk.</span><span> The Fund is not actively managed and may be affected by </span><span>a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests </span><span>in securities included in, or representative of, the Underlying Index, regardless of their </span><span>investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in </span><span>defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</span></div> <div><span>Industrials Sector Risk.</span><span> The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials </span><span>sector may be adversely affected by supply and demand changes related to their </span><span>specific products or services and industrials sector products in general. The products </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>6</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological </span><span>developments and frequent new product introduction. Global events, trade disputes </span><span>and changes in government regulations, economic conditions and exchange rates may </span><span>adversely affect the performance of companies in the industrials sector. Companies in </span><span>the industrials sector may be adversely affected by liability for environmental damage </span><span>and product liability claims. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by </span><span>changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable </span><span>factors. Companies in the industrials sector, particularly aerospace and defense </span><span>companies, may also be adversely affected by government spending policies because </span><span>companies in this sector tend to rely to a significant extent on government demand for </span><span>their products and services.</span></div> <div><span>Infectious Illness Risk. </span><span>A widespread outbreak of an infectious illness, such as the </span><span>COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect the economies of many nations and the </span><span>global economy and may impact individual issuers and capital markets in ways that </span><span>cannot be foreseen.</span></div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in travel restrictions, closed international </span><span>borders, disruption of healthcare services, prolonged quarantines, cancellations, </span><span>supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, temporary and permanent closures </span><span>of businesses, layoffs, defaults and other significant economic, social and political </span><span>impacts, as well as general concern and uncertainty.</span></div> <div><span>An infectious illness outbreak may result in extreme volatility, severe losses, credit </span><span>deterioration of issuers, and disruptions in markets, which could adversely impact the </span><span>Fund and its investments, including impairing any hedging activity.</span></div> <div><span>Certain local markets may be subject to closures. Any suspension of trading in markets </span><span>in which the Fund invests will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and will </span><span>impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities in such markets.</span><span> </span><span>Market or </span><span>economic disruptions could result in elevated tracking error and increased premiums </span><span>or discounts to the Fund's NAV. Additionally, an outbreak could impair the operations </span><span>of the Fund’s service providers, including BFA, which could adversely impact the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Governmental and quasi-governmental authorities and regulators throughout the world </span><span>may respond to an outbreak and any resulting economic disruptions with a variety of </span><span>fiscal and monetary policy changes, including direct capital infusions into companies </span><span>and other issuers, new monetary policy tools, and changes in interest rates. A reversal </span><span>of these policies, or the ineffectiveness of such policies, is likely to increase market </span><span>volatility, which could adversely affect the Fund’s investments.</span></div> <div><span>An outbreak may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social and economic risks in </span><span>certain countries or globally, which could adversely affect the Fund and its investments </span><span>and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Despite the development of vaccines, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its </span><span>effects cannot be predicted with certainty.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>7</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Issuer Risk. </span><span>The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual </span><span>securities to which the Fund has exposure. Any issuer of these securities may perform </span><span>poorly, causing the value of its securities to decline. Poor performance may be caused </span><span>by poor management decisions, competitive pressures, changes in technology, </span><span>expiration of patent protection, disruptions in supply, labor problems or shortages, </span><span>corporate restructurings, fraudulent disclosures, credit deterioration of the issuer or </span><span>other factors. Issuers may, in times of distress or at their own discretion, decide to </span><span>reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock prices to decline. An </span><span>issuer may also be subject to risks associated with the countries, states and regions in </span><span>which the issuer resides, invests, sells products, or otherwise conducts operations.</span></div> <div><span>Management Risk. </span><span>Because BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, </span><span>the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities not </span><span>included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that BFA’s </span><span>investment strategy, the implementation of which is subject to a number of </span><span>constraints, may not produce the intended results.</span></div> <div><span>Market Risk.</span><span> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market </span><span>movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. The </span><span>value of a financial instrument or other asset may decline due to changes in general </span><span>market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the </span><span>particular instrument or asset, or factors that affect one or more issuers, </span><span>counterparties, exchanges, countries, regions, markets, industries, sectors or asset </span><span>classes, as applicable. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, </span><span>public health issues, recessions, the prospect or occurrence of a sovereign default or </span><span>other financial crisis, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund</span><span> </span><span>and </span><span>its investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. </span><span>Changes in market and economic conditions generally do not have the same impact on </span><span>all types of instruments and assets.</span></div> <div><span>Market Trading Risk.</span></div> <div><span>Absence of Active Market.</span><span> Although shares of the Fund are listed for trading on one or </span><span>more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for </span><span>such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized </span><span>Participants.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Secondary Listings. </span><span>The Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S.</span><span> stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary </span><span>listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made available to non-U.S. investors </span><span>through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There </span><span>can be no assurance that the Fund’s shares will continue to trade on any such stock </span><span>exchange or in any market or that the Fund’s shares will continue to meet the </span><span>requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's shares </span><span>may be less actively traded in certain markets than in others, and investors are subject </span><span>to the execution and settlement risks and market standards of the market where they </span><span>or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to </span><span>investors who trade Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>hours may not be available to investors who trade in other markets, which may result </span><span>in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</span></div> <div><span>Secondary Market Trading Risk.</span><span> Shares of the Fund may trade in the secondary market </span><span>at times when the Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such </span><span>times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more significant premiums or </span><span>discounts than might be experienced at times when the Fund accepts purchase and </span><span>redemption orders.</span></div> <div><span>Secondary market trading in Fund shares may be halted by a stock exchange because </span><span>of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund shares on a </span><span>stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by </span><span>extraordinary market volatility pursuant to </span><span>“</span><span>circuit breaker</span><span>”</span><span> rules on the stock </span><span>exchange or market.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed on a stock exchange, may </span><span>be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price </span><span>decreases associated with being sold short. In addition, trading activity in derivative </span><span>products based on the Fund may lead to increased trading volume and volatility in the </span><span>secondary market for the shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV.</span><span> Shares of the Fund trade on </span><span>stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of </span><span>the Fund is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in </span><span>the market value of the Fund’s holdings. The trading price of the Fund's shares </span><span>fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours</span><span> </span><span>based on both market supply of and </span><span>demand for Fund shares and the underlying value of the Fund's portfolio holdings or </span><span>NAV. As a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s shares may deviate significantly from </span><span>NAV during periods of market volatility. </span><span>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, </span><span>MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO </span><span>NAV</span><span>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in Creation Units at </span><span>NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund are not </span><span>likely to be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, </span><span>which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and sometimes at premiums to, </span><span>their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely </span><span>that the Fund’s shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the </span><span>Fund’s next calculated NAV, exchange prices are not expected to correlate exactly with </span><span>the Fund's NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other </span><span>factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at </span><span>market makers, Authorized Participants, or other market participants, and during </span><span>periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the </span><span>Fund that differ significantly from its NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing to </span><span>create or redeem Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for such shares or </span><span>its underlying investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s shares trading at a </span><span>premium or discount to NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.</span><span> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange </span><span>involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>9</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage </span><span>commission and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread</span><span>”</span><span>; </span><span>that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>bid</span><span>”</span><span> price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund shares (the </span><span>“</span><span>ask</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>price).</span><span> </span><span>The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume </span><span>and market liquidity and wider if the Fund has less trading volume and market liquidity. </span><span>In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be </span><span>regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because </span><span>of the costs inherent in buying or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract </span><span>significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be </span><span>advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a </span><span>brokerage account.</span></div> <div><span>Operational Risk.</span><span> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of </span><span>factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication </span><span>errors, errors of the Fund's service providers, counterparties or other third parties, </span><span>failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA </span><span>seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, </span><span>these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address </span><span>significant operational risks.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the U.S.</span><span> A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade </span><span>regulations, inflation and/or an economic recession in the U.S. may have a material </span><span>adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed on U.S. exchanges. </span><span>Proposed and adopted policy and legislative changes in the U.S. are changing many </span><span>aspects of financial, commercial, public health, environmental, and other regulation </span><span>and may have a significant effect on U.S. markets generally, as well as on the value of </span><span>certain securities. Governmental agencies project that the U.S. will continue to </span><span>maintain elevated public debt levels for the foreseeable future. Although elevated debt </span><span>levels do not necessarily indicate or cause economic problems, elevated public debt </span><span>service costs may constrain future economic growth. Circumstances could arise that </span><span>could prevent the timely payment of interest or principal on U.S. government debt, </span><span>such as reaching the legislative </span><span>“</span><span>debt ceiling.</span><span>”</span><span> Such non-payment would result in </span><span>substantial negative consequences for the U.S. economy and the global financial </span><span>system.</span></div> <div><span>If U.S. relations with certain countries deteriorate, it could adversely affect U.S. issuers </span><span>as well as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also </span><span>experienced increased internal unrest and discord. If these trends were to continue, it </span><span>may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the issuers in which the Fund </span><span>invests.</span></div> <div><span>Securities Lending Risk.</span><span> The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities </span><span>lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the </span><span>loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund </span><span>could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash </span><span>collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund. </span><span>BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>BTC</span><span>”</span><span>), the</span><span> </span><span>Fund's securities lending </span><span>agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments for </span><span>dividends when managing the</span><span> </span><span>Fund's securities lending program.</span></div> <div><span>Small-Capitalization Companies Risk. </span><span>Stock prices of small-capitalization </span><span>companies may be more volatile than those of larger companies and, therefore, the </span><span>Fund's share price may be more volatile than those of funds that invest a larger </span><span>percentage of their assets in stocks issued by mid- or large-capitalization companies. </span><span>Stock prices of small-capitalization companies are generally more vulnerable than </span><span>those of mid- or large-capitalization companies to adverse business and economic </span><span>developments. Securities of small-capitalization companies may be thinly traded, </span><span>making it difficult for the Fund to buy and sell them. In addition, small-capitalization </span><span>companies are typically less financially stable than larger, more established companies </span><span>and may depend on a small number of essential personnel, making these companies </span><span>more vulnerable to experiencing adverse effects due to the loss of personnel. Small-capitalization</span><span> companies also normally have less diverse product lines than those of </span><span>mid- or large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse </span><span>developments concerning their products.</span></div> <div><span>Small Fund Risk. </span><span>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading </span><span>volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being </span><span>delisted if the Fund does not meet certain conditions of the listing exchange. If the </span><span>Fund were to be required to delist from the listing exchange, the value of the Fund may </span><span>rapidly decline and performance may be negatively impacted. Any resulting liquidation </span><span>of the Fund could cause the Fund to incur elevated transaction costs for the Fund and </span><span>negative tax consequences for its shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>Tracking Error Risk.</span><span> The Fund may be subject to </span><span>“</span><span>tracking error,</span><span>”</span><span> which is the </span><span>divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error </span><span>may occur because of differences between the securities and other instruments held in </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences, </span><span>transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, </span><span>differences in timing of the accrual or the valuation of dividends or interest received by </span><span>the Fund or distributions paid to the Fund’s shareholders, the requirements to maintain </span><span>pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the </span><span>distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, changes </span><span>to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or </span><span>existing regulatory requirements, among other reasons. This risk may be heightened </span><span>during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. </span><span>Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the </span><span>Underlying Index does not. </span><span>BFA EXPECTS THAT THE FUND MAY EXPERIENCE </span><span>HIGHER TRACKING ERROR THAN IS TYPICAL FOR SIMILAR INDEX ETFs, </span><span>ESPECIALLY BEFORE THE FUND REACHES SUFFICIENT SCALE AND FURTHER </span><span>BROADENS ITS HOLDINGS.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</span></div> <div><span>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated with its investments </span><span>and investment strategies. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the </span><span>significance of any particular risk factor.</span></div> <div><span>Close-Out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.</span><span> Regulations adopted by global </span><span>prudential regulators require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global </span><span>systemically important banking organizations to include contractual restrictions on </span><span>close-out and cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. </span><span>Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards </span><span>and other derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending </span><span>agreements. The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial </span><span>contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution </span><span>proceedings and also prohibit the Fund from exercising default rights due to a </span><span>receivership or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. These </span><span>requirements may increase credit risk and other risks to the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Consumer Discretionary Sector Risk.</span><span> The success of consumer product </span><span>manufacturers and retailers is tied closely to the performance of domestic and </span><span>international economies, interest rates, exchange rates, supply chains, competition, </span><span>consumer confidence, changes in demographics and consumer preferences. </span><span>Companies in the consumer discretionary sector depend heavily on disposable </span><span>household income and consumer spending, and may be strongly affected by social </span><span>trends and marketing campaigns. These companies may be subject to severe </span><span>competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</span></div> <div><span>Consumer Staples Sector Risk.</span><span> Companies in the consumer staples sector may be </span><span>affected by the regulation of various product components and production methods, </span><span>marketing campaigns and changes in the global economy, consumer spending and </span><span>consumer demand. Tobacco and tobacco-related companies, in particular, may be </span><span>adversely affected by new laws, regulations and litigation. Companies in the consumer </span><span>staples sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity </span><span>prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. These companies may be </span><span>subject to severe competition, which may have an adverse impact on their profitability.</span></div> <div><span>Dividend-Paying Stock Risk.</span><span> Investing in dividend-paying stocks involves the risk </span><span>that such stocks may fall out of favor with investors and underperform the broader </span><span>market. Companies that issue dividend-paying stocks are not required to pay or </span><span>continue paying dividends on such stocks. It is possible that issuers of the stocks held </span><span>by the Fund will not declare dividends in the future or will reduce or eliminate the </span><span>payment of dividends (including reducing or eliminating anticipated accelerations or </span><span>increases in the payment of dividends) in the future.</span></div> <div><span>Healthcare Sector Risk.</span><span> The profitability of companies in the healthcare sector may </span><span>be adversely affected by the following factors, among others: extensive government </span><span>regulations, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising </span><span>costs of medical products and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>12</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>outpatient services, changes in the demand for medical products and services, a </span><span>limited number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other </span><span>market developments. Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent on patent </span><span>protection. The expiration of a company’s patents may adversely affect that company’s </span><span>profitability. Many healthcare companies are subject to extensive litigation based on </span><span>product liability and similar claims. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive </span><span>forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may result in price </span><span>discounting. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 allows for the negotiation of </span><span>prescription drug prices on behalf of Medicare recipients, which may result in reduced </span><span>prescription prices. This could reduce some healthcare companies’ overall profitability. </span><span>Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. </span><span>The process of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, and such efforts </span><span>ultimately may be unsuccessful. Companies in the healthcare sector may be thinly </span><span>capitalized and may be susceptible to product obsolescence. In addition, a number of </span><span>legislative proposals concerning healthcare have been considered by the U.S. </span><span>Congress in recent years. It is unclear what proposals will ultimately be enacted, if any, </span><span>and what effect they may have on companies in the healthcare sector.</span></div> <div><span>Illiquid Investments Risk. </span><span>The Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, </span><span>immediately after the acquisition, the Fund would have invested more than 15% of its </span><span>net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the </span><span>Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in </span><span>seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the </span><span>investment. Liquid investments may become illiquid after purchase by the Fund, </span><span>particularly during periods of market turmoil. There can be no assurance that a security </span><span>or instrument that is deemed to be liquid when purchased will continue to be liquid for </span><span>as long as it is held by the Fund, and any security or instrument held by the Fund may </span><span>be deemed an illiquid investment pursuant to the Fund’s liquidity risk management </span><span>program. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid investments may </span><span>reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be unable to transact at </span><span>advantageous times or prices. An investment may be illiquid due to, among other </span><span>things, the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a </span><span>market in securities or instruments</span><span> </span><span>or the lack of an active market for such securities </span><span>or instruments. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or instruments with </span><span>substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have increased exposure to </span><span>the risks associated with illiquid investments. Illiquid investments may be harder to </span><span>value, especially in changing markets. Although the Fund primarily seeks to redeem </span><span>shares of the Fund on an in-kind basis, if the Fund is forced to sell underlying </span><span>investments at reduced prices or under unfavorable conditions to meet redemption </span><span>requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss. This may be magnified in </span><span>a rising interest rate environment or other circumstances where redemptions from the </span><span>Fund may be greater than normal. Other market participants may be attempting to </span><span>liquidate holdings at the same time as the Fund, causing increased supply of the Fund’s </span><span>underlying investments in the market and contributing to illiquid investments risk and </span><span>downward pricing pressure. In addition, if the Fund is limited in its ability to sell illiquid </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>13</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>investments during periods when shareholders are redeeming their shares, the Fund </span><span>will need to sell liquid securities to meet redemption requests and illiquid securities will </span><span>become a larger portion of the Fund’s holdings. During periods of market volatility, </span><span>liquidity in the market for the Fund’s shares may be impacted by the liquidity in the </span><span>market for the underlying securities or instruments held by the Fund, which could lead </span><span>to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to the Fund's NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Information Technology Sector Risk.</span><span> Information technology companies face </span><span>intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse </span><span>effect on their profit margins. Like other technology companies, information </span><span>technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or </span><span>personnel. The products of information technology companies may face obsolescence </span><span>due to rapid technological developments, frequent new product introduction, </span><span>unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified </span><span>personnel. Companies in the information technology sector are heavily dependent on </span><span>patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may </span><span>adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Companies in the information </span><span>technology sector are facing increased government and regulatory scrutiny and may be </span><span>subject to adverse government or regulatory action. Companies in the application </span><span>software industry, in particular, may also be negatively affected by the decline or </span><span>fluctuation of subscription renewal rates for their products and services, which may </span><span>have an adverse effect on profit margins. Companies in the systems software industry </span><span>may be adversely affected by, among other things, actual or perceived security </span><span>vulnerabilities in their products and services, which may result in individual or class </span><span>action lawsuits, state or federal enforcement actions and other remediation costs.</span></div> <div><span>Large Shareholder and Large-Scale Redemption Risk.</span><span> Certain shareholders, </span><span>including an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an </span><span>affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, a market maker, or another entity, may from time to time </span><span>own or manage a substantial amount of Fund shares or may invest in the Fund and </span><span>hold their investment for a limited period of time. These shareholders may also pledge </span><span>or loan Fund shares (to secure financing or otherwise), which may result in the shares </span><span>becoming concentrated in another party. There can be no assurance that any large </span><span>shareholder or large group of shareholders would not redeem their investment or that </span><span>the size of the Fund would be maintained. Redemptions of a large number of Fund </span><span>shares by these shareholders may adversely affect the Fund’s liquidity and net assets. </span><span>To the extent the Fund permits redemptions in cash, these redemptions may force the </span><span>Fund to sell portfolio securities when it might not otherwise do so, which may </span><span>negatively impact the Fund’s NAV, have a material effect on the market price of the </span><span>Shares and increase the Fund’s brokerage costs and/or accelerate the realization of </span><span>taxable income and/or gains and cause the Fund to make taxable distributions to its </span><span>shareholders earlier than the Fund otherwise would have. In addition, under certain </span><span>circumstances, non-redeeming shareholders may be treated as receiving a </span><span>disproportionately large taxable distribution during or with respect to such tax year. </span><span>The Fund also may be required to sell its more liquid Fund investments to meet a large </span><span>redemption, in which case the Fund’s remaining assets may be less liquid, more </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>volatile, and more difficult to price. To the extent these large shareholders transact in </span><span>shares on the secondary market, such transactions may account for a large </span><span>percentage of the trading volume for the shares of the Fund and may, therefore, have a </span><span>material upward or downward effect on the market price of the Fund shares. In </span><span>addition, large purchases of Fund shares may adversely affect the Fund’s performance </span><span>to the extent that the Fund is delayed in investing new cash and is required to maintain </span><span>a larger cash position than it ordinarily would, diluting its investment returns.</span></div> <div><span>Materials Sector Risk.</span><span> Companies in the materials sector may be adversely affected </span><span>by commodity price volatility, exchange rate fluctuations, social and political unrest, </span><span>war, import or export controls, increased competition, depletion of resources, </span><span>technical advances, labor relations, over-production, decreases in the demand for </span><span>materials, litigation and government regulations, among other factors. Companies in </span><span>the materials sector are also at risk of liability for environmental damage and product </span><span>liability claims and may incur significant environmental remediation costs in complying </span><span>with environmental laws. Production of materials may exceed demand as a result of </span><span>market imbalances or economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns.</span></div> <div><span>Real Estate Investment Risk.</span><span> Companies that invest in real estate (</span><span>“</span><span>Real Estate </span><span>Companies</span><span>”</span><span>), such as real estate investment trusts (</span><span>“</span><span>REITs</span><span>”</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>real estate holding and </span><span>operating companies, and real estate management or development companies, expose </span><span>investors to the risks of owning real estate directly, as well as to risks that relate </span><span>specifically to the way in which Real Estate Companies are organized and operated. </span><span>Real estate is highly sensitive to general and local economic conditions and </span><span>developments and is characterized by intense competition and periodic overbuilding. </span><span>Many Real Estate Companies, including REITs,</span><span> </span><span>utilize leverage (and some may be highly </span><span>leveraged), which increases investment risk and the risk normally associated with debt </span><span>financing, and could potentially increase the Fund’s losses. Rising interest rates could </span><span>result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could negatively </span><span>affect a Real Estate Company's ability to meet its payment obligations or its financing </span><span>activity and could decrease the market prices for REITs and for properties held by such </span><span>REITs. In addition, to the extent a Real Estate Company has its own expenses, the Fund </span><span>(and indirectly, its shareholders) will bear its proportionate share of such expenses.</span></div> <div><span>Concentration Risk</span><span>. Real Estate Companies may own a limited number of properties </span><span>and concentrate their investments in a particular geographic region, industry or </span><span>property type. Economic downturns affecting a particular region, industry or property </span><span>type may lead to a high volume of defaults within a short period.</span></div> <div><span>Equity REITs Risk. </span><span>Certain REITs may make direct investments in real estate. These </span><span>REITs are often referred to as </span><span>“</span><span>Equity REITs.</span><span>”</span><span> Equity REITs invest primarily in real </span><span>properties and may earn rental income from leasing those properties. Equity REITs may </span><span>also realize gains or losses from the sale of properties. Equity REITs will be affected by </span><span>conditions in the real estate rental market and by changes in the value of the </span><span>properties they own. A decline in rental income may occur because of extended </span><span>vacancies, limitations on rents, the failure to collect rents, increased competition from </span><span>other properties or poor management. Equity REITs also can be affected by rising </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>15</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>interest rates. Rising interest rates may cause investors to demand a high annual yield </span><span>from future distributions that, in turn, could decrease the market prices for such REITs </span><span>and for the properties held by such REITs. In addition, rising interest rates also increase </span><span>the costs of obtaining financing for real estate projects. Because many real estate </span><span>projects are dependent upon receiving financing, this could cause the value of the </span><span>Equity REITs in which the Fund invests to decline.</span></div> <div><span>Illiquidity Risk</span><span>. Investing in Real Estate Companies may involve risks similar to those </span><span>associated with investing in small-capitalization companies. Real Estate Company </span><span>securities may be volatile. There may be less trading in Real Estate Company shares, </span><span>which means that purchase and sale transactions in those shares could have a </span><span>magnified impact on share price, resulting in abrupt or erratic price fluctuations. In </span><span>addition, real estate is relatively illiquid and, therefore, a Real Estate Company may </span><span>have a limited ability to vary or liquidate its investments in properties in response to </span><span>changes in economic or other conditions.</span></div> <div><span>Interest Rate Risk</span><span>. Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real </span><span>Estate Companies, which could negatively affect a Real Estate Company’s ability to </span><span>meet its payment obligations. Declining interest rates could result in increased </span><span>prepayment on loans and require redeployment of capital in less desirable </span><span>investments.</span></div> <div><span>Leverage Risk</span><span>. Real Estate Companies may use leverage (and some may be highly </span><span>leveraged), which increases investment risk and the risks normally associated with </span><span>debt financing and could adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s operations and </span><span>market value in periods of rising interest rates. Financial covenants related to a Real </span><span>Estate Company’s leveraging may affect the ability of the Real Estate Company to </span><span>operate effectively. In addition, investments may be subject to defaults by borrowers </span><span>and tenants. Leveraging may also increase repayment risk.</span></div> <div><span>Loan Foreclosure Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may foreclose on loans that the Real </span><span>Estate Company originated and/or acquired. Foreclosure may generate negative </span><span>publicity for the underlying property that affects its market value. In addition to the </span><span>length and expense of such proceedings, the validity of the terms of the applicable </span><span>loan may not be recognized in foreclosure proceedings.</span></div> <div><span>Operational Risk</span><span>. Real Estate Companies are dependent upon management skills and </span><span>may have limited financial resources. Real Estate Companies are generally not </span><span>diversified and may be subject to heavy cash flow dependency, default by borrowers </span><span>and self-liquidation. In addition, transactions between Real Estate Companies and their </span><span>affiliates may be subject to conflicts of interest, which may adversely affect a Real </span><span>Estate Company’s shareholders. A Real Estate Company may also have joint ventures </span><span>in certain of its properties and, consequently, its ability to control decisions relating to </span><span>such properties may be limited.</span></div> <div><span>Property Risk</span><span>. Real Estate Companies may be subject to risks relating to functional </span><span>obsolescence or reduced desirability of properties; extended vacancies due to </span><span>economic conditions and tenant bankruptcies; property damage due to events such as </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>16</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, rodent, insect or disease infestations and terrorist </span><span>acts; eminent domain seizures; and casualty or condemnation losses. Real estate </span><span>income and values also may be greatly affected by demographic trends, such as </span><span>population shifts, changes in consumer preferences and values, increasing vacancies </span><span>or declining rents resulting from legal, cultural, technological, global or local economic </span><span>developments and changes in tax law.</span></div> <div><span>Regulatory Risk</span><span>. Real estate income and values may be adversely affected by </span><span>applicable domestic and foreign laws (including tax laws). Government actions, such as </span><span>tax increases, zoning law changes, mandated closures or other commercial </span><span>restrictions, reduced funding for schools, parks, garbage collection and other public </span><span>services or environmental regulations also may have a major impact on real estate </span><span>income and values.</span></div> <div><span>Repayment Risk.</span><span> The prices of Real Estate Company securities may drop because of </span><span>the failure of borrowers to repay their loans, poor management, or the inability to </span><span>obtain financing either on favorable terms or at all. If the properties in which Real </span><span>Estate Companies invest do not generate sufficient income to meet operating </span><span>expenses, including, where applicable, debt service, ground lease payments, tenant </span><span>improvements, third-party leasing commissions and other capital expenditures, the </span><span>income and ability of the Real Estate Companies to make payments of interest and </span><span>principal on their loans will be adversely affected.</span></div> <div><span>U.S. Tax Risk. </span><span>Certain U.S. Real Estate Companies are subject to special U.S. federal </span><span>tax requirements. A REIT that fails to comply with such tax requirements may be </span><span>subject to U.S. federal income taxation, which may affect the value of the REIT and the </span><span>characterization of the REIT’s distributions. The U.S. federal tax requirement that a </span><span>REIT distributes substantially all of its net income to its shareholders may result in the </span><span>REIT having insufficient capital for future expenditures. A REIT that successfully </span><span>maintains its qualification may still become subject to U.S. federal, state and local </span><span>taxes, including excise, penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage recording, and transfer </span><span>taxes, both directly and indirectly through its subsidiaries.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Swap Agreements.</span><span>The Fund currently invests in total return swaps referred </span><span>to as </span><span>“</span><span>contracts for difference</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>CFDs.</span><span>”</span><span> A swap is a two-party contract that generally </span><span>obligates each counterparty to exchange periodic payments based on a pre-determined</span><span> underlying investment or notional amount and to exchange collateral to </span><span>secure the obligations of each counterparty.</span><span> </span><span>Swaps may be leveraged and are subject </span><span>to counterparty risk (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, the risk of a counterparty defaulting on the obligation or </span><span>bankruptcy), credit risk and pricing risk (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, swaps may be difficult to value). Swaps </span><span>may be subject to illiquidity risk, and it may not be possible for the Fund to liquidate a </span><span>swap position at an advantageous time or price, which may result in significant losses. </span><span>All swaps require posting of collateral, which may restrict the ability of the Fund to </span><span>invest the assets in different ways and which involve costs to the Fund. Swaps provide </span><span>customized contractual terms, which may not, in all cases, provide the hedging or </span><span>other intended benefits.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>17</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.</span><span> If certain aggregate and/or fund-level ownership </span><span>thresholds are reached through transactions undertaken by BFA, its affiliates or the </span><span>Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions or actions by an issuer or regulator, the </span><span>ability of BFA and its affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to purchase or </span><span>dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be </span><span>restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make </span><span>investments in certain securities may be affected by the relevant threshold limits, and </span><span>such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the </span><span>Fund’s portfolio holdings</span><span> </span><span>compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This </span><span>may increase the risk of the Fund being underinvested to the Underlying Index and </span><span>increase the risk of tracking error.</span></div> <div><span>For example, in certain circumstances where the Fund invests in securities issued by </span><span>companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or </span><span>international markets, is subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or </span><span>invests in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits on the </span><span>aggregate and/or fund-level amount invested or voted by BFA and its affiliates for their </span><span>proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Fund) that may not be </span><span>exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if </span><span>exceeded, may cause BFA and its affiliates, the Fund or other client accounts to suffer </span><span>disadvantages or business restrictions.</span></div> <div><span>Portfolio Holdings Information</span></div> <div><span>A description of the Trust's policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of </span><span>the Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Fund's Statement of Additional </span><span>Information (</span><span>“</span><span>SAI</span><span>”</span><span>).

In managing </span><span>the Fund, BFA may draw upon the research and expertise of its asset management </span><span>affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's </span><span>investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists </span><span>and other investment specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines </span><span>and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</span></div> <div><span>Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and the Trust (entered </span><span>into on behalf of the Fund), BFA is responsible for substantially all expenses of the </span><span>Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with </span><span>respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of </span><span>portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>18</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>and litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of </span><span>the Trustees who are not </span><span>“</span><span>interested persons</span><span>”</span><span> of the Trust).

BFA and its Affiliates provide investment </span><span>management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that may </span><span>follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA and its Affiliates are </span><span>involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management </span><span>activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in which their </span><span>interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or </span><span>one or more Affiliates act, or may act, as an investor, research provider, investment </span><span>manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, financier, underwriter, </span><span>adviser, trader, lender,</span><span> </span><span>index provider, agent and/or principal, and have other direct </span><span>and indirect interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other </span><span>instruments in which the Fund may directly or indirectly invest. The Fund may invest in </span><span>securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate </span><span>has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The Fund may also invest </span><span>in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which an Affiliate provides and is </span><span>compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of </span><span>such issuances. The Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in other </span><span>transactions with, companies for which an Affiliate provides or may in the future </span><span>provide research coverage. An Affiliate may have business relationships with, and </span><span>purchase or distribute or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants </span><span>or others who recommend the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, </span><span>and may receive compensation for such services. BFA or one or more Affiliates may </span><span>engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment </span><span>objectives similar to those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for </span><span>transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the </span><span>Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end</span><span> investment companies (which may include investment companies that are </span><span>affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment </span><span>Company Act of 1940, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1940 Act</span><span>”</span><span>)). The trading activities of BFA and </span><span>these Affiliates are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly </span><span>by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate having positions in certain securities </span><span>that are senior or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse to, the securities </span><span>that are owned by the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>20</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to share any investment </span><span>opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with </span><span>the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's </span><span>investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an Affiliate and of other </span><span>accounts managed by BlackRock or an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Fund could </span><span>sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts </span><span>achieve profits on their trading for proprietary or other accounts. The opposite result is </span><span>also possible.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, the Fund may, from time to time, enter into transactions in which BFA or an </span><span>Affiliate or</span><span> </span><span>its or their directors, officers, employees or clients have an adverse interest. </span><span>Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or managed by BFA or its </span><span>Affiliates may adversely impact the Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or</span><span> </span><span>by </span><span>BFA or its Affiliates or their directors, officers or employees may have the effect of </span><span>diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the </span><span>Fund.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund's activities may be limited because of regulatory restrictions applicable to </span><span>BFA or one or more Affiliates and/or their internal policies designed to comply with </span><span>such restrictions.</span></div> <div><span>Under a securities lending program approved by the Board, the Fund has retained BTC, </span><span>an Affiliate of BFA, to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent </span><span>that the Fund participates in the securities lending program. For these services, the </span><span>securities lending agent will receive a fee from the Fund, including a fee based on the </span><span>returns earned on the Fund’s investment of the cash received as collateral for the </span><span>loaned securities. In addition, one or more Affiliates may be among the entities to </span><span>which the Fund may lend its portfolio securities under the securities lending program.</span></div> <div><span>Under an ETF Services Agreement, the Fund has retained BlackRock Investments, LLC </span><span>(the </span><span>“</span><span>Distributor</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>BRIL</span><span>”</span><span>), an Affiliate of BFA, to perform certain order processing, </span><span>Authorized Participant communications, and related services in connection with the </span><span>issuance and redemption of Creation Units of the Fund (</span><span>“</span><span>ETF Services</span><span>”</span><span>). BRIL will </span><span>retain a portion of the standard transaction fee received from Authorized Participants </span><span>on each creation or redemption order from the Authorized Participant for the ETF </span><span>Services provided. BlackRock collaborated with, and received payment from, Citibank, </span><span>N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>Citibank</span><span>”</span><span>) on the design and development of the ETF Services platform. Citibank </span><span>may have, or from time to time may develop, additional relationships with BlackRock or </span><span>funds managed by BFA and its affiliates.</span></div> <div><span>It is also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients </span><span>(including other funds and separately managed accounts) may, subject to compliance </span><span>with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of the Fund. The price, availability, </span><span>liquidity, and (in some cases) expense ratio of the Fund may be impacted by purchases </span><span>and sales of the Fund by BlackRock and/or its advisory clients.</span></div> <div><span>The activities of BFA and its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers or </span><span>employees may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>21</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>and its shareholders.

Only an Authorized Participant may </span><span>engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. Once created, </span><span>shares of the Fund generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a </span><span>Creation Unit.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange for trading during the </span><span>trading day. Shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like shares of </span><span>other publicly traded companies. The Trust does not impose any minimum investment </span><span>for shares of the Fund purchased on an exchange or otherwise in the secondary </span><span>market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol </span><span>“</span><span>XJR.</span><span>”</span></div> <div><span>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary market involves two </span><span>types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling </span><span>shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other </span><span>charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may be a significant </span><span>proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In </span><span>addition, you may incur the cost of the </span><span>“</span><span>spread,</span><span>”</span><span> that is, any difference between the </span><span>bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over time for shares of the Fund based </span><span>on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund </span><span>has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading </span><span>volume and market liquidity (which is often the case for funds that are newly launched </span><span>or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity or illiquidity </span><span>of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller </span><span>funds or in instances of significant volatility of the underlying securities.</span></div> <div><span>The Fund does not impose restrictions on the frequency of purchases and redemptions </span><span>of Fund shares directly with the Fund. The Board determined not to adopt policies and </span><span>procedures designed to prevent or monitor for frequent purchases and redemptions of </span><span>Fund shares because the Fund generally sells and redeems its shares directly through </span><span>transactions that are in-kind and/or for cash, with a deadline for placing cash-related </span><span>transactions no later than the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio </span><span>securities. However, the Fund has taken certain measures (</span><span>e.g</span><span>., imposing transaction </span><span>fees on purchases and redemptions of Creation Units and reserving the right to reject </span><span>purchases of Creation Units under certain circumstances) to minimize the potential </span><span>consequences of frequent cash purchases and redemptions by Authorized Participants, </span><span>such as increased tracking error, disruption of portfolio management, dilution to the </span><span>Fund, and/or increased transaction costs. Further, the vast majority of trading in Fund </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>22</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>shares occurs on the secondary market, which does not involve the Fund directly, and </span><span>such trading is unlikely to cause many of the harmful effects of frequent cash </span><span>purchases or redemptions of Fund shares.</span></div> <div><span>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed is open for </span><span>trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays </span><span>(or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, </span><span>Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor </span><span>Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s primary listing exchange is Cboe </span><span>BZX.</span></div> <div><span>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act generally restricts investments by investment </span><span>companies, including foreign and unregistered investment companies, in the securities </span><span>of other investment companies. For example, a registered investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquired Fund</span><span>”</span><span>), such as the Fund, may not knowingly sell or otherwise dispose of any </span><span>security issued by the Acquired Fund to any investment company (the </span><span>“</span><span>Acquiring </span><span>Fund</span><span>”</span><span>) or any company or companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund if, immediately </span><span>after such sale or disposition: (i) more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of </span><span>the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and any company or companies </span><span>controlled by the Acquiring Fund, or (ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding voting </span><span>stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and other investment </span><span>companies and companies controlled by them. However, registered investment </span><span>companies are permitted to invest in the Fund beyond the limits set forth in Section </span><span>12(d)(1), subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in SEC rules. In order for a </span><span>registered investment company to invest in shares of the Fund beyond the limitations </span><span>of Section 12(d)(1) in reliance on Rule 12d1-4 under the 1940 Act, the registered </span><span>investment company must, among other things, enter into an agreement with the </span><span>Trust. Foreign investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund only up to the </span><span>limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to any applicable SEC no-action relief.</span></div> <div><span>Book Entry.</span><span> Shares of the Fund are held in book-entry form, which means that no </span><span>stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (</span><span>“</span><span>DTC</span><span>”</span><span>) or its nominee is </span><span>the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as shown on the records of </span><span>DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. </span><span>DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, </span><span>clearing corporations and other institutions that directly or indirectly maintain a </span><span>custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to </span><span>receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your </span><span>name, and you are not considered a registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise </span><span>any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its </span><span>participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other </span><span>securities that you hold in book-entry or </span><span>“</span><span>street name</span><span>”</span><span> form.</span></div> <div><span>Share Prices.</span><span> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market </span><span>generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>23</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>the supply of and demand for ETF shares and shares of underlying securities held by </span><span>the Fund, economic conditions and other factors.</span></div> <div><span>Determination of Net Asset Value. </span><span>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined </span><span>once daily Monday through Friday, generally as of the close of regular trading hours of </span><span>the New York Stock Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>NYSE</span><span>”</span><span>) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day </span><span>that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that </span><span>any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are </span><span>translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as </span><span>quoted by one or more data service providers. The NAV of the Fund is calculated by </span><span>dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the value of its total assets less </span><span>total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally </span><span>rounded to the nearest cent.</span></div> <div><span>The value of the securities and other assets and liabilities held by the Fund is </span><span>determined pursuant to BFA’s valuation policies and procedures. BFA has been </span><span>designated by the Board as the valuation designee for the Fund pursuant to Rule 2a-5 </span><span>under the 1940 Act.</span></div> <div><span>Equity securities and other equity instruments for which market quotations are readily </span><span>available are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the last </span><span>reported official closing price or, if a reported closing price is not available, the last </span><span>traded price on the exchange or market on which the security or instrument is </span><span>primarily traded at the time of valuation. Shares of underlying open-end funds </span><span>(including money market funds) are valued at net asset value. Shares of underlying </span><span>exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs are valued at their most recent </span><span>closing price.</span></div> <div><span>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities and money market instruments is substantially </span><span>completed each day at various times prior to the close of regular trading hours of the </span><span>NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are </span><span>determined as of such times.</span></div> <div><span>When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be </span><span>unreliable, BFA will fair value the Fund’s investments in accordance with its policies </span><span>and procedures. BFA may conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is </span><span>unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its </span><span>lack of trading or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent </span><span>price quotations or otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security </span><span>or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent </span><span>to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is </span><span>listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is </span><span>available. A </span><span>“</span><span>significant event</span><span>”</span><span> is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable </span><span>business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the Fund’s assets or liabilities, that </span><span>the event is likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or </span><span>closing market price of one or more assets held by, or liabilities of, the Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>24</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The </span><span>fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might </span><span>reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to </span><span>extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments </span><span>using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market </span><span>valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been </span><span>sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value </span><span>prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the </span><span>prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, </span><span>which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the </span><span>performance of the Underlying Index.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends and Distributions.</span></div> <div><span>General Policies.</span><span> Dividends from net investment income, if any, generally are declared </span><span>and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, </span><span>if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make </span><span>distributions on a more frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to </span><span>declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or </span><span>advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company (</span><span>“</span><span>RIC</span><span>”</span><span>) or to avoid </span><span>imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are distributed on a </span><span>pro rata</span><span> </span><span>basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC </span><span>participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds </span><span>received from the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Dividend Reinvestment Service.</span><span> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the </span><span>Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment </span><span>Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for reinvestment of their dividend </span><span>distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the </span><span>availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers </span><span>may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this </span><span>service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains </span><span>will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in </span><span>the secondary market.</span></div> <div><span>Note on Tax Information.</span><span> The following sections summarize some of the consequences </span><span>under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for </span><span>personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund </span><span>distributions and sales of shares. Certain states and localities may exempt from tax </span><span>distributions attributable to interest from U.S. federal government obligations. Consult </span><span>your personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in </span><span>shares of the Fund under all applicable tax laws.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes.</span><span> As with any investment, you should consider how your investment in shares of </span><span>the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>25</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>information, based on current law. You should consult your own tax professional about </span><span>the tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Unless your investment in Fund shares is made through a tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred</span><span> retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally </span><span>will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax </span><span>consequences when the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund shares.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes on Distributions.</span><span> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income (other </span><span>than qualified dividend income), including</span><span> </span><span>distributions of income from securities </span><span>lending and distributions out of the Fund’s net short-term capital gains, if any, are </span><span>taxable to you as ordinary income. Distributions by the Fund of net long-term capital </span><span>gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses (capital gain dividends) are </span><span>taxable to you as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the </span><span>Fund’s shares. Distributions by the Fund that qualify as qualified dividend income are </span><span>taxable to you at long-term capital gain rates. Long-term capital gains and qualified </span><span>dividend income are generally eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for </span><span>non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain </span><span>threshold amounts. In addition, a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is </span><span>imposed on </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income,</span><span>”</span><span> including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, </span><span>and net gain, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if </span><span>married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends will be qualified dividend income to you if they are attributable to qualified </span><span>dividend income received by the Fund. Generally, qualified dividend income includes </span><span>dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations and qualified non-U.S. corporations, </span><span>provided that the Fund satisfies certain holding period requirements in respect of the </span><span>stock of such corporations and has not hedged its position in the stock in certain ways. </span><span>Substitute dividends received by the Fund with respect to dividends paid on securities </span><span>lent out will not be qualified dividend income. For this purpose, a qualified non-U.S. </span><span>corporation means any non-U.S. corporation that is eligible for benefits under a </span><span>comprehensive income tax treaty with the U.S., which includes an exchange of </span><span>information program, or if the stock with respect to which the dividend was paid is </span><span>readily tradable on an established U.S. securities market. The term excludes a </span><span>corporation that is a passive foreign investment company.</span></div> <div><span>Dividends received by the Fund from a RIC generally are qualified dividend income only </span><span>to the extent such dividend distributions are made out of qualified dividend income </span><span>received by such RIC. Additionally, it is expected that dividends received by the Fund </span><span>from a REIT and distributed to a shareholder generally will be taxable to the </span><span>shareholder as ordinary income. However, for tax years beginning after December 31, </span><span>2017 and before January 1, 2026, the Fund may report dividends eligible for a 20% </span><span>“</span><span>qualified business income</span><span>”</span><span> deduction for non-corporate U.S. shareholders to the </span><span>extent the Fund’s income is derived from ordinary REIT dividends, reduced by allocable </span><span>Fund expenses.</span></div> <div><span>For a dividend to be treated as qualified dividend income, the dividend must be </span><span>received with respect to a share of stock held without being hedged by the Fund, and </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>26</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>with respect to a share of the Fund held without being hedged by you, for 61 days </span><span>during the 121-day period beginning at the date which is 60 days before the date on </span><span>which such share becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or, in the case of </span><span>certain preferred stock, 91 days during the 181-day period beginning 90 days before </span><span>such date.</span></div> <div><span>Fund distributions, to the extent attributable to dividends from U.S. corporations, will </span><span>be eligible for the dividends received deduction for Fund shareholders that are </span><span>corporations, subject to certain hedging and holding requirements.</span></div> <div><span>In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal income tax for the year when </span><span>they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on </span><span>December 31 of the prior year.</span></div> <div><span>If the Fund’s distributions exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits, all or </span><span>a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a </span><span>return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum </span><span>distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be </span><span>taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return </span><span>of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder’s </span><span>cost basis and result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those shares on </span><span>which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is </span><span>reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain, if the shareholder </span><span>holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</span></div> <div><span>If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the U.S. or if you are a non-U.S. entity </span><span>(other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s </span><span>ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) </span><span>will generally be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate </span><span>applies, provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income </span><span>realized by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital </span><span>gains or upon the sale or other disposition of shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, </span><span>interest and other income items paid to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S.</span><span> investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the U.S. Internal </span><span>Revenue Service (</span><span>“</span><span>IRS</span><span>”</span><span>) information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account </span><span>holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information </span><span>regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial </span><span>institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will </span><span>provide the IRS information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer </span><span>identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders, comply with due </span><span>diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts, report to the </span><span>IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax </span><span>on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account </span><span>holders who fail to provide the required information, and determine certain other </span><span>information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable </span><span>intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>27</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may </span><span>need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each </span><span>substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless </span><span>certain exceptions apply.</span></div> <div><span>If your Fund shares are loaned out pursuant to a securities lending arrangement, you </span><span>may lose the ability to treat Fund dividends paid while the shares are held by the </span><span>borrower as qualified dividend income.</span></div> <div><span>If you are a resident or a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup withholding at a 24% rate </span><span>will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer </span><span>identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes When Shares Are Sold.</span><span> Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale </span><span>of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been </span><span>held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund </span><span>shares held for one year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except </span><span>that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term</span><span> capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to </span><span>such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from </span><span>capital gain dividends, are included in </span><span>“</span><span>net investment income</span><span>”</span><span> for purposes of the </span><span>3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned above.</span></div> <div><span>Creations and Redemptions.</span><span> Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the </span><span>Fund are </span><span>“</span><span>created</span><span>”</span><span> at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in </span><span>block-size Creation Units or multiples thereof. Each </span><span>“</span><span>creator</span><span>”</span><span> or authorized participant </span><span>(an </span><span>“</span><span>Authorized Participant</span><span>”</span><span>) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's </span><span>Distributor, an affiliate of BFA. An Authorized Participant is a member or participant of </span><span>a clearing agency registered with the SEC, which has a written agreement with the </span><span>Fund or one of its service providers that allows such member or participant to place </span><span>orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units.</span></div> <div><span>A creation transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the Distributor and the Fund, </span><span>generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a </span><span>designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>creation basket</span><span>”</span><span>), and </span><span>an amount of cash (including any cash representing the value of substituted securities, </span><span>assets or other positions), if any, which together approximate the holdings of the Fund </span><span>in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units. Similarly, shares can be </span><span>redeemed only in Creation Units, generally for a designated portfolio of securities, </span><span>assets or other positions (a </span><span>“</span><span>redemption basket</span><span>”</span><span>) held by the Fund and an amount of </span><span>cash (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted). The </span><span>Fund may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units partially or solely for cash. </span><span>Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by the Fund. </span><span>Creation and redemption baskets may differ and the Fund may accept </span><span>“</span><span>custom </span><span>baskets.</span><span>”</span><span> More information regarding custom baskets is contained in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>28</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The prices at which creations and redemptions occur are based on the next calculation </span><span>of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under </span><span>the authorized participant agreement.</span></div> <div><span>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation Units with the Fund. </span><span>Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or </span><span>for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>In the event of a system failure or other interruption, including disruptions at market </span><span>makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either </span><span>may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at </span><span>all, or the Fund may not be able to place or change orders.</span></div> <div><span>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind transactions, the Fund intends to comply </span><span>with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying </span><span>redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any </span><span>securities accepted for deposit and any securities used to satisfy redemption requests </span><span>will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities </span><span>Act of 1933, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1933 Act</span><span>”</span><span>). Further, an Authorized Participant that is </span><span>not a </span><span>“</span><span>qualified institutional buyer,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the </span><span>1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule </span><span>144A.</span></div> <div><span>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is either a member of the </span><span>Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a </span><span>DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to </span><span>creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations. Information about the </span><span>procedures regarding creation and redemption of Creation Units (including the cut-off </span><span>times for receipt of creation and redemption orders) is included in the Fund's SAI.</span></div> <div><span>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing basis, at any point </span><span>during the life of the Fund a </span><span>“</span><span>distribution,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may </span><span>be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on </span><span>their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed </span><span>participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters </span><span>subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any </span><span>determination of whether one is an underwriter must take into account all the relevant </span><span>facts and circumstances of each particular case.</span></div> <div><span>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not </span><span>“</span><span>underwriters</span><span>”</span><span> but are </span><span>participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and </span><span>thus dealing with shares that are part of an </span><span>“</span><span>unsold allotment</span><span>”</span><span> within the meaning of </span><span>Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the 1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the </span><span>prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For </span><span>delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of </span><span>Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is available only with respect to transactions on a </span><span>national securities exchange.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>29</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Householding.</span><span> Householding is an option available to certain Fund investors. </span><span>Householding is a method of delivery, based on the preference of the individual </span><span>investor, in which a single copy of certain shareholder documents can be delivered to </span><span>investors who share the same address, even if their accounts are registered under </span><span>different names. Please contact your broker-dealer if you are interested in enrolling in </span><span>householding and receiving a single copy of prospectuses and other shareholder </span><span>documents, or if you are currently enrolled in householding and wish to change your </span><span>householding status.</span></div> <div><span>Distribution</span></div> <div><span>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the Fund on an agency basis. </span><span>The Distributor does not maintain a secondary market in shares of the Fund. The </span><span>Distributor has no role in determining the policies of the Fund or the securities that are </span><span>purchased or sold by the Fund. The Distributor’s principal address is 50 Hudson Yards, </span><span>New York, NY 10001.</span></div> <div><span>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers, registered investment advisers, </span><span>banks or other intermediaries (together, </span><span>“</span><span>intermediaries</span><span>”</span><span>) related to marketing </span><span>activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the </span><span>development of technology platforms and reporting systems, data provision services, </span><span>or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their </span><span>customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may </span><span>be significant to the intermediary, are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments </span><span>are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or </span><span>indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type </span><span>are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may </span><span>make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or </span><span>the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other </span><span>financial incentives it is eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial </span><span>incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the </span><span>intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the </span><span>Fund or other iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding </span><span>these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. </span><span>Please contact your salesperson or </span><span>other investment professional for more information regarding any such </span><span>payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</span></div> <div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>30</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> </div> <hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Financial Highlights</span></div> <div><span>The financial highlights table is intended to help investors understand the Fund’s </span><span>financial performance since inception.

After market close on October 30, 2023, the Fund will cease the creation and redemption of Creation Units. Trading </span><span>in the Fund will be halted prior to market open on October 31, 2023. Proceeds of the liquidation are currently scheduled to be </span><span>sent to Fund shareholders on or around November 2, 2023 (the </span><span>“</span><span>Liquidation Date</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> <div><span>While the Fund is in the process of liquidating its portfolio, which is anticipated to commence prior to October 30, 2023, the </span><span>Fund will hold cash and securities that will not be consistent with its investment objective and strategies and is likely to incur </span><span>higher tracking error than is typical for the Fund. Furthermore, the Trust cannot assure that there will be a trading market for </span><span>Fund shares between market close on October 30, 2023 and the Liquidation Date because Fund shares will not be traded on </span><span>the primary listing exchange identified in the Prospectus for the Fund (the </span><span>“</span><span>Listing Exchange</span><span>”</span><span>) during that period.</span></div> <div><span>Shareholders may sell their holdings of the Fund on its Listing Exchange until market close on October 30, 2023 and may </span><span>incur the usual and customary brokerage commissions associated with the sale of Fund shares. As of the Liquidation Date, </span><span>shares of the Fund will be individually redeemed. If you hold Fund shares on the Liquidation Date, the Fund will automatically </span><span>redeem your shares for cash based on the net asset value of the Fund as of the close of business on October 30, 2023, which </span><span>will include any dividends or distributions calculated as of that date.</span></div> <div><span>If you are subject to U.S. federal income tax, the liquidation of the Fund will result in one or more taxable events for you. A </span><span>sale or exchange of Fund shares prior to the Liquidation Date will generally give rise to a capital gain or loss to you for federal </span><span>income tax purposes. In connection with the liquidation, the Fund may declare taxable distributions of its investment income </span><span>or taxable distributions of its net capital gain. Any liquidation proceeds paid to you should generally be treated as received by </span><span>you in exchange for your shares and will therefore generally give rise to a capital gain or loss, depending on your tax basis. </span><span>Please consult your personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences.</span></div> <div><span>If you have any questions, please call 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737).</span></div> <div><span>iShares</span><span>®</span><span> is a registered trademark of BlackRock Fund Advisors and its affiliates.</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

The discussion below supplements, and should be read in </span><span>conjunction with, that section of the applicable Prospectus.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of each Fund are listed for trading, and trade throughout the day, on the applicable Listing Exchange and in other </span><span>secondary markets. Shares of certain Funds may also be listed on certain non-U.S. exchanges. There can be no assurance </span><span>that the requirements of the Listing Exchange necessary to maintain the listing of shares of any Fund will continue to be met. </span><span>The Listing Exchange may, but is not required to, remove the shares of a Fund from listing if, among other things: (i) a Fund is </span><span>no longer eligible to operate in reliance on Rule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act; (ii) any of the other listing </span><span>requirements are not continuously maintained; or (iii) any event shall occur or condition shall exist that, in the opinion of the </span><span>Listing Exchange, makes further dealings on the Listing Exchange inadvisable. The Listing Exchange will also remove shares </span><span>of a Fund from listing and trading upon termination of the Fund.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>As in the case of other publicly-traded securities, when you buy or sell shares of a Fund through a broker, you may incur a </span><span>brokerage commission determined by that broker, as well as other charges.</span></div> <div><span>The Trust reserves the right to adjust the share price of the Funds in the future to maintain convenient trading ranges for </span><span>investors. Any adjustments would be accomplished through stock splits or reverse stock splits, which would have no effect </span><span>on the net assets of the Funds or an investor's equity interest in the Funds.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Investment Strategies and Risks</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Each Fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing primarily in securities issued by issuers that compose its relevant </span><span>Underlying Index and in investments that provide substantially similar exposure to securities in the Underlying Index. Each </span><span>Fund operates as an index fund and is not actively managed. Adverse performance of a security in a Fund’s portfolio will </span><span>ordinarily not result in the elimination of the security from the Fund’s portfolio.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Each Fund engages in representative sampling, which is investing in a sample of securities selected by BFA to have a </span><span>collective investment profile similar to that of the Fund's Underlying Index. Securities selected have aggregate investment </span><span>characteristics (based on market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return </span><span>variability, earnings valuation and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of the Fund’s Underlying Index. A fund that </span><span>uses representative sampling generally does not hold all of the securities that are in its underlying index.</span></div> <div><span>Although the Funds do not seek leveraged returns, certain instruments used by the Funds may have a leveraging effect as </span><span>described below.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Borrowing. </span><span> </span><span>Each Fund may borrow for temporary or emergency purposes, including to meet payments due from </span><span>redemptions or to facilitate the settlement of securities or other transactions. The iShares JPX-Nikkei 400 ETF and iShares </span><span>Semiconductor ETF, along with certain other iShares funds, have entered into a syndicated line of credit with the Bank of New </span><span>York Mellon (</span><span>“</span><span>BNY</span><span>”</span><span>), which serves as administrative agent for itself and the other banks. The syndicated line of credit may be </span><span>used for temporary or emergency purposes, including redemption, settlement of trades and rebalancing of portfolio holdings.</span></div> <div><span>Interest rates related to the syndicated line of credit are based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (</span><span>“</span><span>SOFR</span><span>”</span><span>) published </span><span>by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plus a spread. Pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement, if SOFR were to cease </span><span>being published or representative, it would be replaced by a rate based on an alternate benchmark selected by BNY.</span></div> <div><span>The purchase of securities while borrowings are outstanding may have the effect of leveraging a Fund. The incurrence of </span><span>leverage increases a Fund’s exposure to risk, and borrowed funds are subject to interest costs that will reduce net income. </span><span>Purchasing securities while borrowings are outstanding creates special risks, such as the potential for greater volatility in the </span><span>NAV of Fund shares and in the yield on a Fund’s portfolio. In addition, the interest expenses from borrowings may exceed the </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>income generated by a Fund’s portfolio and, therefore, the amount available (if any) for distribution to shareholders as </span><span>dividends may be reduced. BFA may determine to maintain outstanding borrowings if it expects that the benefits to a Fund’s </span><span>shareholders will outweigh the current reduced return.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Certain types of borrowings by a Fund must be made from a bank or may result in a Fund being subject to covenants in </span><span>credit agreements relating to asset coverage, portfolio composition requirements and other matters. It is not anticipated that </span><span>observance of such covenants would impede BFA’s management of a Fund’s portfolio in accordance with a Fund’s </span><span>investment objectives and policies. However, a breach of any such covenants not cured within the specified cure period may </span><span>result in acceleration of outstanding indebtedness and require a Fund to dispose of portfolio investments at a time when it </span><span>may be disadvantageous to do so.</span></div> <div><span>Currency Transactions.</span><span>  </span><span>A currency forward contract is an over-the-counter (</span><span>“</span><span>OTC</span><span>”</span><span>) obligation to purchase or sell a specific </span><span>currency at a future date, which may be any fixed number of days greater than two days from the date on which the contract </span><span>is agreed upon by the parties, at a price set at the time of the contract. A non-deliverable currency forward is an OTC </span><span>currency forward settled in a specified currency, on a specified date, based on the difference between the agreed-upon </span><span>exchange rate and the market exchange rate. A currency futures contract is a contract that trades on an organized futures </span><span>exchange involving an obligation to deliver or acquire a specified amount of a specific currency, at a specified price and at a </span><span>specified future time. Currency futures contracts may be settled on a net cash payment basis rather than by the sale and </span><span>delivery of the underlying currency. Certain of the Funds do not expect to engage in currency transactions for the purpose of </span><span>hedging against declines in the value of the Funds' assets that are denominated in a non-U.S. currency. A Fund may enter </span><span>into non-U.S. currency forwards, non-deliverable currency forwards and non-U.S. currency futures transactions to facilitate </span><span>local securities settlements or to protect against currency exposure in connection with its distributions to shareholders, but </span><span>may not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Foreign exchange transactions involve a significant degree of risk and the markets in which foreign exchange transactions are </span><span>effected may be highly volatile, highly specialized and highly technical. Significant changes, including changes in liquidity and </span><span>prices, can occur in such markets within very short periods of time, often within minutes. Foreign exchange trading risks </span><span>include, but are not limited to, exchange rate risk, counterparty risk, maturity gap, interest rate risk, and potential interference </span><span>by foreign governments through regulation of local exchange markets, foreign investment or particular transactions in non-U.S.</span><span> currency. If BFA utilizes foreign exchange transactions at an inappropriate time or judges market conditions, trends or </span><span>correlations incorrectly, foreign exchange transactions may not serve their intended purpose of improving the correlation of a </span><span>Fund's return with the performance of its Underlying Index and may lower the Fund’s return. A Fund could experience losses </span><span>if the value of its currency forwards, options or futures positions were poorly correlated with its other investments or if it </span><span>could not close out its positions because of an illiquid market or otherwise. In addition, a Fund could incur transaction costs, </span><span>including trading commissions, in connection with certain non-U.S. currency transactions.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Diversification Status.</span><span>  </span><span>The following table sets forth the diversification status of each Fund:</span><span> </span></div> <div> </div> <div>

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>capitalization or index weighting of one or more constituents of their Underlying Indexes and such a change does not require </span><span>shareholder approval.</span></div> <div><span> </span><span>A </span><span>“</span><span>non-diversified</span><span>”</span><span> fund is a fund that is not limited by the 1940 Act with regard to the percentage of its assets that may be </span><span>invested in the securities of a single issuer. The securities of a particular issuer (or securities of issuers in particular industries) </span><span>may constitute a significant percentage of the underlying index of such a fund and, consequently, the fund’s investment </span><span>portfolio. This may adversely affect a fund’s performance or subject the fund’s shares to greater price volatility than that </span><span>experienced by more diversified investment companies.</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund (whether diversified or non-diversified) intends to maintain the required level of diversification and otherwise </span><span>conduct its operations so as to qualify as a regulated investment company (</span><span>“</span><span>RIC</span><span>”</span><span>) for purposes of the U.S. Internal Revenue </span><span>Code of 1986, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>Internal Revenue Code</span><span>”</span><span>), and to relieve the Fund of any liability for U.S. federal income tax to </span><span>the extent that its earnings are distributed to shareholders, provided that the Fund satisfies a minimum distribution </span><span>requirement. Compliance with the diversification requirements of the Internal Revenue Code may limit the investment </span><span>flexibility of the Funds and may make it less likely that the Funds will meet their respective investment objectives.</span></div> <div><span>Futures, Options on Futures and Securities Options.</span><span>  </span><span>Futures contracts, options on futures and securities options may be </span><span>used by a Fund to simulate investment in its Underlying Index, to facilitate trading or to reduce transaction costs. Each Fund </span><span>may enter into futures contracts and options on futures that are traded on a U.S. or non-U.S. futures exchange. Each Fund </span><span>will not use futures, options on futures or securities options for speculative purposes. Each Fund intends to use futures and </span><span>options on futures in accordance with Rule 4.5 of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the </span><span>“</span><span>CFTC</span><span>”</span><span>) promulgated </span><span>under the Commodity Exchange Act (</span><span>“</span><span>CEA</span><span>”</span><span>). BFA, with respect to certain Funds, has claimed an exclusion from the definition </span><span>of the term </span><span>“</span><span>commodity pool operator</span><span>”</span><span> in accordance with Rule 4.5 so that BFA, with respect to such Funds, is not subject to </span><span>registration or regulation as a commodity pool operator under the CEA. See the </span><span>Regulation Regarding Derivatives </span><span>section of </span><span>this SAI for more information.</span></div> <div><span>Futures contracts provide for the future sale by one party and purchase by another party of a specified amount of a specific </span><span>instrument or index at a specified future time and at a specified price. Stock index contracts are based on investments that </span><span>reflect the market value of common stock of the firms included in the investments. Each Fund may enter into futures </span><span>contracts to purchase securities indexes when BFA anticipates purchasing the underlying securities and believes prices will </span><span>rise before the purchase will be made. Upon entering into a futures contract, a Fund will be required to deposit with the </span><span>broker an amount of cash or cash equivalents known as </span><span>“</span><span>initial margin,</span><span>”</span><span> which is similar to a performance bond or good faith </span><span>deposit on the contract and is returned to the Fund upon termination of the futures contract if all contractual obligations </span><span>have been satisfied. Subsequent payments, known as </span><span>“</span><span>variation margin,</span><span>”</span><span> will be made to and from the broker daily as the </span><span>price of the instrument or index underlying the futures contract fluctuates, making the long and short positions in the futures </span><span>contract more or less valuable, a process known as </span><span>“</span><span>marking-to-market.</span><span>”</span><span> At any time prior to the expiration of a futures </span><span>contract, each Fund may elect to close the position by taking an opposite position, which will operate to terminate the Fund’s </span><span>existing position in the contract. An option on a futures contract, as contrasted with a direct investment in such a contract, </span><span>gives the purchaser the right, but no obligation, in return for the premium paid, to assume a position in the underlying </span><span>futures contract at a specified exercise price at any time prior to the expiration date of the option. Upon exercise of an option, </span><span>the delivery of the futures position by the writer of the option to the holder of the option will be accompanied by delivery of </span><span>the accumulated balance in the writer’s futures margin account that represents the amount by which the market price of the </span><span>futures contract exceeds (in the case of a call) or is less than (in the case of a put) the exercise price of the option on the </span><span>futures contract.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The potential for loss related to the purchase of an option on a futures contract is limited to the premium paid for the option </span><span>plus transaction costs. Because the value of the option is fixed at the point of sale, there are no daily cash payments by the </span><span>purchaser to reflect changes in the value of the underlying contract; however, the value of the option changes daily and that </span><span>change would be reflected in the NAV of each Fund. The potential for loss related to writing call options is unlimited. The </span><span>potential for loss related to writing put options is limited to the agreed-upon price per share, also known as the </span><span>“</span><span>strike price,</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>less the premium received from writing the put. Certain of the Funds may purchase and write put and call options on futures </span><span>contracts that are traded on an exchange as a hedge against changes in value of their portfolio securities or in anticipation of </span><span>the purchase of securities, and may enter into closing transactions with respect to such options to terminate existing </span><span>positions. There is no guarantee that such closing transactions can be effected.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>6</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Securities options may be used by a Fund to obtain access to securities in its Underlying Index or to dispose of securities in </span><span>its Underlying Index at favorable prices, to invest cash in a securities index that offers similar exposure to that provided by its </span><span>Underlying Index or otherwise to achieve the Fund’s objective of tracking its Underlying Index.</span><span> </span><span>A call option gives a holder the </span><span>right to purchase a specific security at a specified price (</span><span>“</span><span>exercise price</span><span>”</span><span>) within a specified period of time. A put option gives </span><span>a holder the right to sell a specific security at an exercise price within a specified period of time. The initial purchaser of a call </span><span>option pays the </span><span>“</span><span>writer</span><span>”</span><span> a premium, which is paid at the time of purchase and is retained by the writer whether or not such </span><span>option is exercised. Each Fund may purchase put options to hedge its portfolio against the risk of a decline in the market </span><span>value of securities held and may purchase call options to hedge against an increase in the price of securities it is committed </span><span>to purchase. Each Fund may write put and call options along with a long position in options to increase its ability to hedge </span><span>against a change in the market value of the securities it holds or is committed to purchase. Each Fund may purchase or sell </span><span>securities options on a U.S. or non-U.S. securities exchange or in the OTC market through a transaction with a dealer. Options </span><span>on a securities index are typically settled on a net basis based on the appreciation or depreciation of the index level over the </span><span>strike price. Options on single name securities may be cash- or physically-settled, depending upon the market in which they </span><span>are traded. Options may be structured so as to be exercisable only on certain dates or on a daily basis. Options may also be </span><span>structured to have conditions to exercise (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, </span><span>“</span><span>Knock-in Events</span><span>”</span><span>) or conditions that trigger termination (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, </span><span>“</span><span>Knock-out </span><span>Events</span><span>”</span><span>).</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Lending Portfolio Securities.</span><span>  </span><span>Each Fund may lend portfolio securities to certain borrowers that BFA determines to be </span><span>creditworthy, including borrowers affiliated with BFA. The borrowers provide collateral that is maintained in an amount at </span><span>least equal to the current market value of the securities loaned. No securities loan shall be made on behalf of a Fund if, as a </span><span>result, the aggregate value of all securities loans of the particular Fund exceeds one-third of the value of such Fund's total </span><span>assets (including the value of the collateral received). A Fund may terminate a loan at any time and obtain the return of the </span><span>securities loaned. Each Fund receives, by way of substitute payment, the value of any interest or cash or non-cash </span><span>distributions paid on the loaned securities that it would have otherwise received if the securities were not on loan.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>With respect to loans that are collateralized by cash, the borrower may be entitled to receive a fee based on the amount of </span><span>cash collateral. The Funds are compensated by any positive difference between the amount earned on the reinvestment of </span><span>cash collateral and the fee paid to the borrower. In the case of collateral other than cash, a Fund is compensated by a fee paid </span><span>by the borrower equal to a percentage of the market value of the loaned securities. Any cash collateral received by the Fund </span><span>for such loans, and uninvested cash, may be reinvested in certain short-term instruments either directly on behalf of each </span><span>Fund or through one or more joint accounts or money market funds, including those affiliated with BFA; such investments </span><span>are subject to investment risk.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Each Fund conducts its securities lending pursuant to an exemptive order from the SEC permitting it to lend portfolio </span><span>securities to borrowers affiliated with the Fund and to retain an affiliate of the Fund to act as securities lending agent. To the </span><span>extent that a Fund engages in securities lending, BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>BTC</span><span>”</span><span>) acts as securities </span><span>lending agent for the Fund, subject to the overall supervision of BFA. BTC administers the lending program in accordance </span><span>with guidelines approved by the Trust's Board of Trustees (the </span><span>“</span><span>Board,</span><span>”</span><span> the trustees of which are the </span><span>“</span><span>Trustees</span><span>”</span><span>). JPMorgan </span><span>Chase Bank, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>JPMorgan</span><span>”</span><span>) serves as custodian for the Funds in connection with certain securities lending activities.</span></div> <div><span>Securities lending involves exposure to certain risks, including operational risk (i.e., the risk of losses resulting from problems </span><span>in the settlement and accounting process), </span><span>“</span><span>gap</span><span>”</span><span> risk (i.e., the risk of a mismatch between the return on cash collateral </span><span>reinvestments and the fees a Fund has agreed to pay a borrower), foreign exchange risk (i.e., the risk of a shortfall at default </span><span>when a cash collateral investment is denominated in a currency other than the currency of the assets being loaned due to </span><span>movements in foreign exchange rates), and credit, legal, counterparty and market risks (including the risk that market events </span><span>could lead the Fund to recall loaned securities or to lend less or not at all, which could lead to reduced securities lending </span><span>revenue). If a securities lending counterparty were to default, a Fund would be subject to the risk of a possible delay in </span><span>receiving collateral or in recovering the loaned securities, or to a possible loss of rights in the collateral. In the event a </span><span>borrower does not return a Fund’s securities as agreed, the Fund’s ability to participate in a corporate action event may be </span><span>impacted, or the Fund may experience losses if the proceeds received from liquidating the collateral do not at least equal the </span><span>value of the loaned security at the time the collateral is liquidated, plus the transaction costs incurred in purchasing </span><span>replacement securities. This latter event could trigger adverse tax consequences for a Fund. A Fund could lose money if its </span><span>short-term investment of the collateral declines in value over the period of the loan. Substitute payments received by a Fund </span><span>representing dividends paid on securities loaned out by the Fund will not be considered qualified dividend income. BTC will </span><span>take into account the tax effects on shareholders caused by this difference in connection with a Fund’s securities lending </span><span>program. Substitute payments received on tax-exempt securities loaned out will not be tax-exempt income.

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>be changes in the status of issuers under applicable laws and regulations, including tax regulations, that may impact the </span><span>regulatory or tax treatment of loaned securities and could, for example, result in a delay in the payment of dividend </span><span>equivalent payments owed to a Fund (as permitted by applicable law).</span></div> <div><span>Regulations adopted by global prudential regulators require certain bank-regulated counterparties and certain of their </span><span>affiliates to include in certain financial contracts, including many securities lending agreements, terms that delay or restrict </span><span>the rights of counterparties, such as the Fund, to terminate such agreements, foreclose upon collateral, exercise other default </span><span>rights or restrict transfers of credit support in the event that the counterparty and/or its affiliates are subject to certain types </span><span>of resolution or insolvency proceedings. It is possible that these requirements, as well as potential additional government </span><span>regulation and other developments in the market, could adversely affect the Fund’s ability to terminate existing securities </span><span>lending agreements or to realize amounts to be received under such agreements.</span></div> <div><span>Liquidity Risk Management.</span><span>  </span><span>Rule 22e-4 under the Investment Company Act (the </span><span>“</span><span>Liquidity Rule</span><span>”</span><span>) requires open-end funds, </span><span>including exchange-traded funds (</span><span>“</span><span>ETFs</span><span>”</span><span>) such as the Funds, to establish a liquidity risk management program (the </span><span>“</span><span>Liquidity Program</span><span>”</span><span>) and enhance disclosures regarding fund liquidity. As required by the Liquidity Rule, the Funds have </span><span>implemented a Liquidity Program, and the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees of the Trust, has </span><span>appointed BFA as the administrator of the Liquidity Program. Under the Liquidity Program, BFA assesses, manages, and </span><span>periodically reviews each Fund’s liquidity risk and classifies each investment held by a Fund as a </span><span>“</span><span>highly liquid investment,</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>“</span><span>moderately liquid investment,</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>“</span><span>less liquid investment</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>illiquid investment.</span><span>”</span><span> The Liquidity Rule defines </span><span>“</span><span>liquidity risk</span><span>”</span><span> as </span><span>the risk that a Fund could not meet requests to redeem shares issued by a Fund without significant dilution of the remaining </span><span>investors’ interest in a Fund. The liquidity of a Fund's portfolio investments is determined based on relevant market, trading </span><span>and investment-specific considerations under the Liquidity Program. There are exclusions from certain portions of the </span><span>liquidity risk management program requirements for </span><span>“</span><span>in-kind</span><span>”</span><span> ETFs, as defined in the Liquidity Rule. To the extent that an </span><span>investment is deemed to be an illiquid investment or a less liquid investment, a Fund can expect to be exposed to greater </span><span>liquidity risk.</span></div> <div><span>Non-U.S. Securities.</span><span>  </span><span>Certain Funds purchase publicly traded common stocks of non-U.S. issuers. To the extent a Fund </span><span>invests in stocks of non-U.S. issuers, certain of the Fund's investments in such stocks may be in the form of American </span><span>Depositary Receipts (</span><span>“</span><span>ADRs</span><span>”</span><span>), Global Depositary Receipts (</span><span>“</span><span>GDRs</span><span>”</span><span>) and European Depositary Receipts (</span><span>“</span><span>EDRs</span><span>”</span><span>) (collectively, </span><span>“</span><span>depositary receipts</span><span>”</span><span>). Depositary receipts are receipts, typically issued by a bank or trust issuer, which evidence ownership of </span><span>underlying securities issued by a non-U.S. issuer. Depositary receipts may not necessarily be denominated in the same </span><span>currency as their underlying securities. ADRs typically are issued by a U.S. bank or trust company and evidence ownership of </span><span>underlying securities issued by a non-U.S. issuer. EDRs, which are sometimes referred to as continental depositary receipts, </span><span>are receipts issued in Europe, typically by foreign banks and trust companies, that evidence ownership of either foreign or </span><span>domestic underlying securities. GDRs are depositary receipts structured like global debt issues to facilitate trading on an </span><span>international basis. Generally, ADRs, issued in registered form, are designed for use in the U.S. securities markets, and EDRs, </span><span>issued in bearer form, are designed for use in European securities markets. GDRs are tradable both in the U.S. and in Europe </span><span>and are designed for use throughout the world.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Depositary receipts are generally subject to the same risks as the foreign securities that they evidence or into which they may </span><span>be converted. In addition to investment risks associated with the underlying issuer, depositary receipts expose a Fund to </span><span>additional risks associated with the non-uniform terms that apply to depositary receipt programs, credit exposure to the </span><span>depository bank and to the sponsors and other parties with whom the depository bank establishes the programs, currency </span><span>risk and liquidity risk. Unsponsored programs, which are not sanctioned by the issuer of the underlying common stock, </span><span>generally expose investors to greater risks than sponsored programs and do not provide holders with many of the </span><span>shareholder benefits that come from investing in a sponsored depositary receipts.</span></div> <div><span>Investing in the securities of non-U.S. issuers involves special risks and considerations not typically associated with investing </span><span>in U.S. issuers. These include differences in accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards; the possibility of </span><span>expropriation or confiscatory taxation; adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations; political instability, </span><span>which could affect U.S. investments in non-U.S. countries; and potential restrictions on the flow of international capital. Non-U.S.</span><span> issuers may be subject to less governmental regulation than U.S. issuers. Moreover, individual non-U.S. economies may </span><span>differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy in such respects as growth of gross domestic product (</span><span>“</span><span>GDP</span><span>”</span><span>), rate of </span><span>inflation, capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency and balance of payment positions.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

Rule 18f-4, among other things, requires a Fund to adopt and implement a </span><span>comprehensive written derivatives risk management program (</span><span>“</span><span>DRMP</span><span>”</span><span>) and comply with a relative or absolute limit on Fund </span><span>leverage risk calculated based on value-at-risk (</span><span>“</span><span>VaR</span><span>”</span><span>). The DRMP is administered by a </span><span>“</span><span>derivatives risk manager,</span><span>”</span><span> who is </span><span>appointed by the Board, including a majority of Independent Directors/Trustees, and periodically reviews the DRMP and </span><span>reports to the Board.</span></div> <div><span>Rule 18f-4 provides an exception from the DRMP, VaR limit and certain other requirements if a Fund's </span><span>“</span><span>derivatives exposure</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>(as defined in Rule 18f-4) is limited to 10% of its net assets (as calculated in accordance with Rule 18f-4) and the Fund </span><span>adopts and implements written policies and procedures reasonably designed to manage its derivatives risks (the </span><span>“</span><span>Limited </span><span>Derivatives User Exception</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> <div><span>Repurchase Agreements.</span><span>  </span><span>A repurchase agreement is an instrument under which the purchaser (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, a Fund) acquires a </span><span>security and the seller agrees, at the time of the sale, to repurchase the security at a mutually agreed-upon time and price, </span><span>thereby determining the yield during the purchaser’s holding period. Repurchase agreements may be construed to be </span><span>collateralized loans by the purchaser to the seller secured by the securities transferred to the purchaser. If a repurchase </span><span>agreement is construed to be a collateralized loan, the underlying securities will not be considered to be owned by a Fund but </span><span>only to constitute collateral for the seller’s obligation to pay the repurchase price, and, in the event of a default by the seller, </span><span>the Fund may suffer time delays and incur costs or losses in connection with the disposition of the collateral.</span></div> <div><span>In any repurchase transaction, the collateral for a repurchase agreement may include: (i) cash items; (ii) obligations issued by </span><span>the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities; or (iii) obligations that, at the time the repurchase agreement is </span><span>entered into, are determined to (A) have exceptionally strong capacity to meet their financial obligations and (B) are </span><span>sufficiently liquid such that they can be sold at approximately their carrying value in the ordinary course of business within </span><span>seven days.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Repurchase agreements pose certain risks for a Fund that utilizes them. Such risks are not unique to the Funds, but are </span><span>inherent in repurchase agreements. The Funds seek to minimize such risks, but because of the inherent legal uncertainties </span><span>involved in repurchase agreements, such risks cannot be eliminated. Lower quality collateral and collateral with a longer </span><span>maturity may be subject to greater price fluctuations than higher quality collateral and collateral with a shorter maturity. If </span><span>the repurchase agreement counterparty were to default, lower quality collateral may be more difficult to liquidate than higher </span><span>quality collateral. Should the counterparty default and the amount of collateral not be sufficient to cover the counterparty’s </span><span>repurchase obligation, a Fund would likely retain the status of an unsecured creditor of the counterparty (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the position a </span><span>Fund would normally be in if it were to hold, pursuant to its investment policies, other unsecured debt securities of the </span><span>defaulting counterparty) with respect to the amount of the shortfall. As an unsecured creditor, a Fund would be at risk of </span><span>losing some or all of the principal and income involved in the transaction.</span></div> <div><span>Reverse Repurchase Agreements.</span><span>  </span><span>Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities with an agreement to </span><span>repurchase the securities at an agreed-upon price, date and interest payment and have the characteristics of borrowing. </span><span>Generally, the effect of such transactions is that a Fund can recover all or most of the cash invested in the portfolio securities </span><span>involved during the term of the reverse repurchase agreement, while in many cases the Fund is able to keep some of the </span><span>interest income associated with those securities. Such transactions are advantageous only if a Fund has an opportunity to </span><span>earn a rate of interest on the cash derived from these transactions that is greater than the interest cost of obtaining the same </span><span>amount of cash. Opportunities to realize earnings from the use of the proceeds equal to or greater than the interest required </span><span>to be paid may not always be available, and a Fund intends to use the reverse repurchase technique only when BFA believes it </span><span>will be advantageous to the Fund. The use of reverse repurchase agreements may exaggerate any increase or decrease in the </span><span>value of a Fund’s assets. The use of reverse repurchase agreements is a form of leverage, and the proceeds obtained by a </span><span>Fund through reverse repurchase agreements may be invested in additional securities.</span></div> <div><span>Rule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act permits a Fund to enter into reverse repurchase agreements and similar </span><span>financing transactions (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> recourse and non-recourse tender option bonds, borrowed bonds) notwithstanding the </span><span>limitation on the issuance of senior securities in Section 18 of the Investment Company Act, provided that a Fund either (i) </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

(See </span><span>“</span><span>Regulation Regarding Derivatives</span><span>”</span><span> above.)</span></div> <div><span>Securities of Investment Companies.</span><span>  </span><span>Each Fund may invest in the securities of other investment companies (including </span><span>money market funds) to the extent permitted by law. Pursuant to the 1940 Act, a Fund’s investment in registered investment </span><span>companies is generally limited to, subject to certain exceptions: (i) 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of any one </span><span>investment company; (ii) 5% of a Fund’s total assets with respect to any one investment company; and (iii) 10% of a Fund’s </span><span>total assets with respect to investment companies in the aggregate. To the extent allowed by law or regulation, each Fund </span><span>intends from time to time to invest its assets in the securities of investment companies, including, but not limited to, money </span><span>market funds, including those advised by or otherwise affiliated with BFA, in excess of the general limits discussed above. </span><span>Other investment companies in which a Fund may invest can be expected to incur fees and expenses for operations, such as </span><span>investment advisory and administration fees, which would be in addition to those incurred by the Fund. Pursuant to guidance </span><span>issued by the SEC staff, fees and expenses of money market funds used for cash collateral received in connection with loans </span><span>of securities are not treated as Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, which reflect a Fund’s </span><span>pro rata</span><span> share of the fees and </span><span>expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies (as disclosed in the Prospectus, as applicable).</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Short-Term Instruments and Temporary Investments.</span><span>  </span><span>Each Fund may invest in short-term instruments, including money </span><span>market instruments, on an ongoing basis to provide liquidity or for other reasons. Money market instruments are generally </span><span>short-term investments that may include, but are not limited to: (i) shares of money market funds (including those advised </span><span>by BFA or otherwise affiliated with BFA); (ii) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or </span><span>instrumentalities (including government-sponsored enterprises); (iii) negotiable certificates of deposit (</span><span>“</span><span>CDs</span><span>”</span><span>), bankers’ </span><span>acceptances, fixed-time deposits and other obligations of U.S. and non-U.S. banks (including non-U.S. branches) and similar </span><span>institutions; (iv) commercial paper rated, at the date of purchase, </span><span>“</span><span>Prime-1</span><span>”</span><span> by Moody's</span><span>®</span><span> Investors Service, Inc., </span><span>“</span><span>F-1</span><span>”</span><span> by </span><span>Fitch Ratings, Inc., or </span><span>“</span><span>A-1</span><span>”</span><span> by Standard &amp; Poor's</span><span>®</span><span> Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of S&amp;P Global, Inc. (S&amp;P Global </span><span>Ratings), or if unrated, of comparable quality as determined by BFA; (v) non-convertible corporate debt securities (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, bonds </span><span>and debentures) with remaining maturities at the date of purchase of not more than 397 days and that have been </span><span>determined to present minimal credit risks, in accordance with the requirements set forth in Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act; </span><span>(vi) repurchase agreements; and (vii) short-term U.S. dollar-denominated obligations of non-U.S. banks (including U.S. </span><span>branches) that, in the opinion of BFA, are of comparable quality to obligations of U.S. banks that may be purchased by a </span><span>Fund. Any of these instruments may be purchased on a current or forward-settled basis. Time deposits are non-negotiable </span><span>deposits maintained in banking institutions for specified periods of time at stated interest rates. Bankers’ acceptances are </span><span>time drafts drawn on commercial banks by borrowers, usually in connection with international transactions.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Swap Agreements.</span><span>  </span><span>Swap agreements are contracts between parties in which one party agrees to make periodic payments to </span><span>the other party based on a pre-determined underlying investment or notional amount. In return, the other party agrees to </span><span>make periodic payments to the first party based on the return (or a differential in rate of return) earned or realized on the </span><span>underlying investment or notional amount. Swap agreements will usually be performed on a net basis, with a Fund receiving </span><span>or paying only the net amount of the two payments. The net amount of the excess, if any, of a Fund’s obligations over its </span><span>entitlements with respect to each swap is accrued on a daily basis.</span></div> <div><span>Certain of the Funds may enter into swap agreements, including currency swaps, interest rate swaps and index swaps, or for </span><span>the iShares Core S&amp;P Mid-Cap ETF, iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF, iShares ESG Screened S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF, iShares S&amp;P </span><span>Mid-Cap 400 Growth ETF, iShares S&amp;P Mid-Cap 400 Value ETF, iShares S&amp;P Small-Cap 600 Growth ETF, iShares S&amp;P Small-Cap</span><span> 600 Value ETF and iShares U.S. Infrastructure ETF, total return swaps (some of which may be referred to as contracts for </span><span>difference or </span><span>“</span><span>CFDs</span><span>”</span><span>). The use of swaps is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different </span><span>from those associated with ordinary portfolio security transactions. These transactions generally do not involve the delivery </span><span>of securities or other underlying assets.</span></div> <div><span>Tracking Stocks.</span><span>  </span><span>A tracking stock is a separate class of common stock whose value is linked to a specific business unit or </span><span>operating division within a larger company and is designed to </span><span>“</span><span>track</span><span>”</span><span> the performance of such business unit or division. The </span><span>tracking stock may pay dividends to shareholders independent of the parent company. The parent company, rather than the </span><span>business unit or division, generally is the issuer of tracking stock. However, holders of the tracking stock may not have the </span><span>same rights as holders of the company’s common stock.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Future Developments.</span><span>  </span><span>The Board may, in the future, authorize each Fund to invest in securities contracts and investments, </span><span>other than those listed in this SAI and in the applicable Prospectus, provided they are consistent with each Fund's investment </span><span>objective and do not violate any of its investment restrictions or policies.</span></div> <div><span>General Considerations and Risks</span></div> <div><span>A discussion of some of the principal risks associated with an investment in a Fund is contained in the applicable Prospectus.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>An investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding that the value of the Fund’s portfolio</span><span> </span><span>securities may </span><span>fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the issuers of the portfolio securities, the value of preferred </span><span>or common stocks in general, and other factors that affect the market. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate </span><span>the significance of any particular risk factor.</span></div> <div><span>Borrowing Risk. </span><span> </span><span>Borrowing may exaggerate changes in the NAV of Fund shares and in the return on a Fund’s portfolio. </span><span>Borrowing will cause a Fund to incur interest expense and other fees. The costs of borrowing may reduce a Fund’s return. </span><span>Borrowing may cause a Fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations.</span></div> <div><span>Custody Risk. </span><span> </span><span>Custody risk refers to the risks inherent in the process of clearing and settling trades and to the holding of </span><span>securities, cash and other assets by local banks, agents and depositories. Low trading volumes and volatile prices in less </span><span>developed markets make trades harder to complete and settle, and governments or trade groups may compel local agents to </span><span>hold securities in designated depositories that may not be subject to independent evaluation. Local agents are held only to </span><span>the standards of care of their local markets, and thus may be subject to limited or no government oversight. Communications </span><span>between the U.S. and emerging market countries may be unreliable, increasing the risk of delayed settlements or losses of </span><span>security certificates. In general, the less developed a country’s securities market is, the greater the likelihood of custody </span><span>problems. Practices in relation to the settlement of securities transactions in emerging markets involve higher risks than </span><span>those in developed markets, in part because of the use of brokers and counterparties that are often less well capitalized, and </span><span>custody and registration of assets in some countries may be unreliable. The possibility of fraud, negligence or undue </span><span>influence being exerted by the issuer or refusal to recognize ownership exists in some emerging markets, and, along with </span><span>other factors, could result in ownership registration being lost. In addition, the laws of certain countries may put limits on a </span><span>Fund’s ability to recover its assets if a foreign bank or depository or issuer of a security or an agent of any of the foregoing </span><span>goes bankrupt. A Fund would absorb any loss resulting from such custody problems and may have no successful claim for </span><span>compensation.</span></div> <div><span>Dividend-Paying Stock Risk. </span><span> </span><span>Investing in dividend-paying stocks involves the risk that such stocks may fall out of favor with </span><span>investors and underperform the broader market. Companies that issue dividend-paying stocks are not required to pay or </span><span>continue paying dividends on such stocks. It is possible that issuers of the stocks held by a Fund will not declare dividends in </span><span>the future or will reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends (including reducing or eliminating anticipated accelerations or </span><span>increases in the payment of dividends) in the future.</span></div> <div><span>Illiquid Investments Risk.</span><span>  </span><span>Each Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, immediately after the acquisition, the Fund </span><span>would have invested more than 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that a </span><span>Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less without </span><span>significantly changing the market value of the investment. The liquidity of an investment will be determined based on </span><span>relevant market, trading and investment specific considerations as set out in the Liquidity Program as required by the </span><span>Liquidity Rule. Illiquid investments may trade at a discount to comparable, more liquid investments and a Fund may not be </span><span>able to dispose of illiquid investments in a timely fashion or at their expected prices. If illiquid investments exceed 15% of a </span><span>Fund’s net assets, the Liquidity Rule and the Liquidity Program will require that certain remedial actions be taken.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>LIBOR Replacement Risk. </span><span> </span><span>A Fund may be exposed to financial instruments that are tied to the London Interbank Offered </span><span>Rate (</span><span>“</span><span>LIBOR</span><span>”</span><span>) to determine payment obligations, financing terms, hedging strategies or investment value. The United </span><span>Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that a majority of USD LIBOR settings will no </span><span>longer be published after June 30, 2023. All other LIBOR settings and certain other interbank offered rates ceased to be </span><span>published after December 31, 2021. The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (</span><span>“</span><span>SOFR</span><span>”</span><span>), which is a broad measure of the cost of </span><span>borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities in the repurchase agreement market, has been used </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>12</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>increasingly on a voluntary basis in new instruments and transactions. Under U.S. regulations that implement a statutory </span><span>fallback mechanism to replace LIBOR, benchmark rates based on SOFR will replace LIBOR in different categories of financial </span><span>contracts after June 30, 2023.</span></div> <div><span>Neither the effect of the LIBOR transition process nor its ultimate success can yet be known. While some existing LIBOR-based</span><span> instruments may contemplate a scenario where LIBOR is no longer available by providing for an alternative rate-setting </span><span>methodology, there may be significant uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of any such alternative methodologies to </span><span>replicate LIBOR. Not all existing LIBOR-based instruments may have alternative rate-setting provisions and there remains </span><span>uncertainty regarding the willingness and ability of issuers to add alternative rate-setting provisions in certain existing </span><span>instruments. Parties to contracts, securities, or other instruments using LIBOR may disagree on transition rates or the </span><span>application of transition regulation, potentially resulting in uncertainty of performance and the possibility of litigation. A Fund </span><span>may have instruments linked to other interbank offered rates that may also cease to be published in the future.</span></div> <div><span>Money Market Instruments Risk. </span><span> </span><span>A Fund may hold money market instruments. The value of money market instruments </span><span>may be affected by changes in interest rates or in the credit ratings of the investments, among other things. If a significant </span><span>amount of a Fund's assets is invested in money market instruments, it may be more difficult for the Fund to achieve its </span><span>investment objective. An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance </span><span>Corporation or any other government agency. It is possible to lose money by investing in a money market fund. Money </span><span>market funds other than U.S. government money market funds and retail money market funds </span><span>“</span><span>float</span><span>”</span><span> their NAV instead of </span><span>using a stable $1.00 per share price.</span></div> <div><span>National Closed Market Trading Risk. </span><span> </span><span>To the extent that the underlying securities held by a Fund trade on foreign exchanges </span><span>or in foreign markets that are closed when the securities exchange on which a Fund’s shares trade is open, there are likely to </span><span>be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security </span><span>(</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, a Fund’s quote from the closed foreign market). The impact of a closed foreign market on a Fund is likely to be greater </span><span>where a large portion of a Fund’s underlying securities and/or other assets trade on that closed foreign market or when the </span><span>foreign market is closed for unscheduled reasons. These deviations may result in premiums or discounts to a Fund’s NAV </span><span>that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</span></div> <div><span>Operational Risk.</span><span>  </span><span>BFA and a Fund's other service providers may experience disruptions or operating errors such as </span><span>processing errors or human errors, inadequate or failed internal or external processes, or systems or technology failures, that </span><span>could negatively impact the Funds. While service providers are required to have appropriate operational risk management </span><span>policies and procedures, their methods of operational risk management may differ from a Fund’s in the setting of priorities, </span><span>the personnel and resources available or the effectiveness of relevant controls. BFA, through its monitoring and oversight of </span><span>service providers, seeks to ensure that service providers take appropriate precautions to avoid and mitigate risks that could </span><span>lead to disruptions and operating errors. However, it is not possible for BFA or the other Fund service providers to identify all </span><span>of the operational risks that may affect a Fund or to develop processes and controls to completely eliminate or mitigate their </span><span>occurrence or effects.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Derivatives.</span><span>  </span><span>A derivative is a financial contract, the value of which depends on, or is derived from, the value of an </span><span>underlying asset, such as a security, a commodity (such as gold or silver), a currency or an index (a measure of value or rates, </span><span>such as the S&amp;P 500</span><span>®</span><span> or the prime lending rate). A Fund may invest in futures contracts, securities options, CFDs (for the </span><span>iShares Core S&amp;P Mid-Cap ETF, iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF, iShares ESG Screened S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF, iShares S&amp;P Mid-Cap</span><span> 400 Growth ETF, iShares S&amp;P Mid-Cap 400 Value ETF, iShares S&amp;P Small-Cap 600 Growth ETF, iShares S&amp;P Small-Cap </span><span>600 Value ETF and iShares U.S. Infrastructure ETF) and other derivatives. Compared to securities, derivatives can be more </span><span>sensitive to changes in interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in market prices and thus a Fund’s losses may be greater if it </span><span>invests in derivatives than if it invests only in conventional securities. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which </span><span>is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligations. Derivatives generally involve the </span><span>incurrence of leverage.</span></div> <div><span>When a derivative is used as a hedge against a position that a Fund holds or is committed to purchase, any loss generated by </span><span>the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can </span><span>reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains, and in some cases, hedging can cause losses that are not </span><span>offset by gains, and the Fund will recognize losses on both the investment and the hedge. Hedges are sometimes subject to </span><span>imperfect matching between the derivative and the underlying security, and there can be no assurance that a Fund's hedging </span><span>transactions, which entail additional transaction costs, will be effective.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>13</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Equity Securities.</span><span>  </span><span>An investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding of the risks inherent in an </span><span>investment in equity securities, including the risk that the financial condition of issuers may become impaired or that the </span><span>general condition of stock markets may deteriorate (either of which may cause a decrease in the value of the portfolio </span><span>securities and thus in the value of shares of the Fund). Common stocks are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations </span><span>and to increases and decreases in value as market confidence and perceptions of their issuers change. These investor </span><span>perceptions are based on various and unpredictable factors, including expectations regarding government, economic, </span><span>monetary and fiscal policies, inflation and interest rates, economic expansion or contraction, and global or regional political, </span><span>economic or banking crises. Common stocks may experience extreme price volatility due to actions taken by particular </span><span>investors or groups of investors (for example, retail investors influenced by social media activity or other media coverage or </span><span>significant </span><span>“</span><span>short</span><span>”</span><span> positions taken by institutional investors).</span></div> <div><span>Holders of common stocks incur more risks than holders of preferred stocks and debt obligations because common </span><span>stockholders generally have rights to receive payments from stock issuers that are inferior to the rights of creditors, or </span><span>holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks. Further, unlike debt securities, which typically have a stated principal amount </span><span>payable at maturity (the value of which, however, is subject to market fluctuations prior to maturity), or preferred stocks, </span><span>which typically have a liquidation preference and which may have stated optional or mandatory redemption provisions, </span><span>common stocks have neither a fixed principal amount nor a maturity date. In addition, issuers may, in times of distress or at </span><span>their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock price to decline.</span></div> <div><span>The iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF invests a significant portion of its assets in preferred stock, although all of </span><span>the Funds may invest in preferred stock. A Fund that invests in preferred stock may be exposed to certain risks not typically </span><span>encountered by investing in common stock. Many preferred stocks pay dividends at a fixed rate, therefore, a preferred stock’s </span><span>market price may be sensitive to changes in interest rates in a manner similar to bonds — that is, as interest rates rise, the </span><span>value of the preferred stock is likely to decline. Many preferred stocks also allow holders to convert the preferred stock into </span><span>common stock of the issuer; the market price of such preferred stocks may be sensitive to changes in the value of the </span><span>issuer’s common stock. In addition, the ability of an issuer of preferred stock to pay dividends may deteriorate or the issuer </span><span>may default (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, fail to make scheduled dividend payments on the preferred stock or scheduled interest payments on other </span><span>obligations of the issuer), which would negatively affect the value of any such holding. Dividend payments on a preferred </span><span>stock typically must be declared by the issuer’s board of directors. An issuer’s board of directors is generally not under any </span><span>obligation to pay a dividend (even if such dividends have accrued), and may suspend payment of dividends on preferred </span><span>stock at any time. Preferred stock is also subject to market volatility and the price of preferred stock will fluctuate based on </span><span>market demand. Preferred stock often has a call feature which allows the issuer to redeem the security at its discretion. </span><span>Therefore, preferred stocks having a higher than average yield may be called by the issuer, which may cause a decrease in the </span><span>yield of a Fund that invested in the preferred stock.</span></div> <div><span>Although most of the securities in each Underlying Index are listed on a securities exchange, the principal trading market for </span><span>some of the securities may be in the OTC market. The existence of a liquid trading market for certain securities may depend </span><span>on whether dealers will make a market in such securities. There can be no assurance that a market will be made or </span><span>maintained or that any such market will be or remain liquid. The price at which securities may be sold and the value of a </span><span>Fund’s shares will be adversely affected if trading markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities are limited or absent, or if </span><span>bid/ask spreads are wide.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Futures and Options on Futures Transactions.</span><span>  </span><span>There are several risks accompanying the utilization of futures </span><span>contracts and options on futures contracts. A position in futures contracts and options on futures contracts may be closed </span><span>only on the exchange on which the contract was made (or a linked exchange). While each Fund plans to utilize futures </span><span>contracts only if an active market exists for such contracts, there is no guarantee that a liquid market will exist for the </span><span>contract at a specified time. Futures contracts, by definition, project price levels in the future and not current levels of </span><span>valuation; therefore, market circumstances may result in a discrepancy between the price of the future and the movement in </span><span>a Fund's Underlying Index. In the event of adverse price movements, a Fund would continue to be required to make daily </span><span>cash payments to maintain its required margin. In such situations, if a Fund has insufficient cash, it may have to sell portfolio </span><span>securities to meet daily margin requirements at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. In addition, a Fund may be </span><span>required to deliver the instruments underlying the futures contracts it has sold.</span></div> <div><span>The risk of loss in trading futures contracts or uncovered call options in some strategies (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, selling uncovered stock index </span><span>futures contracts) is potentially unlimited. The Funds do not plan to use futures and options contracts in this way. The risk of </span><span>a futures position may still be large as traditionally measured due to the low margin deposits required. In many cases, a </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>relatively small price movement in a futures contract may result in immediate and substantial loss or gain to the investor </span><span>relative to the size of a required margin deposit. The Funds, however, intend to utilize futures and options contracts in a </span><span>manner designed to limit their risk exposure to levels comparable to a direct investment in the types of stocks in which they </span><span>invest.</span></div> <div><span>Utilization of futures and options on futures by a Fund involves the risk of imperfect or even negative correlation to its </span><span>Underlying Index if the index underlying the futures contract differs from the Underlying Index. There is also the risk of loss of </span><span>margin deposits in the event of bankruptcy of a broker with whom a Fund has an open position in the futures contract or </span><span>option. The purchase of put or call options will be based upon predictions by BFA as to anticipated trends, which predictions </span><span>could prove to be incorrect.</span></div> <div><span>Because the futures market generally imposes less burdensome margin requirements than the securities market, an </span><span>increased amount of participation by speculators in the futures market could result in price fluctuations. Certain financial </span><span>futures exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures contract prices during a single trading day. The daily </span><span>limit establishes the maximum amount by which the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the </span><span>previous day’s settlement price at the end of a trading session. Once the daily limit has been reached in a particular type of </span><span>contract, no trades may be made on that day at a price beyond that limit. It is possible that futures contract prices could </span><span>move to the daily limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading, thereby preventing prompt liquidation of </span><span>futures positions and subjecting each Fund to substantial losses. In the event of adverse price movements, each Fund would </span><span>be required to make daily cash payments of variation margin.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Non-U.S. Equity Securities. </span><span> </span><span>An investment in any of the Funds that invest, directly or indirectly, in non-U.S.</span><span> equity securities involves risks similar to those of investing in portfolios of equity securities traded on non-U.S. </span><span>exchanges. These risks include market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic and political developments in those </span><span>foreign countries, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in stock prices. Investing in securities issued by issuers </span><span>domiciled in countries other than the domicile of the investor and denominated in currencies other than an investor’s local </span><span>currency entails certain considerations and risks not typically encountered by the investor in making investments in its home </span><span>country and in that country’s currency. These considerations include favorable or unfavorable changes in interest rates, </span><span>currency exchange rates, exchange control regulations and the costs that may be incurred in connection with conversions </span><span>between various currencies. Investing in any of these Funds also involves certain risks and considerations not typically </span><span>associated with investing in a fund whose portfolio contains exclusively securities of U.S. issuers. These risks include </span><span>generally less liquid and less efficient securities markets; generally greater price volatility; less publicly available information </span><span>about issuers; the imposition of withholding or other taxes; the imposition of restrictions on the expatriation of funds or </span><span>other assets of the Funds; higher transaction and custody costs; delays and risks attendant in settlement procedures; </span><span>difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations; lower liquidity and significantly smaller market capitalization; different </span><span>accounting and disclosure standards; lower levels of regulation of the securities markets; more substantial government </span><span>interference with the economy and businesses; higher rates of inflation; greater social, economic, and political uncertainty; </span><span>the risk of nationalization or expropriation of assets; and the risk of war.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Mid-Capitalization Companies.</span><span>  </span><span>Stock prices of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile than </span><span>those of large-capitalization companies, and, therefore, a Fund’s share price may be more volatile than that of funds that </span><span>invest a larger percentage of their assets in stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of mid-capitalization </span><span>companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business or economic </span><span>developments, and the stocks of mid-capitalization companies may be less liquid than those of large-capitalization </span><span>companies, making it more difficult for the Funds to buy and sell shares of mid-capitalization companies. In addition, mid-capitalization</span><span> companies generally have less diverse product lines than large-capitalization companies and are more </span><span>susceptible to adverse developments related to their products.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Non-U.S. Preferred Stock. </span><span> </span><span>A Fund that invests in preferred stock may be exposed to certain risks not typically </span><span>encountered by investing in common stock. Many preferred stocks pay dividends at a fixed rate, therefore, a preferred stock’s </span><span>market price may be sensitive to changes in interest rates in a manner similar to bonds — that is, as interest rates rise, the </span><span>value of the preferred stock is likely to decline. Many preferred stocks also allow holders to convert the preferred stock into </span><span>common stock of the issuer; the market price of such preferred stocks can be sensitive to changes in the value of the issuer’s </span><span>common stock. In addition, the ability of an issuer of preferred stock to pay dividends may deteriorate or the issuer may </span><span>default (</span><span>i.e</span><span>., fail to make scheduled dividend payments on the preferred stock or scheduled interest payments on other </span><span>obligations of the issuer), which would negatively affect the value of any such holding. Dividend payments on a preferred </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>15</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>stock typically must be declared by the issuer’s board of directors. An issuer’s board of directors is generally not under any </span><span>obligation to pay a dividend (even if such dividends have accrued), and may suspend payment of dividends on preferred </span><span>stock at any time. Preferred stock is also subject to market volatility and the price of preferred stock will fluctuate based on </span><span>market demand. Preferred stock often has a call feature which allows the issuer to redeem the security at its discretion. </span><span>Therefore, preferred stocks having a higher than average yield may be called by the issuer, which may cause a decrease in the </span><span>yield of a fund that invested in the preferred stock. Also, non U.S. preferred stock may have different rights or privileges than </span><span>those commonly associated with U.S. preferred stock. In addition to the risks listed above, investors in non U.S. preferred </span><span>stock may experience difficulty or uncertainty in determining and enforcing their rights related to preferred stock.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Swap Agreements.</span><span>  </span><span>The risk of loss with respect to swaps is generally limited to the net amount of payments that a </span><span>Fund is contractually obligated to make. Swap agreements are subject to the risk that the swap counterparty will default on </span><span>its obligations</span><span> </span><span>to pay a Fund and the risk that a Fund will not be able to meet its obligations to pay the other party to the </span><span>agreement. If such a default occurs, the parties will have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the </span><span>transaction. However, such remedies may be subject to bankruptcy and insolvency laws, which could affect such Fund’s </span><span>rights as a creditor (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, a Fund may not receive the net amount of payments that it is contractually entitled to receive). Swap </span><span>agreements may also involve the risk that there is an imperfect correlation between the return on the Fund’s obligation to its </span><span>counterparty and the return on the referenced asset. In addition, swap agreements are subject to market and liquidity risk, </span><span>leverage risk and hedging risk.</span></div> <div><span>A Fund is required to post and collect variation margin and initial margin (comprised of specified liquid securities subject to </span><span>haircuts) in connection with trading of OTC swaps. These requirements may raise the costs for a Fund’s investment in swaps.</span></div> <div><span>Tracking Error Risk.</span><span>  </span><span>A Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of a Fund’s performance from that of </span><span>the applicable underlying index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities and other </span><span>instruments held in a Fund’s portfolio and those included in its applicable underlying index, pricing differences, transaction </span><span>costs incurred by a Fund, a Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of </span><span>dividends or interest received by a Fund or distributions paid to a Fund’s shareholders, the requirements to maintain pass-through</span><span> tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, </span><span>acceptance of custom baskets, changes to the applicable underlying index or the costs to a Fund of complying with various </span><span>new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other </span><span>unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because a Fund incurs fees and expenses, while its applicable </span><span>underlying index does not. Tracking error may occur due to differences between the methodologies used in calculating the </span><span>value of the applicable Underlying Index and determining a Fund’s NAV.</span></div> <div><span>When an issuer is introduced by an index provider into an index tracked by a Fund, BFA may conduct an analysis on such </span><span>issuer’s securities to identify and screen for outlier high risk behavior (such as rapid or unusual price growth that does not </span><span>appear to be supported by publicly available information on the business and assets of the issuer, unusual or significant short </span><span>interest or lending activity, negative sentiment, suspended trading or incorrect free-float calculations, which could be </span><span>indicators of possible irregularities, miscalculations or even fraud). If it identifies such behavior, BFA may, where appropriate, </span><span>alert the index provider as to the alleged issue. The index provider has sole discretion for the determination as to whether to </span><span>continue to include the issuer’s securities in the rebalancing of its index. If the securities continue to be included in the index, </span><span>BFA may underweight or exclude such securities from a Fund’s portfolio and, if it does so, such a fund will be subject to </span><span>increased tracking error due to the divergence in the securities included in its portfolio from its underlying index. BFA’s </span><span>underweighting or excluding such securities may result in a decline in a Fund’s net asset value. The application of the </span><span>abovementioned analysis and screening to a Fund and its Underlying Index is in the sole discretion of BFA and its affiliates </span><span>(without any guarantees). The analysis and screening may not exclude any or all high risk securities from an Underlying </span><span>Index or a Fund’s portfolio, and the inclusion of such securities will result in an adverse impact to a Fund’s net asset value if </span><span>one or more such securities declines in value.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Asia.</span><span>  </span><span> Investments in securities of issuers in certain Asian countries involve risks not typically associated </span><span>with investments in securities of issuers in other regions. Such heightened risks</span><span> </span><span>include, among others, expropriation and/or </span><span>nationalization of assets, confiscatory taxation, piracy of intellectual property, data and other security breaches (especially of </span><span>data stored electronically), political instability, including authoritarian and/or military involvement in governmental decision-making,</span><span> armed conflict and social instability as a result of religious, ethnic and/or socio-economic unrest. Certain Asian </span><span>economies have experienced rapid rates of economic growth and industrialization in recent years, and there is no assurance </span><span>that these rates of economic growth and industrialization will be maintained.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>16</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Certain Asian countries have democracies with relatively short histories, which may increase the risk of political instability. </span><span>These countries have faced political and military unrest, and further unrest could present a risk to their local economies and </span><span>securities markets. Indonesia and the Philippines have each experienced violence and terrorism, which has negatively </span><span>impacted their economies. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial military capabilities, and historical tensions </span><span>between the two countries present the risk of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of </span><span>hostilities between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on </span><span>the entire Asian region. Certain Asian countries have also developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if </span><span>these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. Political, religious, and </span><span>border disputes persist in India. India has recently experienced and may continue to experience civil unrest and hostilities </span><span>with certain of its neighboring countries. Increased political and social unrest in these geographic areas could adversely affect </span><span>the performance of investments in this region.</span></div> <div><span>Certain governments in this region administer prices on several basic goods, including fuel and electricity, within their </span><span>respective countries. Certain governments may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector in their </span><span>respective countries and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on </span><span>the economic conditions in this region, which in turn could have a negative impact on private sector companies. There is also </span><span>the possibility of diplomatic developments adversely affecting investments in the region.</span></div> <div><span>Corruption and the perceived lack of a rule of law in dealings with international companies in certain Asian countries may </span><span>discourage foreign investment and could negatively impact the long-term growth of certain economies in this region. In </span><span>addition, certain countries in the region are experiencing high unemployment and corruption, and have fragile banking </span><span>sectors.</span></div> <div><span>Some economies in this region are dependent on a range of commodities, including oil, natural gas and coal. Accordingly, </span><span>they are strongly affected by international commodity prices and particularly vulnerable to any weakening in global demand </span><span>for these products. The market for securities in this region may also be directly influenced by the flow of international capital, </span><span>and by the economic and market conditions of neighboring countries. China is a key trading partner of many Asian countries </span><span>and any changes in trading relationships between China and other Asian countries may affect the region as a whole. Adverse </span><span>economic conditions or developments in neighboring countries may increase investors' perception of the risk of investing in </span><span>the region as a whole, which may adversely impact the market value of the securities issued by companies in the region.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Australasia. </span><span> </span><span>The economies of Australasia, which include Australia and New Zealand, are dependent on </span><span>exports from the agricultural and mining sectors. This makes Australasian economies susceptible to fluctuations in the </span><span>commodity markets. Australasian economies are also increasingly dependent on their growing service industries. Australia </span><span>and New Zealand are located in a part of the world that has historically been prone to natural disasters, such as drought and </span><span>flooding. Any such event in the future could have a significant adverse impact on the economies of Australia and New </span><span>Zealand and affect the value of securities held by a Fund. The economies of Australia and New Zealand are dependent on </span><span>trading with certain key trading partners, including Asia and the U.S. Economic events in the U.S., Asia, or in other key trading </span><span>countries can have a significant economic effect on the Australasian economies. The economies of Australia and New </span><span>Zealand are heavily dependent on the mining sector. Passage of new regulations limiting foreign ownership of companies in </span><span>the mining sector or imposition of new taxes on profits of mining companies may dissuade foreign investment, and as a </span><span>result, have a negative impact on companies to which a Fund has exposure.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Canada. </span><span> </span><span>The U.S. is Canada’s largest trading and investment partner, and the Canadian economy is </span><span>significantly affected by developments in the U.S. economy. Since the implementation of the North American Free Trade </span><span>Agreement (</span><span>“</span><span>NAFTA</span><span>”</span><span>) in 1994 among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, total two-way merchandise trade between the U.S. and </span><span>Canada has more than doubled. Any downturn in U.S. or Mexican economic activity is likely to have an adverse impact on the </span><span>Canadian economy. Political developments, including the implementation of tariffs by the U.S. and the renegotiation of </span><span>NAFTA in the form of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (</span><span>“</span><span>USMCA</span><span>”</span><span>), which replaced NAFTA on or around July 1, </span><span>2020, could have an adverse impact on Canadian securities. The Canadian economy is also dependent upon external trade </span><span>with other key trading partners, specifically China and the United Kingdom</span><span> </span><span>(the </span><span>“</span><span>U.K.</span><span>”</span><span>). As a result, Canada is dependent on </span><span>the economies of these other countries. In addition, Canada is a large supplier of natural resources (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, oil, natural gas and </span><span>agricultural products). As a result, the Canadian economy is sensitive to fluctuations in certain commodity prices.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>17</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. </span><span> </span><span>Many countries with developed markets have recently experienced significant </span><span>economic pressures. These countries generally tend to rely on the services sectors (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, the financial services sector) as the </span><span>primary source of economic growth and may be susceptible to the risks of individual service sectors. For example, companies </span><span>in the financial services sector are subject to governmental regulation and, recently, government intervention, which may </span><span>adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge and amount of capital they must maintain. </span><span>Dislocations in the financial sector and perceived or actual governmental influence over certain financial companies may lead </span><span>to credit rating downgrades and, as a result, impact, among other things, revenue growth for such companies. If financial </span><span>companies experience a prolonged decline in revenue growth, certain developed countries that rely heavily on financial </span><span>companies as an economic driver may experience a correlative slowdown. Concerns have emerged with respect to the </span><span>economic health of certain developed countries. These concerns primarily stem from heavy indebtedness of many developed </span><span>countries and their perceived inability to continue to service high debt loads without simultaneously implementing stringent </span><span>austerity measures. Such concerns have led to tremendous downward pressure on the economies of these countries. As a </span><span>result, it is possible that interest rates on debt of certain developed countries may rise to levels that make it difficult for such </span><span>countries to service such debt. Spending on health care and retirement pensions in most developed countries has risen </span><span>dramatically. Medical innovation, extended life expectancy and higher public expectations are likely to continue the increase </span><span>in health care and pension costs. Any increase in health care and pension costs will likely have a negative impact on the </span><span>economic growth of many developed countries. Certain developed countries rely on imports of certain key items, such as </span><span>crude oil, natural gas, and other commodities. As a result, an increase in demand for, or price fluctuations of, certain </span><span>commodities may negatively affect developed country economies. Developed market countries generally are dependent on </span><span>the economies of certain key trading partners. Changes in any one economy may cause an adverse impact on several </span><span>developed countries. In addition, heavy regulation of, among others, labor and product markets may have an adverse effect </span><span>on certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause prolonged periods of recession. Such </span><span>risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of a Fund’s investments.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets. </span><span> </span><span>Investments in emerging market countries may be subject to greater risks than </span><span>investments in developed countries. These risks include: (i) less social, political, and economic stability; (ii) greater illiquidity </span><span>and price volatility due to smaller or limited local capital markets for such securities, or low or non-existent trading volumes; </span><span>(iii) companies, custodians, clearinghouses, foreign exchanges and broker-dealers may be subject to less scrutiny and </span><span>regulation by local authorities; (iv) local governments may decide to seize or confiscate securities held by foreign investors </span><span>and/or local governments may decide to suspend or limit an issuer's ability to make dividend or interest payments; (v) local </span><span>governments may limit or entirely restrict repatriation of invested capital, profits, and dividends; (vi) capital gains may be </span><span>subject to local taxation, including on a retroactive basis; (vii) issuers facing restrictions on standard payments imposed by </span><span>local governments may attempt to make dividend or interest payments to foreign investors in the local currency; (viii) there </span><span>may be significant obstacles to obtaining information necessary for investigations into or litigation against companies and </span><span>investors may experience difficulty in enforcing legal claims related to the securities and/or local judges may favor the </span><span>interests of the issuer over those of foreign parties; (ix) bankruptcy judgments may only be permitted to be paid in the local </span><span>currency; (x) limited public information regarding the issuer may result in greater difficulty in determining market valuations </span><span>of the securities; and (xi) lack of financial reporting on a regular basis, substandard disclosure and differences in accounting </span><span>standards may make it difficult to ascertain the financial health of an issuer. The Funds are not actively managed and do not </span><span>select investments based on investor protection considerations.</span></div> <div><span>Emerging market securities markets are typically marked by a high concentration of market capitalization and trading volume </span><span>in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries, as well as a high concentration of ownership of </span><span>such securities by a limited number of investors. In addition, brokerage and other costs associated with transactions in </span><span>emerging market securities can be higher, sometimes significantly, than similar costs incurred in securities markets in </span><span>developed countries. Although some emerging markets have become more established and tend to issue securities of higher </span><span>credit quality, the markets for securities in other emerging market countries are in the earliest stages of their development, </span><span>and these countries issue securities across the credit spectrum. Even the markets for relatively widely traded securities in </span><span>emerging market countries may not be able to absorb, without price disruptions, a significant increase in trading volume or </span><span>trades of a size customarily undertaken by institutional investors in the securities markets of developed countries. The limited </span><span>size of many of these securities markets can cause prices to be erratic for reasons apart from factors that affect the </span><span>soundness and competitiveness of the securities issuers. For example, prices may be unduly influenced by traders who </span><span>control large positions in these markets. Additionally, market making and arbitrage activities are generally less extensive in </span><span>such markets, which may contribute to increased volatility and reduced liquidity of such markets. The limited liquidity of </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>18</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>emerging market country securities may also affect a Fund's ability to accurately value its portfolio securities or to acquire or </span><span>dispose of securities at the price and time it wishes to do so or in order to meet redemption requests.</span></div> <div><span>Many emerging market countries suffer from uncertainty and corruption in their legal frameworks. Legislation may be </span><span>difficult to interpret and laws may be too new to provide any precedential value. Laws regarding foreign investment and </span><span>private property may be weak or non-existent. Sudden changes in governments may result in policies which are less </span><span>favorable to investors such as policies designed to expropriate or nationalize </span><span>“</span><span>sovereign</span><span>”</span><span> assets. Certain emerging market </span><span>countries in the past have expropriated large amounts of private property, in many cases with little or no compensation, and </span><span>there can be no assurance that such expropriation will not occur in the future.</span></div> <div><span>Investment in the securities markets of certain emerging market countries is restricted or controlled to varying degrees. </span><span>These restrictions may limit a Fund's investment in certain emerging market countries and may increase the expenses of the </span><span>Fund. Certain emerging market countries require governmental approval prior to investments by foreign persons or limit </span><span>investment by foreign persons to only a specified percentage of an issuer's outstanding securities or a specific class of </span><span>securities which may have less advantageous terms (including price) than securities of the company available for purchase </span><span>by nationals.</span></div> <div><span>Many emerging market countries lack the social, political, and economic stability characteristic of the U.S. Political instability </span><span>among emerging market countries can be common and may be caused by an uneven distribution of wealth, social unrest, </span><span>labor strikes, civil wars, and religious oppression. Economic instability in emerging market countries may take the form of: (i) </span><span>high interest rates; (ii) high levels of inflation, including hyperinflation; (iii) high levels of unemployment or </span><span>underemployment; (iv) changes in government economic and tax policies, including confiscatory taxation; and (v) </span><span>imposition of trade barriers.</span></div> <div><span>A Fund's income and, in some cases, capital gains from foreign securities will be subject to applicable taxation in certain of </span><span>the emerging market countries in which it invests, and treaties between the U.S. and such countries may not be available in </span><span>some cases to reduce the otherwise applicable tax rates.</span></div> <div><span>Emerging markets also have different clearance and settlement procedures, and in certain of these emerging markets there </span><span>have been times when settlements have been unable to keep pace with the volume of securities transactions, making it </span><span>difficult to conduct such transactions.</span></div> <div><span>In the past, certain governments in emerging market countries have become overly reliant on the international capital </span><span>markets and other forms of foreign credit to finance large public spending programs, which in the past have caused huge </span><span>budget deficits. Often, interest payments have become too overwhelming for a government to meet, representing a large </span><span>percentage of total GDP. These foreign obligations have become the subject of political debate and served as fuel for political </span><span>parties of the opposition, which pressure the government not to make payments to foreign creditors, but instead to use these </span><span>funds for, among other things, social programs. Either due to an inability to pay or submission to political pressure, foreign </span><span>governments have been forced to seek a restructuring of their loan and/or bond obligations, have declared a temporary </span><span>suspension of interest payments or have defaulted. These events have adversely affected the values of securities issued by </span><span>foreign governments and corporations domiciled in those countries and have negatively affected not only their cost of </span><span>borrowing, but their ability to borrow in the future as well.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Europe. </span><span> </span><span>Investing in European countries may expose a Fund to the economic and political risks </span><span>associated with Europe in general and the specific European countries in which it invests. The economies and markets of </span><span>European countries are often closely connected and interdependent, and events in one European country can have an </span><span>adverse impact on other European countries. A Fund makes investments in securities of issuers that are domiciled in, have </span><span>significant operations in, or that are listed on at least one securities exchange within member states of the European Union </span><span>(the </span><span>“</span><span>EU</span><span>”</span><span>). A number of countries within the EU are also members of the Economic and Monetary Union (the </span><span>“</span><span>eurozone</span><span>”</span><span>) </span><span>and have adopted the euro as their currency. Eurozone membership requires member states to comply with restrictions on </span><span>inflation rates, deficits, interest rates, debt levels and fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect </span><span>every country in Europe. Changes in import or export tariffs, changes in governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in </span><span>the exchange rate of the euro and other currencies of certain EU countries which are not in the eurozone, the default or </span><span>threat of default by an EU member state on its sovereign debt, and/or an economic recession in an EU member state may </span><span>have a significant adverse effect on the economies of other EU member states and their trading partners. Although certain </span><span>European countries are not in the eurozone, many of these countries are obliged to meet the criteria for joining the eurozone.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>19</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Consequently, these countries must comply with many of the restrictions noted above. The European financial markets have </span><span>experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns, government debt levels and the </span><span>possible default of government debt in several European countries, including, but not limited to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, </span><span>France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. In order to prevent further economic deterioration, certain </span><span>countries, without prior warning, can institute </span><span>“</span><span>capital controls.</span><span>”</span><span> Countries may use these controls to restrict volatile </span><span>movements of capital entering and exiting their country. Such controls may negatively affect a Fund’s investments. A default </span><span>or debt restructuring by any European country would adversely impact holders of that country’s debt and sellers of credit </span><span>default swaps linked to that country’s creditworthiness, which may be located in countries other than those listed above. In </span><span>addition, the credit ratings of certain European countries were downgraded in the past. These events have adversely affected </span><span>the value and exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect the economies of every country in Europe, </span><span>including countries that do not use the euro and non-EU member states. Responses to the financial problems by European </span><span>governments, central banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may </span><span>result in social unrest and may limit future growth and economic recovery or have other unintended consequences. Further </span><span>defaults or restructurings by governments and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on </span><span>economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more countries may abandon the </span><span>euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The impact of these actions, especially if they occur in a disorderly fashion, is not clear </span><span>but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely impact the value of a Fund’s investments in the region.</span></div> <div><span>The U.K. left the EU (</span><span>“</span><span>Brexit</span><span>”</span><span>) on January 31, 2020. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, </span><span>economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and </span><span>financial markets.</span></div> <div><span>Certain European countries have also developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were </span><span>to worsen, they could adversely affect European issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The national politics of countries in </span><span>Europe have been unpredictable and subject to influence by disruptive political groups and ideologies, including for example, </span><span>secessionist movements. The governments of European countries may be subject to change and such countries may </span><span>experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments may result in sudden and </span><span>significant investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe or war in the region also could impact </span><span>financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching</span><span> </span><span>and could adversely affect </span><span>the value and liquidity of a Fund's investments.</span></div> <div><span>Russian Invasion of Ukraine</span><span>. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The extent and duration </span><span>of the military action, resulting sanctions and resulting future market disruptions, including declines in its stock markets and </span><span>the value of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but could be significant. Disruptions caused by Russian </span><span>military action or other actions (including cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting actual and threatened responses to such </span><span>activity, including purchasing and financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer or purchaser preferences, </span><span>sanctions, import and export restrictions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Russian government, Russian companies or Russian </span><span>individuals, including politicians, may impact Russia's economy, Russian issuers of securities in which a Fund invests, or the </span><span>economies of Europe as a whole. Actual and threatened responses to Russian military action may also impact the markets for </span><span>certain Russian commodities, such as oil and natural gas, as well as other sectors of the Russian economy, and are likely to </span><span>have collateral impacts on such sectors across Europe and globally.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Japan. </span><span> </span><span>Japan may be subject to political, economic, labor and other risks. Any of these risks, individually </span><span>or in the aggregate, can impact an investment made in Japan.</span> <br/><span> </span></div> <div><span>Currency Risk</span><span>. The Japanese yen has fluctuated widely at times and any increase in its value may cause a decline in exports </span><span>that could weaken the Japanese economy. Japan has, in the past, intervened in the currency markets to attempt to maintain </span><span>or reduce the value of the yen. Japanese intervention in the currency markets could cause the value of the yen to fluctuate </span><span>sharply and unpredictably and could cause losses to investors.</span> <br/><span> </span></div> <div><span>Economic Risk</span><span>. The growth of Japan’s economy has recently lagged that of its Asian neighbors and other major developed </span><span>economies. Since 2000, Japan’s economic growth rate has generally remained low relative to other advanced economies, and </span><span>it may remain low in the future. The Japanese economy is heavily dependent on international trade and has been adversely </span><span>affected by trade tariffs, other protectionist measures, competition from emerging economies and the economic conditions </span><span>of its trading partners. Japan is also heavily dependent on oil imports, and higher commodity prices could therefore have a </span><span>negative impact on the Japanese economy.</span> <br/><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>20</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Geographic Risk</span><span>. Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, typhoons and tsunamis, could occur in Japan or </span><span>surrounding areas and could negatively affect the Japanese economy, and, in turn, could negatively affect a Fund.</span> <br/><span> </span></div> <div><span>Labor Risk</span><span>. Japan has an aging workforce and has experienced a significant population decline in recent years. Japan’s labor </span><span>market appears to be undergoing fundamental structural changes, as a labor market traditionally accustomed to lifetime </span><span>employment adjusts to meet the need for increased labor mobility, which may adversely affect Japan’s economic </span><span>competitiveness.</span> <br/></div> <div><span>Large Government and Corporate Debt Risk</span><span>. The Japanese economy faces several concerns, including a financial system with </span><span>large levels of nonperforming loans, over-leveraged corporate balance sheets, extensive cross-ownership by major </span><span>corporations, a changing corporate governance structure, and large government deficits. These issues may cause a </span><span>slowdown of the Japanese economy.</span> <br/><span> </span></div> <div><span>Political Risk</span><span>. Historically, Japan has had unpredictable national politics and may experience frequent political turnover. Future </span><span>political developments may lead to changes in policy that might adversely affect a Fund’s investments. In addition, China has </span><span>become an important trading partner with Japan. Japan’s political relationship with China, however, has been strained. Should </span><span>political tension increase, it could adversely affect the Japanese economy and destabilize the region as a whole.</span> <br/><span> </span></div> <div><span>Security Risk.</span><span> Japan's relations with its neighbors, particularly China, North Korea, South Korea and Russia, have at times been </span><span>strained due to territorial disputes, historical animosities and defense concerns. Most recently, the Japanese government has </span><span>shown concern over the increased nuclear and military activity by North Korea and China. Strained relations may cause </span><span>uncertainty in the Japanese markets and adversely affect the overall Japanese economy, particularly in times of crisis.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in North America. </span><span> </span><span>A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations or an economic recession </span><span>in any North American country can have a significant economic effect on the entire North American region and on some or </span><span>all of the North American countries in which a Fund invests. </span></div> <div><span>The U.S. is Canada's and Mexico's largest trading and investment partner. The Canadian and Mexican economies are </span><span>significantly affected by developments in the U.S. economy. Since the implementation of NAFTA in 1994 among Canada, the </span><span>U.S. and Mexico, total merchandise trade among the three countries has increased. However, political developments </span><span>including the implementation of tariffs by the U.S., and the renegotiation of NAFTA in the form of the United States-Mexico-Canada</span><span> Agreement (</span><span>“</span><span>USMCA</span><span>”</span><span>), which replaced NAFTA on July 1, 2020, could negatively affect North America’s economic </span><span>outlook and, as a result, the value of securities held by a Fund. Policy and legislative changes in one country may have a </span><span>significant effect on North American markets generally, as well as on the value of certain securities held by a Fund. </span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the United Kingdom.</span><span>  </span><span>Investment in U.K. issuers may subject a Fund to regulatory, political, currency, </span><span>security, and economic risks specific to the U.K. The U.K. economy relies heavily on the export of financial services to the U.S. </span><span>and other European countries. A prolonged slowdown in the financial services sector may have a negative impact on the </span><span>U.K.’s economy. In the past, the U.K. has been a target of terrorism. Acts of terrorism in the U.K. or against U.K. interests </span><span>abroad may cause uncertainty in the U.K. financial markets</span><span> </span><span>and adversely affect the performance of the issuers to which a </span><span>Fund has exposure. Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain and the independence movement in </span><span>Scotland, may have an adverse effect on the U.K. economy.</span></div> <div><span>On January 31, 2020, the U.K. officially left the EU (Brexit), subject to a transitional period that ended December 31, 2020. The </span><span>U.K. and EU have reached an agreement on the terms of their future trading relationship effective January 1, 2021, which </span><span>principally relates to the trading of goods rather than services, including financial services. Further discussions are to be held </span><span>between the U.K. and the EU in relation to matters not covered by the trade agreement, such as financial services. A Fund will </span><span>face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and consequences that may follow Brexit, including with respect to </span><span>volatility in exchange rates and interest rates. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, </span><span>economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and </span><span>financial markets. Brexit has also led to legal uncertainty and could lead to politically divergent national laws and regulations </span><span>as a new relationship between the U.K. and EU is defined and the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any </span><span>of these effects of Brexit could adversely affect any of the companies to which a Fund has exposure and any other assets that </span><span>a Fund invests in. The political, economic and legal consequences of Brexit are not yet known. In the short term, financial </span><span>markets may experience heightened volatility, particularly those in the U.K. and Europe, but possibly worldwide. The U.K. and </span><span>Europe may be less stable than they have been in recent years, and investments in the U.K. and the EU may be difficult to </span><span>value or subject to greater or more frequent volatility. In the longer term, there is likely to be a period of significant political, </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>21</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>regulatory and commercial uncertainty as the U.K. continues to negotiate the terms of its future trading relationships. </span><span>Recently, the U.K.'s real estate sector has experienced significant volatility and declines in the value of many real estate </span><span>securities, including real estate funds, real estate investment trusts (</span><span>“</span><span>REITs</span><span>”</span><span>) and real estate holding companies. Increased </span><span>volatility and investor redemption requests in real estate funds may result in the continued decline in the value and liquidity </span><span>of real estate securities, which may impair the ability of a Fund to buy, sell, receive or deliver those securities.</span></div> <div><span>U.S. Economic Trading Partners Risk. </span><span> </span><span>The U.S. is a significant, and in some cases the most significant, trading partner of, or </span><span>foreign investor in, certain countries in which a Fund invests. As a result, economic conditions of such countries may be </span><span>particularly affected by changes in the U.S. economy. A decrease in U.S. imports or exports, new trade and financial </span><span>regulations or tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate or an economic slowdown in the U.S. may have a material </span><span>adverse effect on a country’s economic conditions and, as a result, securities to which a Fund has exposure. Circumstances </span><span>could arise that could prevent the timely payment of interest or principal on U.S. government debt, such as reaching the </span><span>legislative </span><span>“</span><span>debt ceiling.</span><span>”</span><span> Such non-payment would result in substantial negative consequences for the U.S. economy and the </span><span>global financial system.</span></div> <div><span>There are strained relations between the U.S. and a number of foreign countries, including traditional allies, such as certain </span><span>European countries, and historical adversaries, such as North Korea, Iran, China and Russia. If these relations were to worsen, </span><span>it could adversely affect U.S. issuers as well as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also experienced </span><span>increased internal unrest and discord. If these trends were to continue, it may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy </span><span>and many of the issuers in which a Fund invests.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Aerospace and Defense Industry. </span><span> </span><span>The aerospace and defense industry can be significantly affected </span><span>by government defense and aerospace regulation and spending policies. The aerospace industry in particular has recently </span><span>been affected by adverse economic conditions and consolidation within the industry.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Basic Materials Industry. </span><span> </span><span>Issuers in the basic materials industry could be adversely affected by </span><span>commodity price volatility, exchange rate fluctuations, social and political unrest, import controls and increased competition. </span><span>Companies in the basic materials industry may be subject to swift fluctuations in supply and demand. Fluctuations may be </span><span>caused by events relating to political and economic developments, the environmental impact of basic materials operations, </span><span>and the success of exploration projects. Production of industrial materials often exceeds demand as a result of over-building </span><span>or economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns. Issuers in the basic materials industry are at risk for </span><span>environmental damage and product liability claims and may be adversely affected by depletion of resources, delays in </span><span>technical progress, labor relations, tax and government regulations related to changes to, among other things, energy and </span><span>environmental policies.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Biotechnology Industry. </span><span> </span><span>Biotechnology companies depend on the successful development of new </span><span>and proprietary technologies. There can be no assurance that the development of new technologies will be successful or that </span><span>intellectual property rights will be obtained with respect to new technologies. The loss or impairment of intellectual property </span><span>rights may adversely affect the profitability of biotechnology companies. In addition, companies in the biotechnology </span><span>industry spend heavily on research and development and their products or services may not prove commercially successful </span><span>or may become obsolete quickly. The risks of high development costs may be exacerbated by the inability to raise prices as a </span><span>result of managed care pressure, government regulation or price controls. Biotechnology companies can suffer persistent </span><span>losses during the transition of new products from development to production or when products are or may be subject to </span><span>regulatory approval processes or regulatory scrutiny and, as a consequence, the earnings of biotechnology companies may </span><span>be erratic. Companies in the biotechnology industry are also exposed to the risk that they will be subject to products liability </span><span>claims. Companies involved in the biotechnology industry may be subject to extensive government regulations by the U.S. </span><span>Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, among </span><span>other foreign and domestic regulators. Such regulation may significantly affect and limit biotechnology research, product </span><span>development and approval of products.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Communication Services Sector. </span><span> </span><span>The communication services sector consists of both companies in </span><span>the telecommunication services industry as well as those in the media and entertainment industry. Examples of companies in </span><span>the telecommunication services industry group include providers of fiber-optic, fixed-line, cellular and wireless </span><span>telecommunications networks. Companies in the media and entertainment industry group encompass a variety of services </span><span>and products including television broadcasting, gaming products, social media, networking platforms, online classifieds, </span><span>online review websites, and Internet search engines. Companies in the communication services sector may be affected by </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>22</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>industry competition, substantial capital requirements, government regulation, and obsolescence of communications </span><span>products and services due to technological advancement. Fluctuating domestic and international demand, shifting </span><span>demographics and often unpredictable changes in consumer tastes can drastically affect a communication services </span><span>company's profitability. In addition, while all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies </span><span>in the communication services sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or consumer </span><span>information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses. </span></div> <div><span>The communication services sector of a country’s economy is often subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of </span><span>complying with governmental regulations, delays or failure to receive required regulatory approvals, or the enactment of new </span><span>regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of communications companies. Government actions around the </span><span>world, specifically in the area of pre-marketing clearance of products and prices, can be arbitrary and unpredictable. The </span><span>communications services industry can also be significantly affected by intense competition for market share, including </span><span>competition with alternative technologies such as wireless communications, product compatibility and standardization, </span><span>consumer preferences, rapid product obsolescence, research and development of new products, lack of standardization or </span><span>compatibility with existing technologies, and a dependency on patent and copyright protections. Companies in the </span><span>communication services sector may encounter distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet </span><span>increasing competition, particularly in developing new products and services using new technology. Technological </span><span>innovations may make the products and services of certain communications companies obsolete.</span></div> <div><span>Telecommunications providers with exposure to the U.S. are generally required to obtain franchises or licenses in order to </span><span>provide services in a given location. Licensing and franchise rights in the telecommunications sector are limited, which may </span><span>provide an advantage to certain participants. Limited availability of such rights, high barriers to market entry and regulatory </span><span>oversight, among other factors, have led to consolidation of companies within the sector, which could lead to further </span><span>regulation or other negative effects in the future. Telecommunication providers investing in non-U.S. countries may be </span><span>subject to similar risks. Additional risks include those related to competitive challenges in the U.S. from non-U.S. competitors </span><span>engaged in strategic joint ventures with U.S. companies and in non-U.S. markets from both U.S. and non-U.S. competitors. </span></div> <div><span>Companies in the media and entertainment industries can be significantly affected by several factors, including competition, </span><span>particularly in formulation of products and services using new technologies, cyclicality of revenues and earnings, a potential </span><span>decrease in the discretionary income of targeted individuals, changing consumer tastes and interests, and the potential </span><span>increase in government regulation. Companies in the media and entertainment industries may become obsolete quickly. </span><span>Advertising spending can be an important revenue source for media and entertainment companies. During economic </span><span>downturns advertising spending typically decreases and, as a result, media and entertainment companies tend to generate </span><span>less revenue.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Discretionary Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies engaged in the design, production or distribution of </span><span>products or services for the consumer discretionary sector (including, without limitation, television and radio broadcasting, </span><span>manufacturing, publishing, recording and musical instruments, motion pictures, photography, amusement and theme parks, </span><span>gaming casinos, sporting goods and sports arenas, camping and recreational equipment, toys and games, apparel, travel-related</span><span> services, automobiles, hotels and motels, and fast food and other restaurants) are subject to the risk that their </span><span>products or services may become obsolete quickly. The success of these companies can depend heavily on disposable </span><span>household income and consumer spending. During periods of an expanding economy, the consumer discretionary sector </span><span>may outperform the consumer staples sector, but may underperform when economic conditions worsen. Moreover, the </span><span>consumer discretionary sector can be significantly affected by several factors, including, without limitation, the performance </span><span>of domestic and international economies, exchange rates, changing consumer preferences, demographics, marketing </span><span>campaigns, cyclical revenue generation, consumer confidence, commodity price volatility, labor relations, interest rates, </span><span>import and export controls, intense competition, technological developments and government regulation.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Staples Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the consumer staples sector may be adversely affected by </span><span>changes in the global economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, and production </span><span>spending. Companies in the consumer staples sector may also be affected by changes in global economic, environmental </span><span>and political events, economic conditions, the depletion of resources, and government regulation. For instance, government </span><span>regulations may affect the permissibility of using various food additives and production methods of companies that make </span><span>food products, which could affect company profitability. In addition, tobacco companies may be adversely affected by the </span><span>adoption of proposed legislation and/or by litigation. Companies in the consumer staples sector also may be subject to risks </span><span>pertaining to the supply of, demand for and prices of raw materials. The prices of raw materials fluctuate in response to a </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>23</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>number of factors, including, without limitation, changes in government agricultural support programs, exchange rates, </span><span>import and export controls, changes in international agricultural and trading policies, and seasonal and weather conditions. </span><span>Companies in the consumer staples sector may be subject to severe competition, which may also have an adverse impact on </span><span>their profitability.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Energy Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the energy sector are strongly affected by the changes in and volatility </span><span>of global energy prices, energy supply and demand, government regulations and policies, energy production and </span><span>conservation efforts, technological change, development of alternative energy sources, and other factors that they cannot </span><span>control. Energy companies may have relatively high levels of debt and may be more likely to restructure their businesses if </span><span>there are downturns in energy markets or in the global economy. If an energy company in a Fund's portfolio becomes </span><span>distressed, a Fund could lose all or a substantial portion of its investment. The energy sector is cyclical and is highly </span><span>dependent on commodity prices. Prices and supplies of energy may fluctuate significantly over short and long periods of </span><span>time due to, among other things, national and international political changes, Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>OPEC</span><span>”</span><span>) policies, changes in relationships among OPEC members and between OPEC and oil-importing nations, the </span><span>regulatory environment, taxation policies, the enactment or cessation of trade sanctions, war or other geopolitical conflicts, </span><span>and the economies of key energy-consuming countries. Companies in the energy sector may be adversely affected by </span><span>terrorism, cyber incidents, natural disasters or other catastrophes. Companies in the energy sector are at risk of liability from </span><span>accidents resulting in injury, loss of life or property, pollution or other environmental damage claims. Significant oil and gas </span><span>deposits are located in emerging markets countries where corruption and security may raise significant risks, in addition to </span><span>the other risks of investing in emerging markets. Additionally, the Middle East, where many companies in the energy sector </span><span>may operate, has experienced conflict and unrest. Companies in the energy sector may also be adversely affected by changes </span><span>in exchange rates, interest rates, economic conditions, tax treatment, government regulation and intervention, negative </span><span>perception, efforts at energy conservation and world events in the regions in which the companies operate (</span><span>e.g</span><span>., </span><span>expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments </span><span>and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest, violence or labor unrest). Because a significant portion of revenues of </span><span>companies in this sector is derived from a relatively small number of customers that are largely composed of governmental </span><span>entities and utilities, governmental budget constraints may have a significant impact on companies in this sector. The energy </span><span>sector is highly regulated. Entities operating in the energy sector are subject to significant regulation of nearly every aspect of </span><span>their operations by governmental agencies. Such regulation can change rapidly or over time in both scope and intensity. </span><span>Stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be enacted, which would likely increase compliance costs and may </span><span>materially adversely affect the financial performance of companies in the energy sector.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The energy sector may experience significant market volatility. For example, Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine on </span><span>February 24, 2022 led to further disruptions and increased volatility in the energy and commodity futures markets due to </span><span>actual and potential disruptions in the supply and demand for certain commodities, including oil and natural gas. The U.S. </span><span>and other actors have enacted various sanctions and restrictions on business dealings with Russia, which include restrictions </span><span>on imports of oil, natural gas and coal. The effect of the current sanctions and restrictions, as well as the extent and duration </span><span>of the Russian military action, additional sanctions and associated market disruptions on the energy sector, are impossible to </span><span>predict and depend on a number of factors. The effect of these events or any related developments could be significant and </span><span>may have a severe adverse effect on the performance of a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Financials Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the financials sector include small, regional and money center </span><span>banks, securities brokerage firms, asset management companies, savings banks and thrift institutions, specialty finance </span><span>companies (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, credit card, mortgage providers), insurance and insurance brokerage firms, consumer finance firms, </span><span>financial conglomerates and foreign banking and financial companies.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Most financial companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which limits their activities and may affect their </span><span>ability to earn a profit from a given line of business. Government regulation may change frequently and may have significant </span><span>adverse consequences for companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by the regulation. Direct </span><span>governmental intervention in the operations of financial companies and financial markets may materially and adversely affect </span><span>the companies in which a Fund invests, including legislation in many countries that may increase government regulation, </span><span>repatriation and other intervention. The impact of governmental intervention and legislative changes on any individual </span><span>financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. The valuation of financial companies has been </span><span>and continues to be subject to unprecedented volatility and may be influenced by unpredictable factors, including interest </span><span>rate risk and sovereign debt default. Certain financial businesses are subject to intense competitive pressures, including </span><span>market share and price competition. Financial companies in foreign countries are subject to market-specific and general </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>24</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>regulatory and interest rate concerns. In particular, government regulation in certain foreign countries may include taxes and </span><span>controls on interest rates, credit availability, minimum capital requirements, bans on short sales, limits on prices and </span><span>restrictions on currency transfers. In addition, companies in the financials sector may be the targets of hacking and potential </span><span>theft of proprietary or customer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their </span><span>businesses.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The profitability of banks, savings and loan associations and other financial companies is largely dependent on the availability </span><span>and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change; for instance, when interest rates go up, </span><span>the value of securities issued by many types of companies in the financials sector generally goes down. In other words, </span><span>financial companies may be adversely affected in certain market cycles, including, without limitation, during periods of rising </span><span>interest rates, which may restrict the availability and increase the cost of capital, and during periods of declining economic </span><span>conditions, which may cause, among other things, credit losses due to financial difficulties of borrowers.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>In addition, general economic conditions are important to the operations of these companies, and financial difficulties of </span><span>borrowers may have an adverse effect on the profitability of financial companies. Companies in the financials sector are </span><span>exposed directly to the credit risk of their borrowers and counterparties, who may be leveraged to an unknown degree, </span><span>including through swaps and other derivatives products, and who at times may be unable to meet their obligations to the </span><span>financial services companies. Financial services companies may have significant exposure to the same borrowers and </span><span>counterparties, with the result that a borrower’s or counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations to one company may affect </span><span>other companies with exposure to the same borrower or counterparty. This interconnectedness of risk, including cross-default</span><span> risk, may result in significant negative impacts to the financial condition and reputation of companies with direct </span><span>exposure to the defaulting counterparty as well as adverse cascading effects in the markets and the financials sector </span><span>generally. Financial companies can be highly dependent upon access to capital markets, and any impediments to such </span><span>access, such as adverse overall economic conditions or a negative perception in the capital markets of a financial company’s </span><span>financial condition or prospects, could adversely affect its business. Deterioration of credit markets can have an adverse </span><span>impact on a broad range of financial markets, causing certain financial companies to incur large losses. In these conditions, </span><span>companies in the financials sector may experience significant declines in the valuation of their assets, take actions to raise </span><span>capital and even cease operations. Some financial companies may also be required to accept or borrow significant amounts </span><span>of capital from government sources and may face future government-imposed restrictions on their businesses or increased </span><span>government intervention. In addition, there is no guarantee that governments will provide any such relief in the future. These </span><span>actions may cause the securities of many companies in the financials sector to decline in value.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Healthcare Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the healthcare sector are often issuers whose profitability may be </span><span>affected by extensive government regulation, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising or </span><span>falling costs of medical products and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, a limited </span><span>number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market developments. Many healthcare </span><span>companies are heavily dependent on patent protection and the actual or perceived safety and efficiency of their products.</span></div> <div><span>Patents have a limited duration, and, upon expiration, other companies may market substantially similar </span><span>“</span><span>generic</span><span>”</span><span> products </span><span>that are typically sold at a lower price than the patented product, which can cause the original developer of the product to </span><span>lose market share and/or reduce the price charged for the product, resulting in lower profits for the original developer. As a </span><span>result, the expiration of patents may adversely affect the profitability of these companies.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>In addition, because the products and services of many companies in the healthcare sector affect the health and well-being </span><span>of many individuals, these companies are especially susceptible to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar </span><span>claims. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may </span><span>result in price discounting. Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The process </span><span>of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, which can result in increased development costs, delayed cost recovery </span><span>and loss of competitive advantage to the extent that rival companies have developed competing products or procedures, </span><span>adversely affecting the company’s revenues and profitability. In other words, delays in the regulatory approval process may </span><span>diminish the opportunity for a company to profit from a new product or to bring a new product to market, which could have </span><span>a material adverse effect on a company’s business. Healthcare companies may also be strongly affected by scientific </span><span>biotechnology or technological developments, and their products may quickly become obsolete. Also, many healthcare </span><span>companies offer products and services that are subject to governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by changes </span><span>in governmental policies or laws. Changes in governmental policies or laws may span a wide range of topics, including cost </span><span>control, national health insurance, incentives for compensation in the provision of healthcare services, tax incentives and </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>25</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>penalties related to healthcare insurance premiums, and promotion of prepaid healthcare plans. In addition, a number of </span><span>legislative proposals concerning healthcare have been considered by the U.S. Congress in recent years. It is unclear what </span><span>proposals will ultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect they may have on companies in the healthcare sector.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Additionally, the expansion of facilities by healthcare-related providers may be subject to </span><span>“</span><span>determinations of need</span><span>”</span><span> by certain </span><span>government authorities. This process not only generally increases the time and costs involved in these expansions, but also </span><span>makes expansion plans uncertain, limiting the revenue and profitability growth potential of healthcare-related facilities </span><span>operators and negatively affecting the prices of their securities. Moreover, in recent years, both local and national </span><span>governmental budgets have come under pressure to reduce spending and control healthcare costs, which could both </span><span>adversely affect regulatory processes and public funding available for healthcare products, services and facilities.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Home Construction Industry. </span><span> </span><span>The home construction industry may be significantly affected by </span><span>changes in government spending, zoning laws, economic conditions, interest rates, commodity prices, consumer confidence </span><span>and spending, taxation, demographic patterns, real estate values, overbuilding, housing starts, and new and existing home </span><span>sales. Rising interest rates, reductions in mortgage availability to consumers, increasing foreclosure rates or increases in the </span><span>costs of owning a home could reduce the market for new homes and adversely affect the profitability of home construction </span><span>companies. Different segments of the home construction industry can be significantly affected by environmental clean-up </span><span>costs and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts. Home construction companies may lack </span><span>diversification, due to ownership of a limited number of properties and concentration in a particular geographic region or </span><span>property type.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Industrials Sector. </span><span> </span><span>The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be </span><span>adversely affected by supply of and demand for both their specific products or services and for industrials sector products in </span><span>general. The products of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and </span><span>frequent new product introduction. Government regulations, trade disputes, world events and economic conditions may </span><span>affect the performance of companies in the industrials sector. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by </span><span>changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors.</span><span> </span><span>Aerospace and defense </span><span>companies, a component of the industrials sector, can be significantly affected by government spending policies because </span><span>companies involved in this industry rely, to a significant extent, on government demand for their products and services. Thus, </span><span>the financial condition of, and investor interest in, aerospace and defense companies are heavily influenced by governmental </span><span>defense spending policies, which are typically under pressure from efforts to control government budgets. Transportation </span><span>stocks, a component of the industrials sector, are cyclical and can be significantly affected by economic changes, fuel prices, </span><span>labor relations and insurance costs. Transportation companies in certain countries may also be subject to significant </span><span>government regulation and oversight, which may adversely affect their businesses. For example, commodity price declines </span><span>and unit volume reductions resulting from an over-supply of materials used in the industrials sector can adversely affect the </span><span>sector. Furthermore, companies in the industrials sector may be subject to liability for environmental damage, product </span><span>liability claims, depletion of resources, and mandated expenditures for safety and pollution control.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Information Technology Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Information technology companies face intense competition, both </span><span>domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Like other technology companies, </span><span>information technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products </span><span>of information technology companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent </span><span>new product introduction, unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. </span><span>Technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technology, especially those of smaller, less-seasoned companies, </span><span>tend to be more volatile than the overall market. Companies in the information technology sector are heavily dependent on </span><span>patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these </span><span>companies. Information technology companies are facing increased government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject </span><span>to adverse government or regulatory action. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, </span><span>certain companies in the information technology sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of </span><span>proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses. </span><span>These risks are heightened for information technology companies in foreign markets.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Infrastructure Industry. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the infrastructure industry may be subject to a variety of </span><span>factors that could adversely affect their business or operations, including high interest costs in connection with capital </span><span>construction programs, high degrees of leverage, costs associated with governmental, environmental and other regulations, </span><span>the effects of economic slowdowns, increased competition from other providers of services, uncertainties concerning costs, </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>26</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>the level of government spending on infrastructure projects, and other factors. Infrastructure companies may be adversely </span><span>affected by commodity price volatility, changes in exchange rates, import controls, depletion of resources, technological </span><span>developments, and labor relations. There is also the risk that corruption may negatively affect publicly funded infrastructure </span><span>projects, especially in emerging markets, resulting in delays and cost overruns. Infrastructure issuers can be significantly </span><span>affected by government spending policies because companies involved in this industry rely to a significant extent on U.S. and </span><span>other government demand for their products.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Infrastructure companies in the oil and gas industry may be adversely affected by government regulation or world events in </span><span>the regions where the companies operate (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the </span><span>imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest, violence or labor </span><span>unrest). Infrastructure companies may have significant capital investments in, or engage in transactions involving, emerging </span><span>market countries, which may heighten these risks.</span></div> <div><span>Operations Risk. </span><span>The failure of an infrastructure company to carry adequate insurance or to operate its assets appropriately </span><span>could lead to significant losses. Infrastructure may be adversely affected by environmental clean-up costs and catastrophic </span><span>events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts.</span></div> <div><span>Customer Risk. </span><span>Infrastructure companies can be dependent upon a narrow customer base. Additionally, if these customers </span><span>fail to pay their obligations, significant revenues could be lost and may not be replaceable.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Regulatory Risk. </span><span>Infrastructure companies may be subject to significant regulation by various governmental authorities and </span><span>also may be affected by regulation of rates charged to customers, service interruption due to environmental, operational or </span><span>other events, the imposition of special tariffs and changes in tax laws, regulatory policies and accounting standards.</span></div> <div><span>Strategic Asset Risk. </span><span>Infrastructure companies may control significant strategic assets (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, major pipelines or highways), </span><span>which are assets that have a national or regional profile, and may have monopolistic characteristics. Given their national or </span><span>regional profile or irreplaceable nature, strategic assets could generate additional risk not common in other industry sectors </span><span>and they may be targeted for terrorist acts or adverse political actions.</span></div> <div><span>Interest Rate Risk. </span><span>Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for infrastructure companies, which could </span><span>negatively impact their ability to meet payment obligations.</span></div> <div><span>Leverage Risk. </span><span>Infrastructure companies can be highly leveraged, which increases investments risk and other risks normally </span><span>associated with debt financing and could adversely affect an infrastructure company's operations and market value in </span><span>periods of rising interest rates.</span></div> <div><span>Inflation Risk. </span><span>Many infrastructure companies may have fixed income streams. Consequently, their market values may decline </span><span>in times of higher inflation. Additionally, the prices that an infrastructure company is able to charge users of its assets may be </span><span>linked to inflation, whether by government regulation, contractual arrangement or other factors. In this case, changes in the </span><span>rate of inflation may affect the company's profitability.</span></div> <div><span>Transportation Risk. </span><span>The stock prices of companies in the transportation industry group are affected by both supply and </span><span>demand for their specific product. Government regulation, world events and economic conditions may affect the </span><span>performance of companies in the transportation industry group.</span></div> <div><span>Oil and Gas Risk.</span><span> The profitability of oil and gas companies is related to worldwide energy prices, exploration, and production </span><span>spending.</span></div> <div><span>Utilities Risk. </span><span>Utilities companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse </span><span>effect on their profit margins. The rates charged by regulated utility companies are subject to review and limitation by </span><span>governmental regulatory commissions.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Insurance Industry. </span><span> </span><span>The insurance industry is subject to extensive government regulation in some </span><span>countries and can be significantly affected by changes in interest rates, general economic conditions, price and marketing </span><span>competition, the imposition of premium rate caps or other changes in government regulation or tax law. Different segments </span><span>of the insurance industry can be significantly affected by changes in mortality and morbidity rates, environmental clean-up </span><span>costs and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>27</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

If not repealed, the continued implementation or </span><span>expansion of the ACA may create increased demand for healthcare products and services but also may have an adverse </span><span>effect on some companies in the life sciences and tools industry. Increased emphasis on managed care in the United States </span><span>may put pressure on the price and usage of products sold by life sciences and tools companies in which the Fund may invest </span><span>and may adversely affect the sales and revenues of these companies. In addition, the restructuring or repeal of the ACA may </span><span>result in lower utilization of life science and tools products and services. A reduction in the research budget of the National </span><span>Institutes of Health may also result in reduced annual research outlays and adversely impact the demand for life science and </span><span>tools products and services.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Materials Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the materials sector may be adversely affected by commodity price </span><span>volatility, exchange rate fluctuations, social and political unrest, war, import or export controls, increased competition, </span><span>depletion of resources, technical progress, labor relations and government regulations, and mandated expenditures for safety </span><span>and pollution control, among other factors. Such risks may adversely affect the issuers to which a Fund has exposure. </span><span>Companies in the materials sector are also at risk of liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. </span><span>Production of materials may exceed demand as a result of market imbalances or economic downturns, leading to poor </span><span>investment returns. These risks are heightened for companies in the materials sector located in foreign markets.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Medical Equipment Industry. </span><span> </span><span>Many companies in the medical equipment industry are heavily </span><span>dependent on patent protection, and the expiration of patents may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. </span><span>Companies in the medical equipment industry may be subject to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar </span><span>claims as well as competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may result in price discounting. The </span><span>profitability of some medical equipment companies may be dependent on a relatively limited number of products. In </span><span>addition, their products can become obsolete due to industry innovation, changes in technologies or other market </span><span>developments. Many new products in the medical equipment industry are subject to regulatory approvals, and the process of </span><span>obtaining such approvals is long and costly.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Mortgage Real Estate Investment Trusts. </span><span> </span><span>Mortgage REITs lend money to developers and owners of </span><span>properties and invest primarily in mortgages and similar real estate interests. The mortgage REITs receive interest payments </span><span>from the owners of the mortgaged properties. Accordingly, mortgage REITs are subject to the credit risk of the borrowers to </span><span>whom they extend funds. Credit risk is the risk that the borrower will not be able to make timely interest and principal </span><span>payments on the loan to the REIT. Mortgage REITs also are subject to the risk that the value of mortgaged properties may be </span><span>less than the amounts owed on the properties. If a mortgage REIT is required to foreclose on a borrower, the amount </span><span>recovered in connection with the foreclosure may be less than the amount owed to the mortgage REIT.</span></div> <div><span> </span><span>Mortgage REITs are subject to significant interest rate risk. During periods when interest rates are declining, mortgages are </span><span>often refinanced or prepaid. Refinancing or prepayment of mortgages may reduce the yield of mortgage REITs. When interest </span><span>rates decline, the value of a REIT’s investment in fixed rate obligations can be expected to rise. Conversely, when interest rates </span><span>rise, the value of a REIT’s investment in fixed rate obligations can be expected to decline. In addition, rising interest rates </span><span>generally increase the costs of obtaining financing, which could cause the value of a mortgage REIT’s investments to decline. </span><span>A REIT’s investment in adjustable rate obligations may react differently to interest rate changes than an investment in fixed </span><span>rate obligations. As interest rates on adjustable rate mortgage loans are reset periodically, yields on a REIT’s investment in </span><span>such loans will gradually align themselves to reflect changes in market interest rates, causing the value of such investments </span><span>to fluctuate less dramatically in response to interest rate fluctuations than would investments in fixed rate obligations.</span></div> <div><span> </span><span>Mortgage REITs typically use leverage (and in many cases, may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk and </span><span>could adversely affect a REIT’s operations and market value in periods of rising interest rates, increased interest rate volatility, </span><span>downturns in the economy and reductions in the availability of financing or deterioration in the conditions of the REIT’s </span><span>mortgage-related assets.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>28</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

Companies in the natural resources </span><span>industry are affected by government regulation, world events and economic conditions. Companies in the natural resources </span><span>industry are at risk for environmental damage claims. Companies in the natural resources industry could be adversely </span><span>affected by commodity price volatility, changes in exchange rates, imposition of import controls and increased competition. </span><span>Companies in the natural resources industry may be adversely affected by depletion of natural resources, technological </span><span>developments, and labor relations.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Pharmaceuticals Industry. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the pharmaceuticals industry are subject to competitive </span><span>forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may result in price discounting. The profitability of some </span><span>companies in the pharmaceuticals industry may be dependent on a relatively limited number of products. In addition, their </span><span>products can become obsolete due to industry innovation, changes in technologies or other market developments. Many </span><span>new products in the pharmaceuticals industry are subject to government approvals, regulation and reimbursement rates </span><span>which may affect companies' profitability. The process of obtaining government approvals may be long and costly. Many </span><span>companies in the pharmaceuticals industry are heavily dependent on patents and intellectual property rights. The loss or </span><span>impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Companies in the pharmaceutical </span><span>industry may be subject to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Real Estate Industry. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the real estate industry include companies that invest in real </span><span>estate, such as REITs, real estate holding and operating companies or real estate development companies (collectively, </span><span>“</span><span>Real </span><span>Estate Companies</span><span>”</span><span>). Investing in Real Estate Companies exposes investors to the risks of owning real estate directly, as well </span><span>as to risks that relate specifically to the way in which Real Estate Companies are organized and operated. The real estate </span><span>industry is highly sensitive to general and local economic conditions and developments, and characterized by intense </span><span>competition and periodic overbuilding. Investing in Real Estate Companies involves various risks. Some risks that are specific </span><span>to Real Estate Companies are discussed in greater detail below.</span></div> <div><span>Concentration Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may own a limited number of properties and concentrate their investments in a </span><span>particular geographic region or property type. Economic downturns affecting a particular region, industry or property type </span><span>may lead to a high volume of defaults within a short period.</span></div> <div><span>Distressed Investment Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may invest in distressed, defaulted or out-of-favor bank loans. </span><span>Identification and implementation by a Real Estate Company of loan modification and restructure programs involves a high </span><span>degree of uncertainty. Even successful implementation may still require adverse compromises and may not prevent </span><span>bankruptcy. Real Estate Companies may also invest in other debt instruments that may become non-performing, including </span><span>the securities of companies with higher credit and market risk due to financial or operational difficulties. Higher risk securities </span><span>may be less liquid and more volatile than the securities of companies not in distress.</span></div> <div><span>Illiquidity Risk.</span><span> Investing in Real Estate Companies may involve risks similar to those associated with investing in small-capitalization</span><span> companies. Real Estate Company securities, like the securities of small-capitalization companies, may be more </span><span>volatile than, and perform differently from, shares of large-capitalization companies. There may be less trading in Real Estate </span><span>Company shares, which means that buy and sell transactions in those shares could have a magnified impact on share price, </span><span>resulting in abrupt or erratic price fluctuations. In addition, real estate is relatively illiquid, and, therefore, a Real Estate </span><span>Company may have a limited ability to vary or liquidate properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions.</span></div> <div><span>Interest Rate Risk.</span><span> Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could </span><span>negatively impact a Real Estate Company’s ability to meet its payment obligations. Declining interest rates could result in </span><span>increased prepayment on loans and require redeployment of capital in less desirable investments.</span></div> <div><span>Leverage Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may use leverage (and some may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk </span><span>and could adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s operations and market value in periods of rising interest rates. Real Estate </span><span>Companies are also exposed to the risks normally associated with debt financing. Financial covenants related to a Real Estate </span><span>Company’s leverage may affect the ability of the Real Estate Company to operate effectively. In addition, real property may be </span><span>subject to the quality of credit extended and defaults by borrowers and tenants. If the properties do not generate sufficient </span><span>income to meet operating expenses, including, where applicable, debt service, ground lease payments, tenant improvements, </span><span>third-party leasing commissions and other capital expenditures, the income and ability of a Real Estate Company to make </span><span>payments of any interest and principal on its debt securities will be adversely affected.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>29</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Loan Foreclosure Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may foreclose on loans that the Real Estate Company originated and/or </span><span>acquired. Foreclosure may generate negative publicity for the underlying property that affects its market value. In addition to </span><span>the length and expense of such proceedings, the validity of the terms of the applicable loan may not be recognized in </span><span>foreclosure proceedings. Claims and defenses asserted by borrowers or other lenders may interfere with the enforcement of </span><span>rights by a Real Estate Company. Parallel proceedings, such as bankruptcy, may also delay resolution and limit the amount of </span><span>recovery on a foreclosed loan by a Real Estate Company even where the property underlying the loan is liquidated.</span></div> <div><span>Management Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies are dependent upon management skills and may have limited financial resources. </span><span>Real Estate Companies are generally not diversified and may be subject to heavy cash flow dependency, default by borrowers </span><span>and voluntary liquidation. In addition, transactions between Real Estate Companies and their affiliates may be subject to </span><span>conflicts of interest, which may adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s shareholders. A Real Estate Company may also have </span><span>joint venture investments in certain of its properties, and, consequently, its ability to control decisions relating to such </span><span>properties may be limited.</span></div> <div><span>Property Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may be subject to risks relating to functional obsolescence or reduced desirability of </span><span>properties; extended vacancies due to economic conditions and tenant bankruptcies; catastrophic events such as </span><span>earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts; and casualty or condemnation losses. Real estate income and values also may be </span><span>greatly affected by demographic trends, such as population shifts or changes in consumer preferences and values, or </span><span>increasing vacancies or declining rents resulting from legal, cultural, technological, global or local economic developments.</span></div> <div><span>Regulatory Risk.</span><span> Real estate income and values may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable domestic and foreign </span><span>laws (including tax laws). Government actions, such as tax increases, zoning law changes, mandated closures or other </span><span>commercial restrictions or environmental regulations, also may have a major impact on real estate income and values. In </span><span>addition, quarterly compliance with regulations limiting the proportion of asset types held by a U.S. REIT may force certain </span><span>Real Estate Companies to liquidate or restructure otherwise attractive investments. Some countries may not recognize REITs </span><span>or comparable structures as a viable form of real estate funds.</span></div> <div><span>Underlying Investment Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies make investments in a variety of debt and equity instruments with </span><span>varying risk profiles. For instance, Real Estate Companies may invest in debt instruments secured by commercial property </span><span>that have higher risks of delinquency and foreclosure than loans on single family homes due to a variety of factors associated </span><span>with commercial property, including the tie between income available to service debt and productive use of the property. Real </span><span>Estate Companies may also invest in debt instruments and preferred equity that are junior in an issuer’s capital structure and </span><span>that involve privately negotiated structures. Subordinated debt investments, such as B-Notes and mezzanine loans, involve a </span><span>greater credit risk of default due to the need to service more senior debt of the issuer. Similarly, preferred equity investments </span><span>involve a greater risk of loss than conventional debt financing due to their non-collateralized nature and subordinated </span><span>ranking. Investments in commercial mortgage-backed securities may also be junior in priority in the event of bankruptcy or </span><span>similar proceedings. Investments in senior loans may be effectively subordinated if the senior loan is pledged as collateral. </span><span>The ability of a holder of junior claims to proceed against a defaulting issuer is circumscribed by the terms of the particular </span><span>contractual arrangement, which vary considerably from transaction to transaction.</span></div> <div><span>U.S. Tax Risk.</span><span> Certain U.S. Real Estate Companies are subject to special U.S. federal tax requirements. A REIT that fails to </span><span>comply with such tax requirements may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation, which may affect the value of the REIT </span><span>and the characterization of the REIT’s distributions. The U.S. federal tax requirement that a REIT distribute substantially all of </span><span>its net income to its shareholders may result in a REIT having insufficient capital for future expenditures. A REIT that </span><span>successfully maintains its qualification may still become subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes, including excise, </span><span>penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage recording, and transfer taxes, both directly and indirectly through its subsidiaries. </span><span>Because REITs often do not provide complete tax information until after the calendar year-end, a Fund may at times need to </span><span>request permission to extend the deadline for issuing your tax reporting statement or supplement the information otherwise </span><span>provided to you.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Residential and Residential-Related REIT Sub-Industry. </span><span> </span><span>The Residential and Residential-Related </span><span>REIT Sub-Industry consists of REITs with exposure to residential real estate and certain types of commercial real estate that </span><span>complements residential real estate, including properties operated by healthcare providers and self-storage companies. In </span><span>addition to the risks related to REITs generally, investments in these REITs are subject to additional subsector-specific risks. </span><span>Residential real estate may be affected by unique supply and demand factors that do not apply to other REIT sub-sectors. In </span><span>addition, certain investors may already have exposure to residential real estate through ownership of a primary residence or </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>30</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>direct ownership of rental property. The value of healthcare-focused REITs may be affected by changes in federal or state </span><span>regulation of healthcare providers and reimbursement rates to healthcare providers under Medicare, Medicaid and other </span><span>public or private health insurance plans. Unlike less specialized commercial real estate, when tenants vacate healthcare-related</span><span> properties, the ability of property management to find replacement tenants may be impaired by the properties’ </span><span>specialized healthcare uses. Investments in self-storage REITs are subject to changes in demand levels for self-storage. In </span><span>addition, self-storage operators may be liable for unplanned environmental and hazardous waste compliance costs </span><span>associated with operating self-storage locations.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Semiconductor Industry. </span><span> </span><span>Semiconductor companies face intense competition, both domestically </span><span>and internationally; such competition may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Semiconductor companies may have </span><span>limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of semiconductor companies may face </span><span>obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction, unpredictable changes in </span><span>growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Capital equipment expenditures could be substantial </span><span>and equipment generally suffers from rapid obsolescence. Companies in the semiconductor industry are heavily dependent </span><span>on patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights would adversely affect the profitability of </span><span>these companies.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Technology Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Technology companies are characterized by periodic new product introductions, </span><span>innovations and evolving industry standards, and, as a result, face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, </span><span>which may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Companies in the technology sector are often smaller and less </span><span>experienced companies and may be subject to greater risks than larger companies; these risks may be heightened for </span><span>technology companies in foreign markets. Technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial </span><span>resources or personnel. The products of technology companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological </span><span>developments and frequent new product introduction, changes in consumer and business purchasing patterns, </span><span>unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. In addition, a rising interest </span><span>rate environment tends to negatively affect companies in the technology sector because, in such an environment, those </span><span>companies with high market valuations may appear less attractive to investors, which may cause sharp decreases in the </span><span>companies’ market prices. Companies in the technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property </span><span>rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Companies in the </span><span>technology sector are facing increased government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or </span><span>regulatory action. The technology sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which </span><span>may be influenced or characterized by unpredictable factors. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network </span><span>security breaches, certain companies in the technology sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of </span><span>proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Telecommunications Sector. </span><span> </span><span>The telecommunications sector of a country’s economy is often </span><span>subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with governmental regulations, delays or failure to </span><span>receive required regulatory approvals, or the enactment of new regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of </span><span>telecommunications companies. Government actions around the world, specifically in the area of pre-marketing clearance of </span><span>products and prices, can be arbitrary and unpredictable. Companies in the telecommunications sector may experience </span><span>distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition, particularly in </span><span>developing new products and services using new technology. Technological innovations may make the products and services </span><span>of certain telecommunications companies obsolete. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network security </span><span>breaches, certain companies in the telecommunications sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of </span><span>proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Utilities Sector. </span><span> </span><span>The utilities sector may be adversely affected by changing commodity prices, </span><span>government regulation stipulating rates charged by utilities, increased tariffs, changes in tax laws, interest rate fluctuations </span><span>and changes in the cost of providing specific utility services. The utilities industry is also subject to potential terrorist attacks, </span><span>natural disasters and severe weather conditions, as well as regulatory and operational burdens associated with the operation </span><span>and maintenance of nuclear facilities. Government regulators monitor and control utility revenues and costs, and therefore </span><span>may limit utility profits. In certain countries, regulatory authorities may also restrict a company’s access to new markets, </span><span>thereby diminishing the company’s long-term prospects.</span></div> <div><span>There are substantial differences among the regulatory practices and policies of various jurisdictions, and any regulatory </span><span>agency may make major shifts in policy from time to time. There is no assurance that regulatory authorities will, in the future, </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>31</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>grant rate increases. Additionally, existing and possible future regulatory legislation may make it even more difficult for </span><span>utilities to obtain adequate relief. Certain of the issuers of securities held in a Fund's portfolio may own or operate nuclear </span><span>generating facilities. Governmental authorities may from time to time review existing policies and impose additional </span><span>requirements governing the licensing, construction and operation of nuclear power plants. Prolonged changes in climate </span><span>conditions can also have a significant impact on both the revenues of an electric and gas utility as well as the expenses of a </span><span>utility, particularly a hydro-based electric utility.</span></div> <div><span>The rates that traditional regulated utility companies may charge their customers generally are subject to review and </span><span>limitation by governmental regulatory commissions. Rate changes may occur only after a prolonged approval period or may </span><span>not occur at all, which could adversely affect utility companies when costs are rising. The value of regulated utility debt </span><span>securities (and, to a lesser extent, equity securities) tends to have an inverse relationship to the movement of interest rates. </span><span>Certain utility companies have experienced full or partial deregulation in recent years. These utility companies are frequently </span><span>more similar to industrial companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been permitted by regulators to </span><span>diversify outside of their original geographic regions and their traditional lines of business. As a result, some companies may </span><span>be forced to defend their core business and may be less profitable. Deregulation may also permit a utility company to expand </span><span>outside of its traditional lines of business and engage in riskier ventures.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Proxy Voting Policy</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>For the Funds, the Board has delegated the voting of proxies for each Fund’s securities to BFA pursuant to the Funds' Proxy </span><span>Voting Policy, and BFA has adopted policies and procedures (collectively, the </span><span>“</span><span>iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policies</span><span>”</span><span>) governing </span><span>proxy voting by accounts managed by BFA, including the Funds.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Under the iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policies, BFA will vote proxies related to Fund securities in the best interests of a Fund </span><span>and its shareholders. From time to time, a vote may present a conflict between the interests of a Fund’s shareholders, on the </span><span>one hand, and those of BFA, or any affiliated person of a Fund or BFA, on the other. BFA maintains policies and procedures </span><span>that are designed to prevent undue influence on BFA’s proxy voting activity that might stem from any relationship between </span><span>the issuer of a proxy (or any dissident shareholder) and BFA, BFA’s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund’s affiliates. Most conflicts are </span><span>managed through a structural separation of BFA’s Corporate Governance Group from BFA’s employees with sales and client </span><span>responsibilities. In addition, BFA maintains procedures to ensure that all engagements with corporate issuers or dissident </span><span>shareholders are managed consistently and without regard to BFA’s relationship with the issuer of the proxy or the dissident </span><span>shareholder. In certain instances, BFA may determine to engage an independent fiduciary to vote proxies as a further </span><span>safeguard to avoid potential conflicts of interest or as otherwise required by applicable law.</span></div> <div><span>Copies of the iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policies are attached as Appendix A.</span></div> <div><span>Information with respect to how proxies relating to the Funds' portfolio securities were voted during the 12-month period </span><span>ended June 30 is available: (i) without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737) or through the Funds' </span><span>website at www.iShares.com; and (ii) on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.</span></div> <div><span>Portfolio Holdings Information</span></div> <div><span>On each Business Day (as defined in the </span><span>Creation and Redemption of Creation Units</span><span> section of this SAI), prior to the opening </span><span>of regular trading on the Fund’s primary listing exchange, a Fund discloses on its website (</span><span>www.iShares.com</span><span>) certain </span><span>information relating to the portfolio holdings that will form the basis of a Fund’s next net asset value per share calculation.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, certain information may also be made available to certain parties:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Communications of Data Files: </span><span>A Fund may make available through the facilities of the National Securities Clearing </span><span>Corporation (</span><span>“</span><span>NSCC</span><span>”</span><span>) or through posting on the </span><span>www.iShares.com</span><span>, prior to the opening of trading on each business </span><span>day, a list of a Fund’s holdings (generally pro-rata) that Authorized Participants could deliver to a Fund to settle </span><span>purchases of a Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span> Deposit Securities) or that Authorized Participants would receive from a Fund to settle </span><span>redemptions of a Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span> Fund Securities).

Securities that are removed from an Index between reconstitution </span><span>dates are not replaced.</span></div> <div><span>Index Maintenance.</span><span> Maintaining the Underlying Indexes includes monitoring and completing the adjustments for additions </span><span>and deletions to each Underlying Index, share changes, stock splits, stock dividends, and stock price adjustments due to </span><span>restructuring and spin-offs.</span></div> <div><span>Weighting.</span><span> The component stocks are weighted according to the float-adjusted market capitalization. The impact of a </span><span>component’s price change is proportional to the issue’s total market value, which is the share price multiplied by the number </span><span>of shares outstanding. Each Underlying Index is adjusted to reflect changes in capitalization resulting from mergers, </span><span>acquisitions, stock rights, substitutions and other capital events. Each of the Underlying Indexes (subject to any applicable </span><span>capping as described below) is a free-float adjusted market capitalization-weighted index, so the impact of a component’s </span><span>price change is proportional to the component’s free-float adjusted market value, which is the share price multiplied by the </span><span>number of float-adjusted shares outstanding. S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices LLC (</span><span>“</span><span>SPDJI</span><span>”</span><span>) defines the free-float of a security as the </span><span>proportion of shares outstanding that are deemed to be available for purchase in the public equity markets by investors. In </span><span>practice, limitations on free-float available to investors include: cross ownership (shares that are owned by other companies), </span><span>ownership by governments (central or municipal) or their agencies, certain substantial levels of private ownership (by </span><span>individuals, families or charitable trusts and foundations), and restricted shares. Under SPDJI's free-float adjustment </span><span>methodology, a company’s outstanding shares are adjusted if, and only if, an entity in any of the four qualified categories </span><span>listed above owns 5% or more of the company. The company’s shares will not be adjusted if the block ownership is less than </span><span>5%. A constituent’s inclusion factor is equal to its estimated percentage of free-float shares outstanding. For example, a </span><span>constituent security with a free-float of 67% will be included in the index at 67% of its market capitalization. However, a </span><span>company’s outstanding shares are not adjusted by institutional investors’ holdings, which include, but are not limited to, the </span><span>following categories: custodian nominees, trustee companies, mutual funds (open-end and closed-end funds), and other </span><span>investment companies.</span></div> <div><span>Index Availability.</span><span> The Underlying Indexes are calculated continuously and are available from major data vendors.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Component Selection Criteria.</span><span> The following indexes are collectively referred to herein as the </span><span>“</span><span>Dow Jones U.S. Select Sectors </span><span>Specialty Indexes</span><span>”</span><span>: Dow Jones U.S. Select Aerospace &amp; Defense Index, Dow Jones U.S. Select Health Care Providers Index, </span><span>Dow Jones U.S. Select Home Construction Index, Dow Jones U.S. Select Insurance Index, Dow Jones U.S. Select Investment </span><span>Services Index, Dow Jones U.S. Select Medical Equipment Index, Dow Jones U.S. Select Oil Equipment &amp; Services Index, Dow </span><span>Jones U.S. Select Oil Exploration &amp; Production Index, Dow Jones U.S. Select Pharmaceuticals Index and Dow Jones U.S. Select </span><span>Regional Banks Index.

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The Russell 1000 Index is constructed to provide a comprehensive and unbiased barometer for the large- and mid-capitalization</span><span> segments of the investable U.S. equity market. It is a float-adjusted capitalization-weighted index consisting </span><span>approximately 1000 of the largest issuers in the Russell 3000 Index.</span></div> <div><span>For the Russell 3000</span><span>®</span><span> Index and the Russell 1000</span><span>®</span><span> Index, the weights of component issuers are adjusted based on available </span><span>float-weighted capitalization according to the market value of their available outstanding shares. The impact of a component </span><span>security’s price change is proportional to the issuer’s total market value, which is the share price times the number of shares </span><span>available. Each Russell Index is adjusted to reflect changes in capitalization resulting from mergers, acquisitions, stock rights, </span><span>substitutions and other capital events.</span></div> <div><span>Frank Russell Company uses a probability measure to assign stocks to the growth and value style indexes. The probability </span><span>measure is used to indicate the degree of certainty that a stock is value or growth, based on three fundamental indicators: </span><span>relative price-to-book (</span><span>“</span><span>PB</span><span>”</span><span>) ratio, Institutional Brokers’ Estimate System forecast medium-term growth (2 years) and sales </span><span>per share historical growth (5 years). This method allows stocks to be represented as having both growth and value </span><span>characteristics, while preserving the additive nature of the indexes. As a result, a stock may be a component of a Russell </span><span>growth style index and also a component of the corresponding value style index, although the stock would likely have a </span><span>different weight in each index.</span></div> <div><span>Issue Changes.</span><span> Securities that leave the Russell Indexes between reconstitution dates are not replaced. Thus, the number of </span><span>securities in the investments over the year will fluctuate according to corporate activity. When a stock is acquired, delisted or </span><span>moves to the pink sheets or OTC bulletin boards, the stock is deleted from the relevant indexes.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>When acquisitions or mergers take place, the stock’s capitalization moves to the acquiring stock, hence, mergers have no </span><span>effect on index total capitalization if the acquiring stock is part of the index. The only additions between reconstitution dates </span><span>are as a result of spin-offs and IPOs.</span></div> <div><span>Issue Changes for the Focused Value Select Index.</span><span> The Focused Value Select Index will be reviewed monthly, with changes </span><span>being implemented after the close of the 6</span><span>th</span><span> business day.

In addition, significant share capital changes are made at month-end. The </span><span>divisor is adjusted for all changes in company market value to leave the value of the investments unaffected.

Issuers (</span><span>i.e</span><span>., the </span><span>“</span><span>components</span><span>”</span><span>) selected for the </span><span>S&amp;P U.S. indexes represent a broad range of industry segments within the U.S. economy. The starting universe of publicly </span><span>traded U.S. issuers classified by the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS</span><span>®</span><span>) is screened to eliminate ADRs, mutual </span><span>funds, limited partnerships, royalty trusts, certain holding issuers, OTC bulletin board issues, pink sheet-listed issues, closed-end</span><span> funds, ETFs and tracking stocks. REITs, except for mortgage REITs, are eligible for inclusion in the Indexes. The stock of </span><span>each constituent must trade on either the NYSE, the NYSE Amex Equities or on NASDAQ. Additionally, only one share class </span><span>per constituent will be included in an Index. The share class is selected by SPDJI and is generally defined as the largest, most </span><span>liquid share class. Issuers with multiple share classes will have the classes combined for purposes of calculation of market </span><span>capitalization. The following criteria are then analyzed to determine an issuer’s eligibility for inclusion in the S&amp;P Indexes: (i) </span><span>ownership of an issuer’s outstanding common stock, in order to screen out closely held issuers; (ii) trading volume of an </span><span>issuer’s shares, in order to ensure ample liquidity and efficient share pricing; and (iii) the financial and operating condition of </span><span>an issuer.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>48</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The S&amp;P DJI’s Indices are capitalization-weighted, based on the following formula: number of outstanding shares of a </span><span>constituent (as determined by the float-adjusted market capitalization using SPDJI’s methodology) multiplied by the </span><span>constituent’s share price. Issuers with float-adjusted market capitalizations below certain thresholds are not eligible for the </span><span>Indexes. In addition, the market capitalization of an issuer eligible for inclusion typically must be greater than the Index’s </span><span>minimum market capitalization at the time it is being considered for Index inclusion. The market capitalizations of an Index’s </span><span>components are adjusted to reflect changes in capitalization resulting from mergers, acquisitions, stock rights, substitutions </span><span>and other capital events. The market capitalizations of an Index’s constituent are adjusted for all strategic holdings, including </span><span>private, corporate, and government holdings.</span></div> <div><span>Component Selection Criteria for International Indexes.</span><span> </span><span>Stocks are eligible for the S&amp;P Global Indices if they meet criteria for </span><span>size, liquidity, profitability, and sector and market representation. Each of the S&amp;P Global Indices is balanced across country </span><span>and sector weights in the region/market. The S&amp;P Global Indices begin with an eligible investable universe of stocks covering </span><span>approximately 95% of each country’s total market capitalization. In some cases, the S&amp;P Global Indexes may include ADRs </span><span>and GDRs. Stocks with relatively small market capitalization or insufficient liquidity are excluded by SPDJI. To identify a </span><span>candidate pool for index constituent selection, all stocks are carefully examined using a set of general criteria. The specific </span><span>securities are then screened for industry sector classification; thus, the eligible securities are ranked according to GICS. Then, </span><span>the Index components, now determined, are weighted on the basis of SPDJI’s float-adjusted, market capitalization </span><span>methodology. Generally, SPDJI observes a prospective constituent’s liquidity over a period of at least twelve months before </span><span>consideration for inclusion. However, there may be extraordinary situations when issuers should be added immediately (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, </span><span>certain privatizations). When a particular issuer dominates its home market, it may be excluded from an Index if analysis of </span><span>the sectors reveals that its securities are not as liquid as those of similar issuers in other countries. Once a year, the float </span><span>adjustments will be reviewed and potentially changed based on such review. The values of an Index’s components are </span><span>adjusted to reflect changes in capitalization resulting from mergers, acquisitions, stock rights, substitutions and other capital </span><span>events. The market capitalization of index constituent issuers is adjusted for all strategic holdings, including private, </span><span>corporate, and government holdings.</span></div> <div><span>With respect to the non-U.S. components of the S&amp;P Global Indexes, the eligible universe of index components that are </span><span>considered for inclusion are from the following S&amp;P DJI Indices: (i) the S&amp;P/TSX 60 (Toronto Stock Exchange), which </span><span>represents the liquid, large-cap stocks of the publicly listed issuers in the Canadian equities market; (ii) the S&amp;P/TOPIX 150 </span><span>(TSE) which represents the liquid, large-cap stocks of the publicly listed issuers in the Japanese equities market; (iii) S&amp;P/ASX </span><span>All-Australian 50 Index (Australian Stock Exchange), which represents the liquid, large-cap stocks in the Australian equities </span><span>market; (iv) the S&amp;P Asia 50, which represents the liquid, large-cap stocks of four major equities markets in Asia (Hong Kong, </span><span>South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore); (v) the S&amp;P Latin America 40, which represents the liquid, large-cap stocks from major </span><span>sectors of the Mexico, Brazil, Peru, Colombia and Chilé equity markets; and (vi) the S&amp;P Europe 350, which represents the </span><span>liquid, large-cap stocks of the publicly listed issuers in the region, covering approximately 70% of the region’s market </span><span>capitalization.</span></div> <div><span>Issue Changes.</span><span> </span><span>General oversight responsibility for the S&amp;P DJI Indices, including overall policy guidelines and methodology, </span><span>is handled by the S&amp;P Global Index Committee. Maintenance of component investments, including additions and deletions to </span><span>these investments, is the responsibility of separate regional index committees composed of S&amp;P staff specialized in the </span><span>various regional equity markets and, in some cases, with the assistance of local stock exchanges. Public announcements of </span><span>index changes as the result of committee decisions will generally be made two business days in advance of the anticipated </span><span>effective date whenever possible, although for exceptional corporate events announcements may be made earlier.</span></div> <div><span>Index Maintenance.</span><span> </span><span>Maintaining the S&amp;P DJI Indices includes monitoring and completing the adjustments for issuer </span><span>additions and deletions, share changes, stock splits, stock dividends, and stock price adjustments due to restructuring and </span><span>spin-offs. An issuer will be removed from the S&amp;P DJI Indices as a result of mergers/acquisitions, bankruptcy, or </span><span>restructuring. An issuer is removed from the relevant index as close as possible to the actual date on which the event </span><span>occurred. An issuer can be removed from an index because it no longer meets current criteria for inclusion and/or is no </span><span>longer representative of its industry group. All replacement issuers are selected based on the above component section </span><span>criteria.</span></div> <div><span>When calculating index weights, individual components shares held by governments, corporations, strategic partners, or </span><span>other control groups are excluded from the issuer’s shares outstanding. Shares owned by other issuers are also excluded </span><span>regardless of whether they are index components. In countries with regulated environments, where a foreign investment </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>49</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

However, during the course of </span><span>the year, SPDJI also monitors each issuer’s Investable Weight Factor (</span><span>“</span><span>IWF</span><span>”</span><span>) which is SPDJI’s term for the mathematical float </span><span>factor used to calculate the float adjustment. If a change in IWF is caused by a major corporate action (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, privatization, </span><span>merger, takeover, or share offering) and the change equal to or greater than 5%, a float adjustment will be implemented as </span><span>soon as reasonably possible.</span></div> <div><span>Changes in the number of shares outstanding driven by corporate events such as stock dividends, splits, and rights issues </span><span>will be adjusted on the ex-date. Share changes of 5% or greater are implemented when they occur. Share changes of less </span><span>than 5% are only updated on a quarterly basis on the Friday near the end of the calendar quarter. Generally, index changes </span><span>due to rebalancing are announced two days before the effective date by way of a news release posted on </span><span>www.us.spindices.com.</span></div> <div><span>Index Availability.</span><span> The S&amp;P Indexes are calculated continuously and are available from major data vendors.</span></div> <div><span>Exchange Rates. </span><span>SPDJI uses the World Markets/Reuters Closing Spot Rates taken at 4:00 p.m. London time</span><span> </span><span>for the following </span><span>funds:</span><span> </span><span>iShares ESG Screened S&amp;P 500 ETF, iShares ESG Screened S&amp;P Mid-Cap ETF, iShares ESG Screened S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF, </span><span>iShares Europe ETF, iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF, iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF, iShares North American </span><span>Natural Resources ETF and iShares North American Tech-Multimedia Networking ETF.

The SEC staff has taken the position that investment of 25% or </span><span>more of a fund’s total assets in one or more issuers conducting their principal activities in the same industry or group of </span><span>industries constitutes concentration. It is possible that interpretations of concentration could change in the future. The policy </span><span>in (1) above will be interpreted to refer to concentration as that term may be interpreted from time to time. The policy also </span><span>will be interpreted to permit investment without limit in the following: securities of the U.S. government and its agencies or </span><span>instrumentalities; securities of state, territory, possession or municipal governments and their authorities, agencies, </span><span>instrumentalities or political subdivisions; and repurchase agreements collateralized by any such obligations. Accordingly, </span><span>issuers of the foregoing securities will not be considered to be members of any industry. There also will be no limit on </span><span>investment in issuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or country. Finance companies will be considered to be in the </span><span>industries of their parents if their activities are primarily related to financing the activities of the parents. Each foreign </span><span>government will be considered to be a member of a separate industry. With respect to a Fund's industry classifications, each </span><span>Fund currently utilizes any one or more of the industry sub-classifications used by one or more widely recognized market </span><span>indexes or rating group indexes, and/or as defined by Fund management. The policy also will be interpreted to give broad </span><span>authority to a Fund as to how to classify issuers within or among industries.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to borrowing money set forth in (2) above, the Investment Company Act </span><span>permits each Fund to borrow money in amounts of up to one-third of the Fund's total assets from banks for any purpose, </span><span>and to borrow up to 5% of the Fund's total assets from banks or other lenders for temporary purposes. (The Fund's total </span><span>assets include the amounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks attendant to borrowing, the Investment Company Act requires </span><span>each Fund to maintain at all times an </span><span>“</span><span>asset coverage</span><span>”</span><span> of at least 300% of the amount of its borrowings. Asset coverage </span><span>means the ratio that the value of each Fund’s total assets (including amounts borrowed), minus liabilities other than </span><span>borrowings, bears to the aggregate amount of all borrowings. Borrowing money to increase portfolio holdings is known as </span><span>“</span><span>leveraging.</span><span>”</span><span> Certain trading practices and investments, such as reverse repurchase agreements, may be considered to be </span><span>borrowings or involve leverage and thus are subject to the Investment Company Act restrictions. In accordance with Rule 18f-4</span><span> under the Investment Company Act, when each Fund engages in reverse repurchase agreements and similar financing </span><span>transactions, the Fund may either (i) maintain asset coverage of at least 300% with respect to such transactions and any </span><span>other borrowings in the aggregate, or (ii) treat such transactions as </span><span>“</span><span>derivatives transactions</span><span>”</span><span> and comply with Rule 18f-4 </span><span>with respect to such transactions. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and </span><span>arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered to be borrowings under the policy. Practices and </span><span>investments that may involve leverage but are not considered to be borrowings are not subject to the policy.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>57</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to underwriting set forth in (5) above, the Investment Company Act does not </span><span>prohibit a fund from engaging in the underwriting business or from underwriting the securities of other issuers; in fact, in the </span><span>case of diversified funds, the Investment Company Act permits a fund to have underwriting commitments of up to 25% of its </span><span>assets under certain circumstances. Those circumstances currently are that the amount of a fund’s underwriting </span><span>commitments, when added to the value of a fund’s investments in issuers where a fund owns more than 10% of the </span><span>outstanding voting securities of those issuers, cannot exceed the 25% cap. A fund engaging in transactions involving the </span><span>acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act. Although it is </span><span>not believed that the application of the 1933 Act provisions described above would cause a fund to be engaged in the </span><span>business of underwriting, the policy in (5) above will be interpreted not to prevent a fund from engaging in transactions </span><span>involving the acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities, regardless of whether a fund may be considered to be an </span><span>underwriter under the 1933 Act or is otherwise engaged in the underwriting business to the extent permitted by applicable </span><span>law.</span></div> <div><span>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to lending set forth in (7) above, the Investment Company Act does not </span><span>prohibit each Fund from making loans (including lending its securities); however, SEC staff interpretations currently prohibit </span><span>funds from lending more than one-third of their total assets (including lending its securities), except through the purchase of </span><span>debt obligations or the use of repurchase agreements. In addition, collateral arrangements with respect to options, forward </span><span>currency and futures transactions and other derivative instruments (as applicable), as well as delays in the settlement of </span><span>securities transactions, will not be considered loans.</span></div> <div><span>Non-Fundamental Investment Policies</span></div> <div><span>iShares ESG Screened S&amp;P 500 ETF, </span><span>iShares ESG Screened S&amp;P Mid-Cap ETF, </span><span>iShares ESG Screened S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF, </span><span>iShares Factors US Growth Style ETF, iShares Factors US Value Style ETF, iShares Focused Value Factor ETF, iShares </span><span>International Developed Small Cap Value Factor ETF, iShares U.S. Infrastructure ETF and iShares US Small Cap Value </span><span>Factor ETF Only</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy not to make short sales of securities or maintain a short position, except to </span><span>the extent permitted by each Fund’s Prospectus and SAI, as amended from time to time, and applicable law.</span></div> <div><span>All Funds Other Than the </span><span>iShares ESG Screened S&amp;P 500 ETF, </span><span>iShares ESG Screened S&amp;P Mid-Cap ETF, </span><span>iShares ESG </span><span>Screened S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF, </span><span>iShares Factors US Growth Style ETF, iShares Factors US Value Style ETF, iShares Focused </span><span>Value Factor ETF, iShares International Developed Small Cap Value Factor ETF, iShares U.S. Infrastructure ETF and </span><span>iShares US Small Cap Value Factor ETF</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy not to invest in the securities of a company for the purpose of exercising </span><span>management or control, or purchase or otherwise acquire any illiquid investment, except as permitted under the 1940 Act, </span><span>which currently limits each Fund's holdings in illiquid investments to 15% of a Fund's net assets.

Each Fund also has adopted a policy to provide its shareholders with at least 60 </span><span>days’ prior written notice of any change in such policy. If, subsequent to an investment, the 80% requirement is no longer </span><span>met, a Fund’s future investments will be made in a manner that will bring the Fund into compliance with this policy.</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy not to purchase securities of other investment companies, except to the </span><span>extent permitted by the 1940 Act. As a matter of policy, however, a Fund will not purchase shares of any registered open-end </span><span>investment company or registered unit investment trust, in reliance on Section 12(d)(1)(F) or (G) (the </span><span>“</span><span>fund of funds</span><span>”</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>58</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

Any change in the percentage of each Fund's assets invested in certain </span><span>securities or other instruments resulting from market fluctuations or other changes in each Fund’s total assets will not </span><span>require each Fund to dispose of an investment until BFA determines that it is practicable to sell or close out the investment </span><span>without undue market or tax consequences.</span></div> <div><span>Continuous Offering</span></div> <div><span>The method by which Creation Units are created and traded may raise certain issues under applicable securities laws. </span><span>Because new Creation Units are issued and sold by the Funds on an ongoing basis, at any point a </span><span>“</span><span>distribution,</span><span>”</span><span> as such term </span><span>is used in the 1933 Act, may occur. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, </span><span>depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render </span><span>them statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus delivery requirement and liability provisions of the 1933 Act.</span></div> <div><span>For example, a broker-dealer firm or its client may be deemed a statutory underwriter if it takes Creation Units after placing </span><span>an order with the Distributor, breaks them down into constituent shares and sells such shares directly to customers or if it </span><span>chooses to couple the creation of new shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand </span><span>for shares. A determination of whether one is an underwriter for purposes of the 1933 Act must take into account all of the </span><span>facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the broker-dealer or its client in the particular case and the examples </span><span>mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that could lead to a categorization as </span><span>an underwriter.</span></div> <div><span>Broker-dealer firms should also note that dealers who are not </span><span>“</span><span>underwriters</span><span>”</span><span> but are effecting transactions in shares, </span><span>whether or not participating in the distribution of shares, generally are required to deliver a prospectus. This is because the </span><span>prospectus delivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act is not available in respect of such transactions as a result of </span><span>Section 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that incur a prospectus delivery obligation with respect to shares of the Funds are </span><span>reminded that, pursuant to Rule 153 under the 1933 Act, a prospectus delivery obligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the 1933 </span><span>Act owed to an exchange member in connection with a sale on the Listing Exchange generally is satisfied by the fact that the </span><span>prospectus is available at the Listing Exchange upon request. The prospectus delivery mechanism provided in Rule 153 is </span><span>available only with respect to transactions on an exchange.</span></div> <div><span>Management</span></div> <div><span>Trustees and Officers. </span><span> </span><span>The Board has responsibility for the overall management and operations of the Funds, including </span><span>general supervision of the duties performed by BFA and other service providers.

The Board has engaged BFA to manage the Funds on a </span><span>day-to-day basis. The Board is responsible for overseeing BFA and other service providers in the operations of the Funds in </span><span>accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, applicable provisions of state and other laws and the Trust’s charter. The </span><span>Board is currently composed of nine members, seven of whom are Independent Trustees. The Board currently conducts </span><span>regular in person meetings four times a year. In addition, the Board frequently holds special in person or telephonic meetings </span><span>or informal conference calls to discuss specific matters that may arise or require action between regular meetings. The </span><span>Independent Trustees meet regularly outside the presence of management, in executive session or with other service </span><span>providers to the Trust.</span></div> <div><span>The Board has appointed an Independent Trustee to serve in the role of Board Chair. The Board Chair’s role is to preside at all </span><span>meetings of the Board and to act as a liaison with service providers, officers, attorneys, and other Trustees generally between </span><span>meetings. The Board Chair may also perform such other functions as may be delegated by the Board from time to time. The </span><span>Board has established seven standing Committees: a Nominating and Governance Committee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c) </span><span>Committee, a Securities Lending Committee, a Risk Committee, an Equity Plus Committee and a Fixed Income Plus </span><span>Committee to assist the Board in the oversight and direction of the business and affairs of the Funds, and from time to time </span><span>the Board may establish ad hoc committees or informal working groups to review and address the policies and practices of </span><span>the Funds with respect to certain specified matters. The Chair of each standing Committee is an Independent Trustee. The </span><span>role of the Chair of each Committee is to preside at all meetings of the Committee and to act as a liaison with service </span><span>providers, officers, attorneys and other Trustees between meetings. Each standing Committee meets regularly to conduct the </span><span>oversight functions delegated to the Committee by the Board and reports its finding to the Board. The Board and each </span><span>standing Committee conduct annual assessments of their oversight function and structure. The Board has determined that </span><span>the Board’s leadership structure is appropriate because it allows the Board to exercise independent judgment over </span><span>management and it allocates areas of responsibility among committees of Independent Trustees and the full Board to </span><span>enhance effective oversight.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Day-to-day risk management with respect to the Funds is the responsibility of BFA or other service providers (depending on </span><span>the nature of the risk), subject to the supervision of BFA. Each Fund is subject to a number of risks, including investment, </span><span>compliance, operational, reputational, counterparty and valuation risks, among others. While there are a number of risk </span><span>management functions performed by BFA and other service providers, as applicable, it is not possible to identify and </span><span>eliminate all of the risks applicable to the Funds. The Trustees have an oversight role in this area, satisfying themselves that </span><span>risk management processes and controls are in place and operating effectively. Risk oversight forms part of the Board’s </span><span>general oversight of each Fund and is addressed as part of various Board and committee activities. In some cases, risk </span><span>management issues are specifically addressed in presentations and discussions. For example, BFA has an independent </span><span>dedicated Risk and Quantitative Analysis Group (</span><span>“</span><span>RQA</span><span>”</span><span>) that assists BFA in managing fiduciary and corporate risks, including </span><span>investment, operational, counterparty credit and enterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet with the Board to discuss their </span><span>analysis and methodologies, as well as specific risk topics such as operational and counterparty risks relating to the Funds. </span><span>The Board, directly or through a committee, also reviews reports from, among others, management and the independent </span><span>registered public accounting firm for the Trust, as appropriate, regarding risks faced by each Fund and management’s risk </span><span>functions. The Board has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer who oversees the implementation and testing of the Trust's </span><span>compliance program, including assessments by independent third parties, and reports to the Board regarding compliance </span><span>matters for the Trust and its principal service providers. In testing and maintaining the compliance program, the Chief </span><span>Compliance Officer (and his or her delegates) assesses key compliance risks affecting each Fund, and addresses them in </span><span>periodic reports to the Board. In addition, the Audit Committee meets with both the Funds' independent registered public </span><span>accounting firm and BFA’s internal audit group to review risk controls in place that support each Fund as well as test results. </span><span>Board oversight of risk is also performed as needed between meetings through communications between BFA and the Board. </span><span>The Independent Trustees have engaged independent legal counsel to assist them in performing their oversight </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>66</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

(collectively </span><span>referred to in this section as </span><span>“</span><span>BlackRock</span><span>”</span><span>) and their respective directors, officers and employees, with respect to the Funds </span><span>and/or other accounts managed by BlackRock, may give rise to actual or perceived conflicts of interest such as those </span><span>described below.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock is one of the world's largest asset management firms. BlackRock, its subsidiaries and their respective directors, </span><span>officers and employees, including the business units or entities and personnel who may be involved in the investment </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>99</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>activities and business operations of a Fund, are engaged worldwide in businesses, including managing equities, fixed-income</span><span> securities, cash and alternative investments, and have interests other than that of managing the Funds. These are </span><span>considerations of which investors in a Fund should be aware, and which may cause conflicts of interest that could </span><span>disadvantage a Fund and its shareholders. These businesses and interests include potential multiple advisory, financial and </span><span>other relationships with, or interests in, companies and interests in securities or other instruments that may be purchased or </span><span>sold by a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock has proprietary interests in, and may manage or advise with respect to, accounts or funds (including separate </span><span>accounts and other funds and collective investment vehicles) that have investment objectives similar to those of a Fund </span><span>and/or that engage in transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and instruments as the Funds. BlackRock is </span><span>also a major participant in the global currency, equities, swap and fixed income markets, in each case, for the accounts of </span><span>clients and, in some cases, on a proprietary basis. As such, BlackRock is or may be actively engaged in transactions in the </span><span>same securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests. Such activities could affect the prices and availability of </span><span>the securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests, which could have an adverse impact on a Fund's </span><span>performance. Such transactions, particularly in respect of most proprietary accounts or client accounts, will be executed </span><span>independently of a Fund's transactions and thus at prices or rates that may be more or less favorable than those obtained by </span><span>the Funds.</span></div> <div><span>When BlackRock seeks to purchase or sell the same assets for managed accounts, including a Fund, the assets actually </span><span>purchased or sold may be allocated among the accounts on a basis determined in its good faith discretion to be equitable. In </span><span>some cases, this system may adversely affect the size or price of the assets purchased or sold for a Fund. In addition, </span><span>transactions in investments by one or more other accounts managed by BlackRock may have the effect of diluting or </span><span>otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of a Fund, particularly, but not limited to, with respect to </span><span>small-capitalization, emerging market or less liquid strategies. This may occur with respect to BlackRock-advised accounts </span><span>when investment decisions regarding a Fund are based on research or other information that is also used to support </span><span>decisions for other accounts. When BlackRock implements a portfolio decision or strategy on behalf of another account </span><span>ahead of, or contemporaneously with, similar decisions or strategies for a Fund, market impact, liquidity constraints, or other </span><span>factors could result in the Fund receiving less favorable trading results and the costs of implementing such decisions or </span><span>strategies could be increased or the Fund could otherwise be disadvantaged. BlackRock may, in certain cases, elect to </span><span>implement internal policies and procedures designed to limit such consequences, which may cause a Fund to be unable to </span><span>engage in certain activities, including purchasing or disposing of securities, when it might otherwise be desirable for it to do </span><span>so.</span></div> <div><span>Conflicts may also arise because portfolio decisions regarding a Fund may benefit other accounts managed by BlackRock. For </span><span>example, the sale of a long position or establishment of a short position by a Fund may impair the price of the same security </span><span>sold short by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its other accounts or funds, and the purchase of a security or covering of a </span><span>short position in a security by a Fund may increase the price of the same security held by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or </span><span>its other accounts or funds. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, certain Funds may invest their assets in </span><span>other funds advised by BlackRock, including funds that are managed by one or more of the same portfolio managers, which </span><span>could result in conflicts of interest relating to asset allocation, timing of Fund purchases and sales, and increased </span><span>remuneration and profitability for BlackRock, and/or its personnel, including portfolio managers.</span></div> <div><span>In certain circumstances, BlackRock, on behalf of the Funds, may seek to buy from or sell securities to another fund or </span><span>account advised by BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is not required to) effect purchases and sales between BlackRock clients </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>cross trades</span><span>”</span><span>), including the Funds, if BlackRock believes such transactions are appropriate based on each party's </span><span>investment objectives and guidelines, subject to applicable law and regulation. There may be potential conflicts of interest or </span><span>regulatory issues relating to these transactions which could limit BlackRock’s decision to engage in these transactions for the </span><span>Funds. BlackRock may have a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities to the parties in such </span><span>transactions. On any occasion when a Fund participates in a cross trade, BlackRock will comply with procedures adopted </span><span>under applicable rules and SEC guidance.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock and its clients may pursue or enforce rights with respect to an issuer in which a Fund has invested, and those </span><span>activities may have an adverse effect on the Fund. As a result, prices, availability, liquidity and terms of a Fund's investments </span><span>may be negatively impacted by the activities of BlackRock or its clients, and transactions for the Fund may be impaired or </span><span>effected at prices or terms that may be less favorable than would otherwise have been the case.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>100</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The results of a Fund’s investment activities may differ significantly from the results achieved by BlackRock for its proprietary </span><span>accounts or other accounts (including investment companies or collective investment vehicles) which it manages or advises. </span><span>It is possible that one or more accounts managed or advised by BlackRock and such other accounts will achieve investment </span><span>results that are substantially more or less favorable than the results achieved by a Fund. Moreover, it is possible that a Fund </span><span>will sustain losses during periods in which one or more proprietary or other accounts managed or advised by BlackRock </span><span>achieve significant profits. The opposite result is also possible.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>From time to time, a Fund may be restricted from purchasing or selling securities, or from engaging in other investment </span><span>activities because of regulatory, legal or contractual requirements applicable to BlackRock or other accounts managed or </span><span>advised by BlackRock, and/or the internal policies of BlackRock designed to comply with such requirements. As a result, </span><span>there may be periods, for example, when BlackRock will not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions in certain </span><span>securities or instruments with respect to which BlackRock is performing services or when position limits have been reached. </span><span>For example, the investment activities of BlackRock for its proprietary accounts and accounts under its management may </span><span>limit the investment opportunities for a Fund in certain emerging and other markets in which limitations are imposed upon </span><span>the amount of investment, in the aggregate or in individual issuers, by affiliated foreign investors.</span></div> <div><span>In connection with its management of a Fund, BlackRock may have access to certain fundamental analysis and proprietary </span><span>technical models developed by BlackRock. BlackRock will not be under any obligation, however, to effect transactions on </span><span>behalf of a Fund in accordance with such analysis and models. In addition, BlackRock will not have any obligation to make </span><span>available any information regarding its proprietary activities or strategies, or the activities or strategies used for other </span><span>accounts managed by them, for the benefit of the management of a Fund and it is not anticipated that BlackRock will have </span><span>access to such information for the purpose of managing the Fund. The proprietary activities or portfolio strategies of </span><span>BlackRock, or the activities or strategies used for accounts managed by BlackRock or other client accounts could conflict </span><span>with the transactions and strategies employed by BlackRock in managing a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>The Funds may be included in investment models developed by BlackRock for use by clients and financial advisors. To the </span><span>extent clients invest in these investment models and increase the assets under management of the Funds, the investment </span><span>management fee amounts paid by the Funds to BlackRock may also increase. The price, availability and liquidity of a Fund </span><span>may be impacted by purchases and sales of the Fund by model-driven investment portfolios, as well as by BlackRock itself </span><span>and by its advisory clients.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, certain principals and certain employees of a Fund’s investment adviser are also principals or employees of other </span><span>business units or entities within BlackRock. As a result, these principals and employees may have obligations to such other </span><span>business units or entities or their clients and such obligations to other business units or entities or their clients may be a </span><span>consideration of which investors in a Fund should be aware.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may enter into transactions and invest in securities, instruments and currencies on behalf of a Fund in which </span><span>clients of BlackRock or, to the extent permitted by the SEC and applicable law, BlackRock serves as the counterparty, principal </span><span>or issuer. In such cases, such party's interests in the transaction will be adverse to the interests of the Fund, and such party </span><span>may have no incentive to assure that the Fund obtains the best possible prices or terms in connection with the transactions. </span><span>In addition, the purchase, holding and sale of such investments by a Fund may enhance the profitability of BlackRock.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may also create, write or issue derivatives for clients based on the underlying securities, currencies or instruments </span><span>in which a Fund may invest or on the performance of the Fund. An entity in which BlackRock has a significant minority </span><span>interest will create, write or issue options which may be based on the performance of certain Funds. BlackRock has the right </span><span>to receive a portion of the gross revenue earned by such entity. Options writing by such entity on a Fund could potentially </span><span>lead to increased purchase activity with respect to the Fund and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock has entered into an arrangement with Markit Indices Limited, the index provider for underlying fixed-income </span><span>indexes used by certain iShares funds, related to derivative fixed-income products that are based on such iShares funds. </span><span>BlackRock may receive certain payments for licensing intellectual property belonging to BlackRock and for facilitating the </span><span>provision of data in connection with such derivative products, which may include payments based on the trading volumes of, </span><span>or revenues generated by, the derivative products. However, BlackRock will not receive any such payments on those derivative </span><span>products utilized by the Funds or other BlackRock funds or accounts. Other funds and accounts managed by BlackRock may </span><span>from time to time transact in such derivative products, which could contribute to the viability or success of such derivative </span><span>products by making them more appealing to funds and accounts managed by third parties, and in turn lead to increased </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>101</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>payments to BlackRock. Trading activity in such derivative products could also potentially lead to increased purchase activity </span><span>with respect to these iShares funds and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</span></div> <div><span>A Fund may, subject to applicable law, purchase investments that are the subject of an underwriting or other distribution by </span><span>BlackRock and may also enter into transactions with other clients of BlackRock where such other clients have interests </span><span>adverse to those of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>At times, these activities may cause business units or entities within BlackRock to give advice to clients that may cause these </span><span>clients to take actions adverse to the interests of a Fund. To the extent such transactions are permitted, a Fund will deal with </span><span>BlackRock on an arm’s-length basis.</span></div> <div><span>To the extent authorized by applicable law, BlackRock may act as broker, dealer, agent, lender or adviser or in other </span><span>commercial capacities for a Fund. It is anticipated that the commissions, mark-ups, mark-downs, financial advisory fees, </span><span>underwriting and placement fees, sales fees, financing and commitment fees, brokerage fees, other fees, compensation or </span><span>profits, rates, terms and conditions charged by BlackRock will be in its view commercially reasonable, although BlackRock, </span><span>including its sales personnel, will have an interest in obtaining fees and other amounts that are favorable to BlackRock and </span><span>such sales personnel, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. Index based funds may use an index provider that is </span><span>affiliated with another service provider of a Fund or BlackRock that acts as a broker, dealer, agent, lender or in other </span><span>commercial capacities for a Fund or BlackRock.</span></div> <div><span>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock (and its personnel and other distributors) will be entitled to retain fees and other </span><span>amounts that they receive in connection with their service to the Funds as broker, dealer, agent, lender, adviser or in other </span><span>commercial capacities. No accounting to the Funds or their shareholders will be required, and no fees or other compensation </span><span>payable by the Funds or their shareholders will be reduced by reason of receipt by BlackRock of any such fees or other </span><span>amounts.</span></div> <div><span>When BlackRock acts as broker, dealer, agent, adviser or in other commercial capacities in relation to the Funds, BlackRock </span><span>may take commercial steps in its own interests, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. A Fund will be required to </span><span>establish business relationships with its counterparties based on the Fund's own credit standing. BlackRock will not have any </span><span>obligation to allow its credit to be used in connection with a Fund's establishment of its business relationships, nor is it </span><span>expected that the Fund's counterparties will rely on the credit of BlackRock in evaluating the Fund's creditworthiness.</span></div> <div><span>BTC, an affiliate of BFA pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, acts as securities lending agent to, and receives a share of securities </span><span>lending revenues from, the Funds. BlackRock will also receive compensation for managing the reinvestment of the cash </span><span>collateral from securities lending. There are potential conflicts of interests in managing a securities lending program, </span><span>including but not limited to: (i) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to increase or decrease the </span><span>amount of securities on loan or to lend particular securities in order to generate additional risk-adjusted revenue for </span><span>BlackRock and its affiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to allocate loans to clients </span><span>that would provide more revenue to BlackRock. As described further below, BlackRock seeks to mitigate this conflict by </span><span>providing its securities lending clients with equal lending opportunities over time in order to approximate </span><span>pro rata </span><span>allocation. </span></div> <div><span>As part of its securities lending program, BlackRock indemnifies the Funds and certain other clients and/or funds against a </span><span>shortfall in collateral in the event of borrower default. On a regular basis, BlackRock calculates the potential dollar exposure of </span><span>collateral shortfall resulting from a borrower default (</span><span>“</span><span>shortfall risk</span><span>”</span><span>) in the securities lending program. BlackRock establishes </span><span>program-wide borrower limits (</span><span>“</span><span>credit limits</span><span>”</span><span>) to actively manage borrower-specific credit exposure. BlackRock oversees the </span><span>risk model that calculates projected collateral shortfall values using loan-level factors such as loan and collateral type and </span><span>market value as well as specific borrower credit characteristics. When necessary, BlackRock may adjust securities lending </span><span>program attributes by restricting eligible collateral or reducing borrower credit limits. As a result, the management of </span><span>program-wide exposure as well as BlackRock-specific indemnification exposure may affect the amount of securities lending </span><span>activity BlackRock may conduct at any given point in time by reducing the volume of lending opportunities for certain loans </span><span>(including by asset type, collateral type and/or revenue profile).</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock uses a predetermined systematic process in order to approximate </span><span>pro rata</span><span> allocation over time. In order to allocate </span><span>a loan to a portfolio: (i) BlackRock as a whole must have sufficient lending capacity pursuant to the various program limits </span><span>(</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> indemnification exposure limit and borrower credit limits); (ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset at the time a </span><span>loan opportunity arrives; and (iii) the lending portfolio must also have enough inventory, either on its own or when </span><span>aggregated with other portfolios into one single market delivery, to satisfy the loan request. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>102</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>provide equal lending opportunities for all portfolios, independent of whether BlackRock indemnifies the portfolio. Equal </span><span>opportunities for lending portfolios does not guarantee equal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-term outcomes for </span><span>individual clients may vary due to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on different securities, and the overall limits imposed by </span><span>the firm.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may decline to make a securities loan on behalf of a Fund, discontinue lending on behalf of a Fund or terminate a </span><span>securities loan on behalf of a Fund for any reason, including but not limited to regulatory requirements and/or market rules, </span><span>liquidity considerations, or credit considerations, which may impact Funds by reducing or eliminating the volume of lending </span><span>opportunities for certain types of loans, loans in particular markets, loans of particular securities or types of securities, or for </span><span>loans overall.</span></div> <div><span>Purchases and sales of securities and other assets for a Fund may be bunched or aggregated with orders for other BlackRock </span><span>client accounts, including with accounts that pay different transaction costs solely due to the fact that they have different </span><span>research payment arrangements. BlackRock, however, is not required to bunch or aggregate orders if portfolio management </span><span>decisions for different accounts are made separately, or if they determine that bunching or aggregating is not practicable or </span><span>required, or in cases involving client direction.</span></div> <div><span>Prevailing trading activity frequently may make impossible the receipt of the same price or execution on the entire volume of </span><span>securities purchased or sold. When this occurs, the various prices may be averaged, and the Funds will be charged or </span><span>credited with the average price. Thus, the effect of the aggregation may operate on some occasions to the disadvantage of </span><span>the Funds. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Funds will not be charged the same commission or commission </span><span>equivalent rates in connection with a bunched or aggregated order.</span></div> <div><span>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock may select brokers that furnish BlackRock, the Funds, other BlackRock client accounts or </span><span>personnel, directly or through correspondent relationships, with research or other appropriate services which provide, in </span><span>BlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to BlackRock in the investment decision-making process (including with respect to </span><span>futures, fixed-price offerings and OTC transactions). Such research or other services may include, to the extent permitted by </span><span>law, research reports on companies, industries and securities; economic and financial data; financial publications; proxy </span><span>analysis; trade industry seminars; computer data bases; research-oriented software and other services and products. </span><span>Research or other services obtained in this manner may be used in servicing any or all of the Funds and other BlackRock </span><span>client accounts, including in connection with BlackRock client accounts other than those that pay commissions to the broker </span><span>relating to the research or other service arrangements. Such products and services may disproportionately benefit other </span><span>BlackRock client accounts relative to the Funds based on the amount of brokerage commissions paid by the Funds and such </span><span>other BlackRock client accounts. For example, research or other services that are paid for through one client's commissions </span><span>may not be used in managing that client's account. In addition, other BlackRock client accounts may receive the benefit, </span><span>including disproportionate benefits, of economies of scale or price discounts in connection with products and services that </span><span>may be provided to the Funds and to such other BlackRock client accounts. To the extent that BlackRock uses soft dollars, it </span><span>will not have to pay for those products and services itself.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock does not currently enter into arrangements to use the Funds' assets for, or participate in, soft dollars, although </span><span>BlackRock may receive research that is bundled with the trade execution, clearing, and/or settlement services provided by a </span><span>particular broker-dealer. To the extent that BlackRock receives research on this basis, many of the same conflicts related to </span><span>traditional soft dollars may exist. For example, the research effectively will be paid by client commissions that also will be </span><span>used to pay for the execution, clearing, and settlement services provided by the broker-dealer and will not be paid by </span><span>BlackRock. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may endeavor to execute trades through brokers who, pursuant to </span><span>such arrangements, provide research or other services in order to ensure the continued receipt of research or other services </span><span>BlackRock believes are useful in its investment decision-making process. BlackRock may from time to time choose not to </span><span>engage in the above described arrangements to varying degrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may also </span><span>enter into commission sharing arrangements under which BlackRock may execute transactions through a broker-dealer, and </span><span>request that the broker-dealer allocate a portion of the commissions or commission credits to another firm that provides </span><span>research to BlackRock. To the extent that BlackRock engages in commission sharing arrangements, many of the same </span><span>conflicts related to traditional soft dollars may exist.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may utilize certain electronic crossing networks (</span><span>“</span><span>ECNs</span><span>”</span><span>) (including, without limitation, ECNs in which BlackRock </span><span>has an investment or other interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law) in executing client</span><span> </span><span>securities transactions for </span><span>certain types of securities. These ECNs may charge fees for their services, including access fees and transaction fees. The </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>103</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>transaction fees, which are similar to commissions or markups/markdowns, will generally be charged to clients and, like </span><span>commissions and markups/markdowns, would generally be included in the cost of the securities purchased. Access fees </span><span>may be paid by BlackRock even though incurred in connection with executing transactions on behalf of clients, including the </span><span>Funds. In certain circumstances, ECNs may offer volume discounts that will reduce the access fees typically paid by </span><span>BlackRock. BlackRock will only utilize ECNs consistent with its obligation to seek to obtain best execution in client </span><span>transactions.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock owns a minority interest in, and is a member of, Members Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>MEMX</span><span>”</span><span>), a newly created U.S. stock </span><span>exchange. Transactions for a Fund may be executed on MEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue </span><span>for execution of orders placed by BlackRock traders on behalf of such Funds. In addition, transactions in Fund shares may be </span><span>executed on MEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue for the execution of such orders.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock has adopted policies and procedures designed to prevent conflicts of interest from influencing proxy voting </span><span>decisions that it makes on behalf of advisory clients, including the Funds, and to help ensure that such decisions are made in </span><span>accordance with BlackRock's fiduciary obligations to its clients. Nevertheless, notwithstanding such proxy voting policies and </span><span>procedures, actual proxy voting decisions of BlackRock may have the effect of favoring the interests of other clients or </span><span>businesses of other divisions or units of BlackRock, provided that BlackRock believes such voting decisions to be in </span><span>accordance with its fiduciary obligations. For a more detailed discussion of these policies and procedures, see the </span><span>Proxy </span><span>Voting Policy</span><span> section of this SAI.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>It is also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients (including other funds and separately </span><span>managed accounts) may, subject to compliance with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of a Fund. Increasing a Fund’s </span><span>assets may enhance liquidity, investment flexibility and diversification and may contribute to economies of scale that tend to </span><span>reduce the Fund's expense ratio. BlackRock reserves the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to sell into the </span><span>market or redeem in Creation Units through an Authorized Participant at any time some or all of the shares of a Fund </span><span>acquired for its own accounts or the account of a BlackRock advisory client. A large sale or redemption of shares of a Fund by </span><span>BlackRock itself or a BlackRock advisory client could significantly reduce the asset size of the Fund, which might have an </span><span>adverse effect on the Fund's liquidity, investment flexibility, portfolio diversification, expense ratio or ability to comply with the </span><span>listing requirements for the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>It is possible that a Fund may invest in securities of, or engage in transactions with, companies in which BlackRock has </span><span>significant debt or equity investments or other interests. A Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by </span><span>entities for which BlackRock provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the </span><span>sale of such issuances. In making investment decisions for a Fund, BlackRock is not permitted to obtain or use material non-public</span><span> information acquired by any unit of BlackRock in the course of these activities. In addition, from time to time, the </span><span>activities of BlackRock may limit a Fund's flexibility in purchases and sales of securities. As indicated below, BlackRock may </span><span>engage in transactions with companies in which BlackRock-advised funds or other clients of BlackRock have an investment.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock, its personnel and other financial service providers may have interests in promoting sales of the Funds. With </span><span>respect to BlackRock and its personnel, the remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of the Funds or </span><span>other products may be greater than remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of certain funds or other </span><span>products that might be provided or offered. BlackRock and its sales personnel may directly or indirectly receive a portion of </span><span>the fees and commissions charged to the Funds or their shareholders. BlackRock and its advisory or other personnel may </span><span>also benefit from increased amounts of assets under management. Fees and commissions may also be higher than for other </span><span>products or services, and the remuneration and profitability to BlackRock and such personnel resulting from transactions on </span><span>behalf of or management of the Funds may be greater than the remuneration and profitability resulting from other funds or </span><span>products.</span></div> <div><span>Third parties, including service providers to BlackRock or a Fund, may sponsor events (including, but not limited to, </span><span>marketing and promotional activities and presentations, educational training programs and conferences) for registered </span><span>representatives, other professionals and individual investors. There is a potential conflict of interest as such sponsorships </span><span>may defray the costs of such activities to BlackRock, and may provide an incentive to BlackRock to retain such third parties to </span><span>provide services to a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may provide valuation assistance to certain clients with respect to certain securities or other investments and the </span><span>valuation recommendations made for such clients' accounts may differ from the valuations for the same securities or </span><span>investments assigned by a Fund's pricing vendors, especially if such valuations are based on broker-dealer quotes or other </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>104</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>data sources unavailable to the Fund's pricing vendors. While BlackRock will generally communicate its valuation information </span><span>or determinations to a Fund's pricing vendors and/or fund accountants, there may be instances where the Fund's pricing </span><span>vendors or fund accountants assign a different valuation to a security or other investment than the valuation for such </span><span>security or investment determined or recommended by BlackRock.</span></div> <div><span>As disclosed in more detail in the </span><span>Determination of Net Asset Value</span><span> section in this SAI, when market quotations are not </span><span>readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, each Fund’s investments are valued at fair value by BFA. BFA has been </span><span>designated as each Fund’s valuation designee pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act and acts through </span><span>BFA’s Rule 2a-5 Committee (the </span><span>“</span><span>2a-5 Committee</span><span>”</span><span>), with assistance from other BFA pricing committees and in accordance </span><span>with BFA’s policies and procedures (the </span><span>“</span><span>Valuation Procedures</span><span>”</span><span>). When determining a </span><span>“</span><span>fair value price,</span><span>”</span><span> the 2a-5 Committee </span><span>seeks to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or liability in </span><span>an arm’s-length transaction. The price generally may not be determined based on what a Fund might reasonably expect to </span><span>receive for selling an asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. While fair value </span><span>determinations will be based upon all available factors that BFA deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be </span><span>based on analytical values determined by BFA using proprietary or third-party valuation models, fair value represents only a </span><span>good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in </span><span>retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair </span><span>values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a </span><span>holding or holdings are valued by the 2a-5 Committee at fair value, may have the effect of diluting or increasing the economic </span><span>interest of existing shareholders and may affect the amount of revenue received by BFA with respect to services for which it </span><span>receives an asset-based fee.</span></div> <div><span>To the extent permitted by applicable law, a Fund may invest all or some of its short-term cash investments in any money </span><span>market fund or similarly-managed private fund advised or managed by BlackRock. In connection with any such investments, </span><span>a Fund, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, may pay its share of expenses of a money market fund or other similarly-managed</span><span> private fund in which it invests, which may result in a Fund bearing some additional expenses.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock and its directors, officers and employees, may buy and sell securities or other investments for their own accounts </span><span>and may have conflicts of interest with respect to investments made on behalf of a Fund. As a result of differing trading and </span><span>investment strategies or constraints, positions may be taken by directors, officers and employees that are the same, different </span><span>from or made at different times than positions taken for the Fund. To lessen the possibility that a Fund will be adversely </span><span>affected by this personal trading, each Fund, BFA and BlackRock have each adopted a code of ethics in compliance with </span><span>Section 17(j) of the 1940 Act that restricts securities trading in the personal accounts of investment professionals and others </span><span>who normally come into possession of information regarding a Fund's portfolio transactions. Each code of ethics is available </span><span>by contacting BlackRock at the telephone number on the back cover of each Fund’s Prospectus or by accessing the EDGAR </span><span>Database on the SEC's Internet site at http://www.sec.gov, and copies may be obtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by </span><span>e-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock will not purchase securities or other property from, or sell securities or other property to, a Fund, except that a </span><span>Fund may in accordance with rules or guidance adopted under the 1940 Act engage in transactions with another Fund or </span><span>accounts that are affiliated with a Fund as a result of common officers, directors, or investment advisers or pursuant to </span><span>exemptive orders granted to the Funds and/or BlackRock by the SEC. These transactions would be effected in circumstances </span><span>in which BlackRock determined that it would be appropriate for a Fund to purchase and another client of BlackRock to sell, or </span><span>a Fund to sell and another client of BlackRock to purchase, the same security or instrument on the same day. From time to </span><span>time, the activities of a Fund may be restricted because of regulatory requirements applicable to BlackRock and/or </span><span>BlackRock's internal policies designed to comply with, limit the applicability of, or otherwise relate to such requirements. A </span><span>client not advised by BlackRock would not be subject to some of those considerations. There may be periods when </span><span>BlackRock may not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions, or may otherwise restrict or limit its advice in certain </span><span>securities or instruments issued by or related to companies for which BlackRock is performing advisory or other services or </span><span>has proprietary positions. For example, when BlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or risk management services for a </span><span>company, BlackRock may be prohibited from or limited in purchasing or selling securities of that company on behalf of a </span><span>Fund, particularly where such services result in BlackRock obtaining material non-public information about the company </span><span>(</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, in connection with participation in a creditors’ committee). Similar situations could arise if personnel of BlackRock serve </span><span>as directors of companies the securities of which a Fund wishes to purchase or sell. However, if permitted by applicable law, </span><span>and where consistent with BlackRock’s policies and procedures (including the necessary implementation of appropriate </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>105</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>information barriers), the Funds may purchase securities or instruments that are issued by such companies, are the subject </span><span>of an advisory or risk management assignment by BlackRock, or where personnel of BlackRock are directors or officers of the </span><span>issuer.</span></div> <div><span>The investment activities of BlackRock for its proprietary accounts and for client accounts may also limit the investment </span><span>strategies and rights of the Funds. For example, in certain circumstances where the Funds invest in securities issued by </span><span>companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or international markets, or are subject to </span><span>corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or invest in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits </span><span>on the aggregate amount invested by BlackRock for their proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Funds) </span><span>that may not be exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if exceeded, may cause </span><span>BlackRock, the Funds or other client accounts to suffer disadvantages or business restrictions.</span></div> <div><span>If certain aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either through the actions of BlackRock or a Fund or as a result of </span><span>third-party transactions, the ability of BlackRock, on behalf of clients (including the Funds), to purchase or dispose of </span><span>investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. As </span><span>a result, BlackRock, on behalf of its clients (including the Funds), may limit purchases, sell existing investments, or otherwise </span><span>restrict, forgo or limit the exercise of rights (including transferring, outsourcing or limiting voting rights or forgoing the right </span><span>to receive dividends) when BlackRock, in its sole discretion, deems it appropriate in light of potential regulatory or other </span><span>restrictions on ownership or other consequences resulting from reaching investment thresholds.</span></div> <div><span>In those circumstances where ownership thresholds or limitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks to allocate limited </span><span>investment opportunities equitably among clients (including the Funds), taking into consideration benchmark weight and </span><span>investment strategy. BlackRock has adopted certain controls designed to prevent the occurrence of a breach of any </span><span>applicable ownership threshold or limits, including, for example, when ownership in certain securities nears an applicable </span><span>threshold, BlackRock may remove such securities from the list of Deposit Securities to be delivered to the Fund in connection </span><span>with purchases of Creation Units of such Fund and may limit purchases in such securities to the issuer's weighting in the </span><span>applicable benchmark used by BlackRock to manage such Fund. If client (including Fund) holdings of an issuer exceed an </span><span>applicable threshold and BlackRock is unable to obtain relief to enable the continued holding of such investments, it may be </span><span>necessary to sell down these positions to meet the applicable limitations. In these cases, benchmark overweight positions </span><span>will be sold prior to benchmark positions being reduced to meet applicable limitations.</span></div> <div><span>In addition to the foregoing, other ownership thresholds may trigger reporting requirements to governmental and regulatory </span><span>authorities, and such reports may entail the disclosure of the identity of a client or BlackRock’s intended strategy with respect </span><span>to such security or asset.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may not serve as an Authorized Participant in the creation and redemption of iShares ETFs.</span></div> <div><span>Under an ETF Services Agreement, certain Funds have retained BRIL, an Affiliate of BFA, to perform certain order processing, </span><span>Authorized Participant communications, and related services in connection with the issuance and redemption of Creation </span><span>Units of the Funds (</span><span>“</span><span>ETF Services</span><span>”</span><span>). BRIL will retain a portion of the standard transaction fee received from Authorized </span><span>Participants on each creation or redemption order from the Authorized Participant for the ETF Services provided. BlackRock </span><span>collaborated with, and received payment from, Citibank, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>Citibank</span><span>”</span><span>) on the design and development of the ETF Services </span><span>platform. Citibank may have, or from time to time may develop, additional relationships with BlackRock or funds managed by </span><span>BFA and its affiliates.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may maintain securities indices. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, the Funds may seek to license and use </span><span>such indices as part of their investment strategy. Index based funds that seek to track the performance of securities indices </span><span>also may use the name of the index or index provider in the fund name. Index providers, including BlackRock (to the extent </span><span>permitted by applicable law), may be paid licensing fees for use of their index or index name. BlackRock may benefit from the </span><span>Funds using BlackRock indices by creating increasing acceptance in the marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is not </span><span>obligated to license its indices to a Fund and the Funds are under no obligation to use BlackRock indices. Any Fund that </span><span>enters into a license for a BlackRock index cannot be assured that the terms of any index licensing agreement with BlackRock </span><span>will be as favorable as those terms offered to other licensees.</span></div> <div><span>The custody arrangement described in </span><span>“</span><span>Investment Advisory, Administrative and Distribution Services</span><span>”</span><span> may lead to potential </span><span>conflicts of interest with BlackRock where BlackRock has agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse ordinary operating expenses </span><span>in order to cap expenses of the Funds (or where BlackRock charges a unitary management fee). This is because the custody </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>106</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>arrangements with certain Funds' custodian may have the effect of reducing custody fees when the Funds leave cash </span><span>balances uninvested. This could be viewed as having the potential to provide BlackRock an incentive to keep high positive </span><span>cash balances for Funds in order to offset fund custody fees that BlackRock might otherwise reimburse or pay. However, </span><span>BlackRock’s portfolio managers do not intentionally keep uninvested balances high, but rather make investment decisions </span><span>that they anticipate will be beneficial to fund performance. For funds without a unitary management fee, when a fund’s </span><span>actual operating expense ratio exceeds a stated cap, a reduction in custody fees reduces the amount of waivers and/or </span><span>reimbursements BlackRock would be required to make to the fund.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may enter into contractual arrangements with third-party service providers to a Fund (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, custodians, </span><span>administrators and index providers) pursuant to which BlackRock receives fee discounts or concessions in recognition of </span><span>BlackRock’s overall relationship with such service providers. BlackRock may also enter into contractual arrangements with </span><span>such service providers pursuant to which BlackRock incurs additional costs if the service provider’s services are terminated </span><span>with respect to a Fund. To the extent that BlackRock is responsible for paying these service providers out of its management </span><span>fee, the benefits of any such fee discounts or concessions, or any additional costs, may accrue, in whole or in part, to </span><span>BlackRock, which could result in conflicts of interest relating to the use or termination of service providers to a Fund.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock owns or has an ownership interest in certain trading, portfolio management, operations and/or information </span><span>systems used by Fund service providers. These systems are, or will be, used by a Fund service provider in connection with the </span><span>provision of services to accounts managed by BlackRock and funds managed and sponsored by BlackRock, including the </span><span>Funds, that engage the service provider (typically the custodian). A Fund’s service provider remunerates BlackRock for the </span><span>use of the systems. A Fund service provider’s payments to BlackRock for the use of these systems may enhance the </span><span>profitability of BlackRock.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock’s receipt of fees from a service provider in connection with the use of systems provided by BlackRock may create </span><span>an incentive for BlackRock to recommend that a Fund enter into or renew an arrangement with the service provider.</span></div> <div><span>In recognition of a BlackRock client’s overall relationship with BlackRock, BlackRock may offer special pricing arrangements </span><span>for certain services provided by BlackRock. Any such special pricing arrangements will not apply to the client’s investment in </span><span>a Fund.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Present and future activities of BlackRock (including BFA), its directors, officers and employees, in addition to those described </span><span>in this section, may give rise to additional conflicts of interest.</span></div> <div><span>Investment Advisory, Administrative and </span><span>Distribution Services</span></div> <div><span>Investment Adviser. </span><span> </span><span>BFA serves as investment adviser to each Fund pursuant to an investment advisory agreement between </span><span>the Trust, on behalf of each Fund, and BFA. BFA is a California corporation indirectly owned by BlackRock, Inc. and is </span><span>registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Under the investment advisory </span><span>agreement, BFA, subject to the supervision of the Board and in conformity with the stated investment policies of each Fund, </span><span>manages and administers the Trust and the investment of each Fund’s assets. BFA is responsible for placing purchase and </span><span>sale orders and providing continuous supervision of the investment portfolio of each Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Pursuant to the investment advisory agreement, BFA may, from time to time, in its sole discretion and to the extent permitted </span><span>by applicable law, appoint one or more sub-advisers, including, without limitation, affiliates of BFA, to perform investment </span><span>advisory or other services with respect to a Fund. In addition, BFA may delegate certain of its investment advisory functions </span><span>under the investment advisory agreement to one or more of its affiliates to the extent permitted by applicable law. BFA may </span><span>terminate any or all sub-advisers or such delegation arrangements in its sole discretion upon appropriate notice at any time </span><span>to the extent permitted by applicable law.</span></div> <div><span>BFA is responsible, under the investment advisory agreement, for substantially all expenses of the Funds, including the cost </span><span>of transfer agency, custody, fund administration, legal, audit and other services. BFA is not responsible for, and the Funds will </span><span>bear, the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of </span><span>portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or </span><span>expenses, and litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of the Independent Trustees).</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>107</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

BFA Entities also make payments to Intermediaries for certain printing, publishing and mailing costs or materials </span><span>relating to the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products (</span><span>“</span><span>Publishing Costs</span><span>”</span><span>). In addition, BFA Entities make </span><span>payments to Intermediaries that make shares of the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products available to </span><span>their clients, in some cases at a waived or reduced commission rate or ticket charge, develop new products that feature </span><span>iShares, create educational content about the Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products that is featured on an </span><span>Intermediary’s platform, or otherwise promote the Funds, other iShares funds and exchange-traded products. BFA Entities </span><span>may also reimburse expenses or make payments from their own assets to Intermediaries or other persons in consideration of </span><span>services or other activities that the BFA Entities believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in the Funds, </span><span>other iShares funds or exchange-traded products. Payments of the type described above are sometimes referred to as </span><span>revenue-sharing payments.</span></div> <div><span>Payments to an Intermediary may be significant to the Intermediary, and amounts that Intermediaries pay to your </span><span>salesperson or other investment professional may also be significant for your salesperson or other investment professional. </span><span>Because an Intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it will recommend or make available to its </span><span>clients, what services to provide for various products, or what marketing content to make available to its clients based on </span><span>payments it receives or is eligible to receive, such payments may create conflicts of interest between the Intermediary and its </span><span>clients. These financial incentives may cause the Intermediary to recommend the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded</span><span> products, or otherwise promote the Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products over other investments. </span><span>The same conflicts of interest and financial incentives exist with respect to your salesperson or other investment professional </span><span>if he or she receives similar payments from his or her Intermediary firm.</span></div> <div><span>In addition to the payments described above, BFA Entities have developed proprietary tools, calculators and related </span><span>interactive or digital content that is made available through the www.BlackRock.com website at no additional cost to </span><span>Intermediaries. BlackRock may configure these tools and calculators and localize the content for Intermediaries as part of its </span><span>customary digital marketing support and promotion of the Funds, other iShares funds, exchange-traded products and </span><span>BlackRock mutual funds.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>As of March 1, 2013, BFA Entities have contractual arrangements to make payments (in addition to payments for Education </span><span>Costs or Publishing Costs) to one Intermediary, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC (</span><span>“</span><span>FBS</span><span>”</span><span>). Effective June 4, 2016, this </span><span>relationship was expanded to include National Financial Services, LLC (</span><span>“</span><span>NFS</span><span>”</span><span>), an affiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this special, </span><span>long-term and significant arrangement (the </span><span>“</span><span>Marketing Program</span><span>”</span><span>), FBS, NFS and certain of their affiliates (collectively </span><span>“</span><span>Fidelity</span><span>”</span><span>) have agreed, among other things, to actively promote iShares funds to customers, investment professionals and </span><span>other intermediaries and in advertising campaigns as the preferred exchange-traded product, to offer certain iShares funds in </span><span>certain Fidelity platforms and investment programs, in some cases at a waived or reduced commission rate or ticket charge, </span><span>and to provide marketing data to BFA Entities. BFA Entities have agreed to facilitate the Marketing Program by, among other </span><span>things, making certain payments to FBS and NFS for marketing and implementing certain brokerage and investment </span><span>programs. Upon termination of the arrangement, the BFA Entities will make additional payments to FBS and/or NFS based </span><span>upon a number of criteria, including the overall success of the Marketing Program and the level of services provided by FBS </span><span>and NFS during the wind-down period.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, BFA Entities may enter into other contractual arrangements with Intermediaries and certain other third parties </span><span>that the BFA Entities believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in iShares funds. Such agreements may </span><span>include payments by BFA Entities to such Intermediaries and third parties for data collection and provision, technology </span><span>support, platform enhancement, or educational content, co-marketing and cross-promotional efforts. Payments made </span><span>pursuant to such arrangements may vary in any year and may be different for different Intermediaries and third parties. In </span><span>certain cases, the payments to Intermediaries are subject to certain minimum payment levels or tiered payments. As of the </span><span>date of this SAI, the Intermediaries and other third parties receiving one or more types of the contractual payments described </span><span>above include (in addition to FBS and NFS): Advisor Credit Exchange, Avantax Investment Services, Inc., BNY Mellon Capital </span><span>Markets, LLC, BNY Mellon Performance &amp; Risk Analytics, LLC, Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Inc., Clearstream Fund Centre AG, </span><span>Commonwealth Equity Services, LLC, Dorsey Wright and Associates, LLC, E*Trade Securities LLC, Envestnet Asset </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>140</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

Any additions, modifications, or deletions to Intermediaries and other </span><span>third parties listed above that have occurred since the date of this SAI are not included in the list.</span></div> <div><span>Further, BFA Entities make Education Costs and Publishing Costs payments to other Intermediaries that are not listed in the </span><span>immediately preceding paragraph. BFA Entities may determine to make such payments based on any number of metrics. For </span><span>example, BFA Entities may make payments at year-end or other intervals in a fixed amount, an amount based upon an </span><span>Intermediary’s services at defined levels or an amount based on the Intermediary’s net sales of one or more iShares funds in a </span><span>year or other period, any of which arrangements may include an agreed-upon minimum or maximum payment, or any </span><span>combination of the foregoing. As of the date of this SAI, BFA anticipates that the payments paid by BFA Entities in connection </span><span>with the Funds, iShares funds and exchange-traded products in general will be immaterial to BFA Entities in the aggregate for </span><span>the next year. </span><span>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such </span><span>payments or financial incentives his or her Intermediary firm may receive. Any payments made, or financial incentives </span><span>offered, by the BFA Entities to an Intermediary may create the incentive for the Intermediary to encourage customers to </span><span>buy shares of the Funds, other iShares funds or other exchange-traded products.</span></div> <div><span>The Funds may participate in certain market maker incentive programs of a national securities exchange in which an affiliate </span><span>of the Funds would pay a fee to the exchange used for the purpose of incentivizing one or more market makers in the </span><span>securities of a Fund to enhance the liquidity and quality of the secondary market of securities of a Fund. The fee would then </span><span>be credited by the exchange to one or more market makers that meet or exceed liquidity and market quality standards with </span><span>respect to the securities of a Fund. Each market maker incentive program is subject to approval from the SEC. Any such fee </span><span>payments made to an exchange will be made by an affiliate of a Fund solely for the benefit of a Fund and will not be paid </span><span>from any Fund assets. Other funds managed by BFA may also participate in such programs.</span></div> <div><span>Determination of Net Asset Value</span></div> <div><span>Valuation of Shares. </span><span>The NAV for each Fund is generally calculated as of the close of regular trading hours on the NYSE </span><span>(normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time) on each business day the NYSE is open. Valuation of assets held by a Fund is as follows:</span></div> <div><span>Equity Investments. </span><span>Equity securities traded on a recognized securities exchange (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, NYSE), on separate trading boards of a </span><span>securities exchange or through a market system that provides contemporaneous transaction pricing information (each an </span><span>“</span><span>Exchange</span><span>”</span><span>) are valued using information obtained via independent pricing services, generally at the closing price or, if an </span><span>Exchange closing price is not available, the last traded price on that Exchange prior to the time as of which the assets or </span><span>liabilities are valued. However, under certain circumstances, other means of determining current market value may be used. If </span><span>an equity security is traded on more than one Exchange, the current market value of the security where it is primarily traded </span><span>generally will be used. In the event that there are no sales involving an equity security held by a Fund on a day on which a </span><span>Fund values such security, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BFA determines that such prior day’s price no longer </span><span>reflects the fair value of the security, in which case such asset would be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below).</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Options, Futures, Swaps and Other Derivatives. </span><span>Exchange-traded equity options (except those that are customized) for </span><span>which market quotations are readily available are valued at the mean of the last bid and ask prices as quoted on the </span><span>Exchange or the board of trade on which such options are traded. In the event that there is no mean price available for an </span><span>exchange traded equity option held by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values such option, the last bid (long positions) or </span><span>ask (short positions) price, if available, will be used as the value of such option. If no bid or ask price is available on a day on </span><span>which a Fund values such option, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BFA determines that such prior day’s price no </span><span>longer reflects the fair value of the option, in which case such option will be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below). </span><span>Customized exchange-traded equity options, as well as OTC derivatives, may be valued using a mathematical model which </span><span>may incorporate a number of market data factors. Financial futures contracts and options thereon, which are traded on </span><span>exchanges, are valued at their last sale price or settle price as of the close of such exchanges. Swap agreements and other </span><span>derivatives are generally valued daily based upon quotations from market makers or by a pricing service in accordance with </span><span>the Valuation Procedures.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>141</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Underlying Funds. </span><span>Shares of underlying open-end funds (including money market funds) are valued at NAV. Shares of </span><span>underlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs will be valued at their most recent closing price.</span></div> <div><span>General Valuation Information. </span><span>Prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services, broker-dealers or market </span><span>makers to value a Fund’s securities and other assets and liabilities are based on information available at the time a Fund </span><span>values its assets and liabilities. In the event that a pricing service quotation is revised or updated subsequent to the day on </span><span>which a Fund valued such security, the revised pricing service quotation generally will be applied prospectively. Such </span><span>determination will be made considering pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding the revision.</span></div> <div><span>The price a Fund could receive upon the sale of any particular portfolio investment may differ from a Fund’s valuation of the </span><span>investment, particularly for assets that trade in thin or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair valuation methodology </span><span>or a price provided by an independent pricing service. As a result, the price received upon the sale of an investment may be </span><span>less than the value ascribed by a Fund, and a Fund could realize a greater than expected loss or lesser than expected gain </span><span>upon the sale of the investment. A Fund’s ability to value its investment may also be impacted by technological issues and/or </span><span>errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</span></div> <div><span>All cash, receivables and current payables are carried on a Fund’s books at their fair value.</span></div> <div><span>In the event that application of the methods of valuation discussed above result in a price for a security which is deemed not </span><span>to be representative of the fair market value of such security, the security will be valued by, under the direction of or in </span><span>accordance with a method approved by BFA, each Fund’s valuation designee, as reflecting fair value. All other assets and </span><span>liabilities (including securities for which market quotations are not readily available) held by a Fund (including restricted </span><span>securities) are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by BFA pursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any assets and </span><span>liabilities which are denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates.</span></div> <div><span>Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate </span><span>a Fund’s NAV and the prices used in the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between a Fund’s </span><span>performance and the performance of the Underlying Index.</span></div> <div><span>Fair Value.</span><span> When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, a Fund’s investments are </span><span>valued at fair value (</span><span>“</span><span>Fair Value Assets</span><span>”</span><span>). Fair Value Assets are valued by BFA in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. </span><span>Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act, the Board of Trustees has designated BFA as the valuation </span><span>designee for the respective Funds for which it serves as investment adviser. BFA may reasonably conclude that a market </span><span>quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if, among other things, a security or other asset or liability does not have a </span><span>price source due to its complete lack of trading, if BFA believes a market quotation from a broker-dealer or other source is </span><span>unreliable (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, where it varies significantly from a recent trade, or no longer reflects the fair value of the security or other </span><span>asset or liability subsequent to the most recent market quotation), or where the security or other asset or liability is only </span><span>thinly traded or due to the occurrence of a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation. For this </span><span>purpose, a </span><span>“</span><span>significant event</span><span>”</span><span> is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment, that an event has </span><span>occurred after the close of trading for an asset or liability but prior to or at the time of pricing a Fund’s assets or liabilities, is </span><span>likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or closing market price of one or more assets held by, or </span><span>liabilities of, a Fund. On any day the NYSE is open and a foreign market or the primary exchange on which a foreign asset or </span><span>liability is traded is closed, such asset or liability will be valued using the prior day’s price, provided that BFA is not aware of </span><span>any significant event or other information that would cause such price to no longer reflect the fair value of the asset or </span><span>liability, in which case such asset or liability would be treated as a Fair Value Asset.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>For certain foreign assets, a third-party vendor supplies evaluated, systematic fair value pricing based upon the movement of </span><span>a proprietary multi-factor model after the relevant foreign markets have closed. This systematic fair value pricing </span><span>methodology is designed to correlate the prices of foreign assets in one or more non-U.S. markets following the close of the </span><span>local markets to the prices that might have prevailed as of a Fund’s pricing time.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BFA’s Rule 2a-5 Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving methodologies by investment type and significant </span><span>inputs used in the fair valuation of Fund assets or liabilities. In addition, a Fund’s accounting agent assists BFA by periodically </span><span>endeavoring to confirm the prices it receives from all third-party pricing services, index providers and broker-dealers and </span><span>regularly evaluating the values assigned to the securities and other assets and liabilities of a Fund. The pricing of all Fair Value </span><span>Assets is subsequently reported to the Board or a committee thereof.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>142</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>When determining the price for a Fair Value Asset, BFA will seek to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect </span><span>to receive from the current sale of that asset or liability in an arm’s-length transaction on the date on which the asset or </span><span>liability is being valued, and does not seek to determine the price a Fund might reasonably expect to receive for selling an </span><span>asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. Fair value determinations will be based upon all </span><span>available factors that BFA deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be based on analytical values determined </span><span>by BFA using proprietary or third-party valuation models.</span></div> <div><span>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. When determining the fair value of an </span><span>investment, one or more fair value methodologies may be used (depending on certain factors, including the asset type). For </span><span>example, the investment may be initially priced based on the original cost of the investment or, alternatively, using proprietary </span><span>or third-party models that may rely upon one or more unobservable inputs. Prices of actual, executed or historical </span><span>transactions in the relevant investment (or comparable instruments) or, where appropriate, an appraisal by a third-party </span><span>experienced in the valuation of similar instruments, may also be used as a basis for establishing the fair value of an </span><span>investment.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could </span><span>have been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a </span><span>Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a holding or holdings are valued at fair value, may have the </span><span>effect of diluting or increasing the economic interest of existing shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund’s annual audited financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally </span><span>accepted in the United States of America (</span><span>“</span><span>US GAAP</span><span>”</span><span>), follow the requirements for valuation set forth in Financial </span><span>Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, </span><span>“</span><span>Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>ASC 820</span><span>”</span><span>), which defines and establishes a framework for measuring fair value under US GAAP and expands financial </span><span>statement disclosure requirements relating to fair value measurements.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Generally, ASC 820 and other accounting rules applicable to funds and various assets in which they invest are evolving. Such </span><span>changes may adversely affect a Fund. For example, the evolution of rules governing the determination of the fair market </span><span>value of assets or liabilities, to the extent such rules become more stringent, would tend to increase the cost and/or reduce </span><span>the availability of third-party determinations of fair market value. This may in turn increase the costs associated with selling </span><span>assets or affect their liquidity due to a Fund’s inability to obtain a third-party determination of fair market value.</span></div> <div><span>Brokerage Transactions</span></div> <div><span>Subject to policies established by the Board, BFA is primarily responsible for the execution of a Fund’s portfolio transactions </span><span>and the allocation of brokerage. BFA does not execute transactions through any particular broker or dealer, but seeks to </span><span>obtain the best net results for the Funds, taking into account such factors as price (including the applicable brokerage </span><span>commission or dealer spread), size of order, difficulty of execution, operational facilities of the firm and the firm’s risk and skill </span><span>in positioning blocks of securities. While BFA generally seeks reasonable trade execution costs, a Fund does not necessarily </span><span>pay the lowest spread or commission available, and payment of the lowest commission or spread is not necessarily </span><span>consistent with obtaining the best price and execution in particular transactions. Subject to applicable legal requirements, </span><span>BFA may select a broker based partly upon brokerage or research services provided to BFA and its clients, including a Fund. In </span><span>return for such services, BFA may cause a Fund to pay a higher commission than other brokers would charge if BFA </span><span>determines in good faith that the commission is reasonable in relation to the services provided.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>In selecting brokers or dealers to execute portfolio transactions, BFA seeks to obtain the best price and most favorable </span><span>execution for a Fund and may take into account a variety of factors including: (i) the size, nature and character of the security </span><span>or instrument being traded and the markets in which it is purchased or sold; (ii) the desired timing of the transaction; (iii) </span><span>BFA’s knowledge of the expected commission rates and spreads currently available; (iv) the activity existing and expected in </span><span>the market for the particular security or instrument, including any anticipated execution difficulties; (v) the full range of </span><span>brokerage services provided; (vi) the broker’s or dealer’s capital; (vii) the quality of research and research services provided; </span><span>(viii) the reasonableness of the commission, dealer spread or its equivalent for the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA’s </span><span>knowledge of any actual or apparent operational problems of a broker or dealer.

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act (</span><span>“</span><span>Section 28(e)</span><span>”</span><span>) permits a U.S. investment adviser, under certain circumstances, to cause an </span><span>account to pay a broker or dealer a commission for effecting a transaction in securities that exceeds the amount another </span><span>broker or dealer would have charged for effecting the same transaction in recognition of the value of brokerage and research </span><span>services provided by that broker or dealer. This includes commissions paid on riskless principal transactions in securities </span><span>under certain conditions.</span></div> <div><span>From time to time, a Fund may purchase new issues of securities in a fixed price offering. In these situations, the broker may </span><span>be a member of the selling group that will, in addition to selling securities, provide BFA with research services. FINRA has </span><span>adopted rules expressly permitting these types of arrangements under certain circumstances. Generally, the broker will </span><span>provide research </span><span>“</span><span>credits</span><span>”</span><span> in these situations at a rate that is higher than that available for typical secondary market </span><span>transactions. These arrangements may not fall within the safe harbor of Section 28(e).</span></div> <div><span>The Funds anticipate that brokerage transactions involving foreign equity securities generally will be conducted primarily on </span><span>the principal stock exchanges of the applicable country. Foreign equity securities may be held by the Funds in the form of </span><span>depositary receipts, or other securities convertible into foreign equity securities. Depositary receipts may be listed on stock </span><span>exchanges, or traded in OTC markets in the U.S. or Europe, as the case may be. ADRs, like other securities traded in the U.S., </span><span>will be subject to negotiated commission rates.</span></div> <div><span>OTC issues, including most fixed-income securities such as corporate debt and U.S. Government securities, are normally </span><span>traded on a </span><span>“</span><span>net</span><span>”</span><span> basis without a stated commission, through dealers acting for their own account and not as brokers. The </span><span>Funds will primarily engage in transactions with these dealers or deal directly with the issuer unless a better price or </span><span>execution could be obtained by using a broker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect to both foreign and domestic securities </span><span>will generally include a </span><span>“</span><span>spread,</span><span>”</span><span> which is the difference between the prices at which the dealer is willing to purchase and sell </span><span>the specific security at the time, and includes the dealer’s normal profit.</span></div> <div><span>Under the 1940 Act, persons affiliated with a Fund and persons who are affiliated with such affiliated persons are prohibited </span><span>from dealing with the Fund as principal in the purchase and sale of securities unless a permissive order allowing such </span><span>transactions is obtained from the SEC. Since transactions in the OTC market usually involve transactions with the dealers </span><span>acting as principal for their own accounts, the Funds will not deal with affiliated persons and affiliated persons of such </span><span>affiliated persons in connection with such transactions. The Funds will not purchase securities during the existence of any </span><span>underwriting or selling group relating to such securities of which BFA, BRIL or any affiliated person (as defined in the 1940 </span><span>Act) thereof is a member except pursuant to procedures adopted by the Board in accordance with Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 </span><span>Act.</span></div> <div><span>Purchases of money market instruments by the Funds are made from dealers, underwriters and issuers. The Funds do not </span><span>currently expect to incur any brokerage commission expense on such transactions because money market instruments are </span><span>generally traded on a </span><span>“</span><span>net</span><span>”</span><span> basis with dealers acting as principal for their own accounts without a stated commission. The </span><span>price of the security, however, usually includes a profit to the dealer.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BFA may, from time to time, effect trades on behalf of and for the account of the Funds with brokers or dealers that are </span><span>affiliated with BFA, in conformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under these provisions, </span><span>any commissions paid to affiliated brokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by </span><span>other brokers or dealers in comparable transactions.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Securities purchased in underwritten offerings include a fixed amount of compensation to the underwriter, generally referred </span><span>to as the underwriter’s concession or discount. When securities are purchased or sold directly from or to an issuer, no </span><span>commissions or discounts are paid.</span></div> <div><span>Investment decisions for the Funds and for other investment accounts managed by BFA and the other Affiliates are made </span><span>independently of each other in light of differing conditions. A variety of factors will be considered in making investment </span><span>allocations. These factors include: (i) investment objectives or strategies for particular accounts, including sector, industry, </span><span>country or region and capitalization weightings; (ii) tax considerations of an account; (iii) risk or investment concentration </span><span>parameters for an account; (iv) supply or demand for a security at a given price level; (v) size of available investment; (vi) </span><span>cash availability and liquidity requirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory restrictions; (viii) minimum investment size of an </span><span>account; (ix) relative size of account; and (x) such other factors as may be approved by BlackRock’s general counsel. </span><span>Moreover, investments may not be allocated to one client account over another based on any of the following considerations: </span><span>(i) to favor one client account at the expense of another; (ii) to generate higher fees paid by one client account over another </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>144</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>or to produce greater performance compensation to BlackRock; (iii) to develop or enhance a relationship with a client or </span><span>prospective client; (iv) to compensate a client for past services or benefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce future services </span><span>or benefits to be rendered to BlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize investment performance among different client </span><span>accounts. BFA and the other Affiliates may deal, trade and invest for their own respective accounts in the types of securities </span><span>in which the Funds may invest.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Initial public offerings (</span><span>“</span><span>IPOs</span><span>”</span><span>) of securities may be over-subscribed and subsequently trade at a premium in the secondary </span><span>market. When BFA is given an opportunity to invest in such an initial offering or </span><span>“</span><span>new</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>hot</span><span>”</span><span> issue, the supply of securities </span><span>available for client accounts is often less than the amount of securities the accounts would otherwise take. In order to </span><span>allocate these investments fairly and equitably among client accounts over time, each portfolio manager or a member of his </span><span>or her respective investment team will indicate to BFA’s trading desk their level of interest in a particular offering with respect </span><span>to eligible clients’ accounts for which that team is responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities will be identified as eligible for </span><span>particular client accounts that are managed by portfolio teams who have indicated interest in the offering based on market </span><span>capitalization of the issuer of the security and the investment mandate of the client account and in the case of international </span><span>equity securities, the country where the offering is taking place and the investment mandate of the client account. Generally, </span><span>shares received during the IPO will be allocated among participating client accounts within each investment mandate on a </span><span>pro rata</span><span> basis. This </span><span>pro rata</span><span> allocation may result in a Fund receiving less of a particular security than if pro-rating had not </span><span>occurred. All allocations of securities will be subject, where relevant, to share minimums established for accounts and </span><span>compliance constraints. In situations where supply is too limited to be allocated among all accounts for which the </span><span>investment is eligible, portfolio managers may rotate such investment opportunities among one or more accounts so long as </span><span>the rotation system provides for fair access for all client accounts over time. Other allocation methodologies that are </span><span>considered by BFA to be fair and equitable to clients may be used as well.</span></div> <div><span>Because different accounts may have differing investment objectives and policies, BFA may buy and sell the same securities </span><span>at the same time for different clients based on the particular investment objective, guidelines and strategies of those </span><span>accounts. For example, BFA may decide that it may be entirely appropriate for a growth fund to sell a security at the same </span><span>time a value fund is buying that security. To the extent that transactions on behalf of more than one client of BFA or the other </span><span>Affiliates during the same period increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, </span><span>there may be an adverse effect on price. For example, sales of a security by BlackRock on behalf of one or more of its clients </span><span>may decrease the market price of such security, adversely impacting other BlackRock clients that still hold the security. If </span><span>purchases or sales of securities arise for consideration at or about the same time that would involve the Funds or other </span><span>clients or funds for which BFA or another Affiliate act as investment manager, transactions in such securities will be made, </span><span>insofar as feasible, for the respective funds and clients in a manner deemed equitable to all.</span></div> <div><span>In certain instances, BFA may find it efficient for purposes of seeking to obtain best execution, to aggregate or </span><span>“</span><span>bunch</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>certain contemporaneous purchases or sale orders of its advisory accounts and advisory accounts of affiliates. In general, all </span><span>contemporaneous trades for client accounts under management by the same portfolio manager or investment team will be </span><span>bunched in a single order if the trader believes the bunched trade would provide each client with an opportunity to achieve a </span><span>more favorable execution at a potentially lower execution cost. The costs associated with a bunched order will be shared </span><span>pro </span><span>rata</span><span> among the clients in the bunched order. Generally, if an order for a particular portfolio manager or management team is </span><span>filled at several different prices through multiple trades, all accounts participating in the order will receive the average price </span><span>(except in the case of certain international markets where average pricing is not permitted). While in some cases this practice </span><span>could have a detrimental effect upon the price or value of the security as far as the Funds are concerned, in other cases it </span><span>could be beneficial to the Funds. Transactions effected by BFA or the other Affiliates on behalf of more than one of its clients </span><span>during the same period may increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, </span><span>causing an adverse effect on price. The trader will give the bunched order to the broker-dealer that the trader has identified </span><span>as being able to provide the best execution of the order. Orders for purchase or sale of securities will be placed within a </span><span>reasonable amount of time of the order receipt and bunched orders will be kept bunched only long enough to execute the </span><span>order.</span></div> <div><span>The table below sets forth the brokerage commissions paid by each Fund for the fiscal years noted. Any differences in </span><span>brokerage commissions paid by a Fund from year to year are</span><span> </span><span>principally due to increases or decreases in that Fund’s assets </span><span>over those periods</span><span> </span><span>or the magnitude of changes to the components of a Fund's Underlying Index:</span></div> <div><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>145</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

Access to the DTC system is available to entities, </span><span>such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies, that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC </span><span>Participant, either directly or indirectly (</span><span>“</span><span>Indirect Participants</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> <div><span>Beneficial ownership of shares is limited to DTC Participants, Indirect Participants and persons holding interests through DTC </span><span>Participants and Indirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in shares (owners of such beneficial interests are </span><span>referred to herein as </span><span>“</span><span>Beneficial Owners</span><span>”</span><span>) is shown on, and the transfer of ownership is effected only through, records </span><span>maintained by DTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on the records of DTC Participants (with respect to Indirect </span><span>Participants and Beneficial Owners that are not DTC Participants). Beneficial Owners will receive from or through the DTC </span><span>Participant a written confirmation relating to their purchase of shares. The laws of some jurisdictions may require that certain </span><span>purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. Such laws may impair the ability of certain </span><span>investors to acquire beneficial interests in shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Conveyance of all notices, statements and other communications to Beneficial Owners is effected as follows. Pursuant to the </span><span>Depositary Agreement between the Trust and DTC, DTC is required to make available to the Trust upon request and for a fee </span><span>to be charged to the Trust a listing of the shares of each Fund held by each DTC Participant. The Trust shall inquire of each </span><span>such DTC Participant as to the number of Beneficial Owners holding shares, directly or indirectly, through such DTC </span><span>Participant. The Trust shall provide each such DTC Participant with copies of such notice, statement or other communication, </span><span>in such form, number and at such place as such DTC Participant may reasonably request, in order that such notice, </span><span>statement or communication may be transmitted by such DTC Participant, directly or indirectly, to such Beneficial Owners. In </span><span>addition, the Trust shall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair and reasonable amount as reimbursement for the expenses </span><span>attendant to such transmittal, all subject to applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.</span></div> <div><span>Share distributions shall be made to DTC or its nominee, Cede &amp; Co., as the registered holder of all shares of the Trust. DTC or </span><span>its nominee, upon receipt of any such distributions, shall credit immediately DTC Participants’ accounts with payments in </span><span>amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in shares of each Fund as shown on the records of DTC or its </span><span>nominee. Payments by DTC Participants to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners of shares held through such DTC </span><span>Participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for the </span><span>accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in a </span><span>“</span><span>street name,</span><span>”</span><span> and will be the responsibility of such DTC Participants.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The Trust has no responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or notices to Beneficial Owners, or </span><span>payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in such shares, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any </span><span>records relating to such beneficial ownership interests, or for any other aspect of the relationship between DTC and the DTC </span><span>Participants or the relationship between such DTC Participants and the Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners owning </span><span>through such DTC Participants. DTC may decide to discontinue providing its service with respect to shares of the Trust at any </span><span>time by giving reasonable notice to the Trust and discharging its responsibilities with respect thereto under applicable law. </span><span>Under such circumstances, the Trust shall take action to find a replacement for DTC to perform its functions at a comparable </span><span>cost.</span></div> <div><span>Distribution of Shares. </span><span> </span><span>In connection with each Fund's launch, each Fund was seeded through the sale of one or more </span><span>Creation Units by each Fund to one or more initial investors. Initial investors participating in the seeding may be Authorized </span><span>Participants, a lead market maker or other third party investor or an affiliate of each Fund or each Fund’s adviser. Each such </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>152</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

Each Fund will not receive any of the proceeds from the resale by the Selling Shareholders of these </span><span>shares.</span></div> <div><span>Selling Shareholders may sell shares owned by them directly or through broker-dealers, in accordance with applicable law, on </span><span>any national securities exchange on which the shares may be listed or quoted at the time of sale, through trading systems, in </span><span>the OTC market or in transactions other than on these exchanges or systems at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the </span><span>time of the sale, at varying prices determined at the time of sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales may be effected through </span><span>brokerage transactions, privately negotiated trades, block sales, entry into options or other derivatives transactions or </span><span>through any other means authorized by applicable law. Selling Shareholders may redeem the shares held in Creation Unit size </span><span>by them through an Authorized Participant.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Any Selling Shareholder and any broker-dealer or agents participating in the distribution of shares may be deemed to be </span><span>“</span><span>underwriters</span><span>”</span><span> within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the 1933 Act, in connection with such sales.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Any Selling Shareholder and any other person participating in such distribution will be subject to applicable provisions of the </span><span>1934 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.</span></div> <div><span>Creation and Redemption of Creation Units</span></div> <div><span>General. </span><span> </span><span>The Trust issues and sells shares of each Fund only in Creation Units on a continuous basis through the Distributor </span><span>or its agent, without a sales load, at a price based on the NAV next determined after receipt, on any Business Day (as defined </span><span>below), of an order received by the Distributor or its agent in proper form. On days when the</span><span> </span><span>applicable Listing Exchange </span><span>closes earlier than normal, the Funds may require orders to be placed earlier in the day. The following table sets forth the </span><span>number of shares of a Fund that constitute a Creation Unit for such Fund and the approximate value of such Creation Unit as </span><span>of April 30, 2023:</span><span> </span></div> <div><span> </span></div> <div> </div> <div>

As a result, purchase orders placed through an Authorized Participant may result in additional </span><span>charges to such investor. The Trust does not expect to enter into an Authorized Participant Agreement with more than a </span><span>small number of DTC Participants. A list of current Authorized Participants may be obtained from the Distributor. The </span><span>Distributor has adopted guidelines regarding Authorized Participants’ transactions in Creation Units that are made available </span><span>to all Authorized Participants. These guidelines set forth the processes and standards for Authorized Participants to transact </span><span>with the Distributor and its agents in connection with creation and redemption transactions. In addition, the Distributor may </span><span>be appointed as the proxy of the Authorized Participant and may be granted a power of attorney under its Authorized </span><span>Participant Agreement.</span></div> <div><span>Purchase Orders.</span><span>  </span><span> To initiate an order for a Creation Unit, an Authorized Participant must submit to the Distributor or its </span><span>agent an irrevocable order to purchase shares of a Fund, in proper form,</span><span> </span><span>generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any </span><span>Business Day to receive that day’s NAV.

Procedures and requirements governing the </span><span>delivery of the Fund Deposit are set forth in the procedures handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time </span><span>to time. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements for a creation request to be </span><span>made through an Authorized Participant.

Those placing </span><span>orders should ascertain the applicable deadline for cash transfers by contacting the operations department of the broker or </span><span>depositary institution effectuating the transfer of the Cash Component. This deadline is likely to be significantly earlier than </span><span>the Cutoff Time of the Funds.

Creation Orders </span><span>must be transmitted by an Authorized Participant in the form required by the Funds to the Distributor or its agent pursuant to </span><span>procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Economic or market disruptions or changes, or telephone or </span><span>other communication failure, may impede the ability to reach the Distributor or its agent or an Authorized Participant. Orders </span><span>to create shares of a Fund that are submitted on the Business Day immediately preceding a holiday or a day (other than a </span><span>weekend) when the equity markets in the relevant non-U.S. market are closed may not be accepted.

Purchase orders and redemption requests, if </span><span>accepted by the Trust, will be processed based on the NAV next determined after such acceptance in accordance with a </span><span>Fund's Cutoff Times as provided in the Authorized Participant Agreement and disclosed in this SAI.</span></div> <div><span>Acceptance of Orders for Creation Units.</span><span>  </span><span> Subject to the conditions that (i) an irrevocable purchase order has been </span><span>submitted by the Authorized Participant (either on its own or another investor's behalf) and (ii) arrangements satisfactory to </span><span>the Funds are in place for payment of the Cash Component and any other cash amounts which may be due, the Funds will </span><span>accept the order, subject to each Fund's right (and the right of the Distributor and BFA) to reject any order until acceptance, </span><span>as set forth below.</span></div> <div><span>Once a Fund has accepted an order, upon the next determination of the NAV of the shares, the Fund will confirm the </span><span>issuance of a Creation Unit, against receipt of payment, at such NAV.

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Each Fund reserves the right to reject or revoke a creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor or its agent provided that </span><span>a rejection or revocation of a creation order does not violate Rule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act. For example, a </span><span>Fund may reject or revoke a creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor or its agent if (i) the order is not in proper form; </span><span>(ii) the investor(s), upon obtaining the shares ordered, would own 80% or more of the currently outstanding shares of the </span><span>Fund; (iii) the Deposit Securities delivered do not conform to the identity and number of shares specified, as described above; </span><span>(iv) acceptance of the Deposit Securities is not legally required or would, in the opinion of counsel, be unlawful or have an </span><span>adverse effect on the Fund or its shareholders (</span><span>e.g</span><span>., jeopardize the Fund's tax status); or (v) circumstances outside the control </span><span>of the Fund, the Distributor or its agent and BFA make it impracticable to process purchase orders. The Distributor or its </span><span>agent shall notify a prospective purchaser of a Creation Unit and/or the Authorized Participant acting on behalf of such </span><span>purchaser of its rejection of such order. The Funds, State Street, JPMorgan, BNY Mellon or Citibank, as applicable, the sub-custodian</span><span> and the Distributor or its agent are under no duty, however, to give notification of any defects or irregularities in the </span><span>delivery of Fund Deposits nor shall any of them incur any liability for failure to give such notification.</span></div> <div><span>Issuance of a Creation Unit.</span><span>  </span><span> Except as provided herein, a Creation Unit will not be issued until the transfer of good title to </span><span>the applicable Fund of the Deposit Securities and the payment of the Cash Component have been completed. When the sub-custodian</span><span> has confirmed to the custodian that the securities included in the Fund Deposit (or the cash value thereof) have </span><span>been delivered to the account of the relevant sub-custodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor or its agent and BFA shall be </span><span>notified of such delivery and the applicable Fund will issue and cause the delivery of the Creation Unit. Creation Units are </span><span>generally issued on a </span><span>“</span><span>T+2 basis</span><span>”</span><span> (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, two Business Days after trade date). However, each Fund reserves the right to settle </span><span>Creation Unit transactions on a basis other than T+2, including a shorter settlement period, if necessary or appropriate under </span><span>the circumstances and compliant with applicable law. For example, each Fund reserves the right to settle Creation Unit </span><span>transactions on a basis other than T+2, in order to accommodate non-U.S. market holiday schedules to account for different </span><span>treatment among non-U.S. and U.S. markets of dividend record dates and ex-dividend dates (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the last day the holder of a </span><span>security can sell the security and still receive dividends payable on the security) and in certain other circumstances.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>To the extent contemplated by an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Distributor, each Fund will issue Creation Units </span><span>to such Authorized Participant, notwithstanding the fact that the corresponding Fund Deposits have not been received in </span><span>part or in whole, in reliance on the undertaking of the Authorized Participant to deliver the missing Deposit Securities as soon </span><span>as possible, which undertaking shall be secured by such Authorized Participant's delivery and maintenance of collateral as set </span><span>forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants. The Trust may use such collateral at any time to buy Deposit Securities for </span><span>the Funds. Such collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the contractual </span><span>settlement date. Information concerning the Funds' current procedures for collateralization of missing Deposit Securities is </span><span>available from the Distributor or its agent. The Authorized Participant Agreement will permit the Funds to buy the missing </span><span>Deposit Securities at any time and will subject the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the cost to the </span><span>Funds of purchasing such securities and the collateral including, without limitation, liability for related brokerage, borrowings </span><span>and other charges.</span></div> <div><span>In certain cases, Authorized Participants may create and redeem Creation Units on the same trade date and in these </span><span>instances, the Funds reserve the right to settle these transactions on a net basis or require a representation from the </span><span>Authorized Participants that the creation and redemption transactions are for separate beneficial owners. All questions as to </span><span>the number of shares of each security in the Deposit Securities and the validity, form, eligibility and acceptance for deposit of </span><span>any securities to be delivered shall be determined by each Fund and the Fund's determination shall be final and binding.</span></div> <div><span>Costs Associated with Creation Transactions.</span></div> <div><span>iShares Europe ETF, iShares International Developed Small Cap Value Factor ETF and iShares JPX-Nikkei 400 ETF</span></div> <div><span>A standard creation transaction fee is imposed to offset the transfer and other transaction costs associated with the issuance </span><span>of Creation Units. The standard creation transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized </span><span>Participant creates a Creation Unit, and is the same, regardless of the number of Creation Units purchased by the Authorized </span><span>Participant on the applicable Business Day.

Please see the </span><span>Cash Redemption Method</span><span> </span><span>section below and the following discussion summarizing the in-kind method for further information on redeeming Creation </span><span>Units of the Funds.</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund publishes the designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be </span><span>substituted) that will be applicable to redemption requests received in proper form (as defined below) on that day (</span><span>“</span><span>Fund </span><span>Securities</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>Redemption Basket</span><span>”</span><span>), and an amount of cash (the </span><span>“</span><span>Cash Amount,</span><span>”</span><span> as described below) in order to effect </span><span>redemptions of Creation Units of a Fund. Such Fund Securities and Cash Amount will remain in effect until such time as the </span><span>next announced composition of the Fund Securities and Cash Amount is made available.

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>redeemed, as next determined after the receipt of a redemption request in proper form, and the value of Fund Securities, less </span><span>a redemption transaction fee (as described below).</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The Trust may, in its sole discretion, substitute a </span><span>“</span><span>cash in lieu</span><span>”</span><span> amount to replace any Fund Security in certain circumstances, </span><span>including: (i) when the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant (or to an investor on whose behalf the </span><span>Authorized Participant is acting) would be restricted under applicable securities or other local laws or due to a trading </span><span>restriction; (ii) when the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in the disposition of the Fund </span><span>Security by the Authorized Participant due to restrictions under applicable securities or other local laws; (iii) when the delivery </span><span>of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in unfavorable tax treatment; (iv) when a Fund Security cannot </span><span>be settled or otherwise delivered in time to facilitate an in-kind redemption; or (v) in certain other situations. The amount of </span><span>cash paid out in such cases will be equivalent to the value of the substituted security listed as a Fund Security. In the event </span><span>that the Fund Securities have a value greater than the NAV of the shares, a compensating cash payment equal to the </span><span>difference is required to be made by or through an Authorized Participant by the redeeming shareholder. Each Fund generally </span><span>redeems Creation Units for Fund Securities, but each Fund reserves the right to utilize a cash option for redemption of </span><span>Creation Units. Each Fund may, in its sole discretion, provide such redeeming Authorized Participant a portfolio of securities </span><span>that differs from the exact composition of the Fund Securities, but does not differ in NAV. The Redemption Basket may also </span><span>be modified to minimize the Cash Component by redistributing the cash to the Fund Securities portion of the Redemption </span><span>Basket through systematically rounding. The rounding methodology allows position sizes of securities in the Fund Securities </span><span>to be </span><span>“</span><span>rounded up,</span><span>”</span><span> while limiting the maximum allowed percentage change in weight and share quantity of any given </span><span>security in the Redemption Basket. Redemption Baskets may also be modified to position a fund towards a forward index </span><span>rebalance to reflect revisions that account for index additions, deletions, and re-weights.</span></div> <div><span>Cash Redemption Method.</span><span>  </span><span> Although the Trust does not generally permit partial or full cash redemptions of Creation Units </span><span>of its funds, when partial or full cash redemptions of Creation Units are available or specified for a Fund, they will be effected </span><span>in essentially the same manner as in-kind redemptions thereof. In the case of partial or full cash redemption, the Authorized </span><span>Participant receives the cash equivalent of the Fund Securities it would otherwise receive through an in-kind redemption, plus </span><span>the same Cash Amount to be paid to an in-kind redeemer.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Costs Associated with Redemption Transactions.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>iShares Europe ETF, iShares International Developed Small Cap Value Factor ETF and iShares JPX-Nikkei 400 ETF</span></div> <div><span>A standard redemption transaction fee is imposed to offset transfer and other transaction costs that may be incurred by the </span><span>relevant Fund. The standard redemption transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized </span><span>Participant redeems a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number of Creation Units redeemed by an Authorized </span><span>Participant on the applicable Business Day. If a redemption consists solely or partially of cash, the Authorized Participant may </span><span>also be required to cover (up to the maximum amount shown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, </span><span>price movement and other costs and expenses related to the execution of trades resulting from such transaction (which may, </span><span>in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Authorized Participants will also bear the costs </span><span>of transferring the Fund Securities from a Fund to their account on their order. Certain fees/costs associated with redemption </span><span>transactions may be waived in certain circumstances. Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial </span><span>intermediary to dispose of Fund shares may be charged a fee for such services.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The following table sets forth each Fund's standard redemption transaction fees and maximum additional charge (as </span><span>described above):</span></div> <div><span> </span></div> <div> </div> <div>

An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable </span><span>request to redeem shares of a Fund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day in order to receive that </span><span>day's NAV. On days when the Listing Exchange closes earlier than normal, a Fund may require orders to redeem Creation </span><span>Units to be placed earlier that day. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements for </span><span>a redemption request to be made through an Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current </span><span>Authorized Participants upon request.</span></div> <div><span>The Authorized Participant must transmit the request for redemption in the form required by the Funds to the Distributor or </span><span>its agent in accordance with procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Investors should be aware that </span><span>their particular broker may not have executed an Authorized Participant Agreement and that, therefore, requests to redeem </span><span>Creation Units may have to be placed by the investor's broker through an Authorized Participant who has executed an </span><span>Authorized Participant Agreement. At any time, only a limited number of broker-dealers will have an Authorized Participant </span><span>Agreement in effect. Investors making a redemption request should be aware that such request must be in the form specified </span><span>by such Authorized Participant. Investors making a request to redeem Creation Units should allow sufficient time to permit </span><span>proper submission of the request by an Authorized Participant and transfer of the shares to the Funds' transfer agent; such </span><span>investors should allow for the additional time that may be required to effect redemptions through their banks, brokers or </span><span>other financial intermediaries if such intermediaries are not Authorized Participants.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>A redemption request is considered to be in </span><span>“</span><span>proper form</span><span>”</span><span> if: (i) an Authorized Participant has transferred or caused to be </span><span>transferred to the Funds' transfer agent the Creation Unit redeemed through the book-entry system of DTC so as to be </span><span>effective by the Listing Exchange closing time on any Business Day on which the redemption request is submitted; (ii) a </span><span>request in form satisfactory to the applicable Fund is received by the Distributor or its agent from the Authorized Participant </span><span>on behalf of itself or another redeeming investor within the time periods specified above; and (iii) all other procedures set </span><span>forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement are properly followed.</span></div> <div><span>Upon receiving a redemption request, the Distributor or its agent shall notify the applicable Fund and the Fund's transfer </span><span>agent of such redemption request. The tender of an investor's shares for redemption and the distribution of the securities </span><span>and/or cash included in the redemption payment made in respect of Creation Units redeemed will be made through DTC and </span><span>the relevant Authorized Participant to the Beneficial Owner thereof as recorded on the book-entry system of DTC or the DTC </span><span>Participant through which such investor holds, as the case may be, or by such other means specified by the Authorized </span><span>Participant submitting the redemption request.</span></div> <div><span>A redeeming Authorized Participant, whether on its own account or acting on behalf of a Beneficial Owner, must maintain </span><span>appropriate security arrangements with a qualified broker-dealer, bank or other custody providers in each jurisdiction in </span><span>which any of the portfolio securities are customarily traded, to which account such portfolio securities will be delivered.</span></div> <div><span>Deliveries of redemption proceeds are generally made within two Business Days (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, </span><span>“</span><span>T+2</span><span>”</span><span>). However, each Fund reserves </span><span>the right to settle deliveries of redemption proceeds on a basis other than T+2, including a shorter settlement period, if </span><span>necessary or appropriate under the circumstances and compliance with applicable law. For example, certain Funds reserve </span><span>the right to settle redemption transactions on a basis other than T+2 to accommodate non-U.S. market holiday schedules to </span><span>account for different treatment among non-U.S. and U.S. markets of dividend record dates and dividend ex-dates (</span><span>i.e., </span><span>the </span><span>last date the holder of a security can sell the security and still receive dividends payable on the security sold) and in certain </span><span>other circumstances consistent with applicable law.</span></div> <div><span>If neither the redeeming Beneficial Owner nor the Authorized Participant acting on behalf of such redeeming Beneficial </span><span>Owner has appropriate arrangements to take delivery of Fund Securities in the applicable non-U.S. jurisdiction and it is not </span><span>possible to make other such arrangements, or if it is not possible to effect deliveries of Fund Securities in such jurisdiction, a </span><span>Fund may in its discretion exercise its option to redeem such shares in cash, and the redeeming Beneficial Owner will be </span><span>required to receive its redemption proceeds in cash. In such case, the investor will receive a cash payment equal to the net </span><span>asset value of its shares based on the NAV of the relevant Fund next determined after the redemption request is received in </span><span>proper form (minus a redemption transaction fee and additional charges specified above to offset the Fund's brokerage and </span><span>other transaction costs associated with the disposition of Fund Securities). Redemptions of shares for Fund Securities will be </span><span>subject to compliance with applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws and each Fund (whether or not it otherwise </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>164</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

If a Fund includes a foreign investment in its </span><span>basket, and if a local market holiday, or series of consecutive holidays, or the extended delivery cycles for transferring foreign </span><span>investments to redeeming Authorized Participants prevents timely delivery of the foreign investment in response to a </span><span>redemption request, a Fund may delay delivery of the foreign investment more than seven days if a Fund delivers the foreign </span><span>investment as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 days.</span></div> <div><span>To the extent contemplated by an Authorized Participant’s agreement with the Distributor or its agent, in the event an </span><span>Authorized Participant has submitted a redemption request in proper form but is unable to transfer all or part of the Creation </span><span>Unit to be redeemed to a Fund, at or prior to the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the Business Day after the date </span><span>of submission of such redemption request, the Distributor or its agent will accept the redemption request in reliance on the </span><span>undertaking by the Authorized Participant to deliver the missing shares as soon as possible. Such undertaking shall be </span><span>secured by the Authorized Participant’s delivery and maintenance of collateral as set forth in the handbook for Authorized </span><span>Participants. Such collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the Business Day </span><span>after the date of submission of such redemption request and shall be held by State Street, JPMorgan, BNY Mellon or Citibank, </span><span>as applicable, and marked-to-market daily. The fees of State Street, JPMorgan, BNY Mellon or Citibank, as applicable, and any </span><span>sub-custodians in respect of the delivery, maintenance and redelivery of the collateral shall be payable by the Authorized </span><span>Participant. The Authorized Participant Agreement permits the Funds to acquire shares of the Funds at any time and subjects </span><span>the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the aggregate of the cost to the Funds of purchasing such </span><span>shares, plus the value of the Cash Amount, and the value of the collateral together with liability for related brokerage and </span><span>other charges.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Because the portfolio securities of a Fund may trade on exchange(s) on days that the Listing Exchange is closed or are </span><span>otherwise not Business Days for such Fund, shareholders may not be able to redeem their shares of such Fund or purchase </span><span>or sell shares of such Fund on the Listing Exchange on days when the NAV of such a Fund could be significantly affected by </span><span>events in the relevant non-U.S. markets.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The right of redemption may be suspended or the date of payment postponed with respect to any Fund: (i) for any period </span><span>during which the applicable Listing Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday closings); (ii) for any </span><span>period during which trading on the applicable Listing Exchange is suspended or restricted; (iii) for any period during which an </span><span>emergency exists as a result of which disposal of the shares of the Fund's portfolio securities or determination of its NAV is </span><span>not reasonably practicable; or (iv) in such other circumstance as is permitted by the SEC.</span></div> <div><span>Custom Baskets.</span><span>  </span><span>Creation and Redemption baskets may differ and each Fund may accept </span><span>“</span><span>custom baskets.</span><span>”</span><span> A custom </span><span>basket may include any of the following: (i) a basket that is composed of a non-representative selection of a Fund's portfolio </span><span>holdings; (ii) a representative basket that is different from the initial basket used in transactions on the same business day; or </span><span>(iii) a basket that contains bespoke cash substitutions for a single Authorized Participant. Each Fund has adopted policies and </span><span>procedures that govern the construction and acceptance of baskets, including heightened requirements for certain types of </span><span>custom baskets. Such policies and procedures provide the parameters for the construction and acceptance of custom </span><span>baskets that are in the best interests of a Fund and its shareholders, establish processes for revisions to, or deviations from, </span><span>such parameters, and specify the titles and roles of the employees of BFA who are required to review each custom basket for </span><span>compliance with those parameters. In addition, when constructing custom baskets for redemptions, the tax efficiency of a </span><span>Fund may be taken into account. The policies and procedures distinguish among different types of custom baskets that may </span><span>be used for each Fund and impose different requirements for different types of custom baskets in order to seek to mitigate </span><span>against potential risks of conflicts and/or overreaching by an Authorized Participant. BlackRock has established a governance </span><span>process to oversee basket compliance for the Funds, as set forth in each Fund's policies and procedures.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>165</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

This gain or loss is calculated by taking the market value of </span><span>the Creation Units purchased over the Authorized Participant’s aggregate basis in the Deposit Securities exchanged therefor. </span><span>However, the IRS may apply the wash sales rules to determine that any loss realized upon the exchange of Deposit Securities </span><span>for Creation Units is not currently deductible. Authorized Participants should consult their own tax advisors.</span></div> <div><span>Current U.S. federal income tax laws dictate that capital gain or loss realized from the redemption of Creation Units will </span><span>generally create long-term capital gain or loss if the Authorized Participant holds the Creation Units for more than one year, </span><span>or short-term capital gain or loss if the Creation Units were held for one year or less, if the Creation Units are held as capital </span><span>assets.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The following is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations regarding the purchase, ownership and </span><span>disposition of shares of a Fund. This summary does not address all of the potential U.S. federal income tax consequences </span><span>that may be applicable to a Fund or to all categories of investors, some of which may be subject to special tax rules. Current </span><span>and prospective shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the specific U.S. federal, state, local </span><span>and non-U.S. tax consequences of investing in a Fund. The summary is based on the laws and judicial and administrative </span><span>interpretations thereof in effect on the date of this SAI, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Regulated Investment Company Qualifications. </span><span> </span><span>Each Fund intends to continue to qualify for treatment as a separate RIC </span><span>under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify for treatment as a RIC, each Fund must annually distribute at </span><span>least 90% of its investment company taxable income (which includes dividends, interest and net short-term capital gains) </span><span>and meet several other requirements. Among such other requirements are the following: (i) at least 90% of each Fund’s </span><span>annual gross income must be derived from dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans, gains from the sale </span><span>or other disposition of stock or securities or non-U.S. currencies, other income (including, but not limited to, gains from </span><span>options, futures or forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies, </span><span>and net income derived from interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships (</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> partnerships that are traded on an </span><span>established securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than partnerships that derive at least 90% of their </span><span>income from interest, dividends, capital gains and other traditionally permitted RIC income); and (ii) at the close of each </span><span>quarter of each Fund's taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the market value of each Fund’s total assets must be represented by </span><span>cash and cash items, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs and other securities, with such other securities </span><span>limited for purposes of this calculation in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of the </span><span>Fund’s assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (b) not more than 25% of the </span><span>value of each Fund's total assets may be invested in the securities (other than U.S. government securities or the securities of </span><span>other RICs) of any one issuer, of two or more issuers of which 20% or more of the voting stock is held by the Fund and that </span><span>are engaged in the same or similar trades or businesses or related trades or businesses, or the securities of one or more </span><span>qualified publicly-traded partnerships.</span></div> <div><span>A Fund may be able to cure a failure to derive at least 90% of its income from the sources specified above or a failure to </span><span>diversify its holdings in the manner described above by paying a tax</span><span> </span><span>and/or by disposing of certain assets. If, in any taxable </span><span>year, a Fund fails one of these tests and does not timely cure the failure, that Fund will be taxed in the same manner as an </span><span>ordinary corporation and distributions to its shareholders will not be deductible by that Fund in computing its taxable </span><span>income.</span></div> <div><span>Although, in general, the passive loss rules of the Internal Revenue Code do not apply to RICs, such rules do apply to a RIC </span><span>with respect to items attributable to interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships. A Fund's investments in partnerships, </span><span>including in qualified publicly-traded partnerships, may result in the Fund being subject to state, local, or non-U.S. income, </span><span>franchise or withholding tax liabilities.</span></div> <div><span>Taxation of RICs. </span><span> </span><span>As a RIC, a Fund will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of its taxable investment </span><span>income and capital gains that it distributes to its shareholders, provided that it satisfies a minimum distribution requirement. </span><span>To satisfy the minimum distribution requirement, a Fund must distribute to its shareholders at least the sum of (i) 90% of its </span><span>“</span><span>investment company taxable income</span><span>”</span><span> (</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> income other than its net realized long-term capital gain over its net realized </span><span>short-term capital loss), plus or minus certain adjustments, and (ii) 90% of its net tax-exempt income for the taxable year.

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fund will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates on any taxable income or gains that it does not distribute to its </span><span>shareholders. If a Fund fails to qualify for any taxable year as a RIC or fails to meet the distribution requirement, all of its </span><span>taxable income will be subject to tax at regular corporate income tax rates without any deduction for distributions to </span><span>shareholders, and such distributions generally will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends to the extent of the </span><span>Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits. In such event, distributions to individuals should be eligible to be </span><span>treated as qualified dividend income and distributions to corporate shareholders generally should be eligible for the dividends </span><span>received deduction. Although each Fund intends to distribute substantially all of its net investment income and its capital </span><span>gains for each taxable year, a Fund may decide to retain a portion of its income or gains if the Fund determines that doing so </span><span>is in the interest of its shareholders. Each Fund will be subject to U.S. federal income taxation to the extent any such income </span><span>or gains are not distributed. If a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC in any year, it must pay out its earnings and profits accumulated </span><span>in that year in order to qualify again as a RIC. If a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, the </span><span>Fund may be required to recognize any net built-in gains with respect to certain of its assets (</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> the excess of the aggregate </span><span>gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if the Fund </span><span>had been liquidated) if it qualifies as a RIC in a subsequent year.</span></div> <div><span>Excise Tax.</span><span>  </span><span>A Fund will be subject to a 4% excise tax on certain undistributed income if it does not distribute to its </span><span>shareholders in each calendar year at least 98% of its ordinary income for the calendar year plus at least 98.2% of its capital </span><span>gain net income for the 12 months ended October 31 of such year. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital </span><span>gain net income retained by a Fund that is subject to corporate income tax will be considered to have been distributed by </span><span>year-end. In addition, the minimum amounts that must be distributed in any year to avoid the excise tax will be increased or </span><span>decreased to reflect any underdistribution or overdistribution, as the case may be, from the previous year. Each Fund intends </span><span>to declare and distribute dividends and distributions in the amounts and at the times necessary to avoid the application of </span><span>this 4% excise tax.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Net Capital Loss Carryforwards. </span><span> </span><span>Net capital loss carryforwards may be applied against any net realized capital gains in each </span><span>succeeding year, until they have been reduced to zero.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>In the event that a Fund were to experience an ownership change as defined under the Internal Revenue Code, the loss </span><span>carryforwards and other favorable tax attributes of a Fund, if any, may be subject to limitation.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The following Funds had net capital loss carryforwards, as set forth in the table below, as of March 31, 2023, the tax year-end </span><span>for the Funds:</span></div> <div><span> </span></div> <div> </div> <div>

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Taxation of U.S. Shareholders.</span><span>  </span><span> Dividends and other distributions by a Fund are generally treated under the Internal Revenue </span><span>Code as received by the shareholders at the time the dividend or distribution is made. However, any dividend or distribution </span><span>declared by a Fund in October, November or December of any calendar year and payable to shareholders of record on a </span><span>specified date in such a month shall be deemed to have been received by each shareholder on December 31 of such calendar </span><span>year and to have been paid by the Fund not later than such December 31, provided such dividend is actually paid by the Fund </span><span>during January of the following calendar year.</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund intends to distribute annually to its shareholders substantially all of its investment company taxable income and </span><span>any net realized long-term capital gains in excess of net realized short-term capital losses (including any capital loss </span><span>carryovers). However, if a Fund retains for investment an amount equal to all or a portion of its net long-term capital gains in </span><span>excess of its net short-term capital losses (including any capital loss carryovers), it will be subject to a corporate tax (at a flat </span><span>rate of 21%) on the amount retained. In that event, the Fund will designate such retained amounts as undistributed capital </span><span>gains in a notice to its shareholders who (a) will be required to include in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as </span><span>long-term capital gains, their proportionate shares of the undistributed amount, (b) will be entitled to credit their </span><span>proportionate shares of the tax paid by the Fund on the undistributed amount against their U.S. federal income tax liabilities, </span><span>if any, and to claim refunds to the extent their credits exceed their liabilities, if any, and (c) will be entitled to increase their tax </span><span>basis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in their shares by an amount equal to the excess of the amount in clause (a) over </span><span>the amount in clause (b). Organizations or persons not subject to U.S. federal income tax on such capital gains will be </span><span>entitled to a refund of their </span><span>pro rata</span><span> share of such taxes paid by the Fund upon filing appropriate returns or claims for refund </span><span>with the IRS.</span></div> <div><span>Distributions of net realized long-term capital gains, if any, that a Fund reports as capital gains dividends are taxable as long-term</span><span> capital gains, whether paid in cash or in shares and regardless of how long a shareholder has held shares of the Fund. </span><span>All other dividends of a Fund (including dividends from short-term capital gains) from its current and accumulated earnings </span><span>and profits (</span><span>“</span><span>regular dividends</span><span>”</span><span>) are generally subject to tax as ordinary income, subject to the discussion of qualified </span><span>dividend income below. Long-term capital gains are eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate </span><span>shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts.</span></div> <div><span>If an individual receives a regular dividend qualifying for the long-term capital gains rates and such dividend constitutes an </span><span>“</span><span>extraordinary dividend,</span><span>”</span><span> and the individual subsequently recognizes a loss on the sale or exchange of stock in respect of </span><span>which the extraordinary dividend was paid, then the loss will be long-term capital loss to the extent of such extraordinary </span><span>dividend. An </span><span>“</span><span>extraordinary dividend</span><span>”</span><span> on common stock for this purpose is generally a dividend (i) in an amount greater than </span><span>or equal to 10% of the taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-dividend </span><span>dates within an 85-day period, or (ii) in an amount greater than 20% of the taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share </span><span>of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates within a 365-day period.</span></div> <div><span>Distributions in excess of a Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits will, as to each shareholder, be treated as a </span><span>tax-free return of capital to the extent of a shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund, and as a capital gain thereafter (if the </span><span>shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets). Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum distribution </span><span>requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute </span><span>nontaxable returns of capital. Shareholders receiving dividends or distributions in the form of additional shares should be </span><span>treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as receiving a distribution in an amount equal to the amount of money that the </span><span>shareholders receiving cash dividends or distributions will receive and should have a cost basis in the shares received equal to </span><span>such amount.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>A 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on net investment income, including, but not limited to, interest, </span><span>dividends, and net gain from investments, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and </span><span>filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</span></div> <div><span>Investors considering buying shares just prior to a dividend or capital gain distribution should be aware that, although the </span><span>price of shares purchased at that time may reflect the amount of the forthcoming distribution, such dividend or distribution </span><span>may nevertheless be taxable to them. If a Fund is the holder of record of any security on the record date for any dividends </span><span>payable with respect to such security, such dividends will be included in the Fund’s gross income not as of the date received </span><span>but as of the later of (a) the date such security became ex-dividend with respect to such dividends (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the date on which a </span><span>buyer of the security would not be entitled to receive the declared, but unpaid, dividends); or (b) the date the Fund acquired </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>169</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>such security. Accordingly, in order to satisfy its income distribution requirements, a Fund may be required to pay dividends </span><span>based on anticipated earnings, and shareholders may receive dividends in an earlier year than would otherwise be the case.</span></div> <div><span>In certain situations, a Fund may, for a taxable year, defer all or a portion of its net capital loss (or if there is no net capital </span><span>loss, then any net long-term or short-term capital loss) realized after October and its late-year ordinary loss (defined as the </span><span>sum of (i) the excess of post-October foreign currency and passive foreign investment company (</span><span>“</span><span>PFIC</span><span>”</span><span>) losses over post-October</span><span> foreign currency and PFIC gains and (ii) the excess of post-December ordinary losses over post-December ordinary </span><span>income) until the next taxable year in computing its investment company taxable income and net capital gain, which will </span><span>defer the recognition of such realized losses. Such deferrals and other rules regarding gains and losses realized after October </span><span>(or December) may affect the tax character of shareholder distributions.</span></div> <div><span>Sales of Shares. </span><span> </span><span>Upon the sale or exchange of shares of a Fund, a shareholder will realize a taxable gain or loss equal to the </span><span>difference between the amount realized and the shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund. A redemption of shares by a Fund </span><span>will be treated as a sale for this purpose. Such gain or loss will be treated as capital gain or loss if the shares are capital assets </span><span>in the shareholder’s hands and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the shares are held for more than one year and short-term</span><span> capital gain or loss if the shares are held for one year or less. Any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed </span><span>to the extent the shares disposed of are replaced, including replacement through the reinvesting of dividends or capital gains </span><span>distributions, or by an option or contract to acquire substantially identical shares, within a 61-day period beginning 30 days </span><span>before and ending 30 days after the disposition of the shares. In such a case, the basis of the shares acquired will be </span><span>increased to reflect the disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a shareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by the shareholder </span><span>for six months or less will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any </span><span>distributions or deemed distributions of long-term capital gains received by the shareholder with respect to such share. The </span><span>Medicare contribution tax described above will apply to the sale of Fund shares.</span></div> <div><span>If a shareholder incurs a sales charge in acquiring shares of a Fund, disposes of those shares within 90 days and then, on or </span><span>before January 31 of the following calendar year, acquires shares in a mutual fund for which the otherwise applicable sales </span><span>charge is reduced by reason of a reinvestment right (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, an exchange privilege), the original sales charge will not be taken </span><span>into account in computing gain/loss on the original shares to the extent the subsequent sales charge is reduced. Instead, the </span><span>disregarded portion of the original sales charge will be added to the tax basis of the newly acquired shares. Furthermore, the </span><span>same rule also applies to a disposition of the newly acquired shares made within 90 days of the second acquisition. This </span><span>provision prevents shareholders from immediately deducting the sales charge by shifting their investments within a family of </span><span>mutual funds.</span></div> <div><span>Backup Withholding. </span><span> </span><span>In certain cases, a Fund will be required to withhold at a 24% rate and remit to the U.S. Treasury such </span><span>amounts withheld from any distributions paid to a shareholder who: (i) has failed to provide a correct taxpayer identification </span><span>number; (ii) is subject to backup withholding by the IRS; (iii) has failed to certify to a Fund that such shareholder is not </span><span>subject to backup withholding; or (iv) has not certified that such shareholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien). </span><span>Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amount withheld may be credited against a shareholder's U.S. federal </span><span>income tax liability.</span></div> <div><span>Sections 351 and 362. </span><span> </span><span>The Trust, on behalf of each Fund, has the right to reject an order for a purchase of shares of the </span><span>Fund if the purchaser (or group of purchasers) would, upon obtaining the shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the </span><span>outstanding shares of a given Fund and if, pursuant to Sections 351 and 362 of the Internal Revenue Code, that Fund would </span><span>have a basis in the securities different from the market value of such securities on the date of deposit. If a Fund’s basis in </span><span>such securities on the date of deposit was less than market value on such date, the Fund, upon disposition of the securities, </span><span>would recognize more taxable gain or less taxable loss than if its basis in the securities had been equal to market value. It is </span><span>not anticipated that the Trust will exercise the right of rejection except in a case where the Trust determines that accepting </span><span>the order could result in material adverse tax consequences to a Fund or its shareholders. The Trust also has the right to </span><span>require information necessary to determine beneficial share ownership for purposes of the 80% determination.</span></div> <div><span>Taxation of Certain Derivatives.</span><span>  </span><span>A Fund’s transactions in zero coupon securities, non-U.S. currencies, forward contracts, </span><span>options and futures contracts (including options and futures contracts on non-U.S. currencies), to the extent permitted, will </span><span>be subject to special provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (including provisions relating to </span><span>“</span><span>hedging transactions</span><span>”</span><span> and </span><span>“</span><span>straddles</span><span>”</span><span>) that, among other consequences, may affect the character of gains and losses realized by the Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, may </span><span>affect whether gains or losses are ordinary or capital), accelerate recognition of income to the Fund and defer Fund losses. </span><span>These rules could therefore affect the character, amount and timing of distributions to shareholders. These provisions also </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>170</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>(a) will require a Fund to mark-to-market certain types of the positions in its portfolio (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, treat them as if they were closed </span><span>out at the end of each year) and (b) may cause a Fund to recognize income without receiving cash with which to pay </span><span>dividends or make distributions in amounts necessary to satisfy the distribution requirements for avoiding income and excise </span><span>taxes. Each Fund will monitor its transactions, will make the appropriate tax elections and will make the appropriate entries in </span><span>its books and records when it acquires any zero coupon security, non-U.S. currency, forward contract, option, futures </span><span>contract or hedged investment in order to mitigate the effect of these rules and prevent disqualification of a Fund as a RIC.</span></div> <div><span>A Fund’s investments in so-called </span><span>“</span><span>Section 1256 contracts,</span><span>”</span><span> such as regulated futures contracts, most non-U.S. currency </span><span>forward contracts traded in the interbank market and options on most security indexes, are subject to special tax rules. All </span><span>Section 1256 contracts held by a Fund at the end of its taxable year are required to be marked to their market value, and any </span><span>unrealized gain or loss on those positions will be included in a Fund’s income as if each position had been sold for its fair </span><span>market value at the end of the taxable year. The resulting gain or loss will be combined with any gain or loss realized by a </span><span>Fund from positions in Section 1256 contracts closed during the taxable year. Provided such positions were held as capital </span><span>assets and were not part of a </span><span>“</span><span>hedging transaction</span><span>”</span><span> nor part of a </span><span>“</span><span>straddle,</span><span>”</span><span> 60% of the resulting net gain or loss will be </span><span>treated as long-term capital gain or loss, and 40% of such net gain or loss will be treated as short-term capital gain or loss, </span><span>regardless of the period of time the positions were actually held by a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>As a result of entering into swap contracts, a Fund may make or receive periodic net payments. A Fund may also make or </span><span>receive a payment when a swap is terminated prior to maturity through an assignment of the swap or other closing </span><span>transaction. Periodic net payments will generally constitute ordinary income or deductions, while termination of a swap will </span><span>generally result in capital gain or loss (which will be a long-term capital gain or loss if a Fund has been a party to the swap for </span><span>more than one year). With respect to certain types of swaps, a Fund may be required to currently recognize income or loss </span><span>with respect to future payments on such swaps or may elect under certain circumstances to mark such swaps to market </span><span>annually for tax purposes as ordinary income or loss.</span></div> <div><span>Qualified Dividend Income. </span><span> </span><span>Distributions by a Fund of investment company taxable income (including any short-term </span><span>capital gains), whether received in cash or shares, will be taxable either as ordinary income or as qualified dividend income, </span><span>which is eligible to be taxed at long-term capital gain rates to the extent a Fund receives qualified dividend income on the </span><span>securities it holds and a Fund reports the distribution as qualified dividend income. Qualified dividend income is, in general, </span><span>dividend income from taxable U.S. corporations (but generally not from U.S. REITs) and certain non-U.S. corporations (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, </span><span>non-U.S. corporations that are not PFICs and which are incorporated in a possession of the U.S. or in certain countries with a </span><span>comprehensive tax treaty with the U.S., or the stock of which is readily tradable on an established securities market in the </span><span>U.S. (where the dividends are paid with respect to such stock)). Under current IRS guidance, the U.S. has appropriate </span><span>comprehensive income tax treaties with the following countries: Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, Bulgaria, </span><span>Canada, China (but not with Hong Kong, which is treated as a separate jurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes), Cyprus, the Czech </span><span>Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, </span><span>Jamaica, Japan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, </span><span>Pakistan, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, </span><span>Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, the U.K. and Venezuela.</span><span> </span><span>Substitute </span><span>payments received by a Fund for securities lent out by a Fund will not be qualified dividend income.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>A dividend from a Fund will not be treated as qualified dividend income to the extent that: (i) the shareholder has not held </span><span>the shares on which the dividend was paid for 61 days during the 121-day period that begins on the date that is 60 days </span><span>before the date on which the shares become ex-dividend with respect to such dividend or a Fund fails to satisfy those </span><span>holding period requirements with respect to the securities it holds that paid the dividends distributed to the shareholder (or, </span><span>in the case of certain preferred stocks, the holding requirement of 91 days during the 181-day period beginning on the date </span><span>that is 90 days before the date on which the stock becomes ex-dividend with respect to such dividend); (ii) a Fund or the </span><span>shareholder is under an obligation (whether pursuant to a short sale or otherwise) to make related payments with respect to </span><span>substantially similar or related property; or (iii) the shareholder elects to treat such dividend as investment income under </span><span>Section 163(d)(4)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code. Dividends received by a Fund from a REIT or another RIC may be treated </span><span>as qualified dividend income only to the extent the dividend distributions are attributable to qualified dividend income </span><span>received by such REIT or other RIC. It is expected that dividends received by a Fund from a REIT and distributed to a </span><span>shareholder generally will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income. However, for tax years beginning after December </span><span>31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, a non-corporate taxpayer who is a direct REIT shareholder may claim a 20% </span><span>“</span><span>qualified </span><span>business income</span><span>”</span><span> deduction for ordinary REIT dividends, and a RIC may report dividends as eligible for this deduction to the </span><span>extent the RIC’s income is derived from ordinary REIT dividends (reduced by allocable RIC expenses). A shareholder may treat </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>171</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

Distributions by a </span><span>Fund of its net short-term capital gains will be taxable as ordinary income.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Corporate Dividends Received Deduction.</span><span>  </span><span>Dividends paid by a Fund that are attributable to dividends received by the Fund </span><span>from U.S. corporations may qualify for the U.S. federal dividends received deduction for corporations. A 46-day minimum </span><span>holding period during the 90-day period that begins 45 days prior to ex-dividend date (or 91-day minimum holding period </span><span>during the 180 period beginning 90 days prior to ex-dividend date for certain preference dividends) during which risk of loss </span><span>may not be diminished is required for the applicable shares, at both the Fund and shareholder level, for a dividend to be </span><span>eligible for the dividends received deduction. Restrictions may apply if indebtedness, including a short sale, is attributable to </span><span>the investment.</span></div> <div><span>Excess Inclusion Income. </span><span> </span><span>Under current law, the Funds serve to block unrelated business taxable income (</span><span>“</span><span>UBTI</span><span>”</span><span>) from </span><span>being realized by their respective tax-exempt shareholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a tax-exempt shareholder could </span><span>realize UBTI by virtue of its investment in a Fund if shares in the Fund constitute debt-financed property in the hands of the </span><span>tax-exempt shareholder within the meaning of Section 514(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. Certain types of income received </span><span>by a Fund from REITs, real estate mortgage investment conduits, taxable mortgage pools or other investments may cause the </span><span>Fund to report some or all of its distributions as </span><span>“</span><span>excess inclusion income.</span><span>”</span><span> To Fund shareholders, such excess inclusion </span><span>income may: (i) constitute taxable income, as UBTI for those shareholders who would otherwise be tax-exempt such as </span><span>individual retirement accounts, 401(k) accounts, Keogh plans, pension plans and certain charitable entities; (ii) not be offset </span><span>by otherwise allowable deductions for tax purposes; (iii) not be eligible for reduced U.S. withholding for non-U.S. </span><span>shareholders even from tax treaty countries; and (iv) cause the Fund to be subject to tax if certain </span><span>“</span><span>disqualified </span><span>organizations,</span><span>”</span><span> as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, are Fund shareholders. If a charitable remainder annuity trust or a </span><span>charitable remainder unitrust (each as defined in Section 664 of the Internal Revenue Code) has UBTI for a taxable year, a </span><span>100% excise tax on the UBTI is imposed on the trust.</span></div> <div><span>A Fund tries to avoid investing in REITs that are expected to generate excess inclusion income, but a Fund may not always be </span><span>successful in doing so. Because information about a REIT’s investments may be inadequate or inaccurate, or because a REIT </span><span>may change its investment program, a Fund may not be successful in avoiding the consequences described above. </span><span>Avoidance of investments in REITs that generate excess inclusion income may require a Fund to forego otherwise attractive </span><span>investment opportunities.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Non-U.S. Investments. </span><span> </span><span>Under Section 988 of the Internal Revenue Code, gains or losses attributable to fluctuations in </span><span>exchange rates between the time a Fund accrues income or receivables or expenses or other liabilities denominated in a non-U.S.</span><span> currency and the time a Fund actually collects such income or pays such liabilities are generally treated as ordinary </span><span>income or ordinary loss. In general, gains (and losses) realized on debt instruments will be treated as Section 988 gain (or </span><span>loss) to the extent attributable to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which the </span><span>instruments are denominated. Similarly, gains or losses on non-U.S. currency, non-U.S. currency forward contracts and </span><span>certain non-U.S. currency options or futures contracts denominated in non-U.S. currency, to the extent attributable to </span><span>fluctuations in exchange rates between the acquisition and disposition dates, are also treated as ordinary income or loss </span><span>unless a Fund was to elect otherwise.</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund may be subject to non-U.S. income taxes withheld at the source. Each Fund, if permitted to do so, may elect to </span><span>“</span><span>pass through</span><span>”</span><span> to its investors the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid by the Fund provided that the Fund held the </span><span>security on the dividend settlement date and for at least 15 additional days immediately before and/or thereafter, with the </span><span>result that each investor with respect to shares of the Fund held for a minimum 16-day holding period at the time of deemed </span><span>distribution will (i) include in gross income, even though not actually received, the investor’s </span><span>pro rata</span><span> share of the Fund’s </span><span>non-U.S. income taxes, and (ii) either deduct (in calculating U.S. taxable income, but only for investors who itemize their </span><span>deductions on their personal tax returns) or credit (in calculating U.S. federal income tax) the investor’s </span><span>pro rata</span><span> share of the </span><span>Fund’s non-U.S. income taxes. Withholding taxes on dividends on non-U.S. securities while such securities are lent out by the </span><span>Fund are not eligible for non-U.S. tax credit pass through. Taxes not </span><span>“</span><span>passed through</span><span>”</span><span> for tax purposes will not be available to </span><span>shareholders for foreign tax credit purposes. A non-U.S. person invested in a Fund in a year that the Fund elects to </span><span>“</span><span>pass </span><span>through</span><span>”</span><span> its non-U.S. taxes may be treated as receiving additional dividend income subject to U.S. withholding tax. A non-U.S.</span><span> tax credit may not exceed the investor’s U.S. federal income tax otherwise payable with respect to the investor’s non-U.S. </span><span>source income. For this purpose, shareholders must treat as non-U.S. source gross income (i) their proportionate shares of </span><span>non-U.S. taxes paid by a Fund and (ii) the portion of any dividend paid by the Fund that represents income derived from non-U.S.</span><span> sources; the Fund’s gain from the sale of securities will generally be treated as U.S.-source income.

If your Fund shares are loaned pursuant to </span><span>securities lending arrangements, you may lose the ability to use any non-U.S. tax credits passed through by a Fund or to treat </span><span>Fund dividends (paid while the shares are held by the borrower) as qualified dividends. Regarding a short sale with respect to </span><span>shares of a Fund, substitute payments made to the lender of such shares may not be deductible under certain circumstances. </span><span>Consult your financial intermediary or tax advisor.</span></div> <div><span>Passive Foreign Investment Companies. </span><span> </span><span>If a Fund purchases shares in PFICs, it may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on </span><span>a portion of any </span><span>“</span><span>excess distribution</span><span>”</span><span> or gain from the disposition of such shares even if such income is distributed as a </span><span>taxable dividend by the Fund to its shareholders. Additional charges in the nature of interest may be imposed on a Fund in </span><span>respect of deferred taxes arising from such distributions or gains.</span></div> <div><span>If a Fund were to invest in a PFIC and elect to treat the PFIC as a </span><span>“</span><span>qualified electing fund</span><span>”</span><span> under the Internal Revenue Code, in </span><span>lieu of the foregoing requirements, a Fund might be required to include in income each year a portion of the ordinary </span><span>earnings and net capital gains of the qualified electing fund, even if not distributed to a Fund, and such amounts would be </span><span>subject to the 90% and excise tax distribution requirements described above. In order to make this election, a Fund would be </span><span>required to obtain certain annual information from the PFICs in which it invests, which may be difficult or impossible to </span><span>obtain. Currently proposed IRS regulations, if adopted, would treat such included amounts as nonqualifying RIC income to a </span><span>Fund unless such amounts were also distributed to the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Alternatively, a Fund may make a mark-to-market election that would result in a Fund being treated as if it had sold and </span><span>repurchased its PFIC stock at the end of each year. In such case, a Fund would report any such gains as ordinary income and </span><span>would deduct any such losses as ordinary losses to the extent of previously recognized gains. The election must be made </span><span>separately for each PFIC owned by a Fund and, once made, would be effective for all subsequent taxable years, unless </span><span>revoked with the consent of the IRS. By making the election, a Fund could potentially ameliorate the adverse tax </span><span>consequences with respect to its ownership of shares in a PFIC, but in any particular year may be required to recognize </span><span>income in excess of the distributions it receives from PFICs and its proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock. A Fund may </span><span>have to distribute this </span><span>“</span><span>phantom</span><span>”</span><span> income and gain to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement and to avoid imposition of the </span><span>4% excise tax.</span></div> <div><span>A Fund will make the appropriate tax elections, if possible, and take any additional steps that are necessary to mitigate the </span><span>effects of these rules.</span></div> <div><span>Reporting. </span><span> </span><span>If a shareholder recognizes a loss with respect to a Fund’s shares of $2 million or more for an individual </span><span>shareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate shareholder, the shareholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement </span><span>on IRS Form 8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases exempted from this reporting requirement, </span><span>but under current guidance, shareholders of a RIC are not exempted. The fact that a loss is reportable under these </span><span>regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer’s treatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders </span><span>should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual circumstances.</span></div> <div><span>Other Taxes. </span><span> </span><span>Dividends, distributions and redemption proceeds may also be subject to additional state, local and non-U.S. </span><span>taxes depending on each shareholder’s particular situation.</span></div> <div><span>Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders. </span><span> </span><span>Dividends paid by a Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are generally subject to withholding </span><span>tax at a 30% rate or a reduced rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty to the extent derived from investment income </span><span>and short-term capital gains. Dividends paid by a Fund from net tax-exempt income or long-term capital gains are generally </span><span>not subject to such withholding tax. In order to obtain a reduced rate of withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder will be required </span><span>to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying its entitlement to benefits under a treaty. The withholding </span><span>tax does not apply to regular dividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who provides an IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that the </span><span>dividends are effectively connected with the non-U.S. shareholder’s conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. Instead, </span><span>the effectively connected dividends will be subject to regular U.S. income tax as if the non-U.S. shareholder were a U.S. </span><span>shareholder. A non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively connected dividends may also be subject to additional </span><span>“</span><span>branch </span><span>profits tax</span><span>”</span><span> imposed at a rate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S. shareholder who fails to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN, </span><span>IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable form may be subject to backup withholding at the appropriate rate.</span></div> <div><span>Properly-reported dividends are generally exempt from U.S. federal withholding tax where they (i) are paid in respect of a </span><span>Fund’s </span><span>“</span><span>qualified net interest income</span><span>”</span><span> (generally, the Fund’s U.S. source interest income, other than certain contingent </span><span>interest and interest from obligations of a corporation or partnership in which the Fund is at least a 10% shareholder or </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>173</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>partner, reduced by expenses that are allocable to such income) or (ii) are paid in respect of a Fund’s </span><span>“</span><span>qualified short-term </span><span>capital gains</span><span>”</span><span> (generally, the excess of the Fund’s net short-term capital gain over the Fund’s long-term capital loss for such </span><span>taxable year). However, depending on its circumstances, a Fund may report all, some or none of its potentially eligible </span><span>dividends as such qualified net interest income or as qualified short-term capital gains and/or treat such dividends, in whole </span><span>or in part, as ineligible for this exemption from withholding. In order to qualify for this exemption from withholding, a non-U.S.</span><span> shareholder will need to comply with applicable certification requirements relating to its non-U.S. status (including, in </span><span>general, furnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or substitute Form). In the case of shares held through an </span><span>intermediary, the intermediary may withhold even if a Fund reports the payment as qualified net interest income or qualified </span><span>short-term capital gain. Non-U.S. shareholders should contact their intermediaries with respect to the application of these </span><span>rules to their accounts.</span></div> <div><span>Special rules may apply to a foreign shareholder receiving a Fund distribution if at least 50% of the Fund's assets consist of </span><span>interests in U.S. real property interests, including certain REITs and U.S. real property holding corporations (as defined in the </span><span>Internal Revenue Code and Treasury regulations). Fund distributions that are attributable to gain from the disposition of a </span><span>U.S. real property interest will be taxable as ordinary dividends and subject to withholding at a 30% or lower treaty rate if the </span><span>foreign shareholder held no more than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of </span><span>the distribution. If the foreign shareholder held at least 5% of the Fund's shares, the distribution would be treated as income </span><span>effectively connected with a trade or business within the U.S. and the foreign shareholder would be subject to withholding </span><span>tax at a rate of 21% and would generally be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return.</span></div> <div><span>Similar consequences would generally apply to a foreign shareholder's gain on the sale of Fund shares unless the Fund is </span><span>domestically controlled (meaning that more than 50% of the value of the Fund's shares is held by U.S. shareholders) or the </span><span>foreign shareholder owns no more than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of </span><span>sale. Finally, a domestically controlled Fund may be required to recognize a portion of its gain on the in-kind distribution of </span><span>certain U.S. real property interests. Shareholders that are nonresident aliens or foreign entities are urged to consult their own </span><span>tax advisors concerning the particular tax consequences to them of an investment in the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>The rules laid out in the previous two paragraphs, other than the withholding rules, will apply notwithstanding a Fund’s </span><span>participation in a wash sale transaction or its payment of a substitute dividend.</span></div> <div><span>Shareholders that are nonresident aliens or foreign entities are urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning the </span><span>particular tax consequences to them of an investment in a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items paid to: (i) </span><span>foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS </span><span>information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders; and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify </span><span>certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will </span><span>need to: (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information, including the names, </span><span>addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders; comply with due diligence </span><span>procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts; report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. </span><span>accounts maintained; agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to </span><span>account holders who fail to provide the required information; and determine certain other information concerning their </span><span>account holders, or (ii) in the event an intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local </span><span>revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may need to report the name, address, </span><span>and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership </span><span>unless certain exceptions apply.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of a Fund held by a non-U.S. shareholder at death will be considered situated within the U.S. and subject to the U.S. </span><span>estate tax.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The foregoing discussion is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations only and is not intended as </span><span>a substitute for careful tax planning. Purchasers of shares should consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences </span><span>of investing in such shares, including consequences under state, local and non-U.S. tax laws.

Shareholder </span><span>communications to the Board should include the following information: (i) the name and address of the shareholder; (ii) the </span><span>number of shares owned by the shareholder; (iii) the Fund(s) of which the shareholder owns shares; and (iv) if these shares </span><span>are owned indirectly through a broker, financial intermediary or other record owner, the name of the broker, financial </span><span>intermediary or other record owner. All correspondence received as set forth above shall be reviewed by the Secretary of the </span><span>Trust and reported to the Board.</span></div> <div><span>Regulation Under the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive. </span><span> </span><span>The Alternative Investment Fund Managers </span><span>Directive (</span><span>“</span><span>AIFMD</span><span>”</span><span>) imposes detailed and prescriptive obligations on fund managers established in the EU (</span><span>“</span><span>EU Operative </span><span>Provisions</span><span>”</span><span>). These do not currently apply to managers established outside of the EU, such as BFA. Rather, non-EU managers </span><span>are only required to comply with certain disclosure, reporting and transparency obligations of AIFMD (</span><span>“</span><span>AIFMD Disclosure </span><span>Provisions</span><span>”</span><span>) if such managers market a fund to EU investors. </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>175</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Where the AIFMD Disclosure Provisions relate to EU Operative Provisions that do not apply to BFA, no meaningful disclosure </span><span>can be made. These EU Operative Provisions include prescriptive rules on: measuring and capping leverage in line with </span><span>known European standards; the treatment of investors; the use of </span><span>“</span><span>depositaries</span><span>”</span><span>; and coverage for professional liability risks. </span></div> <div><span>AIFMD imposes certain conditions on the marketing of funds, such as the Funds, to EU investors. AIFMD requires that an </span><span>‘alternative investment fund manager’ (</span><span>“</span><span>AIFM</span><span>”</span><span>) be identified to meet such conditions where such marketing is sought. For </span><span>these purposes BFA, as the legal entity responsible for performing the portfolio and risk management of the Funds, shall be </span><span>the AIFM. </span></div> <div><span>AIFMD requires disclosure on an ongoing basis of certain information relating to the use of special arrangements, leverage, </span><span>rights of reuse of collateral, guarantees granted under leverage arrangements and the use of gates, side pockets and similar </span><span>liquidity management tools. Given that the Funds do not use any special arrangements or allow for collateral reuse, it is not </span><span>intended that such disclosures will need to be made by the Funds. Each Fund will, however, to the extent relevant and </span><span>appropriate, disclose in its annual report information on the Fund's leverage, risk profile and risk management systems </span><span>employed by BFA. Each Fund will also disclose material changes, if any, to the liquidity management systems and procedures </span><span>employed in respect of the Fund. </span></div> <div><span>BFA has registered the following Funds for marketing to investors in Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the U.K.:</span></div> <div><span>iShares Biotechnology ETF</span> <br/><span>iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF</span> <br/><span>iShares Core S&amp;P Mid-Cap ETF</span> <br/><span> </span><span>iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF</span> <br/><span> </span><span>iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF</span> <br/><span> </span><span>iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF</span> <br/><span> </span><span>iShares Russell 2000 ETF</span> <br/><span> </span><span>iShares Russell 3000 ETF</span> <br/><span> </span><span>iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF</span> <br/><span> </span><span>iShares U.S. Regional Banks ETF</span></div> <div><span>Investors’ Rights. </span><span> </span><span>Each Fund relies on the services of BFA and its other service providers, including the Distributor, </span><span>administrator, custodian and transfer agent. Further information about the duties and roles of these service providers is set </span><span>out in this SAI. Investors who acquire shares of a Fund are not parties to the relevant agreement with these service providers </span><span>and do not have express contractual rights against the Fund or its service providers, except certain institutional investors that </span><span>are Authorized Participants may have certain express contractual rights with respect to the Distributor under the terms of the </span><span>relevant Authorized Participant Agreement. Investors may have certain legal rights under federal or state law against a Fund </span><span>or its service providers. In the event that an investor considers that it may have a claim against a Fund, or against any service </span><span>provider in connection with its investment in a Fund, such investor should consult its own legal advisor.</span></div> <div><span>By contract, Authorized Participants irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State or U.S. federal </span><span>court sitting in New York City over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Authorized Participant </span><span>Agreement. Jurisdiction over other claims, whether by investors or Authorized Participants, will turn on the facts of the </span><span>particular case and the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceeding is brought.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>176</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Introduction to BlackRock</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock’s purpose is to help more and more people experience financial well-being. We manage assets on behalf of </span><span>institutional and individual clients, across a full spectrum of investment strategies, asset classes, and regions. Our client base </span><span>includes pension plans, endowments, foundations, charities, official institutions, insurers, and other financial institutions, as </span><span>well as individuals around the world. As part of our fiduciary duty to our clients, we consider it one of our responsibilities to </span><span>promote sound corporate governance, as an informed, engaged shareholder on their behalf. At BlackRock, this is the </span><span>responsibility of the Investment Stewardship team.</span></div> <div><span>Philosophy on investment stewardship</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Companies are responsible for ensuring they have appropriate governance structures to serve the interests of shareholders </span><span>and other key stakeholders. We believe that there are certain fundamental rights attached to shareholding. Companies and </span><span>their boards should be accountable to shareholders and structured with appropriate checks and balances to ensure that they </span><span>operate in shareholders’ best interests to create sustainable value. Shareholders should have the right to vote to elect, </span><span>remove, and nominate directors, approve the appointment of the auditor, and amend the corporate charter or by-laws. </span><span>Shareholders should be able to vote on key board decisions that are material to the protection of their investment, including </span><span>but not limited to, changes to the purpose of the business, dilution levels and pre-emptive rights, and the distribution of </span><span>income and capital structure. In order to make informed decisions, shareholders need sufficient and timely information. In </span><span>addition, shareholder voting rights should be proportionate to their economic ownership—the principle of </span><span>“</span><span>one share, one </span><span>vote</span><span>”</span><span> helps achieve this balance.</span></div> <div><span>Consistent with these shareholder rights, BlackRock has a responsibility to monitor and provide feedback to companies in our </span><span>role as stewards of our clients’ investments. Investment stewardship is how we use our voice as an investor to promote </span><span>sound corporate governance and business practices to help maximize long-term shareholder value for our clients, the vast </span><span>majority of whom are investing for long-term goals such as retirement. BlackRock Investment Stewardship (BIS) does this </span><span>through engagement with management teams and/or board members on material business issues and, for those clients </span><span>who have given us authority, through voting proxies in their best long-term financial interests.</span><span>1</span><span> We also contribute to </span><span>consultations on public policy and private sector initiatives on industry standards, consistent with our clients’ interests as </span><span>long-term shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock looks to companies to provide timely, accurate, and comprehensive disclosure on all material governance and </span><span>business matters. This transparency allows shareholders to appropriately understand and assess how relevant risks and </span><span>opportunities are being effectively identified and managed. Where company reporting and disclosure is inadequate or where </span><span>the governance approach taken may be inconsistent with durable, long-term value creation for shareholders, we will engage </span><span>with a company and/or vote in a manner that advances long-term shareholders’ interests.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock views engagement as an important activity; engagement provides us with the opportunity to improve our </span><span>understanding of the business and of the risks and opportunities that are material to the companies in which our clients </span><span>invest. Engagement may also inform our voting decisions. As long-term investors on behalf of clients, we seek to have regular </span><span>and continuing dialogue with executives and board directors to advance sound governance and durable business practices </span><span>aligned with long-term value creation, as well as to understand the effectiveness of the company’s management and </span><span>oversight of material issues. Engagement is an important mechanism for providing feedback on company practices and </span><span>disclosures, particularly where we believe they could be enhanced to support a company’s ability to deliver financial </span><span>performance. Similarly, it provides us with an opportunity to hear directly from company boards and management on how </span><span>they believe their actions are aligned with durable, long-term value creation.</span></div> <div><span>We generally vote in support of management and boards that exhibit an approach to decision-making that is consistent with </span><span>creating durable, long-term value for shareholders. If we have concerns about a company’s approach, we may choose to </span><span>explain our expectations to the company’s board and management. Following that engagement, we may signal through our </span><span>voting that we have outstanding concerns, generally by voting against the re-election of directors we view as having </span><span>responsibility for an issue. We apply our regional proxy voting guidelines to achieve the outcome that is most aligned with </span><span>our clients’ long-term financial interests.</span></div> <div><span>Key Themes</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> <div><span>Through BlackRock Voting Choice we have, since January 2022, made proxy voting easier and more accessible for investors in separate accounts and </span><span>certain pooled vehicles. As a result, the shares attributed to BlackRock in company share registers may be voted differently depending on whether our </span><span>clients have authorized BIS to vote on their behalf, have authorized BIS to vote in accordance with a third party policy, or have elected to vote shares in </span><span>accordance with their own policy. We are not able to disclose which clients have opted to exercise greater control over their voting, nor are we able to </span><span>disclose which proxy voting policies they have selected.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>We recognize that accepted standards and norms of corporate governance can differ between markets. However, in our </span><span>experience, there are certain fundamental elements of governance practice that are intrinsic globally to a company’s ability to </span><span>create long-term value for shareholders. These global themes are set out in this overarching set of principles (the Principles), </span><span>which are anchored in transparency and accountability. At a minimum, it is our view that companies should observe the </span><span>accepted corporate governance standards in their domestic market and ask that, if they do not, they explain how their </span><span>approach better supports durable, long-term value creation.</span></div> <div><span>These Principles cover seven key themes:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Boards and directors</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Auditors and audit-related issues</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Capital structure, mergers, asset sales, and other special transactions</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Compensation and benefits</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Material sustainability-related risks and opportunities</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Other corporate governance matters and shareholder protections</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Shareholder proposals</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>Our regional and market-specific </span><span>voting guidelines</span><span> explain how these Principles inform our voting decisions in relation to </span><span>specific ballot items for shareholder meetings.</span></div> <div><span>Boards and directors</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Our primary focus is on the performance of the board of directors to promote sound corporate governance. The performance </span><span>of the board is critical to the economic success of the company and the protection of shareholders’ interests. As part of their </span><span>responsibilities, board members owe fiduciary duties to shareholders in overseeing the strategic direction and operation of </span><span>the company. For this reason, BIS sees engaging with and the election of directors as one of our most important and </span><span>impactful responsibilities.</span></div> <div><span>We support boards whose approach is consistent with creating durable, long-term value. This includes the effective </span><span>corporate governance and management of material sustainability-related risks and opportunities,</span><span>2</span><span> as well as the </span><span>consideration of the company’s key constituents including their employees, clients, suppliers, and the communities within </span><span>which they operate. The board should establish and maintain a framework of robust and effective governance mechanisms </span><span>to support its oversight of the company’s strategic aims. We look to the board to articulate the effectiveness of these </span><span>mechanisms in overseeing the management of business risks and opportunities and the fulfillment of the company’s </span><span>purpose. Disclosure of all material issues that affect the company’s long-term strategy and ability to create value is essential </span><span>for shareholders to be able to appropriately understand and assess how risks are effectively identified, managed and </span><span>mitigated.</span></div> <div><span>Where a company has not adequately disclosed and demonstrated that they have fulfilled these responsibilities, we will </span><span>consider voting against the re-election of directors whom we consider to have particular responsibility for the issue. We </span><span>assess director performance on a case-by-case basis and in light of each company’s circumstances, taking into consideration </span><span>our assessment of their governance, business practices that support durable, long-term value creation, and performance. In </span><span>serving the interests of shareholders, the responsibility of the board of directors includes, but is not limited to, the following:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Establishing an appropriate corporate governance structure</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Supporting and overseeing management in setting long-term strategic goals and applicable measures of value-creation </span><span>and milestones that will demonstrate progress, and taking steps to address anticipated or actual obstacles to success</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Providing oversight on the identification and management of material governance and sustainability-related risks</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> <div><span>By material sustainability-related risks and opportunities, we mean the drivers of risk and value creation in a company’s business model that have an </span><span>environmental or social dependency or impact. Examples of environmental issues include, but are not limited to, water use, land use, waste </span><span>management and climate risk. Examples of social issues include, but are not limited to, human capital management, impacts on the communities in </span><span>which a company operates, customer loyalty and relationships with regulators. It is our view that well-managed companies will effectively evaluate </span><span>and manage material sustainability-related risks and opportunities relevant to their businesses. Governance is the core means by which boards can </span><span>oversee the creation of durable, long-term value. Appropriate risk oversight of business-relevant and material sustainability-related considerations is a </span><span>component of a sound governance framework.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

Set out below are ways in which boards and directors can demonstrate a commitment to acting in the </span><span>best long-term economic interests of all shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>We will seek to engage with the appropriate directors where we have concerns about the performance of the company, </span><span>board, or individual directors and may signal outstanding concerns in our voting. While we consider these principles to be </span><span>globally relevant, when assessing a board’s composition and governance processes, we consider local market norms and </span><span>regulations.</span></div> <div><span>Regular accountability</span></div> <div><span>It is our view that directors should stand for re-election on a regular basis, ideally annually. In our experience, annual re-elections</span><span> allow shareholders to reaffirm their support for board members or hold them accountable for their decisions in a </span><span>timely manner. When board members are not re-elected annually, in our experience, it is good practice for boards to have a </span><span>rotation policy to ensure that, through a board cycle, all directors have had their appointment re-confirmed, with a </span><span>proportion of directors being put forward for re-election at each annual general meeting.</span></div> <div><span>Effective board composition</span></div> <div><span>Regular director elections also give boards the opportunity to adjust their composition in an orderly way to reflect the </span><span>evolution of the company’s strategy and the market environment. In our view, it is beneficial for new directors to be brought </span><span>onto the board periodically to refresh the group’s thinking and in a manner that supports both continuity and appropriate </span><span>succession planning. We consider the average overall tenure of the board, where we are seeking a balance between the </span><span>knowledge and experience of longer-serving members and the fresh perspectives of newer members. We encourage </span><span>companies to keep under regular review the effectiveness of their board (including its size), and assess directors nominated </span><span>for election or re-election in the context of the composition of the board as a whole. This assessment should consider a </span><span>number of factors, including the potential need to address gaps in skills, experience, independence, and diversity.</span></div> <div><span>In our view, there should be a sufficient number of independent directors, free from conflicts of interest or undue influence </span><span>from connected parties, to ensure objectivity in the decision-making of the board and its ability to oversee management. </span><span>Common impediments to independence may include but are not limited to:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Current or recent employment at the company or subsidiary</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Being, or representing, a shareholder with a substantial shareholding in the company</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Interlocking directorships</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Having any other interest, business or other relationship which could, or could reasonably be perceived to, materially </span><span>interfere with a director’s ability to act in the best interests of the company and their shareholders</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>In our experience, boards are most effective at overseeing and advising management when there is a senior independent </span><span>board leader. This director may chair the board, or, where the chair is also the CEO (or is otherwise not independent), be </span><span>designated as a lead independent director. The role of this director is to enhance the effectiveness of the independent </span><span>members of the board through shaping the agenda, ensuring adequate information is provided to the board, and </span><span>encouraging independent director participation in board deliberations. The lead independent director or another appropriate </span><span>director should be available to shareholders in those situations where an independent director is best placed to explain and </span><span>contextualize a company’s approach.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> <div><span>Enterprise risk management is a process, effected by the entity’s board of directors, management, and other personnel, applied in strategy setting and </span><span>across the enterprise, designed to identify potential events that may affect the entity, and manage risk to be within the risk appetite, to provide </span><span>reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives.

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>When nominating new directors to the board, we look to companies to provide sufficient information on the individual </span><span>candidates so that shareholders can assess the suitability of each individual nominee and the overall board composition. </span><span>These disclosures should give an understanding of how the collective experience and expertise of the board aligns with the </span><span>company’s long-term strategy and business model. Highly qualified, engaged directors with professional characteristics </span><span>relevant to a company’s business enhance the ability of the board to add value and be the voice of shareholders in board </span><span>discussions. In our view, a strong board provides a competitive advantage to a company, providing valuable oversight and </span><span>contributing to the most important management decisions that support long-term financial performance.</span></div> <div><span>It is in this context that we are interested in diversity in the board room. We see it as a means to promoting diversity of </span><span>thought and avoiding </span><span>“</span><span>group think</span><span>”</span><span> in the board’s exercise of its responsibilities to advise and oversee management. It allows </span><span>boards to have deeper discussions and make more resilient decisions. We ask boards to disclose how diversity is considered </span><span>in board composition, including professional characteristics, such as a director’s industry experience, specialist areas of </span><span>expertise and geographic location; as well as demographic characteristics such as gender, race/ethnicity and age.</span></div> <div><span>We look to understand a board’s diversity in the context of a company’s domicile, market capitalization, business model and </span><span>strategy. Increasingly, we see leading boards adding members whose experience deepens the board’s understanding of the </span><span>company’s customers, employees and communities. Self-identified board demographic diversity can usefully be disclosed in </span><span>aggregate, consistent with local law. We believe boards should aspire to meaningful diversity of membership, at least </span><span>consistent with local regulatory requirements and best practices, while recognizing that building a strong, diverse board can </span><span>take time.</span></div> <div><span>This position is based on our view that diversity of perspective and thought – in the board room, in the management team </span><span>and throughout the company – leads to better long term economic outcomes for companies. Academic research already </span><span>reveals correlations between specific dimensions of diversity and effects on decision-making processes and outcomes.</span><span>4</span><span> In </span><span>our experience, greater diversity in the board room contributes to more robust discussions and more innovative and resilient </span><span>decisions. Over time, greater diversity in the board room can also promote greater diversity and resilience in the leadership </span><span>team, and the workforce more broadly. That diversity can enable companies to develop businesses that more closely reflect </span><span>and resonate with the customers and communities they serve.</span></div> <div><span>There are matters for which the board has responsibility that may involve a conflict of interest for executives or for affiliated </span><span>directors. It is our view that objective oversight of such matters is best achieved when the board forms committees </span><span>comprised entirely of independent directors. In many markets, these committees of the board specialize in audit, director </span><span>nominations, and compensation matters. An ad hoc committee might also be formed to decide on a special transaction, </span><span>particularly one involving a related party, or to investigate a significant adverse event.</span></div> <div><span>Sufficient capacity</span></div> <div><span>As the role and expectations of a director are increasingly demanding, directors must be able to commit an appropriate </span><span>amount of time to board and committee matters. It is important that directors have the capacity to meet all of their </span><span>responsibilities - including when there are unforeseen events – and therefore, they should not take on an excessive number of </span><span>roles that would impair their ability to fulfill their duties.</span></div> <div><span>Auditors and audit-related issues</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock recognizes the critical importance of financial statements, which should provide a true and fair picture of a </span><span>company’s financial condition. Accordingly, the assumptions made by management and reviewed by the auditor in preparing </span><span>the financial statements should be reasonable and justified.</span></div> <div><span>The accuracy of financial statements, inclusive of financial and non-financial information as required or permitted under </span><span>market-specific accounting rules, is of paramount importance to BlackRock. Investors increasingly recognize that a broader </span><span>range of risks and opportunities have the potential to materially impact financial performance. Over time, we anticipate </span><span>investors and other users of company reporting will increasingly seek to understand and scrutinize the assumptions </span><span>underlying financial statements, particularly those that pertain to the impact of the transition to a low carbon economy on a </span><span>company’s business model and asset mix. We recognize that this is an area of evolving practice and we look to international </span><span>standards setters, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International Auditing and Assurance </span><span>Standards Board (IAASB) to provide additional guidance to companies.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> <div><span>For a discussion on the different impacts of diversity see: McKinsey, </span><span>“</span><span>Diversity Wins: How Inclusion Matters</span><span>”</span><span>, May 2022; Harvard Business Review, </span><span>Diverse Teams Feel Less Comfortable – and That’s Why They Perform Better, September 2016; </span><span>“</span><span>Do Diverse Directors Influence DEI Outcomes</span><span>”</span><span>, </span><span>September 2022.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-7</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>In this context, audit committees, or equivalent, play a vital role in a company’s financial reporting system by providing </span><span>independent oversight of the accounts, material financial and, where appropriate to the jurisdiction, non-financial </span><span>information, internal control frameworks, and in the absence of a dedicated risk committee, Enterprise Risk Management </span><span>systems. In our view, effective audit committee oversight strengthens the quality and reliability of a company’s financial </span><span>statements and provides an important level of reassurance to shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>We hold members of the audit committee or equivalent responsible for overseeing the management of the audit function. </span><span>Audit committees or equivalent should have clearly articulated charters that set out their responsibilities and have a rotation </span><span>plan in place that allows for a periodic refreshment of the committee membership to introduce fresh perspectives to audit </span><span>oversight. We recognize that audit committees will rely on management, internal audit and the independent auditor in </span><span>fulfilling their responsibilities but look to committee members to demonstrate they have relevant expertise to monitor and </span><span>oversee those functions.</span></div> <div><span>We take particular note of unexplained changes in reporting methodology, cases involving significant financial restatements, </span><span>or ad hoc notifications of material financial weakness. In this respect, audit committees should provide timely disclosure on </span><span>the remediation of Key and Critical Audit Matters identified either by the external auditor or internal audit function.</span></div> <div><span>The integrity of financial statements depends on the auditor being free of any impediments to being an effective check on </span><span>management. To that end, it is important that auditors are, and are seen to be, independent. Where an audit firm provides </span><span>services to the company in addition to the audit, the fees earned should be disclosed and explained. Audit committees </span><span>should have in place a procedure for assessing annually the independence of the auditor and the quality of the external audit </span><span>process.</span></div> <div><span>Comprehensive disclosure provides investors with a sense of the company’s long-term operational risk management </span><span>practices and, more broadly, the quality of the board’s oversight. The audit committee or equivalent, or a dedicated risk </span><span>committee, should periodically review the company’s risk assessment and risk management policies and the significant risks </span><span>and exposures identified by management, the internal auditors or the independent accountants, and management’s steps to </span><span>address them. In the absence of robust disclosures, we may reasonably conclude that companies are not adequately </span><span>managing risk.</span></div> <div><span>Capital structure, mergers, asset sales, and other special transactions</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The capital structure of a company is critical to shareholders as it impacts the value of their investment and the priority of </span><span>their interest in the company relative to that of other equity or debt investors. Pre-emptive rights are a key protection for </span><span>shareholders against the dilution of their interests.</span></div> <div><span>Effective voting rights are basic rights of share ownership. It is our view that one vote for one share as a guiding principle </span><span>supports effective corporate governance. Shareholders, as the residual claimants, have the strongest interest in protecting </span><span>company value, and voting rights should match economic exposure.</span></div> <div><span>In principle, we disagree with the creation of a share class with equivalent economic exposure and preferential, differentiated </span><span>voting rights. In our view, this structure violates the fundamental corporate governance principle of proportionality and </span><span>results in a concentration of power in the hands of a few shareholders, thus disenfranchising other shareholders and </span><span>amplifying any potential conflicts of interest. However, we recognize that in certain markets, at least for a period of time, </span><span>companies may have a valid argument for listing dual classes of shares with differentiated voting rights. In our view, such </span><span>companies should review these share class structures on a regular basis or as company circumstances change.</span></div> <div><span>Additionally, they should seek shareholder approval of their capital structure on a periodic basis via a management proposal </span><span>at the company’s shareholder meeting. The proposal should give unaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to affirm the </span><span>current structure or establish mechanisms to end or phase out controlling structures at the appropriate time, while </span><span>minimizing costs to shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>In assessing mergers, asset sales, or other special transactions, BlackRock’s primary consideration is the long-term economic </span><span>interests of our clients as shareholders. Boards proposing a transaction need to clearly explain the economic and strategic </span><span>rationale behind it. We will review a proposed transaction to determine the degree to which it can enhance long-term </span><span>shareholder value. We would prefer that proposed transactions have the unanimous support of the board and have been </span><span>negotiated at arm’s length. We may seek reassurance from the board that executives’ and/or board members’ financial </span><span>interests in a given transaction have not adversely affected their ability to place shareholders’ interests before their own. </span><span>Where the transaction involves related parties, the recommendation to support should come from the independent directors, </span><span>a best practice in most markets, and ideally, the terms should have been assessed through an independent appraisal process. </span><span>In addition, it is good practice that it be approved by a separate vote of the non-conflicted parties.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>As a matter of sound governance practice, shareholders should have a right to dispose of company shares in the open </span><span>market without unnecessary restriction. In our view, corporate mechanisms designed to limit shareholders’ ability to sell their </span><span>shares are contrary to basic property rights. Such mechanisms can serve to protect and entrench interests other than those </span><span>of the shareholders. In our experience, shareholders are broadly capable of making decisions in their own best interests. We </span><span>encourage any so-called </span><span>“</span><span>shareholder rights plans</span><span>”</span><span> proposed by a board to be subject to shareholder approval upon </span><span>introduction and periodically thereafter.</span></div> <div><span>Compensation and benefits</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>In most markets, one of the most important roles for a company’s board of directors is to put in place a compensation </span><span>structure that incentivizes and rewards executives appropriately. There should be a clear link between variable pay and </span><span>operational and financial performance. Performance metrics should be stretching and aligned with a company’s strategy and </span><span>business model. BIS does not have a position on the use of sustainability-related criteria, but in our view, where companies </span><span>choose to include them, they should be as rigorous as other financial or operational targets. Long-term incentive plans </span><span>should vest over timeframes aligned with the delivery of long-term shareholder value. Compensation committees should </span><span>guard against contractual arrangements that would entitle executives to material compensation for early termination of their </span><span>employment. Finally, pension contributions and other deferred compensation arrangements should be reasonable in light of </span><span>market practice.</span></div> <div><span>We are not supportive of one-off or special bonuses unrelated to company or individual performance. Where discretion has </span><span>been used by the compensation committee or its equivalent, we expect disclosure relating to how and why the discretion </span><span>was used, and how the adjusted outcome is aligned with the interests of shareholders. We acknowledge that the use of peer </span><span>group evaluation by compensation committees can help ensure competitive pay; however, we are concerned when the </span><span>rationale for increases in total compensation at a company is solely based on peer benchmarking rather than a rigorous </span><span>measure of outperformance. We encourage companies to clearly explain how compensation outcomes have rewarded </span><span>outperformance against peer firms.</span></div> <div><span>We believe consideration should be given to building claw back provisions into incentive plans such that executives would be </span><span>required to forgo rewards when they are not justified by actual performance and/or when compensation was based on faulty </span><span>financial reporting or deceptive business practices. We also favor recoupment from any senior executive whose behavior </span><span>caused material financial harm to shareholders, material reputational risk to the company, or resulted in a criminal </span><span>investigation, even if such actions did not ultimately result in a material restatement of past results.</span></div> <div><span>Non-executive directors should be compensated in a manner that is commensurate with the time and effort expended in </span><span>fulfilling their professional responsibilities. Additionally, these compensation arrangements should not risk compromising </span><span>directors’ independence or aligning their interests too closely with those of the management, whom they are charged with </span><span>overseeing.</span></div> <div><span>We use third party research, in addition to our own analysis, to evaluate existing and proposed compensation structures. We </span><span>may vote against members of the compensation committee or equivalent board members for poor compensation practices </span><span>or structures.</span></div> <div><span>Material sustainability-related risks and opportunities</span></div> <div><span>It is our view that well-managed companies will effectively evaluate and manage material sustainability-related risks and </span><span>opportunities relevant to their businesses. Appropriate oversight of sustainability considerations is a core component of </span><span>having an effective governance framework, which supports durable, long-term value creation.</span></div> <div><span>Robust disclosure is essential for investors to effectively evaluate companies’ strategy and business practices related to </span><span>material sustainability-related risks and opportunities. Given the increased understanding of material sustainability-related </span><span>risks and opportunities and the need for better information to assess them, BlackRock advocates for continued improvement </span><span>in companies’ reporting, where necessary, and will express any concerns through our voting where a company’s actions or </span><span>disclosures are inadequate.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock encourages companies to use the framework developed by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial </span><span>Disclosures (TCFD) to disclose their approach to ensuring they have a sustainable business model and to supplement that </span><span>disclosure with industry-specific metrics such as those identified by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), </span><span>now part of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) under the International Financial Reporting Standards </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-9</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

SASB’s industry-specific </span><span>guidance (as identified in its materiality map) is beneficial in helping companies identify key performance indicators (KPIs) </span><span>across various dimensions of sustainability that are considered to be financially material and decision-useful within their </span><span>industry. In particular, we encourage companies to consider reporting on nature-related factors, given the growing materiality </span><span>of these issues for many businesses.</span><span>6</span><span> We recognize that some companies may report using different standards, which may </span><span>be required by regulation, or one of a number of voluntary standards. In such cases, we ask that companies highlight the </span><span>metrics that are industry- or company-specific.</span></div> <div><span>Climate and other sustainability-related disclosures often require companies to collect and aggregate data from various </span><span>internal and external sources. We recognize that the practical realities of data-collection and reporting may not line up with </span><span>financial reporting cycles and companies may require additional time after their fiscal year-end to accurately collect, analyze </span><span>and report this data to investors. To give investors time to assess the data, we encourage companies to produce climate and </span><span>other sustainability-related disclosures sufficiently in advance of their annual meeting.</span></div> <div><span>Companies may also adopt or refer to guidance on sustainable and responsible business conduct issued by supranational </span><span>organizations such as the United Nations or the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Further, industry </span><span>initiatives on managing specific operational risks may provide useful guidance to companies on best practices and </span><span>disclosures. Companies should disclose any relevant global climate and other sustainability-related standards adopted, the </span><span>industry initiatives in which they participate, any peer group benchmarking undertaken, and any assurance processes to help </span><span>investors understand their approach to sustainable and responsible business practices.</span></div> <div><span>Climate risk</span></div> <div><span>It is our view that climate change has become a key factor in many companies’ long-term prospects. As such, as long-term </span><span>investors we are interested in understanding how companies may be impacted by material climate-related risks and </span><span>opportunities – just as we seek to understand other business-relevant risks and opportunities – and how these factors are </span><span>considered within strategy in a manner consistent with the company’s business model and sector. Specifically, we look for </span><span>companies to disclose strategies they have in place that mitigate and are resilient to any material risks to their long-term </span><span>business model associated with a range of climate-related scenarios, including a scenario in which global warming is limited </span><span>to well below 2°C, considering global ambitions to achieve a limit of 1.5°C.</span><span>7</span><span> It is, of course, up to each company to define </span><span>their own strategy: that is not the role of BlackRock or other investors.</span></div> <div><span>BIS recognizes that climate change can be challenging for many companies, as they seek to drive long-term value by </span><span>mitigating risks and capturing opportunities. A growing number of companies, financial institutions, as well as governments, </span><span>have committed to advancing decarbonization in line with the Paris Agreement. There is growing consensus that companies </span><span>can benefit from the more favorable macro-economic environment under an orderly, timely and equitable global energy </span><span>transition.</span><span>8</span><span> Yet the path ahead is deeply uncertain and uneven, with different parts of the economy moving at different </span><span>speeds.</span><span>9</span><span> Many companies are asking what their role should be in contributing to an orderly and equitable transition – in </span><span>ensuring a reliable energy supply and energy security, and in protecting the most vulnerable from energy price shocks and </span><span>economic dislocation. In this context, we encourage companies to include in their disclosure a business plan for how they </span><span>intend to deliver long-term financial performance through a transition to global net zero carbon emissions, consistent with </span><span>their business model and sector.</span></div> <div><span>We look to companies to disclose short-, medium- and long-term targets, ideally science-based targets where these are </span><span>available for their sector, for Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reductions and to demonstrate how their </span><span>targets are consistent with the long-term economic interests of their shareholders.

We also recognize that continued investment in traditional energy sources, including oil and </span><span>gas, is required to maintain an orderly and equitable transition — and that divestiture of carbon-intensive assets is unlikely to </span><span>contribute to global emissions reductions. We encourage companies to disclose how their capital allocation to various energy </span><span>sources is consistent with their strategy.</span></div> <div><span>At this stage, we view Scope 3 emissions differently from Scopes 1 and 2, given methodological complexity, regulatory </span><span>uncertainty, concerns about double-counting, and lack of direct control by companies. While we welcome any disclosures </span><span>and commitments companies choose to make regarding Scope 3 emissions, we recognize these are provided on a good-faith </span><span>basis as methodology develops. Our publicly available commentary provides more information on our approach to climate </span><span>risk.</span></div> <div><span>Key stakeholder interests</span></div> <div><span>In order to advance long-term shareholders’ interests, companies should consider the interests of the various parties on </span><span>whom they depend for their success over time. It is for each company to determine their key stakeholders based on what is </span><span>material to their business and long-term financial performance. Most commonly, key stakeholders include employees, </span><span>business partners (such as suppliers and distributors), clients and consumers, regulators, and the communities in which they </span><span>operate.</span></div> <div><span>Considering the interests of key stakeholders recognizes the collective nature of long-term value creation and the extent to </span><span>which each company’s prospects for growth are tied to its ability to foster strong sustainable relationships with and support </span><span>from those stakeholders. Companies should articulate how they address adverse impacts that could arise from their business </span><span>practices and affect critical business relationships with their stakeholders. We encourage companies to implement, to the </span><span>extent appropriate, monitoring processes (often referred to as due diligence) to identify and mitigate potential adverse </span><span>impacts and grievance mechanisms to remediate any actual adverse material impacts. In our view, maintaining trust within </span><span>these relationships can contribute to a company’s long-term success.</span></div> <div><span>As a long-term shareholder on behalf of our clients, we find it helpful when companies disclose how they have identified </span><span>their key stakeholders and considered their interests in business decision-making. We are also interested to understand the </span><span>role of the board, which is well positioned to ensure that the approach taken is informed by and aligns with the company’s </span><span>strategy and purpose.</span></div> <div><span>Other corporate governance matters and shareholder protections</span></div> <div><span>It is our view that shareholders have a right to material and timely information on the financial performance and viability of </span><span>the companies in which they invest. In addition, companies should publish information on the governance structures in place </span><span>and the rights of shareholders to influence these structures. The reporting and disclosure provided by companies help </span><span>shareholders assess whether their economic interests have been protected and the quality of the board’s oversight of </span><span>management. We believe shareholders should have the right to vote on key corporate governance matters, including </span><span>changes to governance mechanisms, to submit proposals to the shareholders’ meeting, and to call special meetings of </span><span>shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>Corporate Form</span></div> <div><span>In our view, it is the responsibility of the board to determine the corporate form that is most appropriate given the company’s </span><span>purpose and business model.</span><span>10</span><span> Companies proposing to change their corporate form to a public benefit corporation or </span><span>similar entity should put it to a shareholder vote if not already required to do so under applicable law. Supporting </span><span>documentation from companies or shareholder proponents proposing to alter the corporate form should clearly articulate </span><span>how the interests of shareholders and different stakeholders would be impacted as well as the accountability and voting </span><span>mechanisms that would be available to shareholders. As a fiduciary on behalf of clients, we generally support management </span><span>proposals if our analysis indicates that shareholders’ interests are adequately protected. Relevant shareholder proposals are </span><span>evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</span></div> <div><span>Shareholder proposals</span></div> <div><span>In most markets in which BlackRock invests on behalf of clients, shareholders have the right to submit proposals to be voted </span><span>on by shareholders at a company’s annual or extraordinary meeting, as long as eligibility and procedural requirements are </span><span>met. The matters that we see put forward by shareholders address a wide range of topics, including governance reforms, </span><span>capital management, and improvements in the management or disclosure of sustainability-related risks.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> <div><span>Corporate form refers to the legal structure by which a business is organized.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>BlackRock is subject to certain requirements under antitrust law in the United States that place restrictions and limitations on </span><span>how BlackRock can interact with the companies in which we invest on behalf of our clients, including our ability to submit </span><span>shareholder proposals. As noted above, we can vote, on behalf of clients who authorize us to do so, on proposals put forth by </span><span>others.</span></div> <div><span>When assessing shareholder proposals, we evaluate each proposal on its merit, with a singular focus on its implications for </span><span>long-term value creation. We consider the business and economic relevance of the issue raised, as well as its materiality and </span><span>the urgency with which we believe it should be addressed. We take into consideration the legal effect of the proposal, as </span><span>shareholder proposals may be advisory or legally binding depending on the jurisdiction. We would not support proposals that </span><span>we believe would result in over-reaching into the basic business decisions of the company.</span></div> <div><span>Where a proposal is focused on a material governance or sustainability-related risk that we agree needs to be addressed and </span><span>the intended outcome is consistent with long-term value creation, we will look to the board and management to </span><span>demonstrate that the company has met the intent of the request made in the shareholder proposal. Where our analysis </span><span>and/or engagement indicate an opportunity for improvement in the company’s approach to the issue, we may support </span><span>shareholder proposals that are reasonable and not unduly prescriptive or constraining on management. Alternatively, or in </span><span>addition, we may vote against the re-election of one or more directors if, in our assessment, the board has not responded </span><span>sufficiently or with an appropriate sense of urgency. While we may not agree with all aspects of a shareholder proponent’s </span><span>views or all facets of the proponent’s supporting statement, we may still support proposals that address material governance </span><span>or sustainability-related risks where we believe it would be helpful for shareholders to have more detailed information on how </span><span>those risks are identified, monitored, and managed to support a company’s ability to deliver long-term financial returns. We </span><span>may also support a proposal if management is on track, but we believe that voting in favor might accelerate progress.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock’s oversight of its investment stewardship activities</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Oversight</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock maintains three regional advisory committees (Stewardship Advisory Committees) for a) the Americas; b) Europe, </span><span>the Middle East and Africa (EMEA); and c) Asia-Pacific, generally consisting of senior BlackRock investment professionals </span><span>and/or senior employees with practical boardroom experience. The regional Stewardship Advisory Committees review and </span><span>advise on amendments to BIS proxy voting guidelines covering markets within each respective region (Guidelines). The </span><span>advisory committees do not determine voting decisions, which are the responsibility of BIS.</span></div> <div><span>In addition to the regional Stewardship Advisory Committees, the Investment Stewardship Global Oversight Committee </span><span>(Global Committee) is a risk-focused committee, comprised of senior representatives from various BlackRock investment </span><span>teams, a senior legal representative, the Global Head of Investment Stewardship (Global Head), and other senior executives </span><span>with relevant experience and team oversight. The Global Oversight Committee does not determine voting decisions, which </span><span>are the responsibility of BIS.</span></div> <div><span>The Global Head has primary oversight of the activities of BIS, including voting in accordance with the Guidelines, which </span><span>require the application of professional judgment and consideration of each company’s unique circumstances. The Global </span><span>Committee reviews and approves amendments to these Principles. The Global Committee also reviews and approves </span><span>amendments to the regional Guidelines, as proposed by the regional Stewardship Advisory Committees.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, the Global Committee receives and reviews periodic reports regarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as updates on </span><span>material process issues, procedural changes, and other risk oversight considerations. The Global Committee reviews these </span><span>reports in an oversight capacity as informed by the BIS corporate governance engagement program and the Guidelines.</span></div> <div><span>BIS carries out engagement with companies, monitors and executes proxy votes, and conducts vote operations (including </span><span>maintaining records of votes cast) in a manner consistent with the relevant Guidelines. BIS also conducts research on </span><span>corporate governance issues and participates in industry discussions to contribute to and keep abreast of important </span><span>developments in the corporate governance field. BIS may utilize third parties for certain of the foregoing activities and </span><span>performs oversight of those third parties. BIS may raise complicated or particularly controversial matters for internal </span><span>discussion with the relevant investment teams and governance specialists for discussion and guidance prior to making a </span><span>voting decision.</span></div> <div><span>Vote execution</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock votes on proxy issues when our clients authorize us to do so.

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>consider proxies submitted to funds and other fiduciary account(s) (Fund or Funds) for which we have voting authority. </span><span>BlackRock votes (or refrains from voting) proxies for each Fund for which we have voting authority based on our evaluation </span><span>of the best long-term economic interests of our clients as shareholders, in the exercise of our independent business </span><span>judgment, and without regard to the relationship of the issuer of the proxy (or any shareholder proponent or dissident </span><span>shareholder) to the Fund, the Fund’s affiliates (if any), BlackRock or BlackRock’s affiliates, or BlackRock employees (see </span><span>“</span><span>Conflicts management policies and procedures</span><span>”</span><span>, below).</span></div> <div><span>When exercising voting rights, BlackRock will normally vote on specific proxy issues in accordance with the Guidelines for the </span><span>relevant market. The Guidelines are reviewed annually and are amended consistent with changes in the local market practice, </span><span>as developments in corporate governance occur, or as otherwise deemed advisable by the applicable Stewardship Advisory </span><span>Committees. BIS analysts may, in the exercise of their professional judgment, conclude that the Guidelines do not cover the </span><span>specific matter upon which a proxy vote is required or that an exception to the Guidelines would be in the best long-term </span><span>economic interests of BlackRock’s clients.</span></div> <div><span>In the uncommon circumstance of there being a vote with respect to fixed income securities or the securities of privately </span><span>held issuers, the decision generally will be made by a Fund’s portfolio managers and/or BIS based on their assessment of the </span><span>particular transactions or other matters at issue.</span></div> <div><span>In certain markets, proxy voting involves logistical issues which can affect BlackRock’s ability to vote such proxies, as well as </span><span>the desirability of voting such proxies. These issues include, but are not limited to: i) untimely notice of shareholder meetings; </span><span>ii) restrictions on a foreigner’s ability to exercise votes; iii) requirements to vote proxies in person; iv) </span><span>“</span><span>share-blocking</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>(requirements that investors who exercise their voting rights surrender the right to dispose of their holdings for some </span><span>specified period in proximity to the shareholder meeting); v) potential difficulties in translating the proxy; vi) regulatory </span><span>constraints; and vii) requirements to provide local agents with unrestricted powers of attorney to facilitate voting </span><span>instructions. We are not supportive of impediments to the exercise of voting rights such as share-blocking or overly </span><span>burdensome administrative requirements.</span></div> <div><span>As a consequence, BlackRock votes proxies in these situations on a </span><span>“</span><span>best-efforts</span><span>”</span><span> basis. In addition, BIS may determine that it </span><span>is generally in the best interests of BlackRock’s clients not to vote proxies (or not to vote our full allocation) if the costs </span><span>(including but not limited to opportunity costs associated with share-blocking constraints) associated with exercising a vote </span><span>are expected to outweigh the benefit the client would derive by voting on the proposal.</span></div> <div><span>Portfolio managers have full discretion to vote the shares in the Funds they manage based on their analysis of the economic </span><span>impact of a particular ballot item on their investors. Portfolio managers may, from time to time, reach differing views on how </span><span>best to maximize economic value with respect to a particular investment. Therefore, portfolio managers may, and sometimes </span><span>do, vote shares in the Funds under their management differently from BIS or from one another. However, because </span><span>BlackRock’s clients are mostly long-term investors with long-term economic goals, ballots are frequently cast in a uniform </span><span>manner.</span></div> <div><span>Conflicts management policies and procedures</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BIS maintains policies and procedures that seek to prevent undue influence on BlackRock’s proxy voting activity. Such </span><span>influence might stem from any relationship between the investee company (or any shareholder proponent or dissident </span><span>shareholder) and BlackRock, BlackRock’s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund’s affiliates, or BlackRock employees. The following are </span><span>examples of sources of perceived or potential conflicts of interest:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock clients who may be issuers of securities or proponents of shareholder resolutions</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock business partners or third parties who may be issuers of securities or proponents of shareholder resolutions</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock employees who may sit on the boards of public companies held in Funds managed by BlackRock</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Significant BlackRock, Inc. investors who may be issuers of securities held in Funds managed by BlackRock</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Securities of BlackRock, Inc. or BlackRock investment funds held in Funds managed by BlackRock</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock, Inc. board members who serve as senior executives of public companies held in Funds managed by </span><span>BlackRock</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>BlackRock has taken certain steps to mitigate perceived or potential conflicts including, but not limited to, the following:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Adopted the Guidelines which are designed to advance our clients’ interests in the companies in which BlackRock </span><span>invests on their behalf</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Established a reporting structure that separates BIS from employees with sales, vendor management, or business </span><span>partnership roles.

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>shareholders or shareholder proponents are managed consistently and without regard to BlackRock’s relationship with </span><span>such parties. Clients or business partners are not given special treatment or differentiated access to BIS. BIS prioritizes </span><span>engagements based on factors including, but not limited to, our need for additional information to make a voting </span><span>decision or our view on the likelihood that an engagement could lead to positive outcome(s) over time for the economic </span><span>value of the company. Within the normal course of business, BIS may engage directly with BlackRock clients, business </span><span>partners and/or third parties, and/or with employees with sales, vendor management, or business partnership roles, in </span><span>discussions regarding our approach to stewardship, general corporate governance matters, client reporting needs, </span><span>and/or to otherwise ensure that proxy-related client service levels are met</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Determined to engage, in certain instances, an independent third party voting service provider to make proxy voting </span><span>recommendations as a further safeguard to avoid potential conflicts of interest, to satisfy regulatory compliance </span><span>requirements, or as may be otherwise required by applicable law. In such circumstances, the voting service provider </span><span>provides BlackRock with recommendations, in accordance with the Guidelines, as to how to vote such proxies. </span><span>BlackRock uses an independent voting service provider to make proxy voting recommendations for shares of BlackRock, </span><span>Inc. and companies affiliated with BlackRock, Inc. BlackRock may also use an independent voting service provider to </span><span>make proxy voting recommendations for:</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>public companies that include BlackRock employees on their boards of directors</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>public companies of which a BlackRock, Inc. board member serves as a senior executive or a member of </span><span>the board of directors</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>public companies that are the subject of certain transactions involving BlackRock Funds</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>public companies that are joint venture partners with BlackRock, and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>public companies when legal or regulatory requirements compel BlackRock to use an independent voting </span><span>service provider</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>In selecting a voting service provider, we assess several characteristics, including but not limited to: independence, an ability </span><span>to analyze proxy issues and make recommendations in the best economic interest of our clients in accordance with the </span><span>Guidelines, reputation for reliability and integrity, and operational capacity to accurately deliver the assigned </span><span>recommendations in a timely manner. We may engage more than one voting service provider, in part to mitigate potential or </span><span>perceived conflicts of interest at a single voting service provider. The Global Committee appoints and reviews the </span><span>performance of the voting service providers, generally on an annual basis.</span></div> <div><span>Securities lending</span></div> <div><span>When so authorized, BlackRock acts as a securities lending agent on behalf of Funds. Securities lending is a well-regulated </span><span>practice that contributes to capital market efficiency. It also enables funds to generate additional returns for a fund, while </span><span>allowing fund providers to keep fund expenses lower.</span></div> <div><span>With regard to the relationship between securities lending and proxy voting, BlackRock’s approach is informed by our </span><span>fiduciary responsibility to act in our clients’ best interests. In most cases, BlackRock anticipates that the potential long-term </span><span>value to the Fund of voting shares would be less than the potential revenue the loan may provide the Fund. However, in </span><span>certain instances, BlackRock may determine, in its independent business judgment as a fiduciary, that the value of voting </span><span>outweighs the securities lending revenue loss to clients and would therefore recall shares to be voted in those instances.</span></div> <div><span>The decision to recall securities on loan as part of BlackRock’s securities lending program in order to vote is based on an </span><span>evaluation of various factors that include, but are not limited to, assessing potential securities lending revenue alongside the </span><span>potential long-term value to clients of voting those securities (based on the information available at the time of recall </span><span>consideration).</span><span>12</span><span> BIS works with colleagues in the Securities Lending and Risk and Quantitative Analysis teams to evaluate </span><span>the costs and benefits to clients of recalling shares on loan.</span></div> <div><span>Periodically, BlackRock reviews our process for determining whether to recall securities on loan in order to vote and may </span><span>modify it as necessary.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>12</span></div> <div><span>Recalling securities on loan can be impacted by the timing of record dates. In the United States, for example, the record date of a shareholder meeting </span><span>typically falls before the proxy statements are released. Accordingly, it is not practicable to evaluate a proxy statement, determine that a vote has a </span><span>material impact on a fund and recall any shares on loan in advance of the record date for the annual meeting. As a result, managers must weigh </span><span>independent business judgement as a fiduciary, the benefit to a fund’s shareholders of recalling loaned shares in advance of an estimated record date </span><span>without knowing whether there will be a vote on matters which have a material impact on the fund (thereby forgoing potential securities lending </span><span>revenue for the fund’s shareholders) or leaving shares on loan to potentially earn revenue for the fund (thereby forgoing the opportunity to vote).</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Voting guidelines</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The issue-specific Guidelines published for each region/country in which we vote are intended to summarize BlackRock’s </span><span>general philosophy and approach to issues that may commonly arise in the proxy voting context in each market where we </span><span>invest. The Guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. BIS applies the Guidelines on a case-by-case basis, in the context of </span><span>the individual circumstances of each company and the specific issue under review. As such, the Guidelines do not indicate </span><span>how BIS will vote in every instance. Rather, they reflect our view about corporate governance issues generally, and provide </span><span>insight into how we typically approach issues that commonly arise on corporate ballots.</span></div> <div><span>Reporting and vote transparency</span></div> <div><span>We are committed to transparency in the stewardship work we do on behalf of clients. We inform clients about our </span><span>engagement and voting policies and activities through direct communication and through disclosure on our website. Each </span><span>year we publish an annual report that provides a global overview of our investment stewardship engagement and voting </span><span>activities and a voting spotlight that summarizes our voting over a proxy year.</span><span>13</span><span> Additionally, we make public our market-specific</span><span> voting guidelines for the benefit of clients and companies with whom we engage. We also publish commentaries to </span><span>share our perspective on market developments and emerging key themes.</span></div> <div><span>At a more granular level, we publish quarterly our vote record for each company that held a shareholder meeting during the </span><span>period, showing how we voted on each proposal and explaining any votes against management proposals or on shareholder </span><span>proposals. For shareholder meetings where a vote might be high profile or of significant interest to clients, we may publish a </span><span>vote bulletin after the meeting, disclosing and explaining our vote on key proposals. We also publish a quarterly list of all </span><span>companies with which we engaged and the key topics addressed in the engagement meeting.</span></div> <div><span>In this way, we help inform our clients about the work we do on their behalf in promoting the governance and business </span><span>models that support durable, long-term value creation.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>13</span></div> <div><span>The proxy year runs from July 1 to June 30 of the proceeding calendar year.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-15</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

After market close on October 30, 2023, the Fund will cease the creation and redemption of Creation Units. Trading </span><span>in the Fund will be halted prior to market open on October 31, 2023. Proceeds of the liquidation are currently scheduled to be </span><span>sent to Fund shareholders on or around November 2, 2023 (the </span><span>“</span><span>Liquidation Date</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> <div><span>While the Fund is in the process of liquidating its portfolio, which is anticipated to commence prior to October 30, 2023, the </span><span>Fund will hold cash and securities that will not be consistent with its investment objective and strategies and is likely to incur </span><span>higher tracking error than is typical for the Fund. Furthermore, the Trust cannot assure that there will be a trading market for </span><span>Fund shares between market close on October 30, 2023 and the Liquidation Date because Fund shares will not be traded on </span><span>the primary listing exchange identified in the Prospectus for the Fund (the </span><span>“</span><span>Listing Exchange</span><span>”</span><span>) during that period.</span></div> <div><span>Shareholders may sell their holdings of the Fund on its Listing Exchange until market close on October 30, 2023 and may </span><span>incur the usual and customary brokerage commissions associated with the sale of Fund shares. As of the Liquidation Date, </span><span>shares of the Fund will be individually redeemed. If you hold Fund shares on the Liquidation Date, the Fund will automatically </span><span>redeem your shares for cash based on the net asset value of the Fund as of the close of business on October 30, 2023, which </span><span>will include any dividends or distributions calculated as of that date.</span></div> <div><span>If you are subject to U.S. federal income tax, the liquidation of the Fund will result in one or more taxable events for you. A </span><span>sale or exchange of Fund shares prior to the Liquidation Date will generally give rise to a capital gain or loss to you for federal </span><span>income tax purposes. In connection with the liquidation, the Fund may declare taxable distributions of its investment income </span><span>or taxable distributions of its net capital gain. Any liquidation proceeds paid to you should generally be treated as received by </span><span>you in exchange for your shares and will therefore generally give rise to a capital gain or loss, depending on your tax basis. </span><span>Please consult your personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences.</span></div> <div><span>If you have any questions, please call 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737).</span></div> <div><span>iShares</span><span>®</span><span> is a registered trademark of BlackRock Fund Advisors and its affiliates.</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

The Trust was organized as a Delaware </span><span>statutory trust on December 16, 1999 and is authorized to have multiple series or portfolios. The Trust is an open-end </span><span>management investment company registered with the SEC under the 1940 Act. The offering of the Trust’s shares is </span><span>registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>1933 Act</span><span>”</span><span>).

Shares of </span><span>the Funds are listed for trading on national securities exchanges such as Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (</span><span>“</span><span>Cboe BZX</span><span>”</span><span>), NYSE Arca, </span><span>Inc. (</span><span>“</span><span>NYSE Arca</span><span>”</span><span>) or The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (</span><span>“</span><span>Nasdaq</span><span>”</span><span>) (each a </span><span>“</span><span>Listing Exchange</span><span>”</span><span>). Shares of each Fund are traded </span><span>in the secondary market and elsewhere at market prices that may be at, above or below the Fund's NAV. Shares are </span><span>redeemable only in Creation Units by Authorized Participants (as defined in the </span><span>Creation and Redemption of Creation Units-Role</span><span> of the Authorized Participant</span><span> section of this SAI) and, generally, in exchange for portfolio securities and a Cash Amount </span><span>(as defined in the </span><span>Redemption of Creation Units</span><span> section of this SAI). Creation Units typically are a specified number of shares, </span><span>generally ranging from 50,000 to 100,000 shares or multiples thereof.</span></div> <div><span>The Trust reserves the right to permit or require that creations and redemptions of shares are effected fully or partially in cash </span><span>and reserves the right to permit or require the substitution of Deposit Securities in lieu of cash. Shares may be issued in </span><span>advance of receipt of Deposit Securities, subject to various conditions, including a requirement that the Authorized </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

The Trust may use </span><span>such collateral at any time to purchase Deposit Securities. See the </span><span>Creation and Redemption of Creation Units</span><span> section of this </span><span>SAI. Transaction fees and other costs associated with creations or redemptions that include a cash portion may be higher </span><span>than the transaction fees and other costs associated with in-kind creations or redemptions. In all cases, conditions with </span><span>respect to creations and redemptions of shares and fees will be limited in accordance with the requirements of SEC rules and </span><span>regulations applicable to management investment companies offering redeemable securities.</span></div> <div><span>Exchange Listing and Trading</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>A discussion of exchange listing and trading matters associated with an investment in each Fund is contained in the </span><span>Shareholder Information</span><span> section of each Fund's Prospectus. The discussion below supplements, and should be read in </span><span>conjunction with, that section of the applicable Prospectus.</span></div> <div><span>Shares of each Fund are listed for trading, and trade throughout the day, on the applicable Listing Exchange and in other </span><span>secondary markets. Shares of the Funds may also be listed on certain non-U.S. exchanges. There can be no assurance that </span><span>the requirements of the Listing Exchange necessary to maintain the listing of shares of any Fund will continue to be met. The </span><span>Listing Exchange may, but is not required to, remove the shares of a Fund from listing if, among other things: (i) following the </span><span>initial 12-month period beginning upon the commencement of trading of Fund shares, there are fewer than 50 record and/or </span><span>beneficial owners of shares of a Fund; (ii) a Fund is no longer eligible to operate in reliance on Rule 6c-11 under the </span><span>Investment Company Act; (iii) any of the other listing requirements are not continuously maintained; or (iv) any event shall </span><span>occur or condition shall exist that, in the opinion of the Listing Exchange, makes further dealings on the Listing Exchange </span><span>inadvisable. The Listing Exchange will also remove shares of a Fund from listing and trading upon termination of the Fund.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>As in the case of other publicly-traded securities, when you buy or sell shares of a Fund through a broker, you may incur a </span><span>brokerage commission determined by that broker, as well as other charges.</span></div> <div><span>The Trust reserves the right to adjust the share price of the Funds in the future to maintain convenient trading ranges for </span><span>investors. Any adjustments would be accomplished through stock splits or reverse stock splits, which would have no effect </span><span>on the net assets of the Funds or an investor's equity interest in the Funds.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Investment Strategies and Risks</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Each Fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing primarily in securities issued by issuers that compose its relevant </span><span>Underlying Index and in investments that provide substantially similar exposure to securities in the Underlying Index. Each </span><span>Fund operates as an index fund and is not actively managed. Adverse performance of a security in a Fund’s portfolio will </span><span>ordinarily not result in the elimination of the security from the Fund’s portfolio.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Each Fund engages in representative sampling, which is investing in a sample of securities selected by BFA to have a </span><span>collective investment profile similar to that of the Fund's Underlying Index. Securities selected have aggregate investment </span><span>characteristics (based on market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return </span><span>variability, earnings valuation and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of the Fund’s Underlying Index. A fund that </span><span>uses representative sampling generally does not hold all of the securities that are in its underlying index.</span></div> <div><span>Although the Funds do not seek leveraged returns, certain instruments used by the Funds may have a leveraging effect as </span><span>described below.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Borrowing. </span><span> </span><span>Each Fund may borrow for temporary or emergency purposes, including to meet payments due from </span><span>redemptions or to facilitate the settlement of securities or other transactions. The iShares MSCI Denmark ETF, iShares MSCI </span><span>Finland ETF, iShares MSCI Germany Small-Cap ETF, iShares MSCI Indonesia ETF, iShares MSCI Ireland ETF, iShares MSCI </span><span>Japan Value ETF, iShares MSCI New Zealand ETF, iShares MSCI Norway ETF, iShares MSCI Philippines ETF, iShares MSCI </span><span>Poland ETF, iShares MSCI United Kingdom ETF and iShares MSCI United Kingdom Small-Cap ETF, along with certain other </span><span>iShares funds, have entered into a syndicated line of credit with the Bank of New York Mellon (</span><span>“</span><span>BNY</span><span>”</span><span>), which serves as </span><span>administrative agent for itself and the other banks. The syndicated line of credit may be used for temporary or emergency </span><span>purposes, including redemption, settlement of trades and rebalancing of portfolio holdings.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Interest rates related to the syndicated line of credit are based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (</span><span>“</span><span>SOFR</span><span>”</span><span>) published </span><span>by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plus a spread. Pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement, if SOFR were to cease </span><span>being published or representative, it would be replaced by a rate based on an alternate benchmark selected by BNY.</span></div> <div><span>The purchase of securities while borrowings are outstanding may have the effect of leveraging a Fund. The incurrence of </span><span>leverage increases a Fund’s exposure to risk, and borrowed funds are subject to interest costs that will reduce net income. </span><span>Purchasing securities while borrowings are outstanding creates special risks, such as the potential for greater volatility in the </span><span>NAV of Fund shares and in the yield on a Fund’s portfolio. In addition, the interest expenses from borrowings may exceed the </span><span>income generated by a Fund’s portfolio and, therefore, the amount available (if any) for distribution to shareholders as </span><span>dividends may be reduced. BFA may determine to maintain outstanding borrowings if it expects that the benefits to a Fund’s </span><span>shareholders will outweigh the current reduced return.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Certain types of borrowings by a Fund must be made from a bank or may result in a Fund being subject to covenants in </span><span>credit agreements relating to asset coverage, portfolio composition requirements and other matters. It is not anticipated that </span><span>observance of such covenants would impede BFA’s management of a Fund’s portfolio in accordance with a Fund’s </span><span>investment objectives and policies. However, a breach of any such covenants not cured within the specified cure period may </span><span>result in acceleration of outstanding indebtedness and require a Fund to dispose of portfolio investments at a time when it </span><span>may be disadvantageous to do so.</span></div> <div><span>Currency Transactions.</span><span>  </span><span>A currency forward contract is an over-the-counter (</span><span>“</span><span>OTC</span><span>”</span><span>) obligation to purchase or sell a specific </span><span>currency at a future date, which may be any fixed number of days greater than two days from the date on which the contract </span><span>is agreed upon by the parties, at a price set at the time of the contract. A non-deliverable currency forward is an OTC </span><span>currency forward settled in a specified currency, on a specified date, based on the difference between the agreed-upon </span><span>exchange rate and the market exchange rate. A currency futures contract is a contract that trades on an organized futures </span><span>exchange involving an obligation to deliver or acquire a specified amount of a specific currency, at a specified price and at a </span><span>specified future time. Currency futures contracts may be settled on a net cash payment basis rather than by the sale and </span><span>delivery of the underlying currency. The Funds do not expect to engage in currency transactions for the purpose of hedging </span><span>against declines in the value of each Fund's assets that are denominated in a non-U.S. currency. A Fund may enter into non-U.S.</span><span> currency forward and non-U.S. currency futures transactions to facilitate local securities settlements or to protect </span><span>against currency exposure in connection with its distributions to shareholders, but may not enter into such contracts for </span><span>speculative purposes.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Foreign exchange transactions involve a significant degree of risk and the markets in which foreign exchange transactions are </span><span>effected may be highly volatile, highly specialized and highly technical. Significant changes, including changes in liquidity and </span><span>prices, can occur in such markets within very short periods of time, often within minutes. Foreign exchange trading risks </span><span>include, but are not limited to, exchange rate risk, counterparty risk, maturity gap, interest rate risk, and potential interference </span><span>by foreign governments through regulation of local exchange markets, foreign investment or particular transactions in non-U.S.</span><span> currency. If BFA utilizes foreign exchange transactions at an inappropriate time or judges market conditions, trends or </span><span>correlations incorrectly, foreign exchange transactions may not serve their intended purpose of improving the correlation of a </span><span>Fund's return with the performance of its Underlying Index and may lower the Fund’s return. A Fund could experience losses </span><span>if the value of its currency forwards, options or futures positions were poorly correlated with its other investments or if it </span><span>could not close out its positions because of an illiquid market or otherwise. In addition, a Fund could incur transaction costs, </span><span>including trading commissions, in connection with certain non-U.S. currency transactions.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Diversification Status. </span><span> </span><span>The following table sets forth the diversification status of each Fund:</span><span> </span></div> <div> </div> <div>

With </span><span>respect to the remaining 25% of its total assets, the fund may invest more than 5% of its assets in one issuer. Under the 1940 </span><span>Act, a fund cannot change its classification from diversified to non-diversified without shareholder approval.</span></div> <div><span> </span><span>A </span><span>“</span><span>non-diversified</span><span>”</span><span> fund is a fund that is not limited by the 1940 Act with regard to the percentage of its assets that may be </span><span>invested in the securities of a single issuer. The securities of a particular issuer (or securities of issuers in particular industries) </span><span>may constitute a significant percentage of the underlying index of such a fund and, consequently, the fund’s investment </span><span>portfolio. This may adversely affect a fund’s performance or subject the fund’s shares to greater price volatility than that </span><span>experienced by more diversified investment companies.</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund (whether diversified or non-diversified) intends to maintain the required level of diversification and otherwise </span><span>conduct its operations so as to qualify as a regulated investment company (</span><span>“</span><span>RIC</span><span>”</span><span>) for purposes of the U.S. Internal Revenue </span><span>Code of 1986, as amended (the </span><span>“</span><span>Internal Revenue Code</span><span>”</span><span>), and to relieve the Fund of any liability for U.S. federal income tax to </span><span>the extent that its earnings are distributed to shareholders, provided that the Fund satisfies a minimum distribution </span><span>requirement. Compliance with the diversification requirements of the Internal Revenue Code may limit the investment </span><span>flexibility of the Funds and may make it less likely that the Funds will meet their respective investment objectives.</span></div> <div><span>Futures, Options on Futures and Securities Options.</span><span>  </span><span>Futures contracts, options on futures and securities options may be </span><span>used by a Fund to simulate investment in its Underlying Index, to facilitate trading or to reduce transaction costs. Each Fund </span><span>may enter into futures contracts and options on futures that are traded on a U.S. or non-U.S. futures exchange. Each Fund </span><span>will not use futures, options on futures or securities options for speculative purposes. Each Fund intends to use futures and </span><span>options on futures in accordance with Rule 4.5 of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the </span><span>“</span><span>CFTC</span><span>”</span><span>) promulgated </span><span>under the Commodity Exchange Act (</span><span>“</span><span>CEA</span><span>”</span><span>). BFA, with respect to certain Funds, has claimed an exclusion from the definition </span><span>of the term </span><span>“</span><span>commodity pool operator</span><span>”</span><span> in accordance with Rule 4.5 so that BFA, with respect to such Funds, is not subject to </span><span>registration or regulation as a commodity pool operator under the CEA. See the </span><span>Regulation Regarding Derivatives </span><span>section of </span><span>this SAI for more information.</span></div> <div><span>Futures contracts provide for the future sale by one party and purchase by another party of a specified amount of a specific </span><span>instrument or index at a specified future time and at a specified price. Stock index contracts are based on investments that </span><span>reflect the market value of common stock of the firms included in the investments. Each Fund may enter into futures </span><span>contracts to purchase securities indexes when BFA anticipates purchasing the underlying securities and believes prices will </span><span>rise before the purchase will be made. Upon entering into a futures contract, a Fund will be required to deposit with the </span><span>broker an amount of cash or cash equivalents known as </span><span>“</span><span>initial margin,</span><span>”</span><span> which is similar to a performance bond or good faith </span><span>deposit on the contract and is returned to the Fund upon termination of the futures contract if all contractual obligations </span><span>have been satisfied. Subsequent payments, known as </span><span>“</span><span>variation margin,</span><span>”</span><span> will be made to and from the broker daily as the </span><span>price of the instrument or index underlying the futures contract fluctuates, making the long and short positions in the futures </span><span>contract more or less valuable, a process known as </span><span>“</span><span>marking-to-market.</span><span>”</span><span> At any time prior to the expiration of a futures </span><span>contract, each Fund may elect to close the position by taking an opposite position, which will operate to terminate the Fund’s </span><span>existing position in the contract. An option on a futures contract, as contrasted with a direct investment in such a contract, </span><span>gives the purchaser the right, but no obligation, in return for the premium paid, to assume a position in the underlying </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

Upon exercise of an option, </span><span>the delivery of the futures position by the writer of the option to the holder of the option will be accompanied by delivery of </span><span>the accumulated balance in the writer’s futures margin account that represents the amount by which the market price of the </span><span>futures contract exceeds (in the case of a call) or is less than (in the case of a put) the exercise price of the option on the </span><span>futures contract.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The potential for loss related to the purchase of an option on a futures contract is limited to the premium paid for the option </span><span>plus transaction costs. Because the value of the option is fixed at the point of sale, there are no daily cash payments by the </span><span>purchaser to reflect changes in the value of the underlying contract; however, the value of the option changes daily and that </span><span>change would be reflected in the NAV of each Fund. The potential for loss related to writing call options is unlimited. The </span><span>potential for loss related to writing put options is limited to the agreed-upon price per share, also known as the </span><span>“</span><span>strike price,</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>less the premium received from writing the put. Certain of the Funds may purchase and write put and call options on futures </span><span>contracts that are traded on an exchange as a hedge against changes in value of their portfolio securities or in anticipation of </span><span>the purchase of securities, and may enter into closing transactions with respect to such options to terminate existing </span><span>positions. There is no guarantee that such closing transactions can be effected.</span></div> <div><span>Securities options may be used by a Fund to obtain access to securities in its Underlying Index or to dispose of securities in </span><span>its Underlying Index at favorable prices, to invest cash in a securities index that offers similar exposure to that provided by its </span><span>Underlying Index or otherwise to achieve the Fund’s objective of tracking its Underlying Index.</span><span> </span><span>A call option gives a holder the </span><span>right to purchase a specific security at a specified price (</span><span>“</span><span>exercise price</span><span>”</span><span>) within a specified period of time. A put option gives </span><span>a holder the right to sell a specific security at an exercise price within a specified period of time. The initial purchaser of a call </span><span>option pays the </span><span>“</span><span>writer</span><span>”</span><span> a premium, which is paid at the time of purchase and is retained by the writer whether or not such </span><span>option is exercised. Each Fund may purchase put options to hedge its portfolio against the risk of a decline in the market </span><span>value of securities held and may purchase call options to hedge against an increase in the price of securities it is committed </span><span>to purchase. Each Fund may write put and call options along with a long position in options to increase its ability to hedge </span><span>against a change in the market value of the securities it holds or is committed to purchase. Each Fund may purchase or sell </span><span>securities options on a U.S. or non-U.S. securities exchange or in the OTC market through a transaction with a dealer. Options </span><span>on a securities index are typically settled on a net basis based on the appreciation or depreciation of the index level over the </span><span>strike price. Options on single name securities may be cash- or physically-settled, depending upon the market in which they </span><span>are traded. Options may be structured so as to be exercisable only on certain dates or on a daily basis. Options may also be </span><span>structured to have conditions to exercise (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, </span><span>“</span><span>Knock-in Events</span><span>”</span><span>) or conditions that trigger termination (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, </span><span>“</span><span>Knock-out </span><span>Events</span><span>”</span><span>).</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Lending Portfolio Securities.</span><span>  </span><span>Each Fund may lend portfolio securities to certain borrowers that BFA determines to be </span><span>creditworthy, including borrowers affiliated with BFA. The borrowers provide collateral that is maintained in an amount at </span><span>least equal to the current market value of the securities loaned. No securities loan shall be made on behalf of a Fund if, as a </span><span>result, the aggregate value of all securities loans of the particular Fund exceeds one-third of the value of such Fund's total </span><span>assets (including the value of the collateral received). A Fund may terminate a loan at any time and obtain the return of the </span><span>securities loaned. Each Fund receives, by way of substitute payment, the value of any interest or cash or non-cash </span><span>distributions paid on the loaned securities that it would have otherwise received if the securities were not on loan.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>With respect to loans that are collateralized by cash, the borrower may be entitled to receive a fee based on the amount of </span><span>cash collateral. The Funds are compensated by any positive difference between the amount earned on the reinvestment of </span><span>cash collateral and the fee paid to the borrower. In the case of collateral other than cash, a Fund is compensated by a fee paid </span><span>by the borrower equal to a percentage of the market value of the loaned securities. Any cash collateral received by the Fund </span><span>for such loans, and uninvested cash, may be reinvested in certain short-term instruments either directly on behalf of each </span><span>Fund or through one or more joint accounts or money market funds, including those affiliated with BFA; such investments </span><span>are subject to investment risk.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Each Fund conducts its securities lending pursuant to an exemptive order from the SEC permitting it to lend portfolio </span><span>securities to borrowers affiliated with the Fund and to retain an affiliate of the Fund to act as securities lending agent. To the </span><span>extent that a Fund engages in securities lending, BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>BTC</span><span>”</span><span>) acts as securities </span><span>lending agent for the Fund, subject to the overall supervision of BFA. BTC administers the lending program in accordance </span><span>with guidelines approved by the Trust's Board of Trustees (the </span><span>“</span><span>Board,</span><span>”</span><span> the trustees of which are the </span><span>“</span><span>Trustees</span><span>”</span><span>). JPMorgan </span><span>Chase Bank, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>JPMorgan</span><span>”</span><span>) serves as custodian for the Funds in connection with certain securities lending activities.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Securities lending involves exposure to certain risks, including operational risk (i.e., the risk of losses resulting from problems </span><span>in the settlement and accounting process), </span><span>“</span><span>gap</span><span>”</span><span> risk (i.e., the risk of a mismatch between the return on cash collateral </span><span>reinvestments and the fees a Fund has agreed to pay a borrower), foreign exchange risk (i.e., the risk of a shortfall at default </span><span>when a cash collateral investment is denominated in a currency other than the currency of the assets being loaned due to </span><span>movements in foreign exchange rates), and credit, legal, counterparty and market risks (including the risk that market events </span><span>could lead the Fund to recall loaned securities or to lend less or not at all, which could lead to reduced securities lending </span><span>revenue). If a securities lending counterparty were to default, a Fund would be subject to the risk of a possible delay in </span><span>receiving collateral or in recovering the loaned securities, or to a possible loss of rights in the collateral. In the event a </span><span>borrower does not return a Fund’s securities as agreed, the Fund’s ability to participate in a corporate action event may be </span><span>impacted, or the Fund may experience losses if the proceeds received from liquidating the collateral do not at least equal the </span><span>value of the loaned security at the time the collateral is liquidated, plus the transaction costs incurred in purchasing </span><span>replacement securities. This latter event could trigger adverse tax consequences for a Fund. A Fund could lose money if its </span><span>short-term investment of the collateral declines in value over the period of the loan. Substitute payments received by a Fund </span><span>representing dividends paid on securities loaned out by the Fund will not be considered qualified dividend income. BTC will </span><span>take into account the tax effects on shareholders caused by this difference in connection with a Fund’s securities lending </span><span>program. Substitute payments received on tax-exempt securities loaned out will not be tax-exempt income. There could also </span><span>be changes in the status of issuers under applicable laws and regulations, including tax regulations, that may impact the </span><span>regulatory or tax treatment of loaned securities and could, for example, result in a delay in the payment of dividend </span><span>equivalent payments owed to a Fund (as permitted by applicable law).</span></div> <div><span>Regulations adopted by global prudential regulators require certain bank-regulated counterparties and certain of their </span><span>affiliates to include in certain financial contracts, including many securities lending agreements, terms that delay or restrict </span><span>the rights of counterparties, such as the Fund, to terminate such agreements, foreclose upon collateral, exercise other default </span><span>rights or restrict transfers of credit support in the event that the counterparty and/or its affiliates are subject to certain types </span><span>of resolution or insolvency proceedings. It is possible that these requirements, as well as potential additional government </span><span>regulation and other developments in the market, could adversely affect the Fund’s ability to terminate existing securities </span><span>lending agreements or to realize amounts to be received under such agreements.</span></div> <div><span>Liquidity Risk Management.</span><span>  </span><span>Rule 22e-4 under the Investment Company Act (the </span><span>“</span><span>Liquidity Rule</span><span>”</span><span>) requires open-end funds, </span><span>including exchange-traded funds (</span><span>“</span><span>ETFs</span><span>”</span><span>) such as the Funds, to establish a liquidity risk management program (the </span><span>“</span><span>Liquidity Program</span><span>”</span><span>) and enhance disclosures regarding fund liquidity. As required by the Liquidity Rule, the Funds have </span><span>implemented a Liquidity Program, and the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees of the Trust, has </span><span>appointed BFA as the administrator of the Liquidity Program. Under the Liquidity Program, BFA assesses, manages, and </span><span>periodically reviews each Fund’s liquidity risk and classifies each investment held by a Fund as a </span><span>“</span><span>highly liquid investment,</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>“</span><span>moderately liquid investment,</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>“</span><span>less liquid investment</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>illiquid investment.</span><span>”</span><span> The Liquidity Rule defines </span><span>“</span><span>liquidity risk</span><span>”</span><span> as </span><span>the risk that a Fund could not meet requests to redeem shares issued by a Fund without significant dilution of the remaining </span><span>investors’ interest in a Fund. The liquidity of a Fund's portfolio investments is determined based on relevant market, trading </span><span>and investment-specific considerations under the Liquidity Program. There are exclusions from certain portions of the </span><span>liquidity risk management program requirements for </span><span>“</span><span>in-kind</span><span>”</span><span> ETFs, as defined in the Liquidity Rule. To the extent that an </span><span>investment is deemed to be an illiquid investment or a less liquid investment, a Fund can expect to be exposed to greater </span><span>liquidity risk.</span></div> <div><span>Non-U.S. Securities.</span><span>  </span><span>Certain Funds intend to purchase publicly traded common stocks of non-U.S. issuers. To the extent a </span><span>Fund invests in stocks of non-U.S. issuers, certain of the Fund's investments in such stocks may be in the form of American </span><span>Depositary Receipts (</span><span>“</span><span>ADRs</span><span>”</span><span>), Global Depositary Receipts (</span><span>“</span><span>GDRs</span><span>”</span><span>) and European Depositary Receipts (</span><span>“</span><span>EDRs</span><span>”</span><span>) (collectively, </span><span>“</span><span>depositary receipts</span><span>”</span><span>). Depositary receipts are receipts, typically issued by a bank or trust issuer, which evidence ownership of </span><span>underlying securities issued by a non-U.S. issuer. Depositary receipts may not necessarily be denominated in the same </span><span>currency as their underlying securities. ADRs typically are issued by a U.S. bank or trust company and evidence ownership of </span><span>underlying securities issued by a non-U.S. issuer. EDRs, which are sometimes referred to as continental depositary receipts, </span><span>are receipts issued in Europe, typically by foreign banks and trust companies, that evidence ownership of either foreign or </span><span>domestic underlying securities. GDRs are depositary receipts structured like global debt issues to facilitate trading on an </span><span>international basis. Generally, ADRs, issued in registered form, are designed for use in the U.S. securities markets, and EDRs, </span><span>issued in bearer form, are designed for use in European securities markets. GDRs are tradable both in the U.S. and in Europe </span><span>and are designed for use throughout the world.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>6</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Depositary receipts are generally subject to the same risks as the foreign securities that they evidence or into which they may </span><span>be converted. In addition to investment risks associated with the underlying issuer, depositary receipts expose a Fund to </span><span>additional risks associated with the non-uniform terms that apply to depositary receipt programs, credit exposure to the </span><span>depository bank and to the sponsors and other parties with whom the depository bank establishes the programs, currency </span><span>risk and liquidity risk. Unsponsored programs, which are not sanctioned by the issuer of the underlying common stock, </span><span>generally expose investors to greater risks than sponsored programs and do not provide holders with many of the </span><span>shareholder benefits that come from investing in a sponsored depositary receipts.</span></div> <div><span>Investing in the securities of non-U.S. issuers involves special risks and considerations not typically associated with investing </span><span>in U.S. issuers. These include differences in accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards; the possibility of </span><span>expropriation or confiscatory taxation; adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations; political instability, </span><span>which could affect U.S. investments in non-U.S. countries; and potential restrictions on the flow of international capital. Non-U.S.</span><span> issuers may be subject to less governmental regulation than U.S. issuers. Moreover, individual non-U.S. economies may </span><span>differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy in such respects as growth of gross domestic product (</span><span>“</span><span>GDP</span><span>”</span><span>), rate of </span><span>inflation, capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency and balance of payment positions.</span></div> <div><span>Regulation Regarding Derivatives.</span><span>  </span><span>The CFTC subjects advisers to registered investment companies to regulation by the </span><span>CFTC if a fund that is advised by the adviser either (i) invests, directly or indirectly, more than a prescribed level of its </span><span>liquidation value in CFTC-regulated futures, options and swaps</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>CFTC Derivatives</span><span>”</span><span>) or (ii) markets itself as providing </span><span>investment exposure to such instruments. The CFTC also subjects advisers to registered investment companies to regulation </span><span>by the CFTC if the registered investment company invests in one or more commodity pools. To the extent a Fund uses CFTC </span><span>Derivatives, it intends to do so below such prescribed levels and intends not to market itself as a </span><span>“</span><span>commodity pool</span><span>”</span><span> or a </span><span>vehicle for trading such instruments.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BFA has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term </span><span>“</span><span>commodity pool operator</span><span>”</span><span> under the CEA pursuant to Rule 4.5 </span><span>under the CEA with respect to each of the Funds. BFA is not, therefore, subject to registration or regulation as a </span><span>“</span><span>commodity </span><span>pool operator</span><span>”</span><span> under the CEA with respect to the Funds.</span></div> <div><span>The iShares ESG Advanced MSCI EAFE ETF, iShares ESG Aware MSCI EAFE ETF, iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF, iShares </span><span>ESG Aware MSCI USA Small-Cap ETF, iShares ESG MSCI USA Leaders ETF, iShares MSCI Finland ETF, iShares MSCI Germany </span><span>Small-Cap ETF, iShares MSCI Indonesia ETF, iShares MSCI Ireland ETF, iShares MSCI Japan Value ETF, iShares MSCI New </span><span>Zealand ETF, iShares MSCI United Kingdom ETF, iShares MSCI United Kingdom Small-Cap ETF and iShares Paris-Aligned </span><span>Climate MSCI USA ETF (the </span><span>“</span><span>No-Action Letter Funds</span><span>”</span><span>) may also have investments in </span><span>“</span><span>underlying funds</span><span>”</span><span> (and such </span><span>underlying funds themselves may invest in underlying funds) not advised by BFA (the term </span><span>“</span><span>underlying fund</span><span>”</span><span> for purposes of </span><span>the no-action letter referenced below may include, but is not limited to, certain securitized vehicles, mortgage or international </span><span>real estate investment trusts (</span><span>“</span><span>REITs</span><span>”</span><span>), business development companies and investment companies that may invest in CFTC </span><span>Derivatives or in any of the foregoing), and therefore may be viewed by the CFTC as commodity pools. BFA may not have </span><span>transparency into the holdings of these underlying funds because they are not advised by BFA. To address this issue of lack of </span><span>transparency, the CFTC staff issued a no-action letter on November 29, 2012 permitting the adviser of a fund that invests in </span><span>such underlying funds and that would otherwise have filed a claim of exclusion pursuant to CFTC Rule 4.5 to delay </span><span>registration as a </span><span>“</span><span>commodity pool operator</span><span>”</span><span> until six months from the date on which the CFTC issues additional guidance on </span><span>the treatment of CFTC Derivatives held by underlying funds. BFA, the adviser of the No-Action Letter Funds, has filed a claim </span><span>with the CFTC for such funds to rely on this no-action relief. Accordingly, BFA is not currently subject to registration or </span><span>regulation as a </span><span>“</span><span>commodity pool operator</span><span>”</span><span> under the CEA in respect of such funds.</span></div> <div><span>Derivative contracts, including, without limitation, swaps, currency forwards, and non-deliverable forwards, are subject to </span><span>regulation under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (</span><span>“</span><span>Dodd-Frank Act</span><span>”</span><span>) in the U.S. and under </span><span>comparable regimes in Europe, Asia and other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Swaps, non-deliverable forwards and certain other </span><span>derivatives traded in the OTC market are subject to variation margin and initial margin requirements. Implementation of the </span><span>margining and other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding clearing, mandatory trading, reporting and documentation </span><span>of swaps and other derivatives have impacted and may continue to impact the costs to a Fund of trading these instruments </span><span>and, as a result, may affect returns to investors in such Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Rule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act permits a Fund to enter into Derivatives Transactions (as defined below) and </span><span>certain other transactions notwithstanding the restrictions on the issuance of </span><span>“</span><span>senior securities</span><span>”</span><span> under Section 18 of the </span><span>Investment Company Act.

The DRMP is administered by a </span><span>“</span><span>derivatives risk manager,</span><span>”</span><span> who is </span><span>appointed by the Board, including a majority of Independent Directors/Trustees, and periodically reviews the DRMP and </span><span>reports to the Board.</span></div> <div><span>Rule 18f-4 provides an exception from the DRMP, VaR limit and certain other requirements if a Fund's </span><span>“</span><span>derivatives exposure</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>(as defined in Rule 18f-4) is limited to 10% of its net assets (as calculated in accordance with Rule 18f-4) and the Fund </span><span>adopts and implements written policies and procedures reasonably designed to manage its derivatives risks (the </span><span>“</span><span>Limited </span><span>Derivatives User Exception</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> <div><span>Repurchase Agreements.</span><span>  </span><span>A repurchase agreement is an instrument under which the purchaser (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, a Fund) acquires a </span><span>security and the seller agrees, at the time of the sale, to repurchase the security at a mutually agreed-upon time and price, </span><span>thereby determining the yield during the purchaser’s holding period. Repurchase agreements may be construed to be </span><span>collateralized loans by the purchaser to the seller secured by the securities transferred to the purchaser. If a repurchase </span><span>agreement is construed to be a collateralized loan, the underlying securities will not be considered to be owned by a Fund but </span><span>only to constitute collateral for the seller’s obligation to pay the repurchase price, and, in the event of a default by the seller, </span><span>the Fund may suffer time delays and incur costs or losses in connection with the disposition of the collateral.</span></div> <div><span>In any repurchase transaction, the collateral for a repurchase agreement may include: (i) cash items; (ii) obligations issued by </span><span>the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities; or (iii) obligations that, at the time the repurchase agreement is </span><span>entered into, are determined to (A) have exceptionally strong capacity to meet their financial obligations and (B) are </span><span>sufficiently liquid such that they can be sold at approximately their carrying value in the ordinary course of business within </span><span>seven days.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Repurchase agreements pose certain risks for a Fund that utilizes them. Such risks are not unique to the Funds, but are </span><span>inherent in repurchase agreements. The Funds seek to minimize such risks, but because of the inherent legal uncertainties </span><span>involved in repurchase agreements, such risks cannot be eliminated. Lower quality collateral and collateral with a longer </span><span>maturity may be subject to greater price fluctuations than higher quality collateral and collateral with a shorter maturity. If </span><span>the repurchase agreement counterparty were to default, lower quality collateral may be more difficult to liquidate than higher </span><span>quality collateral. Should the counterparty default and the amount of collateral not be sufficient to cover the counterparty’s </span><span>repurchase obligation, a Fund would likely retain the status of an unsecured creditor of the counterparty (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the position a </span><span>Fund would normally be in if it were to hold, pursuant to its investment policies, other unsecured debt securities of the </span><span>defaulting counterparty) with respect to the amount of the shortfall. As an unsecured creditor, a Fund would be at risk of </span><span>losing some or all of the principal and income involved in the transaction.</span></div> <div><span>Reverse Repurchase Agreements.</span><span>  </span><span>Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities with an agreement to </span><span>repurchase the securities at an agreed-upon price, date and interest payment and have the characteristics of borrowing. </span><span>Generally, the effect of such transactions is that a Fund can recover all or most of the cash invested in the portfolio securities </span><span>involved during the term of the reverse repurchase agreement, while in many cases the Fund is able to keep some of the </span><span>interest income associated with those securities. Such transactions are advantageous only if a Fund has an opportunity to </span><span>earn a rate of interest on the cash derived from these transactions that is greater than the interest cost of obtaining the same </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

Opportunities to realize earnings from the use of the proceeds equal to or greater than the interest required </span><span>to be paid may not always be available, and a Fund intends to use the reverse repurchase technique only when BFA believes it </span><span>will be advantageous to the Fund. The use of reverse repurchase agreements may exaggerate any increase or decrease in the </span><span>value of a Fund’s assets. The use of reverse repurchase agreements is a form of leverage, and the proceeds obtained by a </span><span>Fund through reverse repurchase agreements may be invested in additional securities.</span></div> <div><span>Rule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act permits a Fund to enter into reverse repurchase agreements and similar </span><span>financing transactions (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> recourse and non-recourse tender option bonds, borrowed bonds) notwithstanding the </span><span>limitation on the issuance of senior securities in Section 18 of the Investment Company Act, provided that a Fund either (i) </span><span>complies with the 300% asset coverage ratio with respect to such transactions and any other borrowings in the aggregate, or </span><span>(ii) treats such transactions as Derivatives Transactions under Rule 18f-4. (See </span><span>“</span><span>Regulation Regarding Derivatives</span><span>”</span><span> above.)</span></div> <div><span>Securities of Investment Companies.</span><span>  </span><span>Each Fund may invest in the securities of other investment companies (including </span><span>money market funds) to the extent permitted by law. Pursuant to the 1940 Act, a Fund’s investment in registered investment </span><span>companies is generally limited to, subject to certain exceptions: (i) 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of any one </span><span>investment company; (ii) 5% of a Fund’s total assets with respect to any one investment company; and (iii) 10% of a Fund’s </span><span>total assets with respect to investment companies in the aggregate. To the extent allowed by law or regulation, each Fund </span><span>intends from time to time to invest its assets in the securities of investment companies, including, but not limited to, money </span><span>market funds, including those advised by or otherwise affiliated with BFA, in excess of the general limits discussed above. </span><span>Other investment companies in which a Fund may invest can be expected to incur fees and expenses for operations, such as </span><span>investment advisory and administration fees, which would be in addition to those incurred by the Fund. Pursuant to guidance </span><span>issued by the SEC staff, fees and expenses of money market funds used for cash collateral received in connection with loans </span><span>of securities are not treated as Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, which reflect a Fund’s </span><span>pro rata</span><span> share of the fees and </span><span>expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies (as disclosed in the Prospectus, as applicable).</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Short-Term Instruments and Temporary Investments.</span><span>  </span><span>Each Fund may invest in short-term instruments, including money </span><span>market instruments, on an ongoing basis to provide liquidity or for other reasons. Money market instruments are generally </span><span>short-term investments that may include, but are not limited to: (i) shares of money market funds (including those advised </span><span>by BFA or otherwise affiliated with BFA); (ii) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or </span><span>instrumentalities (including government-sponsored enterprises); (iii) negotiable certificates of deposit, bankers’ acceptances, </span><span>fixed-time deposits and other obligations of U.S. and non-U.S. banks (including non-U.S. branches) and similar institutions; </span><span>(iv) commercial paper rated, at the date of purchase, </span><span>“</span><span>Prime-1</span><span>”</span><span> by Moody's</span><span>®</span><span> Investors Service, Inc., </span><span>“</span><span>F-1</span><span>”</span><span> by Fitch Ratings, </span><span>Inc., or </span><span>“</span><span>A-1</span><span>”</span><span> by Standard &amp; Poor's</span><span>®</span><span> Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of S&amp;P Global, Inc., or if unrated, of comparable </span><span>quality as determined by BFA; (v) non-convertible corporate debt securities (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, bonds and debentures) with remaining </span><span>maturities at the date of purchase of not more than 397 days and that have been determined to present minimal credit risks, </span><span>in accordance with the requirements set forth in Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act; (vi) repurchase agreements; and (vii) short-term</span><span> U.S. dollar-denominated obligations of non-U.S. banks (including U.S. branches) that, in the opinion of BFA, are of </span><span>comparable quality to obligations of U.S. banks that may be purchased by a Fund. Any of these instruments may be </span><span>purchased on a current or forward-settled basis. Time deposits are non-negotiable deposits maintained in banking </span><span>institutions for specified periods of time at stated interest rates. Bankers’ acceptances are time drafts drawn on commercial </span><span>banks by borrowers, usually in connection with international transactions.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Swap Agreements.</span><span>  </span><span>Swap agreements are contracts between parties in which one party agrees to make periodic payments to </span><span>the other party based on a pre-determined underlying investment or notional amount. In return, the other party agrees to </span><span>make periodic payments to the first party based on the return (or a differential in rate of return) earned or realized on the </span><span>underlying investment or notional amount. Swap agreements will usually be performed on a net basis, with a Fund receiving </span><span>or paying only the net amount of the two payments. The net amount of the excess, if any, of a Fund’s obligations over its </span><span>entitlements with respect to each swap is accrued on a daily basis.</span></div> <div><span>The Funds may enter into swap agreements, including currency swaps, interest rate swaps and index swaps, or for the </span><span>iShares Paris-Aligned Climate MSCI USA ETF, total return swaps (some of which may be referred to as contracts for </span><span>difference or </span><span>“</span><span>CFDs</span><span>”</span><span>). The use of swaps is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different </span><span>from those associated with ordinary portfolio security transactions. These transactions generally do not involve the delivery </span><span>of securities or other underlying assets.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>9</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Tracking Stocks.</span><span>  </span><span>A tracking stock is a separate class of common stock whose value is linked to a specific business unit or </span><span>operating division within a larger company and is designed to </span><span>“</span><span>track</span><span>”</span><span> the performance of such business unit or division. The </span><span>tracking stock may pay dividends to shareholders independent of the parent company. The parent company, rather than the </span><span>business unit or division, generally is the issuer of tracking stock. However, holders of the tracking stock may not have the </span><span>same rights as holders of the company’s common stock.</span></div> <div><span>Future Developments.</span><span>  </span><span>The Board may, in the future, authorize each Fund to invest in securities contracts and investments, </span><span>other than those listed in this SAI and in the applicable Prospectuses, provided they are consistent with each Fund's </span><span>investment objective and do not violate any of its investment restrictions or policies.</span></div> <div><span>General Considerations and Risks</span></div> <div><span>A discussion of some of the principal risks associated with an investment in a Fund is contained in the applicable Prospectus.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>An investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding that the value of the Fund’s portfolio</span><span> </span><span>securities may </span><span>fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the issuers of the portfolio securities, the value of stocks in </span><span>general, and other factors that affect the market. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any </span><span>particular risk factor.</span></div> <div><span>Borrowing Risk. </span><span> </span><span>Borrowing may exaggerate changes in the NAV of Fund shares and in the return on a Fund’s portfolio. </span><span>Borrowing will cause a Fund to incur interest expense and other fees. The costs of borrowing may reduce a Fund’s return. </span><span>Borrowing may cause a Fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations.</span></div> <div><span>Commodities Investment Risk. </span><span> </span><span>Exposure to commodities markets may subject a Fund to greater volatility than investments </span><span>in traditional securities. The commodities markets have experienced periods of extreme volatility. Similar future market </span><span>conditions may result in rapid and substantial valuation increases or decreases in a Fund’s holdings.</span></div> <div><span>The commodities markets may fluctuate widely based on a variety of factors. Movements in commodity investment prices </span><span>are outside of a Fund's control and may not be anticipated by BFA. Price movements may be influenced by, among other </span><span>things: governmental, agricultural, trade, fiscal, monetary and exchange control programs and policies; changing market and </span><span>economic conditions; market liquidity; weather and climate conditions, including droughts and floods; livestock disease; </span><span>changing supply and demand relationships and levels of domestic production and imported commodities; changes in </span><span>storage costs; the availability of local, intrastate and interstate transportation systems; energy conservation; the success of </span><span>exploration projects; changes in international balances of payments and trade; domestic and foreign rates of inflation; </span><span>currency devaluations and revaluations; domestic and foreign political and economic events; domestic and foreign interest </span><span>rates and/or investor expectations concerning interest rates; foreign currency/exchange rates; domestic and foreign </span><span>governmental regulation and taxation; war, acts of terrorism and other political upheaval and conflicts; governmental </span><span>expropriation; investment and trading activities of mutual funds, hedge funds and commodities funds; and changes in </span><span>philosophies and emotions of market participants. The frequency and magnitude of such changes cannot be predicted.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The prices of commodities can also fluctuate widely due to supply and demand disruptions in major producing or </span><span>consuming regions. Certain commodities or natural resources may be produced in a limited number of countries and may be </span><span>controlled by a small number of producers or groups of producers. As a result, political, economic, regulatory and supply-related</span><span> events in such countries could have a disproportionate impact on the prices of such commodities.</span></div> <div><span>A decrease in the production of a physical commodity or a decrease in the volume of such commodity available for </span><span>transportation, mining, processing, storage or distribution may adversely impact the financial performance of a commodity </span><span>or commodity-related company that devotes a portion of its business to that commodity. Production declines and volume </span><span>decreases could be caused by various factors, including catastrophic events affecting production, depletion of resources, </span><span>labor difficulties, environmental proceedings, increased regulations, equipment failures and unexpected maintenance </span><span>problems, import supply disruption, governmental expropriation, political upheaval or conflicts or increased competition </span><span>from alternative energy sources or commodity prices. Agricultural commodities may be adversely affected by weather or </span><span>other natural phenomena, such as drought, floods and pests.</span></div> <div><span>A sustained decline in demand for such commodities could also adversely affect the financial performance of commodity-related</span><span> companies. Factors that could lead to a decline in demand include economic recession or other adverse economic </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>conditions, higher taxes on commodities or increased governmental regulations, increases in fuel economy, consumer shifts </span><span>to the use of alternative commodities or fuel sources, changes in commodity prices, or weather.</span></div> <div><span>The commodity markets are subject to temporary distortions and other disruptions due to, among other factors, lack of </span><span>liquidity, the participation of speculators, and government regulation and other actions. U.S. futures exchanges and some </span><span>foreign exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation in futures contract prices which may occur in a single business day </span><span>(generally referred to as </span><span>“</span><span>daily price fluctuation limits</span><span>”</span><span>). The maximum or minimum price of a contract as a result of these </span><span>limits is referred to as a </span><span>“</span><span>limit price.</span><span>”</span><span> If the limit price has been reached in a particular contract, no trades may be made </span><span>beyond the limit price. Limit prices have the effect of precluding trading in a particular contract or forcing the liquidation of </span><span>contracts at disadvantageous times or prices.</span></div> <div><span>Currency Risk. </span><span> </span><span>Because each Fund's NAV is determined on the basis of the U.S. dollar, investors may lose money if the </span><span>currency of a non-U.S. market in which a Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar, even if the local currency value of a </span><span>Fund’s holdings in that market increases. Generally, when the U.S. dollar rises in value against a foreign currency, a security </span><span>denominated in that currency loses value because the currency is worth fewer U.S. dollars. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar </span><span>decreases in value against a foreign currency, a security denominated in that currency gains value because the currency is </span><span>worth more U.S. dollars. This risk, generally known as </span><span>“</span><span>currency risk,</span><span>”</span><span> means that a strong U.S. dollar will reduce returns for </span><span>U.S. investors, while a weak U.S. dollar will increase those returns.</span></div> <div><span>Foreign exchange transactions involve a significant degree of risk and the markets in which foreign exchange transactions are </span><span>effected are highly volatile, highly specialized and highly technical. Significant changes, including changes in liquidity and </span><span>prices, can occur in such markets within very short periods of time, often within minutes. If BFA utilizes foreign exchange </span><span>transactions at an inappropriate time or judges market conditions, trends or correlations incorrectly, foreign exchange </span><span>transactions may not serve their intended purpose of improving the Fund’s performance and may lower a Fund’s return. A </span><span>Fund could experience losses if the value of its currency forward positions are poorly correlated with its other investments or </span><span>if it cannot close out its positions because of an illiquid market. In addition, a Fund could incur transaction costs, including </span><span>trading commissions, in connection with certain non-U.S. currency transactions.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Custody Risk. </span><span> </span><span>Custody risk refers to the risks inherent in the process of clearing and settling trades and to the holding of </span><span>securities, cash and other assets by local banks, agents and depositories. Low trading volumes and volatile prices in less </span><span>developed markets make trades harder to complete and settle, and governments or trade groups may compel local agents to </span><span>hold securities in designated depositories that may not be subject to independent evaluation. Local agents are held only to </span><span>the standards of care of their local markets, and thus may be subject to limited or no government oversight. Communications </span><span>between the U.S. and emerging market countries may be unreliable, increasing the risk of delayed settlements or losses of </span><span>security certificates. In general, the less developed a country’s securities market is, the greater the likelihood of custody </span><span>problems. Practices in relation to the settlement of securities transactions in emerging markets involve higher risks than </span><span>those in developed markets, in part because of the use of brokers and counterparties that are often less well capitalized, and </span><span>custody and registration of assets in some countries may be unreliable. The possibility of fraud, negligence or undue </span><span>influence being exerted by the issuer or refusal to recognize ownership exists in some emerging markets, and, along with </span><span>other factors, could result in ownership registration being lost. In addition, the laws of certain countries may put limits on a </span><span>Fund’s ability to recover its assets if a foreign bank or depository or issuer of a security or an agent of any of the foregoing </span><span>goes bankrupt. A Fund would absorb any loss resulting from such custody problems and may have no successful claim for </span><span>compensation.</span></div> <div><span>Dividend-Paying Stock Risk. </span><span> </span><span>Investing in dividend-paying stocks involves the risk that such stocks may fall out of favor with </span><span>investors and underperform the broader market. Companies that issue dividend-paying stocks are not required to pay or </span><span>continue paying dividends on such stocks. It is possible that issuers of the stocks held by a Fund will not declare dividends in </span><span>the future or will reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends (including reducing or eliminating anticipated accelerations or </span><span>increases in the payment of dividends) in the future.</span></div> <div><span>Illiquid Investments Risk.</span><span>  </span><span>Each Fund may not acquire any illiquid investment if, immediately after the acquisition, the Fund </span><span>would have invested more than 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that a </span><span>Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less without </span><span>significantly changing the market value of the investment. The liquidity of an investment will be determined based on </span><span>relevant market, trading and investment specific considerations as set out in the Liquidity Program as required by the </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Liquidity Rule. Illiquid investments may trade at a discount to comparable, more liquid investments and a Fund may not be </span><span>able to dispose of illiquid investments in a timely fashion or at their expected prices. If illiquid investments exceed 15% of a </span><span>Fund’s net assets, the Liquidity Rule and the Liquidity Program will require that certain remedial actions be taken.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>LIBOR Risk. </span><span> </span><span>A Fund may be exposed to financial instruments that are tied to the London Interbank Offered Rate (</span><span>“</span><span>LIBOR</span><span>”</span><span>) to </span><span>determine payment obligations, financing terms, hedging strategies or investment value. A Fund’s investments may pay </span><span>interest at floating rates based on LIBOR or may be subject to interest caps or floors based on LIBOR. A Fund may also obtain </span><span>financing at floating rates based on LIBOR. Derivative instruments utilized by a Fund may also reference LIBOR.</span></div> <div><span>LIBOR Replacement Risk. </span><span> </span><span>As part of the phase-out of the use of LIBOR, the rate’s administrator, ICE Benchmark </span><span>Administration Limited (</span><span>“</span><span>IBA</span><span>”</span><span>), discontinued two USD LIBOR settings immediately after publication on December 31, 2021. </span><span>The FCA , which regulates LIBOR, and IBA previously announced that a majority of USD LIBOR settings will no longer be </span><span>published after June 30, 2023. While the FCA is requiring the IBA to publish certain LIBOR settings, potentially to include USD </span><span>settings, on a </span><span>“</span><span>synthetic</span><span>”</span><span> basis, the </span><span>“</span><span>synthetic</span><span>”</span><span> methodology is not based on panel bank contributions and is not intended to </span><span>be representative of the interest rates in the underlying market. A Fund may have investments linked to other interbank </span><span>offered rates, such as the Euro Overnight Index Average (</span><span>“</span><span>EONIA</span><span>”</span><span>), which may also cease to be published. Various financial </span><span>industry groups continue planning for the transition away from LIBOR, but there are challenges to converting certain </span><span>securities and transactions to a new reference rate, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (</span><span>“</span><span>SOFR</span><span>”</span><span>), which is </span><span>intended to replace USD LIBOR.</span></div> <div><span>In June 2017, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, which includes various private-market participants working with </span><span>the Federal Reserve, announced its selection of the new SOFR, which is intended to be a broad measure of secured overnight </span><span>U.S. Treasury repo rates, as its recommendation for an appropriate replacement for USD LIBOR. The Federal Reserve Bank of </span><span>New York began publishing SOFR in 2018, and it has been used increasingly on a voluntary basis in new instruments and </span><span>transactions. At times, SOFR has proven to be more volatile than the 3-month USD LIBOR. Working groups and regulators in </span><span>other countries have suggested other alternatives for their markets, including the Sterling Overnight Interbank Average Rate </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>SONIA</span><span>”</span><span>) in England.</span></div> <div><span>Neither the effect of the LIBOR transition process nor its ultimate success can yet be known. The transition process might </span><span>lead to increased volatility and illiquidity in markets for, and reduce the effectiveness of, new hedges placed against, </span><span>instruments whose terms currently include LIBOR. While some existing LIBOR-based instruments may contemplate a </span><span>scenario where LIBOR is no longer available by providing for an alternative rate-setting methodology, there may be significant </span><span>uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of any such alternative methodologies to replicate LIBOR. Not all existing LIBOR-based</span><span> instruments may have alternative rate-setting provisions and there remains uncertainty regarding the willingness and </span><span>ability of issuers to add alternative rate-setting provisions in certain existing instruments. Global regulators have advised </span><span>market participants to cease entering into new contracts using LIBOR as a reference rate, and it is possible that investments </span><span>in LIBOR-based instruments could invite regulatory scrutiny. In addition, a liquid market for newly issued instruments that </span><span>use a reference rate other than LIBOR still may be developing. Instruments with fallback provisions (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, contractual </span><span>provisions specifying the trigger events for a transition to a replacement rate) to facilitate the transition from LIBOR to an </span><span>alternative reference rate may also include adjustments that do not adequately compensate the holder for the different </span><span>characteristics of the alternative reference rate. As a result, the fallback provision causes a value transfer from one party to </span><span>the instrument to the counterparty. Because the usefulness of LIBOR as a benchmark could decline during the transition </span><span>period, these and related adverse effects could occur with respect to particular LIBOR settings as they are phased out. There </span><span>may also be challenges for a Fund to enter into hedging transactions against such newly issued instruments until a market </span><span>for such hedging transactions develops.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The effect of any changes to, or discontinuation of, LIBOR on a Fund will vary based on, among other things, (1) existing </span><span>fallback or termination provisions in individual contracts and the potential renegotiation of existing contracts and (2) </span><span>whether, how, and when industry participants develop and adopt new reference rates and fallbacks for both legacy and new </span><span>products and instruments. A Fund's investments may also be tied to other interbank offered rates and currencies, which may </span><span>face similar issues. In many cases, if an instrument falls back to an alternative reference rate, including SOFR, the alternative </span><span>reference rate will not perform the same as LIBOR because the alternative reference rate does not include a credit-sensitive </span><span>component in the rate calculation. Alternative reference rates generally reflect the performance of the market for U.S. </span><span>Treasury securities, which are secured by the U.S. Treasury, and not the interbank lending markets. Therefore, in the event of </span><span>a credit crisis, floating rate instruments using certain alternative reference rates could perform differently than those </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>12</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>

In addition, legislation may affect the transition of LIBOR-based</span><span> instruments by permitting trustees and calculation agents to transition instruments with no LIBOR transition language </span><span>to an alternative reference rate selected by such agents. Such legislation, which has been enacted in some jurisdictions, </span><span>generally includes safe harbors from liability, meaning that a Fund may have limited recourse if the alternative reference rate </span><span>does not fully compensate a Fund for the transition of an instrument from LIBOR. All of the aforementioned may adversely </span><span>affect a Fund’s performance or NAV.</span></div> <div><span>Operational Risk.</span><span>  </span><span>BFA and a Fund's other service providers may experience disruptions or operating errors such as </span><span>processing errors or human errors, inadequate or failed internal or external processes, or systems or technology failures, that </span><span>could negatively impact the Funds. While service providers are required to have appropriate operational risk management </span><span>policies and procedures, their methods of operational risk management may differ from a Fund’s in the setting of priorities, </span><span>the personnel and resources available or the effectiveness of relevant controls. BFA, through its monitoring and oversight of </span><span>service providers, seeks to ensure that service providers take appropriate precautions to avoid and mitigate risks that could </span><span>lead to disruptions and operating errors. However, it is not possible for BFA or the other Fund service providers to identify all </span><span>of the operational risks that may affect a Fund or to develop processes and controls to completely eliminate or mitigate their </span><span>occurrence or effects.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Derivatives.</span><span>  </span><span>A derivative is a financial contract, the value of which depends on, or is derived from, the value of an </span><span>underlying asset, such as a security, a commodity (such as gold or silver), a currency or an index (a measure of value or rates, </span><span>such as the S&amp;P 500</span><span>®</span><span> or the prime lending rate). A Fund may invest in futures contracts, securities options, CFDs (for the </span><span>iShares Paris-Aligned Climate MSCI USA ETF) and other derivatives. Compared to securities, derivatives can be more sensitive </span><span>to changes in interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in market prices and thus a Fund’s losses may be greater if it invests in </span><span>derivatives than if it invests only in conventional securities. Derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk </span><span>that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligations. Derivatives generally involve the incurrence of </span><span>leverage.</span></div> <div><span>When a derivative is used as a hedge against a position that a Fund holds or is committed to purchase, any loss generated by </span><span>the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can </span><span>reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains and, in some cases, hedging can cause losses that are not </span><span>offset by gains, and a Fund will recognize losses on both the investment and the hedge. Hedges are sometimes subject to </span><span>imperfect matching between the derivative and the underlying security, and there can be no assurance that a Fund's hedging </span><span>transactions, which entail additional transaction costs, will be effective.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Equity Securities.</span><span>  </span><span>An investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding of the risks inherent in an </span><span>investment in equity securities, including the risk that the financial condition of issuers may become impaired or that the </span><span>general condition of stock markets may deteriorate (either of which may cause a decrease in the value of the portfolio </span><span>securities and thus in the value of shares of the Fund). Common stocks are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations </span><span>and to increases and decreases in value as market confidence and perceptions of their issuers change. These investor </span><span>perceptions are based on various and unpredictable factors, including expectations regarding government, economic, </span><span>monetary and fiscal policies, inflation and interest rates, economic expansion or contraction, and global or regional political, </span><span>economic or banking crises. Common stocks may experience extreme price volatility due to actions taken by particular </span><span>investors or groups of investors (for example, retail investors influenced by social media activity or other media coverage or </span><span>significant </span><span>“</span><span>short</span><span>”</span><span> positions taken by institutional investors).</span></div> <div><span>Holders of common stocks incur more risks than holders of preferred stocks and debt obligations because common </span><span>stockholders generally have rights to receive payments from stock issuers that are inferior to the rights of creditors, or </span><span>holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks. Further, unlike debt securities, which typically have a stated principal amount </span><span>payable at maturity (the value of which, however, is subject to market fluctuations prior to maturity), or preferred stocks, </span><span>which typically have a liquidation preference and which may have stated optional or mandatory redemption provisions, </span><span>common stocks have neither a fixed principal amount nor a maturity date. In addition, issuers may, in times of distress or at </span><span>their own discretion, decide to reduce or eliminate dividends, which may also cause their stock price to decline.</span></div> <div><span>Although most of the securities in each Underlying Index are listed on a securities exchange, the principal trading market for </span><span>some of the securities may be in the OTC market. The existence of a liquid trading market for certain securities may depend </span><span>on whether dealers will make a market in such securities. There can be no assurance that a market will be made or </span><span>maintained or that any such market will be or remain liquid. The price at which securities may be sold and the value of a </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>13</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Fund’s shares will be adversely affected if trading markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities are limited or absent, or if </span><span>bid/ask spreads are wide.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Futures and Options on Futures Transactions.</span><span>  </span><span>There are several risks accompanying the utilization of futures </span><span>contracts and options on futures contracts. A position in futures contracts and options on futures contracts may be closed </span><span>only on the exchange on which the contract was made (or a linked exchange). While each Fund plans to utilize futures </span><span>contracts only if an active market exists for such contracts, there is no guarantee that a liquid market will exist for the </span><span>contract at a specified time. Futures contracts, by definition, project price levels in the future and not current levels of </span><span>valuation; therefore, market circumstances may result in a discrepancy between the price of the future and the movement in </span><span>a Fund's Underlying Index. In the event of adverse price movements, a Fund would continue to be required to make daily </span><span>cash payments to maintain its required margin. In such situations, if a Fund has insufficient cash, it may have to sell portfolio </span><span>securities to meet daily margin requirements at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. In addition, a Fund may be </span><span>required to deliver the instruments underlying the futures contracts it has sold.</span></div> <div><span>The risk of loss in trading futures contracts or uncovered call options in some strategies (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, selling uncovered stock index </span><span>futures contracts) is potentially unlimited. The Funds do not plan to use futures and options contracts in this way. The risk of </span><span>a futures position may still be large as traditionally measured due to the low margin deposits required. In many cases, a </span><span>relatively small price movement in a futures contract may result in immediate and substantial loss or gain to the investor </span><span>relative to the size of a required margin deposit. The Funds, however, intend to utilize futures and options contracts in a </span><span>manner designed to limit their risk exposure to levels comparable to a direct investment in the types of stocks in which they </span><span>invest.</span></div> <div><span>Utilization of futures and options on futures by a Fund involves the risk of imperfect or even negative correlation to its </span><span>Underlying Index if the index underlying the futures contract differs from the Underlying Index. There is also the risk of loss of </span><span>margin deposits in the event of bankruptcy of a broker with whom a Fund has an open position in the futures contract or </span><span>option. The purchase of put or call options will be based upon predictions by BFA as to anticipated trends, which predictions </span><span>could prove to be incorrect.</span></div> <div><span>Because the futures market generally imposes less burdensome margin requirements than the securities market, an </span><span>increased amount of participation by speculators in the futures market could result in price fluctuations. Certain financial </span><span>futures exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures contract prices during a single trading day. The daily </span><span>limit establishes the maximum amount by which the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the </span><span>previous day’s settlement price at the end of a trading session. Once the daily limit has been reached in a particular type of </span><span>contract, no trades may be made on that day at a price beyond that limit. It is possible that futures contract prices could </span><span>move to the daily limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading, thereby preventing prompt liquidation of </span><span>futures positions and subjecting each Fund to substantial losses. In the event of adverse price movements, each Fund would </span><span>be required to make daily cash payments of variation margin.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Non-U.S. Equity Securities. </span><span> </span><span>An investment in a Fund involves risks similar to those of investing in </span><span>portfolios of equity securities traded on non-U.S. exchanges. These risks include market fluctuations caused by such factors </span><span>as economic and political developments in those foreign countries, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in stock </span><span>prices. Investing in securities issued by issuers domiciled in countries other than the domicile of the investor and </span><span>denominated in currencies other than an investor’s local currency entails certain considerations and risks not typically </span><span>encountered by the investor in making investments in its home country and in that country’s currency. These considerations </span><span>include favorable or unfavorable changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, exchange control regulations and the </span><span>costs that may be incurred in connection with conversions between various currencies. Investing in any of the Funds also </span><span>involves certain risks and considerations not typically associated with investing in a fund whose portfolio contains exclusively </span><span>securities of U.S. issuers. These risks include generally less liquid and less efficient securities markets; generally greater price </span><span>volatility; less publicly available information about issuers; the imposition of withholding or other taxes; the imposition of </span><span>restrictions on the expatriation of funds or other assets of the Funds; higher transaction and custody costs; delays and risks </span><span>attendant in settlement procedures; difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations; lower liquidity and significantly smaller </span><span>market capitalization; different accounting and disclosure standards; lower levels of regulation of the securities markets; more </span><span>substantial government interference with the economy and businesses; higher rates of inflation; greater social, economic, </span><span>and political uncertainty; the risk of nationalization or expropriation of assets; and the risk of war.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Risk of Swap Agreements.</span><span>  </span><span>The risk of loss with respect to swaps is generally limited to the net amount of payments that a </span><span>Fund is contractually obligated to make. Swap agreements are subject to the risk that the swap counterparty will default on </span><span>its obligations</span><span> </span><span>to pay a Fund and the risk that a Fund will not be able to meet its obligations to pay the other party to the </span><span>agreement. If such a default occurs, a Fund will have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the </span><span>transaction. However, such remedies may be subject to bankruptcy and insolvency laws, which could affect such Fund’s </span><span>rights as a creditor (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, a Fund may not receive the net amount of payments that it is contractually entitled to receive). Swap </span><span>agreements may also involve the risk that there is an imperfect correlation between the return on the Fund’s obligation to its </span><span>counterparty and the return on the referenced asset. In addition, swap agreements are subject to market and liquidity risk, </span><span>leverage risk and hedging risk.</span></div> <div><span>A Fund is required to post and collect variation margin and initial margin (comprised of specified liquid securities subject to </span><span>haircuts) in connection with trading of OTC swaps. These requirements may raise the costs for a Fund’s investment in swaps.</span></div> <div><span>Tracking Error Risk.</span><span>  </span><span>A Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of a Fund’s performance from that of </span><span>the applicable underlying index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities and other </span><span>instruments held in a Fund’s portfolio and those included in its applicable underlying index, pricing differences, transaction </span><span>costs incurred by a Fund, a Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of </span><span>dividends or interest received by a Fund or distributions paid to a Fund’s shareholders, the requirements to maintain pass-through</span><span> tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, </span><span>acceptance of custom baskets, changes to the applicable underlying index or the costs to a Fund of complying with various </span><span>new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other </span><span>unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because a Fund incurs fees and expenses, while its applicable </span><span>underlying index does not. Tracking error may occur due to differences between the methodologies used in calculating the </span><span>value of the applicable Underlying Index and determining a Fund’s NAV.</span></div> <div><span>When an issuer is introduced by an index provider into an index tracked by a Fund, BFA may conduct an analysis on such </span><span>issuer’s securities to identify and screen for outlier high risk behavior (such as rapid or unusual price growth that does not </span><span>appear to be supported by publicly available information on the business and assets of the issuer, unusual or significant short </span><span>interest or lending activity, negative sentiment, suspended trading or incorrect free-float calculations, which could be </span><span>indicators of possible irregularities, miscalculations or even fraud). If it identifies such behavior, BFA may, where appropriate, </span><span>alert the index provider as to the alleged issue. The index provider has sole discretion for the determination as to whether to </span><span>continue to include the issuer’s securities in the rebalancing of its index. If the securities continue to be included in the index, </span><span>BFA may underweight or exclude such securities from a Fund’s portfolio and, if it does so, such a fund will be subject to </span><span>increased tracking error due to the divergence in the securities included in its portfolio from its underlying index. BFA’s </span><span>underweighting or excluding such securities may result in a decline in a Fund’s net asset value. The application of the </span><span>abovementioned analysis and screening to a Fund and its Underlying Index is in the sole discretion of BFA and its affiliates </span><span>(without any guarantees). The analysis and screening may not exclude any or all high risk securities from an Underlying </span><span>Index or a Fund’s portfolio, and the inclusion of such securities will result in an adverse impact to a Fund’s net asset value if </span><span>one or more such securities declines in value.</span></div> <div><span>Securities Lending Risk. </span><span> </span><span>A Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that a Fund may lose </span><span>money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. A Fund could </span><span>also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of </span><span>any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for a Fund.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Asia.</span><span>  </span><span> Investments in securities of issuers in certain Asian countries involve risks not typically associated </span><span>with investments in securities of issuers in other regions. Such heightened risks</span><span> </span><span>include, among others, expropriation and/or </span><span>nationalization of assets, confiscatory taxation, piracy of intellectual property, data and other security breaches (especially of </span><span>data stored electronically), political instability, including authoritarian and/or military involvement in governmental decision-making,</span><span> armed conflict and social instability as a result of religious, ethnic and/or socio-economic unrest. Certain Asian </span><span>economies have experienced rapid rates of economic growth and industrialization in recent years, and there is no assurance </span><span>that these rates of economic growth and industrialization will be maintained.</span></div> <div><span>Certain Asian countries have democracies with relatively short histories, which may increase the risk of political instability. </span><span>These countries have faced political and military unrest, and further unrest could present a risk to their local economies and </span><span>securities markets. Indonesia and the Philippines have each experienced violence and terrorism, which has negatively </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>15</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>impacted their economies. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial military capabilities, and historical tensions </span><span>between the two countries present the risk of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of </span><span>hostilities between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on </span><span>the entire Asian region. Certain Asian countries have also developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if </span><span>these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. Political, religious, and </span><span>border disputes persist in India. India has recently experienced and may continue to experience civil unrest and hostilities </span><span>with certain of its neighboring countries. Increased political and social unrest in these geographic areas could adversely affect </span><span>the performance of investments in this region.</span></div> <div><span>Certain governments in this region administer prices on several basic goods, including fuel and electricity, within their </span><span>respective countries. Certain governments may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector in their </span><span>respective countries and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on </span><span>the economic conditions in this region, which in turn could have a negative impact on private sector companies. There is also </span><span>the possibility of diplomatic developments adversely affecting investments in the region.</span></div> <div><span>Corruption and the perceived lack of a rule of law in dealings with international companies in certain Asian countries may </span><span>discourage foreign investment and could negatively impact the long-term growth of certain economies in this region. In </span><span>addition, certain countries in the region are experiencing high unemployment and corruption, and have fragile banking </span><span>sectors.</span></div> <div><span>Some economies in this region are dependent on a range of commodities, including oil, natural gas and coal. Accordingly, </span><span>they are strongly affected by international commodity prices and particularly vulnerable to any weakening in global demand </span><span>for these products. The market for securities in this region may also be directly influenced by the flow of international capital, </span><span>and by the economic and market conditions of neighboring countries. China is a key trading partner of many Asian countries </span><span>and any changes in trading relationships between China and other Asian countries may affect the region as a whole. Adverse </span><span>economic conditions or developments in neighboring countries may increase investors' perception of the risk of investing in </span><span>the region as a whole, which may adversely impact the market value of the securities issued by companies in the region.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Australasia. </span><span> </span><span>The economies of Australasia, which include Australia and New Zealand, are dependent on </span><span>exports from the agricultural and mining sectors. This makes Australasian economies susceptible to fluctuations in the </span><span>commodity markets. Australasian economies are also increasingly dependent on their growing service industries. Australia </span><span>and New Zealand are located in a part of the world that has historically been prone to natural disasters, such as drought and </span><span>flooding. Any such event in the future could have a significant adverse impact on the economies of Australia and New </span><span>Zealand and affect the value of securities held by a relevant Fund. The economies of Australia and New Zealand are </span><span>dependent on trading with certain key trading partners, including Asia and the U.S. Economic events in the U.S., Asia, or in </span><span>other key trading countries can have a significant economic effect on the Australasian economies. The economies of </span><span>Australia and New Zealand are heavily dependent on the mining sector. Passage of new regulations limiting foreign </span><span>ownership of companies in the mining sector or imposition of new taxes on profits of mining companies may dissuade </span><span>foreign investment, and as a result, have a negative impact on companies to which a Fund has exposure.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. </span><span> </span><span>Many countries with developed markets have recently experienced significant </span><span>economic pressures. These countries generally tend to rely on the services sectors (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, the financial services sector) as the </span><span>primary source of economic growth and may be susceptible to the risks of individual service sectors. For example, companies </span><span>in the financial services sector are subject to governmental regulation and, recently, government intervention, which may </span><span>adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge and amount of capital they must maintain. </span><span>Dislocations in the financial sector and perceived or actual governmental influence over certain financial companies may lead </span><span>to credit rating downgrades and, as a result, impact, among other things, revenue growth for such companies. If financial </span><span>companies experience a prolonged decline in revenue growth, certain developed countries that rely heavily on financial </span><span>companies as an economic driver may experience a correlative slowdown. Concerns have emerged with respect to the </span><span>economic health of certain developed countries. These concerns primarily stem from heavy indebtedness of many developed </span><span>countries and their perceived inability to continue to service high debt loads without simultaneously implementing stringent </span><span>austerity measures. Such concerns have led to tremendous downward pressure on the economies of these countries. As a </span><span>result, it is possible that interest rates on debt of certain developed countries may rise to levels that make it difficult for such </span><span>countries to service such debt. Spending on health care and retirement pensions in most developed countries has risen </span><span>dramatically. Medical innovation, extended life expectancy and higher public expectations are likely to continue the increase </span><span>in health care and pension costs. Any increase in health care and pension costs will likely have a negative impact on the </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>16</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>economic growth of many developed countries. Certain developed countries rely on imports of certain key items, such as </span><span>crude oil, natural gas, and other commodities. As a result, an increase in demand for, or price fluctuations of, certain </span><span>commodities may negatively affect developed country economies. Developed market countries generally are dependent on </span><span>the economies of certain key trading partners. Changes in any one economy may cause an adverse impact on several </span><span>developed countries. In addition, heavy regulation of, among others, labor and product markets may have an adverse effect </span><span>on certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause prolonged periods of recession. Such </span><span>risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of a Fund’s investments.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Eastern Europe. </span><span> </span><span>Investing in the securities of issuers located or operating in Eastern Europe is highly </span><span>speculative and involves risks not usually associated with investing in the more developed markets of Western Europe. </span><span>Certain Eastern European countries have high public debt levels, significant underground economies, high unemployment </span><span>and emigration of skilled workers. Such countries generally have a history of political instability, limited infrastructure and an </span><span>inefficient public sector prone to endemic corruption. Political and economic reforms are too recent to establish a definite </span><span>trend away from centrally planned economies and state-owned industries. In the past, some Eastern European governments </span><span>have expropriated substantial amounts of private property, and many claims of the property owners have never been fully </span><span>settled.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Many Eastern European countries continue to move toward market economies at different paces with different </span><span>characteristics. Many Eastern European securities markets are generally underdeveloped with low, irregular trading volumes, </span><span>dubious investor protections, and often a dearth of reliable corporate information. Eastern European securities markets are </span><span>generally subject to less government supervision and regulation and may be less liquid and more volatile than securities </span><span>markets in the U.S. or Western European countries. Legal institutions governing private and foreign investments and private </span><span>property may be relatively nascent, inefficient, and unevenly enforced or inequitably enforced. Certain Eastern European </span><span>governments may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector and may own or control many </span><span>companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic conditions in such countries, which </span><span>could have a negative impact on a Fund’s investments. Information and transaction costs, differential taxes, and sometimes </span><span>political or transfer risk give a comparative advantage to the domestic investor rather than the foreign investor.</span></div> <div><span>Eastern European economies may also be particularly susceptible to changes in the international credit markets due to their </span><span>reliance on bank related inflows of capital. Changes to the economies of countries with substantial foreign direct investment </span><span>in certain Eastern European countries may negatively affect the region’s economy. The economy of certain Eastern European </span><span>countries may be adversely affected by global prices for manufactured goods or commodity price declines to the extent that </span><span>a country relies on the export of such products.</span></div> <div><span>Geopolitical events, including war, and other instability in certain Eastern European countries may cause uncertainty in the </span><span>region’s financial markets and adversely affect the performance of the issuers to which a Fund has exposure. These markets </span><span>may be particularly sensitive to social, political, economic, and currency events in Russia and may suffer heavy losses as a </span><span>result of their trading and investment links to the Russian economy and currency. Russia has historically asserted its influence </span><span>in the region using diplomatic, informational, military, and economic instruments of national power, as it did with Georgia in </span><span>the summer of 2008 and Ukraine beginning in 2014, and most recently on February 24, 2022.</span></div> <div><span>Russian Invasion of Ukraine</span><span>. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The extent and duration </span><span>of the military action, resulting sanctions and resulting future market disruptions, including declines in its stock markets and </span><span>the value of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but could be significant. Disruptions caused by Russian </span><span>military action or other actions (including cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting actual and threatened responses to such </span><span>activity, including purchasing and financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer or purchaser preferences, </span><span>sanctions, import and export restrictions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Russian government, Russian companies or Russian </span><span>individuals, including politicians, may impact Russia's economy and Russian issuers of securities in which a Fund invests. </span><span>Actual and threatened responses to Russian military action may also impact the markets for certain Russian commodities, </span><span>such as oil and natural gas, as well as other sectors of the Russian economy, and are likely to have collateral impacts on such </span><span>sectors globally.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets. </span><span> </span><span>Investments in emerging market countries may be subject to greater risks than </span><span>investments in developed countries. These risks include: (i) less social, political, and economic stability; (ii) greater illiquidity </span><span>and price volatility due to smaller or limited local capital markets for such securities, or low or non-existent trading volumes; </span><span>(iii) companies, custodians, clearinghouses, foreign exchanges and broker-dealers may be subject to less scrutiny and </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>17</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

The Funds are not actively managed and do not </span><span>select investments based on investor protection considerations.</span></div> <div><span>Emerging market securities markets are typically marked by a high concentration of market capitalization and trading volume </span><span>in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries, as well as a high concentration of ownership of </span><span>such securities by a limited number of investors. In addition, brokerage and other costs associated with transactions in </span><span>emerging market securities can be higher, sometimes significantly, than similar costs incurred in securities markets in </span><span>developed countries. Although some emerging markets have become more established and tend to issue securities of higher </span><span>credit quality, the markets for securities in other emerging market countries are in the earliest stages of their development, </span><span>and these countries issue securities across the credit spectrum. Even the markets for relatively widely traded securities in </span><span>emerging market countries may not be able to absorb, without price disruptions, a significant increase in trading volume or </span><span>trades of a size customarily undertaken by institutional investors in the securities markets of developed countries. The limited </span><span>size of many of these securities markets can cause prices to be erratic for reasons apart from factors that affect the </span><span>soundness and competitiveness of the securities issuers. For example, prices may be unduly influenced by traders who </span><span>control large positions in these markets. Additionally, market making and arbitrage activities are generally less extensive in </span><span>such markets, which may contribute to increased volatility and reduced liquidity of such markets. The limited liquidity of </span><span>emerging market country securities may also affect a Fund's ability to accurately value its portfolio securities or to acquire or </span><span>dispose of securities at the price and time it wishes to do so or in order to meet redemption requests.</span></div> <div><span>Many emerging market countries suffer from uncertainty and corruption in their legal frameworks. Legislation may be </span><span>difficult to interpret and laws may be too new to provide any precedential value. Laws regarding foreign investment and </span><span>private property may be weak or non-existent. Sudden changes in governments may result in policies which are less </span><span>favorable to investors such as policies designed to expropriate or nationalize </span><span>“</span><span>sovereign</span><span>”</span><span> assets. Certain emerging market </span><span>countries in the past have expropriated large amounts of private property, in many cases with little or no compensation, and </span><span>there can be no assurance that such expropriation will not occur in the future.</span></div> <div><span>Investment in the securities markets of certain emerging market countries is restricted or controlled to varying degrees. </span><span>These restrictions may limit a Fund's investment in certain emerging market countries and may increase the expenses of the </span><span>Fund. Certain emerging market countries require governmental approval prior to investments by foreign persons or limit </span><span>investment by foreign persons to only a specified percentage of an issuer's outstanding securities or a specific class of </span><span>securities which may have less advantageous terms (including price) than securities of the company available for purchase </span><span>by nationals.</span></div> <div><span>Many emerging market countries lack the social, political, and economic stability characteristic of the U.S. Political instability </span><span>among emerging market countries can be common and may be caused by an uneven distribution of wealth, social unrest, </span><span>labor strikes, civil wars, and religious oppression. Economic instability in emerging market countries may take the form of: (i) </span><span>high interest rates; (ii) high levels of inflation, including hyperinflation; (iii) high levels of unemployment or </span><span>underemployment; (iv) changes in government economic and tax policies, including confiscatory taxation; and (v) </span><span>imposition of trade barriers.</span></div> <div><span>A Fund's income and, in some cases, capital gains from foreign securities will be subject to applicable taxation in certain of </span><span>the emerging market countries in which it invests, and treaties between the U.S. and such countries may not be available in </span><span>some cases to reduce the otherwise applicable tax rates.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>18</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Emerging markets also have different clearance and settlement procedures, and in certain of these emerging markets there </span><span>have been times when settlements have been unable to keep pace with the volume of securities transactions, making it </span><span>difficult to conduct such transactions.</span></div> <div><span>In the past, certain governments in emerging market countries have become overly reliant on the international capital </span><span>markets and other forms of foreign credit to finance large public spending programs, which in the past have caused huge </span><span>budget deficits. Often, interest payments have become too overwhelming for a government to meet, representing a large </span><span>percentage of total GDP. These foreign obligations have become the subject of political debate and served as fuel for political </span><span>parties of the opposition, which pressure the government not to make payments to foreign creditors, but instead to use these </span><span>funds for, among other things, social programs. Either due to an inability to pay or submission to political pressure, foreign </span><span>governments have been forced to seek a restructuring of their loan and/or bond obligations, have declared a temporary </span><span>suspension of interest payments or have defaulted. These events have adversely affected the values of securities issued by </span><span>foreign governments and corporations domiciled in those countries and have negatively affected not only their cost of </span><span>borrowing, but their ability to borrow in the future as well.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Europe. </span><span> </span><span>Investing in European countries may expose a Fund to the economic and political risks </span><span>associated with Europe in general and the specific European countries in which it invests. The economies and markets of </span><span>European countries are often closely connected and interdependent, and events in one European country can have an </span><span>adverse impact on other European countries. A Fund makes investments in securities of issuers that are domiciled in, have </span><span>significant operations in, or that are listed on at least one securities exchange within member states of the European Union </span><span>(the </span><span>“</span><span>EU</span><span>”</span><span>). A number of countries within the EU are also members of the Economic and Monetary Union (the </span><span>“</span><span>eurozone</span><span>”</span><span>) </span><span>and have adopted the euro as their currency. Eurozone membership requires member states to comply with restrictions on </span><span>inflation rates, deficits, interest rates, debt levels and fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect </span><span>every country in Europe. Changes in import or export tariffs, changes in governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in </span><span>the exchange rate of the euro and other currencies of certain EU countries which are not in the eurozone, the default or </span><span>threat of default by an EU member state on its sovereign debt, and/or an economic recession in an EU member state may </span><span>have a significant adverse effect on the economies of other EU member states and their trading partners. Although certain </span><span>European countries are not in the eurozone, many of these countries are obliged to meet the criteria for joining the eurozone. </span></div> <div><span>Consequently, these countries must comply with many of the restrictions noted above. The European financial markets have </span><span>experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about economic downturns, government debt levels and the </span><span>possible default of government debt in several European countries, including, but not limited to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, </span><span>France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. In order to prevent further economic deterioration, certain </span><span>countries, without prior warning, can institute </span><span>“</span><span>capital controls.</span><span>”</span><span> Countries may use these controls to restrict volatile </span><span>movements of capital entering and exiting their country. Such controls may negatively affect a Fund’s investments. A default </span><span>or debt restructuring by any European country would adversely impact holders of that country’s debt and sellers of credit </span><span>default swaps linked to that country’s creditworthiness, which may be located in countries other than those listed above. In </span><span>addition, the credit ratings of certain European countries were downgraded in the past. These events have adversely affected </span><span>the value and exchange rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect the economies of every country in Europe, </span><span>including countries that do not use the euro and non-EU member states. Responses to the financial problems by European </span><span>governments, central banks and others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may </span><span>result in social unrest and may limit future growth and economic recovery or have other unintended consequences. Further </span><span>defaults or restructurings by governments and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on </span><span>economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more countries may abandon the </span><span>euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The impact of these actions, especially if they occur in a disorderly fashion, is not clear </span><span>but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely impact the value of a Fund’s investments in the region.</span></div> <div><span>The United Kingdom (the </span><span>“</span><span>U.K.</span><span>”</span><span>) left the EU (</span><span>“</span><span>Brexit</span><span>”</span><span>) on January 31, 2020. The U.K. and EU reached an agreement on the </span><span>terms of their future trading relationship effective January 1, 2021, which principally relates to the trading of goods rather </span><span>than services, including financial services. Further discussions are to be held between the U.K. and the EU in relation to </span><span>matters not covered by the trade agreement, such as financial services. A Fund faces risks associated with the potential </span><span>uncertainty and consequences that may follow Brexit, including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates. </span><span>Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could </span><span>contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. Brexit has also led to legal </span><span>uncertainty and could lead to politically divergent national laws and regulations as a new relationship between the U.K. and </span><span>EU is defined and the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects could adversely affect any of </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>19</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>the companies to which a Fund has exposure and any other assets in which a Fund invests. The political, economic and legal </span><span>consequences of Brexit are not yet fully known. In the short term, financial markets may experience heightened volatility, </span><span>particularly those in the U.K. and Europe, but possibly worldwide. The U.K. and Europe may be less stable than they have </span><span>been in recent years, and investments in the U.K. and the EU may be difficult to value, or subject to greater or more frequent </span><span>volatility. In the longer term, there is likely to be a period of significant political, regulatory and commercial uncertainty as the </span><span>U.K. continues to negotiate the terms of its future trading relationships.</span></div> <div><span>Certain European countries have also developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were </span><span>to worsen, they could adversely affect European issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. Secessionist movements, such as the </span><span>Catalan movement in Spain and the independence movement in Scotland, as well as governmental or other responses to </span><span>such movements, may also create instability and uncertainty in the region. In addition, the national politics of countries in the </span><span>EU have been unpredictable and subject to influence by disruptive political groups and ideologies. The governments of EU </span><span>countries may be subject to change and such countries may experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated or sudden </span><span>political or social developments may result in sudden and significant investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents </span><span>throughout Europe or war in the region also could impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could </span><span>be significant and far-reaching</span><span> </span><span>and could adversely affect the value and liquidity of a Fund's investments.</span></div> <div><span>Russian Invasion of Ukraine</span><span>. Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The extent and duration </span><span>of the military action, resulting sanctions and resulting future market disruptions, including declines in its stock markets and </span><span>the value of the ruble against the U.S. dollar, are impossible to predict, but could be significant. Disruptions caused by Russian </span><span>military action or other actions (including cyberattacks and espionage) or resulting actual and threatened responses to such </span><span>activity, including purchasing and financing restrictions, boycotts or changes in consumer or purchaser preferences, </span><span>sanctions, import and export restrictions, tariffs or cyberattacks on the Russian government, Russian companies or Russian </span><span>individuals, including politicians, may impact Russia's economy and Russian issuers of securities in which a Fund invests. </span><span>Actual and threatened responses to Russian military action may also impact the markets for certain Russian commodities, </span><span>such as oil and natural gas, as well as other sectors of the Russian economy, and are likely to have collateral impacts on such </span><span>sectors globally.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Finland. </span><span> </span><span>Investment in Finnish issuers involves risks that are specific to Finland, including, legal, </span><span>regulatory, political, currency, security and economic risks. Finland’s economy, among other things, depends on imported raw </span><span>materials, energy and components for its manufactured products. As a result, Finland is dependent on trading relationships </span><span>with certain key trading partners, including other EU countries, Russia, China and the U.S. Metals, engineering and timber are </span><span>Finland’s main industries, and major exports include electronics and machinery. Finland’s reliance on these sectors makes it </span><span>vulnerable to economic downturns in, among other sectors, the technology and industrials sectors. Secessionist movements </span><span>in certain European countries, such as the Catalan movement in Spain and the independence movement in Scotland, may </span><span>have an adverse effect on the Finnish economy.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Germany. </span><span> </span><span>Investment in German issuers may subject a Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, </span><span>security, and economic risks specific to Germany. Ongoing concerns in relation to the economic health of the EU continue to </span><span>constrain the economic resilience of certain EU member states, including Germany. Germany has a large export-reliant </span><span>manufacturing and industrials sector and the German economy is dependent to a significant extent on the economies of </span><span>certain key trading partners, including the U.S., France, Italy and other European countries. Reduction in spending on German </span><span>products and services, or changes in any of the economies may have an adverse impact on the German economy. In addition, </span><span>heavy regulation of labor and product markets in Germany may have an adverse effect on German issuers. Such regulations </span><span>may negatively impact economic growth or cause prolonged periods of recession.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Indonesia.</span><span>  </span><span>Investment in securities of Indonesian issuers involves risks not typically associated with </span><span>investments in securities of issuers in developed countries. Such heightened risks include, among others, expropriation </span><span>and/or nationalization of assets, confiscatory taxation, political instability, including authoritarian and/or military </span><span>involvement in governmental decision-making, armed conflict and social instability as a result of religious, ethnic and/or </span><span>socioeconomic unrest.</span></div> <div><span>The securities market of Indonesia is considered an emerging market characterized by a small number of listed companies, </span><span>high price volatility and a relatively illiquid secondary trading market. These factors, coupled with restrictions on foreign </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>20</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>investment and other factors, limit the supply of securities available for investment by a Fund. This will affect the rate at </span><span>which a Fund is able to invest in Indonesia, the purchase and sale prices for such securities and the timing of purchases and </span><span>sales.</span></div> <div><span>Indonesia’s political institutions and democracy have a relatively short history, increasing the risk of political instability. In the </span><span>recent past, Indonesia has faced political and militant unrest, and further unrest could present a risk to the local economy </span><span>and securities markets. Indonesia has also experienced acts of terrorism, predominantly targeted at foreigners, which has </span><span>had a negative impact on tourism and consequently has negatively impacted the economy of Indonesia. Corruption and the </span><span>perceived lack of a rule of law in dealings with international companies may discourage foreign direct investment and could </span><span>negatively impact the long-term growth of the economy of Indonesia. In addition, many economic development problems </span><span>remain, including high unemployment, a fragile banking sector, endemic corruption, inadequate infrastructure, a poor </span><span>investment climate, and unequal resource distribution among regions.</span></div> <div><span>The Indonesian economy is dependent on a range of commodities including oil, natural gas and coal. Accordingly, it is </span><span>strongly affected by international commodity prices and is particularly vulnerable to any weakening in global demand for </span><span>these products. Any acts of terrorism or armed conflicts in Indonesia or internationally could have an adverse effect on the </span><span>financial and commodities markets and the global economy.</span></div> <div><span>The Indonesian government plays a significant role in Indonesia’s economy, including administering prices on several basic </span><span>goods, including fuel, rice and electricity. The Indonesian government may exercise substantial influence over many aspects </span><span>of the private sector and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on </span><span>the economic conditions in Indonesia, which could have a negative impact on private sector companies. There is also the </span><span>possibility of diplomatic developments that could adversely affect investments in Indonesia.</span></div> <div><span>The market for Indonesian securities is directly influenced by the flow of international capital, and economic and market </span><span>conditions of certain countries, especially emerging market countries in Southeastern Asia. Adverse economic conditions or </span><span>developments in other emerging market countries have at times significantly affected the availability of credit in the </span><span>Indonesian economy and resulted in considerable outflows of funds and declines in the amount of foreign currency invested </span><span>in Indonesia. A crisis in neighboring emerging market countries also may increase investors’ perception of risk in Indonesia, </span><span>which may adversely impact the market value of the securities issued by Indonesian companies, including securities in which </span><span>a Fund may invest.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Ireland. </span><span> </span><span>Investing in securities of companies domiciled in Ireland involves special considerations not </span><span>typically associated with investing in the U.S. market. Such heightened risks include, among others, ongoing sectarian </span><span>conflict, social instability as a result of religious, ethnic and/or socioeconomic unrest, potential armed conflict and/or threats </span><span>of terrorism within the country, continued lack of unification as a country, and internal hostile relations, all which can </span><span>adversely impact the Irish economy. Consumer indebtedness in Ireland has been high and increasing in recent years, leading </span><span>to concern with respect to overall economic growth in Ireland.</span></div> <div><span>Ireland relies heavily on exports to its key trading partners that include the other members of the EU and the U.S. Reduction in </span><span>spending by these economies on Irish products and services or negative changes in any of these economies may cause an </span><span>adverse impact on the Irish economy. Any changes in the price or demand for Irish exports could adversely impact Ireland’s </span><span>economy. Ireland’s economy may also be negatively affected if trade barriers, exchange controls, or other protectionist </span><span>measures are imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>As a member of the EU, Ireland is heavily dependent on the other member states both economically and politically. The </span><span>referendum by the U.K. in June 2016 resolving to leave the EU may have an adverse impact on a Fund and its shareholders. </span><span>The European Central Bank has control over each member country’s monetary policies, including inflation rates, deficit levels, </span><span>interest rates, debt levels and fiscal and monetary controls. However, the Irish government has retained the authority to set </span><span>tax and spending policies and public debt levels. Any event within the EU, including economic and political developments, </span><span>can cause market disruptions, and can adversely affect the values of securities held by a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Japan. </span><span> </span><span>Japan may be subject to political, economic, nuclear, labor and other risks. Any of these risks, </span><span>individually or in the aggregate, can impact an investment made in Japan.</span> <br/><span> </span></div> <div><span>Currency Risk</span><span>. The Japanese yen has fluctuated widely at times and any increase in its value may cause a decline in exports </span><span>that could weaken the Japanese economy. Japan has, in the past, intervened in the currency markets to attempt to maintain </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>21</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>or reduce the value of the yen. Japanese intervention in the currency markets could cause the value of the yen to fluctuate </span><span>sharply and unpredictably and could cause losses to investors.</span> <br/><span> </span></div> <div><span>Economic Risk</span><span>. The growth of Japan’s economy has recently lagged that of its Asian neighbors and other major developed </span><span>economies. Since 2000, Japan’s economic growth rate has generally remained low relative to other advanced economies, and </span><span>it may remain low in the future. The Japanese economy is heavily dependent on international trade and has been adversely </span><span>affected by trade tariffs, other protectionist measures, competition from emerging economies and the economic conditions </span><span>of its trading partners. Japan is also heavily dependent on oil imports, and higher commodity prices could therefore have a </span><span>negative impact on the Japanese economy.</span> <br/><span> </span></div> <div><span>Geographic Risk</span><span>. Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, typhoons and tsunamis, could occur in Japan or </span><span>surrounding areas and could negatively affect the Japanese economy, and, in turn, could negatively affect a Fund.</span> <br/><span> </span></div> <div><span>Labor Risk</span><span>. Japan has an aging workforce and has experienced a significant population decline in recent years. Japan’s labor </span><span>market appears to be undergoing fundamental structural changes, as a labor market traditionally accustomed to lifetime </span><span>employment adjusts to meet the need for increased labor mobility, which may adversely affect Japan’s economic </span><span>competitiveness.</span> <br/></div> <div><span>Large Government and Corporate Debt Risk</span><span>. The Japanese economy faces several concerns, including a financial system with </span><span>large levels of nonperforming loans, over-leveraged corporate balance sheets, extensive cross-ownership by major </span><span>corporations, a changing corporate governance structure, and large government deficits. These issues may cause a </span><span>slowdown of the Japanese economy.</span> <br/><span> </span></div> <div><span>Political Risk</span><span>. Historically, Japan has had unpredictable national politics and may experience frequent political turnover. Future </span><span>political developments may lead to changes in policy that might adversely affect a Fund’s investments. In addition, China has </span><span>become an important trading partner with Japan. Japan’s political relationship with China, however, has been strained. Should </span><span>political tension increase, it could adversely affect the Japanese economy and destabilize the region as a whole.</span> <br/><span> </span></div> <div><span>Security Risk.</span><span> Japan's relations with its neighbors, particularly China, North Korea, South Korea and Russia, have at times been </span><span>strained due to territorial disputes, historical animosities and defense concerns. Most recently, the Japanese government has </span><span>shown concern over the increased nuclear and military activity by North Korea and China. Strained relations may cause </span><span>uncertainty in the Japanese markets and adversely affect the overall Japanese economy, particularly in times of crisis.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Middle East. </span><span> </span><span>Many Middle Eastern countries have little or no democratic tradition, and the political </span><span>and legal systems in such countries may have an adverse impact on a Fund. Many economies in the Middle East are highly </span><span>reliant on income from the sale of oil and natural gas or trade with countries involved in the sale of oil and natural gas, and </span><span>their economies are therefore vulnerable to changes in the market for oil and natural gas and foreign currency values. As </span><span>global demand for oil and natural gas fluctuates, many Middle Eastern economies may be significantly impacted.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, many Middle Eastern governments have exercised and continue to exercise substantial influence over many </span><span>aspects of the private sector. In certain cases, a Middle Eastern country’s government may own or control many companies, </span><span>including some of the largest companies in the country. Accordingly, governmental actions in the future could have a </span><span>significant effect on economic conditions in Middle Eastern countries. This could affect private sector companies and a Fund, </span><span>as well as the value of securities in the Fund's portfolio.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Certain Middle Eastern markets are in the earliest stages of development. As a result, there may be a high concentration of </span><span>market capitalization and trading volume in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries, as well as </span><span>a high concentration of investors and financial intermediaries. Brokers in Middle Eastern countries typically are fewer in </span><span>number and less capitalized than brokers in the U.S.</span></div> <div><span>The legal systems in certain Middle Eastern countries also may have an adverse impact on a Fund. For example, the potential </span><span>liability of a shareholder in a U.S. corporation with respect to acts of the corporation generally is limited to the amount of the </span><span>shareholder’s investment. However, the notion of limited liability is less clear in certain Middle Eastern countries. A Fund </span><span>therefore may be liable in certain Middle Eastern countries for the acts of a corporation in which it invests for an amount </span><span>greater than its actual investment in that corporation. Similarly, the rights of investors in Middle Eastern issuers may be more </span><span>limited than those of shareholders of a U.S. corporation. It may be difficult or impossible to obtain or enforce a legal </span><span>judgment in a Middle Eastern country. Some Middle Eastern countries prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>22</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>investments in their capital markets, particularly their equity markets, by foreign entities such as a Fund. For example, certain </span><span>countries may require governmental approval prior to investment by foreign persons or limit the amount of investment by </span><span>foreign persons in a particular issuer. Certain Middle Eastern countries may also limit investment by foreign persons to only a </span><span>specific class of securities of an issuer that may have less advantageous terms (including price) than securities of the issuer </span><span>available for purchase by nationals of the relevant Middle Eastern country.</span></div> <div><span>The manner in which foreign investors may invest in companies in certain Middle Eastern countries, as well as limitations on </span><span>those investments, may have an adverse impact on the operations of a Fund. For example, in certain of these countries, a </span><span>Fund may be required to invest initially through a local broker or other entity and then have the shares that were purchased </span><span>re-registered in the name of a Fund. Re-registration in some instances may not be possible on a timely basis. This may result </span><span>in a delay during which a Fund may be denied certain of its rights as an investor, including rights as to dividends or to be </span><span>made aware of certain corporate actions. There also may be instances where a Fund places a purchase order but is </span><span>subsequently informed, at the time of re-registration, that the permissible allocation of the investment to foreign investors </span><span>has already been filled and, consequently, a Fund may not be able to invest in the relevant company.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Substantial limitations may exist in certain Middle Eastern countries with respect to a Fund’s ability to repatriate investment </span><span>income or capital gains. A Fund could be adversely affected by delays in, or a refusal to grant, any required governmental </span><span>approval for repatriation of capital, as well as by the application to a Fund of any restrictions on investment.</span></div> <div><span>Certain Middle Eastern countries may be heavily dependent upon international trade and, consequently, have been and may </span><span>continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values and </span><span>other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade. These countries also have been </span><span>and may continue to be adversely impacted by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade. In addition, </span><span>certain issuers located in Middle Eastern countries in which a Fund invests may operate in, or have dealings with, countries </span><span>subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations, and/or countries identified </span><span>by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer may sustain damage to its reputation if it is </span><span>identified as an issuer which operates in, or has dealings with, such countries. A Fund, as an investor in such issuers, will be </span><span>indirectly subject to those risks.</span></div> <div><span>Certain Middle Eastern countries have strained relations with other Middle Eastern countries due to territorial disputes, </span><span>historical animosities, international alliances, defense concerns or other reasons, which may adversely affect the economies </span><span>of these Middle Eastern countries. Certain Middle Eastern countries experience significant unemployment, as well as </span><span>widespread underemployment. There has also been a recent increase in recruitment efforts and an aggressive push for </span><span>territorial control by terrorist groups in the region, which has led to an outbreak of warfare and hostilities. Warfare in Syria has </span><span>spread to surrounding areas, including many portions of Iraq and Turkey. Such hostilities may continue into the future or may </span><span>escalate at any time due to ethnic, racial, political, religious or ideological tensions between groups in the region or foreign </span><span>intervention or lack of intervention, among other factors.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in New Zealand. </span><span> </span><span>Investment in the New Zealand market involves special considerations not typically </span><span>associated with investing in the U.S. market. Although New Zealand encourages foreign investment, its Overseas Investment </span><span>Office must give consent to certain foreign investments based on a national interest determination. A delay in obtaining such </span><span>approval can delay investments in New Zealand and, as a result, a Fund may not be able to invest in certain securities while </span><span>approval is pending. Furthermore, approval could be rejected or a Fund's investments may be affected by a limitation in the </span><span>number of investors interested in a particular industry and/or issuer, and any one of these factors could cause a decline in the </span><span>value of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>New Zealand’s economy historically has been based on a foundation of agricultural exports. Accordingly, natural disasters, </span><span>particularly earthquakes which occur regularly in New Zealand, can have a significant adverse impact on the economy. New </span><span>Zealand is heavily dependent upon international trade and, consequently, has been and may continue to be adversely </span><span>affected by economic conditions in the countries with which it trades. Reduction in spending, particularly by key trading </span><span>partners, on New Zealand products and services may cause an adverse impact on the New Zealand economy. New Zealand’s </span><span>economy may be negatively affected if trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values or </span><span>other protectionist measures are imposed or negotiated by the countries with which it trades.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>23</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

The Philippines has experienced a high level of debt and public </span><span>spending, which may stifle economic growth, contribute to prolonged periods of recession or lower the country’s sovereign </span><span>debt rating and adversely impact investments in a Fund. Large, unprofitable public enterprises, especially in the energy sector, </span><span>contribute to the government’s debt because of slow progress on privatization.</span></div> <div><span>The Philippines’ democracy has a relatively short history, increasing the risk of political instability. The Philippines has in the </span><span>past faced political and militant unrest, and further unrest could present a risk to the local economy and securities markets. </span><span>The Philippines’ political history is marred with widespread fraud and violence. The Philippines has periodically experienced </span><span>and is currently experiencing violence and terrorism, including international terrorist organizations. Any acts of terrorism or </span><span>armed conflicts in the Philippines or internationally could have an adverse effect on the financial and commodities markets </span><span>and the global economy. Furthermore, the geopolitical conflict created by China’s claims in the South China Sea has created </span><span>diplomatic tension. Such increased political and social unrest in any neighboring country could cause further economic and </span><span>market uncertainty in the region.</span></div> <div><span>The Philippines’ economy is heavily dependent on exports, particularly electronics and semiconductors. The Philippines’ </span><span>reliance on these sectors makes it vulnerable to economic downturns during periods of slumps in the information technology </span><span>sectors. In addition, many economic development problems remain, including high unemployment, inadequate </span><span>infrastructure, endemic corruption, poverty, and intensifying global competition from neighboring countries.</span></div> <div><span>The Philippine government may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector and may own or </span><span>control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic conditions in the </span><span>Philippines, which could have a negative impact on private sector companies. There is also the possibility of diplomatic </span><span>developments that could adversely affect investments in the Philippines.</span></div> <div><span>The market for Philippine securities is directly influenced by the flow of international capital, and economic and market </span><span>conditions of certain countries, especially emerging market countries in Southeastern Asia. Adverse economic conditions or </span><span>developments in other emerging market countries have at times significantly affected the availability of credit in the </span><span>Philippine economy and resulted in considerable outflows of funds and declines in the amount of foreign currency invested in </span><span>the Philippines. A crisis in neighboring emerging market countries also may increase investors’ perception of risk in the </span><span>Philippines, which may adversely impact the market value of the securities issued by Philippine companies, including </span><span>securities in which a Fund may invest.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in Poland. </span><span> </span><span>Investment in securities of Polish issuers involves risks not typically associated with investments </span><span>in securities of issuers in developed countries. Such heightened risks include, among others, a relatively short history of </span><span>democracy, expropriation and/or nationalization of assets, confiscatory taxation, less publicly available financial and other </span><span>information, and potential difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations. In addition, Poland faces many economic </span><span>development problems, including high unemployment, inadequate infrastructure, endemic corruption, poverty, and </span><span>intensifying global competition from neighboring countries.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Securities laws in Poland are relatively new and unsettled and, consequently, there is a risk of rapid and unpredictable change </span><span>in laws regarding foreign investment, securities regulation, custody and title to securities and shareholder rights. Accordingly, </span><span>foreign investors may be adversely affected by new or amended laws and regulations. In circumstances where adequate laws </span><span>and shareholder rights exist, it may not be possible to obtain swift and equitable enforcement of the law.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The securities market of Poland is considered an emerging market characterized by a small number of listed companies and a </span><span>relatively illiquid secondary trading market, particularly for corporate bonds. These factors, coupled with restrictions on </span><span>foreign investment and other factors, limit the supply of securities available for investment by a Fund. This will affect the rate </span><span>at which a Fund is able to invest in Poland, the purchase and sale prices for such securities and the timing of purchases and </span><span>sales.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The government in Poland may restrict or control to varying degrees the ability of foreign investors to invest in securities of </span><span>issuers located or operating in Poland. Moreover, governmental approval or special licenses prior to investments by foreign </span><span>investors may be required and may limit the amount of investments by foreign investors in a particular industry and/or issuer. </span><span>A delay in obtaining a required government approval or license would delay investments in Poland, and, as a result, a Fund </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>24</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>may not be able to invest in certain securities while approval is pending. The government of Poland may also withdraw or </span><span>decline to renew a license that enables a Fund to invest in Poland. Any one of these factors could cause a decline in the value </span><span>of a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>The Polish government may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector and may own or control </span><span>many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic conditions in Poland, which </span><span>could have a negative impact on private sector companies. There is also the possibility of diplomatic developments that could </span><span>adversely affect investments in Poland.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The market for Polish securities is directly influenced by the flow of international capital, and economic and market </span><span>conditions of certain countries, especially emerging market countries in Eastern Europe. Adverse economic conditions or </span><span>developments in other emerging market countries have at times significantly affected the availability of credit in the Polish </span><span>economy and resulted in considerable outflows of funds and declines in the amount of foreign currency invested in Poland.</span></div> <div><span>U.S. Economic Trading Partners Risk. </span><span> </span><span>The U.S. is a significant, and in some cases the most significant, trading partner of, or </span><span>foreign investor in, certain countries in which a Fund invests. As a result, economic conditions of such countries may be </span><span>particularly affected by changes in the U.S. economy. A decrease in U.S. imports or exports, new trade and financial </span><span>regulations or tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate or an economic slowdown in the U.S. may have a material </span><span>adverse effect on a country’s economic conditions and, as a result, securities to which a Fund has exposure.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Communication Services Sector. </span><span> </span><span>The communication services sector consists of both companies in </span><span>the telecommunication services industry as well as those in the media and entertainment industry. Examples of companies in </span><span>the telecommunication services industry group include providers of fiber-optic, fixed-line, cellular and wireless </span><span>telecommunications networks. Companies in the media and entertainment industry group encompass a variety of services </span><span>and products including television broadcasting, gaming products, social media, networking platforms, online classifieds, </span><span>online review websites, and Internet search engines. Companies in the communication services sector may be affected by </span><span>industry competition, substantial capital requirements, government regulation, and obsolescence of communications </span><span>products and services due to technological advancement. Fluctuating domestic and international demand, shifting </span><span>demographics and often unpredictable changes in consumer tastes can drastically affect a communication services </span><span>company's profitability. In addition, while all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies </span><span>in the communication services sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or consumer </span><span>information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses. </span></div> <div><span>The communication services sector of a country’s economy is often subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of </span><span>complying with governmental regulations, delays or failure to receive required regulatory approvals, or the enactment of new </span><span>regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of communications companies. Government actions around the </span><span>world, specifically in the area of pre-marketing clearance of products and prices, can be arbitrary and unpredictable. The </span><span>communications services industry can also be significantly affected by intense competition for market share, including </span><span>competition with alternative technologies such as wireless communications, product compatibility and standardization, </span><span>consumer preferences, rapid product obsolescence, research and development of new products, lack of standardization or </span><span>compatibility with existing technologies, and a dependency on patent and copyright protections. Companies in the </span><span>communication services sector may encounter distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet </span><span>increasing competition, particularly in developing new products and services using new technology. Technological </span><span>innovations may make the products and services of certain communications companies obsolete.</span></div> <div><span>Telecommunications providers with exposure to the U.S. are generally required to obtain franchises or licenses in order to </span><span>provide services in a given location. Licensing and franchise rights in the telecommunications sector are limited, which may </span><span>provide an advantage to certain participants. Limited availability of such rights, high barriers to market entry and regulatory </span><span>oversight, among other factors, have led to consolidation of companies within the sector, which could lead to further </span><span>regulation or other negative effects in the future. Telecommunication providers investing in non-U.S. countries may be </span><span>subject to similar risks. Additional risks include those related to competitive challenges in the U.S. from non-U.S. competitors </span><span>engaged in strategic joint ventures with U.S. companies and in non-U.S. markets from both U.S. and non-U.S. competitors. </span></div> <div><span>Companies in the media and entertainment industries can be significantly affected by several factors, including competition, </span><span>particularly in formulation of products and services using new technologies, cyclicality of revenues and earnings, a potential </span><span>decrease in the discretionary income of targeted individuals, changing consumer tastes and interests, and the potential </span><span>increase in government regulation. Companies in the media and entertainment industries may become obsolete quickly. </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>25</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Advertising spending can be an important revenue source for media and entertainment companies. During economic </span><span>downturns advertising spending typically decreases and, as a result, media and entertainment companies tend to generate </span><span>less revenue.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Discretionary Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies engaged in the design, production or distribution of </span><span>products or services for the consumer discretionary sector (including, without limitation, television and radio broadcasting, </span><span>manufacturing, publishing, recording and musical instruments, motion pictures, photography, amusement and theme parks, </span><span>gaming casinos, sporting goods and sports arenas, camping and recreational equipment, toys and games, apparel, travel-related</span><span> services, automobiles, hotels and motels, and fast food and other restaurants) are subject to the risk that their </span><span>products or services may become obsolete quickly. The success of these companies can depend heavily on disposable </span><span>household income and consumer spending. During periods of an expanding economy, the consumer discretionary sector </span><span>may outperform the consumer staples sector, but may underperform when economic conditions worsen. Moreover, the </span><span>consumer discretionary sector can be significantly affected by several factors, including, without limitation, the performance </span><span>of domestic and international economies, exchange rates, changing consumer preferences, demographics, marketing </span><span>campaigns, cyclical revenue generation, consumer confidence, commodity price volatility, labor relations, interest rates, </span><span>import and export controls, intense competition, technological developments and government regulation.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Staples Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the consumer staples sector may be adversely affected by </span><span>changes in the global economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, and production </span><span>spending. Companies in the consumer staples sector may also be affected by changes in global economic, environmental </span><span>and political events, economic conditions, the depletion of resources, and government regulation. For instance, government </span><span>regulations may affect the permissibility of using various food additives and production methods of companies that make </span><span>food products, which could affect company profitability. In addition, tobacco companies may be adversely affected by the </span><span>adoption of proposed legislation and/or by litigation. Companies in the consumer staples sector also may be subject to risks </span><span>pertaining to the supply of, demand for and prices of raw materials. The prices of raw materials fluctuate in response to a </span><span>number of factors, including, without limitation, changes in government agricultural support programs, exchange rates, </span><span>import and export controls, changes in international agricultural and trading policies, and seasonal and weather conditions. </span><span>Companies in the consumer staples sector may be subject to severe competition, which may also have an adverse impact on </span><span>their profitability.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Energy Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the energy sector are strongly affected by the levels and volatility of </span><span>global energy prices, energy supply and demand, government regulations and policies, energy production and conservation </span><span>efforts, technological change, development of alternative energy sources, and other factors that they cannot control. These </span><span>companies may also lack resources and have limited business lines. Energy companies may have relatively high levels of debt </span><span>and may be more likely to restructure their businesses if there are downturns in certain energy markets or in the global </span><span>economy. If an energy company in a Fund's portfolio becomes distressed, a Fund could lose all or a substantial portion of its </span><span>investment.</span></div> <div><span>The energy sector is cyclical and is highly dependent on commodity prices; prices and supplies of energy may fluctuate </span><span>significantly over short and long periods of time due to, among other things, national and international political changes, </span><span>Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (</span><span>“</span><span>OPEC</span><span>”</span><span>) policies, changes in relationships among OPEC members and </span><span>between OPEC and oil-importing nations, the regulatory environment, taxation policies, the enactment or cessation of trade </span><span>sanctions, war or other geopolitical conflicts, and the economies of the key energy-consuming countries. Commodity prices </span><span>have recently been subject to increased volatility, which may negatively affect companies in which a Fund invests. For </span><span>example, in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak and disputes among oil-producing countries regarding potential limits on </span><span>the production of crude oil, the energy sector has experienced increased volatility. In particular, significant market volatility </span><span>occurred in the crude oil markets as well as the oil futures markets, which resulted in the market price of certain crude oil </span><span>futures contracts falling below zero for a period of time.</span></div> <div><span>Companies in the energy sector may be adversely affected by terrorism, war, cyber incidents, natural disasters or other </span><span>catastrophes. While certain Funds seek to invest in companies with positive or favorable environmental and social </span><span>characteristics, companies in the energy sector are at risk of civil liability from accidents resulting in injury, loss of life or </span><span>property, pollution or other environmental damage claims. Disruptions in the oil industry or shifts in fuel consumption may </span><span>significantly impact companies in this sector. Significant oil and gas deposits are located in emerging markets countries </span><span>where corruption and security may raise significant risks, in addition to the other risks of investing in emerging markets. </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>26</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Additionally, the Middle East, where many companies in the energy sector may operate, has historically and recently </span><span>experienced widespread social unrest.</span></div> <div><span>Companies in the energy sector may also be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates, interest rates, economic </span><span>conditions, tax treatment, government regulation and intervention, negative perception, efforts at energy conservation and </span><span>world events in the regions in which the companies operate (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and </span><span>property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest, </span><span>violence or labor unrest). Because a significant portion of revenues of companies in this sector is derived from a relatively </span><span>small number of customers that are largely composed of governmental entities and utilities, governmental budget </span><span>constraints may have a significant impact on the stock prices of companies in this sector. The energy sector is highly </span><span>regulated. Entities operating in the energy sector are subject to significant regulation of nearly every aspect of their </span><span>operations by governmental agencies. Such regulation can change rapidly or over time in both scope and intensity. Stricter </span><span>laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be enacted in the future which would likely increase compliance costs and </span><span>may materially adversely affect the financial performance of companies in the energy sector. Energy companies may have </span><span>relatively high levels of debt and may be more likely than companies in other sectors to restructure their businesses during </span><span>economic downturns or adversity in global energy markets.</span></div> <div><span>Russia's large-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 has led to further disruptions and increased volatility in the </span><span>energy and commodity futures markets due to actual and potential disruptions in the supply and demand for certain </span><span>commodities, including oil and natural gas. The U.S. and certain European countries have announced bans or restrictions on </span><span>imports of hydrocarbon commodities from Russia. The effect of such bans and any similar restrictions by other countries, as </span><span>well as the extent, scope and duration of the conflict, resulting sanctions and associated market disruptions on the energy </span><span>sector, are impossible to predict and depend on a number of factors. The effect of these events or any related developments </span><span>could be significant and may have a severe adverse effect on the performance of a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Financials Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the financials sector include regional and money center banks, </span><span>securities brokerage firms, asset management companies, savings banks and thrift institutions, specialty finance companies </span><span>(</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, credit card, mortgage providers), insurance and insurance brokerage firms, consumer finance firms, financial </span><span>conglomerates and foreign banking and financial companies.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Most financial companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which limits their activities and may affect their </span><span>ability to earn a profit from a given line of business. Government regulation may change frequently and may have significant </span><span>adverse consequences for companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by the regulation. Direct </span><span>governmental intervention in the operations of financial companies and financial markets may materially and adversely affect </span><span>the companies in which a Fund invests, including legislation in many countries that may increase government regulation, </span><span>repatriation and other intervention. The impact of governmental intervention and legislative changes on any individual </span><span>financial company or on the financials sector as a whole cannot be predicted. The valuation of financial companies has been </span><span>and continues to be subject to unprecedented volatility and may be influenced by unpredictable factors, including interest </span><span>rate risk and sovereign debt default. Certain financial businesses are subject to intense competitive pressures, including </span><span>market share and price competition. Financial companies in foreign countries are subject to market specific and general </span><span>regulatory and interest rate concerns. In particular, government regulation in certain foreign countries may include taxes and </span><span>controls on interest rates, credit availability, minimum capital requirements, bans on short sales, limits on prices and </span><span>restrictions on currency transfers. In addition, companies in the financials sector may be the targets of hacking and potential </span><span>theft of proprietary or customer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their </span><span>businesses.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The profitability of banks, savings and loan associations and financial companies is largely dependent on the availability and </span><span>cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change; for instance, when interest rates go up, the </span><span>value of securities issued by many types of companies in the financials sector generally goes down. In other words, financial </span><span>companies may be adversely affected in certain market cycles, including, without limitation, during periods of rising interest </span><span>rates, which may restrict the availability and increase the cost of capital, and during periods of declining economic </span><span>conditions, which may cause, among other things, credit losses due to financial difficulties of borrowers.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>In addition, general economic conditions are important to the operations of these companies, and financial difficulties of </span><span>borrowers may have an adverse effect on the profitability of financial companies. Companies in the financials sector are </span><span>exposed directly to the credit risk of their borrowers and counterparties, who may be leveraged to an unknown degree, </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>27</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>including through swaps and other derivatives products, and who at times may be unable to meet their obligations to the </span><span>financial services companies. Financial services companies may have significant exposure to the same borrowers and </span><span>counterparties, with the result that a borrower’s or counterparty’s inability to meet its obligations to one company may affect </span><span>other companies with exposure to the same borrower or counterparty. This interconnectedness of risk, including cross-default</span><span> risk, may result in significant negative impacts to the financial condition and reputation of companies with direct </span><span>exposure to the defaulting counterparty as well as adverse cascading effects in the markets and the financials sector </span><span>generally. Financial companies can be highly dependent upon access to capital markets, and any impediments to such </span><span>access, such as adverse overall economic conditions or a negative perception in the capital markets of a financial company’s </span><span>financial condition or prospects, could adversely affect its business. Deterioration of credit markets can have an adverse </span><span>impact on a broad range of financial markets, causing certain financial companies to incur large losses. In these conditions, </span><span>companies in the financials sector may experience significant declines in the valuation of their assets, take actions to raise </span><span>capital and even cease operations. Some financial companies may also be required to accept or borrow significant amounts </span><span>of capital from government sources and may face future government-imposed restrictions on their businesses or increased </span><span>government intervention. In addition, there is no guarantee that governments will provide any such relief in the future. These </span><span>actions may cause the securities of many companies in the financials sector to decline in value.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Healthcare Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the healthcare sector are often issuers whose profitability may be </span><span>affected by extensive government regulation, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising or </span><span>falling costs of medical products and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, a limited </span><span>number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market developments. Many healthcare </span><span>companies are heavily dependent on patent protection and the actual or perceived safety and efficiency of their products.</span></div> <div><span>Patents have a limited duration, and, upon expiration, other companies may market substantially similar </span><span>“</span><span>generic</span><span>”</span><span> products </span><span>that are typically sold at a lower price than the patented product, which can cause the original developer of the product to </span><span>lose market share and/or reduce the price charged for the product, resulting in lower profits for the original developer. As a </span><span>result, the expiration of patents may adversely affect the profitability of these companies.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>In addition, because the products and services of many companies in the healthcare sector affect the health and well-being </span><span>of many individuals, these companies are especially susceptible to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar </span><span>claims. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may </span><span>result in price discounting. Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The process </span><span>of obtaining such approvals may be long and costly, which can result in increased development costs, delayed cost recovery </span><span>and loss of competitive advantage to the extent that rival companies have developed competing products or procedures, </span><span>adversely affecting the company’s revenues and profitability. In other words, delays in the regulatory approval process may </span><span>diminish the opportunity for a company to profit from a new product or to bring a new product to market, which could have </span><span>a material adverse effect on a company’s business. Healthcare companies may also be strongly affected by scientific </span><span>biotechnology or technological developments, and their products may quickly become obsolete. Also, many healthcare </span><span>companies offer products and services that are subject to governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by changes </span><span>in governmental policies or laws. Changes in governmental policies or laws may span a wide range of topics, including cost </span><span>control, national health insurance, incentives for compensation in the provision of healthcare services, tax incentives and </span><span>penalties related to healthcare insurance premiums, and promotion of prepaid healthcare plans. In addition, a number of </span><span>legislative proposals concerning healthcare have been considered by the U.S. Congress in recent years. It is unclear what </span><span>proposals will ultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect they may have on companies in the healthcare sector.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Additionally, the expansion of facilities by healthcare-related providers may be subject to </span><span>“</span><span>determinations of need</span><span>”</span><span> by certain </span><span>government authorities. This process not only generally increases the time and costs involved in these expansions, but also </span><span>makes expansion plans uncertain, limiting the revenue and profitability growth potential of healthcare-related facilities </span><span>operators and negatively affecting the prices of their securities. Moreover, in recent years, both local and national </span><span>governmental budgets have come under pressure to reduce spending and control healthcare costs, which could both </span><span>adversely affect regulatory processes and public funding available for healthcare products, services and facilities.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Industrials Sector. </span><span> </span><span>The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be </span><span>adversely affected by supply of and demand for both their specific products or services and for industrials sector products in </span><span>general. The products of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and </span><span>frequent new product introduction. Government regulations, trade disputes, world events and economic conditions may </span><span>affect the performance of companies in the industrials sector. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>28</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. For example, commodity price </span><span>declines and unit volume reductions resulting from an over-supply of materials used in the industrials sector can adversely </span><span>affect the sector. Furthermore, while certain Funds seek to invest in companies with positive or favorable environmental, </span><span>social, and governance (</span><span>“</span><span>ESG</span><span>”</span><span>) characteristics, companies in the industrials sector may be subject to liability for </span><span>environmental damage, product liability claims, depletion of resources, and mandated expenditures for safety and pollution </span><span>control.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Materials Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the materials sector may be adversely affected by commodity price </span><span>volatility, exchange rate fluctuations, social and political unrest, war, import or export controls, increased competition, </span><span>depletion of resources, technical progress, labor relations and government regulations, and mandated expenditures for safety </span><span>and pollution control, among other factors. Such risks may adversely affect the issuers to which a Fund has exposure. While </span><span>certain Funds seek to invest in companies with positive or favorable ESG characteristics, companies in the materials sector </span><span>are also at risk of liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. Production of materials may exceed demand </span><span>as a result of market imbalances or economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns. These risks are heightened for </span><span>companies in the materials sector located in foreign markets.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Real Estate Industry. </span><span> </span><span>Companies in the real estate industry include companies that invest in real </span><span>estate, such as REITs, real estate holding and operating companies or real estate development companies (collectively, </span><span>“</span><span>Real </span><span>Estate Companies</span><span>”</span><span>). Investing in Real Estate Companies exposes investors to the risks of owning real estate directly, as well </span><span>as to risks that relate specifically to the way in which Real Estate Companies are organized and operated. The real estate </span><span>industry is highly sensitive to general and local economic conditions and developments, and characterized by intense </span><span>competition and periodic overbuilding. Investing in Real Estate Companies involves various risks. Some risks that are specific </span><span>to Real Estate Companies are discussed in greater detail below.</span></div> <div><span>Concentration Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may own a limited number of properties and concentrate their investments in a </span><span>particular geographic region or property type. Economic downturns affecting a particular region, industry or property type </span><span>may lead to a high volume of defaults within a short period.</span></div> <div><span>Distressed Investment Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may invest in distressed, defaulted or out-of-favor bank loans. </span><span>Identification and implementation by a Real Estate Company of loan modification and restructure programs involves a high </span><span>degree of uncertainty. Even successful implementation may still require adverse compromises and may not prevent </span><span>bankruptcy. Real Estate Companies may also invest in other debt instruments that may become non-performing, including </span><span>the securities of companies with higher credit and market risk due to financial or operational difficulties. Higher risk securities </span><span>may be less liquid and more volatile than the securities of companies not in distress.</span></div> <div><span>Illiquidity Risk.</span><span> Investing in Real Estate Companies may involve risks similar to those associated with investing in small-capitalization</span><span> companies. Real Estate Company securities, like the securities of small-capitalization companies, may be more </span><span>volatile than, and perform differently from, shares of large-capitalization companies. There may be less trading in Real Estate </span><span>Company shares, which means that buy and sell transactions in those shares could have a magnified impact on share price, </span><span>resulting in abrupt or erratic price fluctuations. In addition, real estate is relatively illiquid, and, therefore, a Real Estate </span><span>Company may have a limited ability to vary or liquidate properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions.</span></div> <div><span>Interest Rate Risk.</span><span> Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could </span><span>negatively impact a Real Estate Company’s ability to meet its payment obligations. Declining interest rates could result in </span><span>increased prepayment on loans and require redeployment of capital in less desirable investments.</span></div> <div><span>Leverage Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may use leverage (and some may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk </span><span>and could adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s operations and market value in periods of rising interest rates. Real Estate </span><span>Companies are also exposed to the risks normally associated with debt financing. Financial covenants related to a Real Estate </span><span>Company’s leverage may affect the ability of the Real Estate Company to operate effectively. In addition, real property may be </span><span>subject to the quality of credit extended and defaults by borrowers and tenants. If the properties do not generate sufficient </span><span>income to meet operating expenses, including, where applicable, debt service, ground lease payments, tenant improvements, </span><span>third-party leasing commissions and other capital expenditures, the income and ability of a Real Estate Company to make </span><span>payments of any interest and principal on its debt securities will be adversely affected.</span></div> <div><span>Loan Foreclosure Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may foreclose on loans that the Real Estate Company originated and/or </span><span>acquired. Foreclosure may generate negative publicity for the underlying property that affects its market value.

Claims and defenses asserted by borrowers or other lenders may interfere with the enforcement of </span><span>rights by a Real Estate Company. Parallel proceedings, such as bankruptcy, may also delay resolution and limit the amount of </span><span>recovery on a foreclosed loan by a Real Estate Company even where the property underlying the loan is liquidated.</span></div> <div><span>Management Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies are dependent upon management skills and may have limited financial resources. </span><span>Real Estate Companies are generally not diversified and may be subject to heavy cash flow dependency, default by borrowers </span><span>and voluntary liquidation. In addition, transactions between Real Estate Companies and their affiliates may be subject to </span><span>conflicts of interest, which may adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s shareholders. A Real Estate Company may also have </span><span>joint venture investments in certain of its properties, and, consequently, its ability to control decisions relating to such </span><span>properties may be limited.</span></div> <div><span>Property Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies may be subject to risks relating to functional obsolescence or reduced desirability of </span><span>properties; extended vacancies due to economic conditions and tenant bankruptcies; catastrophic events such as </span><span>earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts; and casualty or condemnation losses. Real estate income and values also may be </span><span>greatly affected by demographic trends, such as population shifts or changing tastes and values, or increasing vacancies or </span><span>declining rents resulting from legal, cultural, technological, global or local economic developments.</span></div> <div><span>Regulatory Risk.</span><span> Real estate income and values may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable domestic and foreign </span><span>laws (including tax laws). Government actions, such as tax increases, zoning law changes, mandated closures or other </span><span>commercial restrictions or environmental regulations, also may have a major impact on real estate income and values. In </span><span>addition, quarterly compliance with regulations limiting the proportion of asset types held by a U.S. REIT may force certain </span><span>Real Estate Companies to liquidate or restructure otherwise attractive investments. Some countries may not recognize REITs </span><span>or comparable structures as a viable form of real estate funds.</span></div> <div><span>Underlying Investment Risk.</span><span> Real Estate Companies make investments in a variety of debt and equity instruments with </span><span>varying risk profiles. For instance, Real Estate Companies may invest in debt instruments secured by commercial property </span><span>that have higher risks of delinquency and foreclosure than loans on single family homes due to a variety of factors associated </span><span>with commercial property, including the tie between income available to service debt and productive use of the property. Real </span><span>Estate Companies may also invest in debt instruments and preferred equity that are junior in an issuer’s capital structure and </span><span>that involve privately negotiated structures. Subordinated debt investments, such as B-Notes and mezzanine loans, involve a </span><span>greater credit risk of default due to the need to service more senior debt of the issuer. Similarly, preferred equity investments </span><span>involve a greater risk of loss than conventional debt financing due to their non-collateralized nature and subordinated </span><span>ranking. Investments in commercial mortgage-backed securities may also be junior in priority in the event of bankruptcy or </span><span>similar proceedings. Investments in senior loans may be effectively subordinated if the senior loan is pledged as collateral. </span><span>The ability of a holder of junior claims to proceed against a defaulting issuer is circumscribed by the terms of the particular </span><span>contractual arrangement, which vary considerably from transaction to transaction.</span></div> <div><span>U.S. Tax Risk.</span><span> Certain U.S. Real Estate Companies are subject to special U.S. federal tax requirements. A REIT that fails to </span><span>comply with such tax requirements may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation, which may affect the value of the REIT </span><span>and the characterization of the REIT’s distributions. The U.S. federal tax requirement that a REIT distribute substantially all of </span><span>its net income to its shareholders may result in a REIT having insufficient capital for future expenditures. A REIT that </span><span>successfully maintains its qualification may still become subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes, including excise, </span><span>penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage recording, and transfer taxes, both directly and indirectly through its subsidiaries. </span><span>Because REITs often do not provide complete tax information until after the calendar year-end, a Fund may at times need to </span><span>request permission to extend the deadline for issuing your tax reporting statement or supplement the information otherwise </span><span>provided to you.</span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Technology Sector. </span><span> </span><span>Technology companies are characterized by periodic new product introductions, </span><span>innovations and evolving industry standards, and, as a result, face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, </span><span>which may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Companies in the technology sector are often smaller and less </span><span>experienced companies and may be subject to greater risks than larger companies; these risks may be heightened for </span><span>technology companies in foreign markets. Technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial </span><span>resources or personnel. The products of technology companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological </span><span>developments and frequent new product introduction, changes in consumer and business purchasing patterns, </span><span>unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. In addition, a rising interest </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>30</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>rate environment tends to negatively affect companies in the technology sector because, in such an environment, those </span><span>companies with high market valuations may appear less attractive to investors, which may cause sharp decreases in the </span><span>companies’ market prices. Companies in the technology sector are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property </span><span>rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Companies in the </span><span>technology sector are facing increased government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or </span><span>regulatory action. The technology sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which </span><span>may be influenced or characterized by unpredictable factors. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network </span><span>security breaches, certain companies in the technology sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of </span><span>proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Risk of Investing in the Utilities Sector. </span><span> </span><span>The utilities sector may be adversely affected by changing commodity prices, </span><span>government regulation stipulating rates charged by utilities, increased tariffs, changes in tax laws, interest rate fluctuations </span><span>and changes in the cost of providing specific utility services. The utilities industry is also subject to potential terrorist attacks, </span><span>natural disasters and severe weather conditions, as well as regulatory and operational burdens associated with the operation </span><span>and maintenance of nuclear facilities. Government regulators monitor and control utility revenues and costs, and therefore </span><span>may limit utility profits. In certain countries, regulatory authorities may also restrict a company’s access to new markets, </span><span>thereby diminishing the company’s long-term prospects.</span></div> <div><span>There are substantial differences among the regulatory practices and policies of various jurisdictions, and any regulatory </span><span>agency may make major shifts in policy from time to time. There is no assurance that regulatory authorities will, in the future, </span><span>grant rate increases. Additionally, existing and possible future regulatory legislation may make it even more difficult for </span><span>utilities to obtain adequate relief. Certain of the issuers of securities held in a Fund's portfolio may own or operate nuclear </span><span>generating facilities. Governmental authorities may from time to time review existing policies and impose additional </span><span>requirements governing the licensing, construction and operation of nuclear power plants. Prolonged changes in climate </span><span>conditions can also have a significant impact on both the revenues of an electric and gas utility as well as the expenses of a </span><span>utility, particularly a hydro-based electric utility.</span></div> <div><span>The rates that traditional regulated utility companies may charge their customers generally are subject to review and </span><span>limitation by governmental regulatory commissions. Rate changes may occur only after a prolonged approval period or may </span><span>not occur at all, which could adversely affect utility companies when costs are rising. The value of regulated utility debt </span><span>securities (and, to a lesser extent, equity securities) tends to have an inverse relationship to the movement of interest rates. </span><span>Certain utility companies have experienced full or partial deregulation in recent years. These utility companies are frequently </span><span>more similar to industrial companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been permitted by regulators to </span><span>diversify outside of their original geographic regions and their traditional lines of business. As a result, some companies may </span><span>be forced to defend their core business and may be less profitable. Deregulation may also permit a utility company to expand </span><span>outside of its traditional lines of business and engage in riskier ventures.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Proxy Voting Policy</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>For the Funds, the Board has delegated the voting of proxies for each Fund’s securities to BFA pursuant to the Funds' Proxy </span><span>Voting Policy (the </span><span>“</span><span>iShares ETFs</span><span> </span><span>Proxy Voting Policy</span><span>”</span><span>), and BFA has adopted policies and procedures (the </span><span>“</span><span>BlackRock Proxy </span><span>Voting Policies</span><span>”</span><span>) governing proxy voting by accounts managed by BFA, including the Funds.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Under the BlackRock Proxy Voting Policies, BFA will vote proxies related to Fund securities in the best interests of a Fund and </span><span>its shareholders.The proxy voting policies that apply to the iShares Paris-Aligned Climate MSCI USA ETF include voting </span><span>guidelines for corporate governance matters, as well as environmental and social issues, including providing frameworks of </span><span>factors for consideration when BFA, on behalf of the Fund, votes on proposals related to such matters. BFA may not vote in </span><span>favor of any particular proposal related to corporate governance, environmental or social issues. From time to time, a vote </span><span>may present a conflict between the interests of a Fund’s shareholders, on the one hand, and those of BFA, or any affiliated </span><span>person of a Fund or BFA, on the other. BFA maintains policies and procedures that are designed to prevent undue influence </span><span>on BFA’s proxy voting activity that might stem from any relationship between the issuer of a proxy (or any dissident </span><span>shareholder) and BFA, BFA’s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund’s affiliates. Most conflicts are managed through a structural </span><span>separation of BFA’s Corporate Governance Group from BFA’s employees with sales and client responsibilities. In addition, BFA </span><span>maintains procedures to ensure that all engagements with corporate issuers or dissident shareholders are managed </span><span>consistently and without regard to BFA’s relationship with the issuer of the proxy or the dissident shareholder.

The Underlying Index is a </span><span>subset of the Morningstar Global Markets Index. Morningstar evaluates the constituents based on five-year net profit and </span><span>revenue projections as a producer or supplier with respect to four themes:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Agriculture Technology: Solutions that enhance yield, improve efficiency or achieve waste reduction.

However, if there </span><span>are fewer than 50 Tier 1 constituents, the shortfall is filled with Tier 2 constituents, and the Underlying Index is capped at 50 </span><span>constituents. Constituents are float market capitalization-weighted with a 4% cap for individual stocks. The Underlying Index </span><span>is reconstituted and rebalanced each December. The themes are reviewed annually by Morningstar and are subject to change </span><span>as they evolve and new themes emerge.</span></div> <div><span>Morningstar’s methodology does not require that at least one company from each of the themes be included in the </span><span>Underlying Index, nor does it require a minimum number of Tier 1 constituents. In addition, constituents may operate </span><span>business lines that generate revenues in industries other than those related to the four themes.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Calculation Methodology</span><span>. The Fund utilizes the Underlying Index calculated with net dividends reinvested. Morningstar uses </span><span>the country of incorporation of the constituents to determine the relevant dividend withholding tax rates in calculating the </span><span>net dividends. The regular cash dividend is reinvested after deduction of withholding tax by applying the maximum rate of </span><span>the company’s country of incorporation applicable to institutional investors. Net dividends means dividends after taxes </span><span>withheld at the rate applicable to non-resident institutional investors who do not benefit from double taxation treaties. Such </span><span>withholding rates may differ from those applicable to U.S. residents.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>34</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

The MSCI Global Standard </span><span>Index is the aggregation of the Large Cap Index and Mid Cap Index and the MSCI GIMI is the aggregation of the MSCI Global </span><span>Standard Index and MSCI Global Small Cap Index.</span></div> <div><span>Selection Criteria.</span><span> MSCI's index construction process involves: (i) defining the equity universe; (ii) determining the market </span><span>investable equity universe for each market; (iii) determining market capitalization size segments for each market; (iv) </span><span>applying final size segment investability requirements; and (v) applying index continuity rules for the MSCI Global Standard </span><span>Index.</span></div> <div><span>Defining the Equity Universe</span><span>. MSCI begins with securities listed in countries in the MSCI GIMI. As of June 23, 2022, 23 are </span><span>classified as developed markets, 24 as emerging markets, and 20 as frontier markets (FM excludes the WFMU, which consists </span><span>of securities classified in </span><span>Benin, Senegal, Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso</span><span>.). All listed equity securities and listed securities that </span><span>exhibit characteristics of equity securities, except mutual funds, ETFs, equity derivatives, limited partnerships and most </span><span>investment trusts, are eligible for inclusion in the equity universe. REITs in some countries and certain income trusts in </span><span>Canada are also eligible for inclusion. Each company and its securities (</span><span>i.e</span><span>., share classes) are classified in only one country.</span></div> <div><span>Determining the Market Investable Equity Universe for Each Market.</span><span> The equity universe in any market is derived by </span><span>applying investability screens to individual companies and securities in that market. Some investability requirements are </span><span>applied at the individual security level and some at the overall company level, represented by the aggregation of individual </span><span>securities of the company. As a result, the inclusion or exclusion of one security does not imply the automatic inclusion or </span><span>exclusion of other securities of the same company.</span></div> <div><span>Determining Market Capitalization Size Segments for Each Market.</span><span> In order to create size components that can be </span><span>meaningfully aggregated into composites, individual market size segments balance the following two objectives:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Achieving global size integrity by ensuring that companies of comparable and relevant sizes are included in a given size </span><span>segment across all markets in a composite index; and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Achieving consistent market coverage by ensuring that each market's size segment is represented in its proportional </span><span>weight in the composite universe.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>The Standard Indexes, Large Cap Indexes, Mid Cap Indexes, and Small Cap Indexes capture the following market </span><span>capitalization size segments:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>MSCI Global Standard Indexes cover all investable large- and mid-cap securities by including the largest issuers </span><span>comprising approximately 85% of each market’s free float-adjusted market capitalization.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>MSCI Global Large Cap Indexes provide coverage of all investable large-cap securities by including the largest issuers </span><span>comprising approximately 70% of each market’s free float-adjusted market capitalization.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>MSCI Global Mid Cap Indexes provide coverage in each market by deriving the difference between the market coverage </span><span>of the MSCI Global Standard Index and the MSCI Global Large Cap Index in that market.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>35</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

These investability </span><span>requirements include minimum free float-adjusted market capitalization, minimum liquidity, minimum foreign limits and </span><span>minimum length of trading.</span></div> <div><span>Applying Index Continuity Rules for the Standard Index.</span><span> In order to achieve index continuity as well as provide some basic </span><span>level of diversification within a market index, notwithstanding the effect of other index construction rules contained herein, a </span><span>minimum number of five constituents will be maintained for a developed market Standard Index and a minimum number of </span><span>three constituents will be maintained for an emerging market Standard Index.</span></div> <div><span>Weighting.</span><span> All indexes of the MSCI GIMI are free float weighted, </span><span>i.e.,</span><span> companies are included in the indexes at the value of </span><span>their free public float (free float multiplied by security price).</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Regional Weights.</span><span> Market capitalization-weighting, combined with a consistent target of approximately 99% of free float-adjusted</span><span> market capitalization, helps ensure that each country's weight in regional and international indexes approximates its </span><span>weight in the total universe of developing and emerging markets. A market is equivalent to a single country except for </span><span>developed Europe, where all markets are aggregated into a single market for index construction purposes. Individual country </span><span>indexes of the European developed markets are derived from the constituents of the MSCI GIMI Europe Index.</span></div> <div><span>Free Float.</span><span> MSCI defines the free float of a security as the proportion of shares outstanding that are deemed to be available </span><span>for purchase in the public equity markets by international investors. In practice, limitations on free float available to </span><span>international investors include: (i) strategic and other shareholdings not considered part of available free float; and (ii) limits </span><span>on share ownership for foreigners.</span></div> <div><span>MSCI calculates the free float-adjusted market capitalization of each security in the equity index universe by (i) defining and </span><span>estimating the free float available to foreign investors; (ii) assigning a free float-adjustment factor to each security; and (iii) </span><span>calculating the free float-adjusted market capitalization of each security.</span></div> <div><span>Under MSCI's free float-adjustment methodology, a constituent's inclusion factor is equal to its estimated free float, rounded </span><span>up to the closest 5% for constituents with free float equal to or exceeding 15%. For example, a constituent security with a </span><span>free float of 23.2% will be included in the index at 25% of its market capitalization. For securities with a free float of less than </span><span>15%, the estimated free float is adjusted to the nearest 1%.</span></div> <div><span>Price and Exchange Rates</span></div> <div><span>Prices.</span><span> The prices used to calculate all MSCI indexes are the official exchange closing prices or those figures accepted as </span><span>such. MSCI reserves the right to use an alternative pricing source on any given day.</span></div> <div><span>Exchange Rates.</span><span> MSCI uses the World Markets/Reuters Closing Spot Rates taken at 4:00 p.m. London time. In case World </span><span>Markets/Reuters does not provide rates for specific markets on given days (for example, Christmas Day and New Year's Day), </span><span>the previous business day's rates are normally used. MSCI independently monitors the exchange rates on all its indexes. </span><span>MSCI may under exceptional circumstances elect to use alternative sources of exchange rates if the World Markets/Reuters </span><span>rates are not available, or if MSCI determines that the World Markets/Reuters rates are not reflective of market circumstances </span><span>for a given currency on a particular day. In such circumstances, an announcement would be sent to clients with the related </span><span>information. If appropriate, MSCI may conduct a consultation with the investment community to gather feedback on the </span><span>most relevant exchange rate.</span></div> <div><span>Changes to the Indexes.</span><span> The MSCI GIMI are maintained with the objective of reflecting, on a timely basis, the evolution of </span><span>the underlying equity markets. In maintaining the MSCI indexes, emphasis is also placed on continuity, replicability and </span><span>minimizing turnover in the indexes. Maintaining the MSCI indexes involves many aspects, including: (i) additions to, and </span><span>deletions from, the indexes; (ii) changes in number of shares; and (iii) changes in inclusion factors as a result of updated free </span><span>float estimates.</span></div> <div><span>Index maintenance can be described by three broad categories of changes:</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>36</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

During the SAIRs, MSCI </span><span>updates the investable equity universe and reassesses size segmentation investability requirements. MSCI also conducts QIRs </span><span>generally as of the close of the last business day of February and August. During the QIRs, MSCI reflects changes in the index </span><span>that were not captured at the time of their actual occurrence, but are significant enough to be included before the next SAIR. </span><span>The results of the SAIR and QIR are generally announced at least ten business days in advance of implementation.</span></div> <div><span>Creation of Sector and Industry Indexes using the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS</span><span>®</span><span>)</span></div> <div><span>All securities in the Global Investable Equity Universe are assigned to the industry that best describes their business activities </span><span>using the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS</span><span>®</span><span>). The GICS consists of sectors, industry groups, industries and sub-industries.</span><span> Under the GICS, each company is assigned to one unique sub-industry according to its principal business activity </span><span>(generally defined as the business activity that generates 60% or more of the company’s revenues). Narrower indexes may be </span><span>derived based on industry classification, and may contain securities belonging to specific sectors, industry groups, industries, </span><span>sub-industries or a combination thereof.</span></div> <div><span>MSCI 25/50 Indexes</span> <br/></div> <div><span>Each of the MSCI 25/50 Indexes (the </span><span>“</span><span>25/50 Indexes</span><span>”</span><span>) is a sub-index of either an MSCI Global Standard Index or an MSCI </span><span>GIMI. Their construction reflects the diversification requirements applicable to RICs pursuant to Subchapter M of the Internal </span><span>Revenue Code. MSCI uses the concept of </span><span>“</span><span>group entities</span><span>”</span><span> for the concentration limits of the capping methodologies in the </span><span>25/50 Indexes. A group entity is a group of companies that operate as an affiliated corporate group but may separately issue </span><span>listed securities. To determine </span><span>“</span><span>group entities,</span><span>”</span><span> MSCI analyzes financial accounts of listed companies holding stakes of 20% </span><span>or more in other listed companies to determine whether these stakes are controlling in nature. In certain cases, even in the </span><span>absence of consolidated accounts, MSCI may also consider two companies as belonging to the same group entity where </span><span>there is reasonable evidence of control based on other information. The 25/50 Indexes are free float-adjusted market </span><span>capitalization-weighted indexes with a capping methodology applied to group entity weights so that no single group entity </span><span>exceeds 25% of index weight, and all group entities with a weight above 5% do not cumulatively exceed 50% of the index </span><span>weight. A buffer of 10% of the value of each of these caps is used in order to reduce the risk of noncompliance due to short </span><span>term market movements between rebalances. As a result, at the point of constructing or rebalancing the 25/50 Indexes, the </span><span>weight of any single group entity cannot exceed 22.5% of the index weight and all group entities with weight above 4.5% </span><span>cannot exceed 45% of the index weight. A software application called the Barra Optimizer is utilized to calculate the capped </span><span>index weights through an optimization function which is aimed at minimizing index turnover, tracking error and extreme </span><span>deviation from the uncapped index.</span></div> <div><span>MSCI All Ireland Capped Index</span></div> <div><span>Number of Components: approximately 24</span></div> <div><span>Index Description.</span><span> The MSCI All Ireland Capped Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted index that aims </span><span>to reflect the performance of securities of companies that: (i) are classified in Ireland according to the MSCI Global Investable </span><span>Market Index Methodology; (ii) are not classified in Ireland according to the MSCI Global Investable Market Index </span><span>Methodology but are either headquartered or listed in Ireland and carry out the majority of their operations in Ireland, as </span><span>defined by MSCI; or (iii) have economic exposure greater than 10% to Ireland, as defined by MSCI, where the criteria outlined </span><span>in (i) and (ii) do not result in the target number of securities and issuers. The Index Provider generally applies a capping </span><span>methodology to the Underlying Index so that no single issuer exceeds 25% of the Underlying Index weight, and all issuers </span><span>with a weight above 5% do not cumulatively exceed 50% of the Underlying Index weight. However, this capping </span><span>methodology does not apply to constituents that (1) are not classified as a Large, Mid or Small Capitalization securities as per </span><span>the MSCI Global Investment Market Index Methodology and either (2) have a 3-month annual traded value ratio (</span><span>“</span><span>ATVR</span><span>”</span><span>) </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>37</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

The Underlying Index is rebalanced quarterly using an </span><span>optimization process that aims to minimize the constituent weight differences between the Underlying Index and the MSCI </span><span>Denmark Index. The Underlying Index uses a capping methodology that limits the weight of any single </span><span>“</span><span>group entity</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>(constituents that MSCI determines have a control relationship) to a maximum of 25% of the Underlying Index weight, and </span><span>the sum of all group entities with a weight above 5% to an aggregate of 50% of the Underlying Index weight.

The index is constructed by selecting constituents from </span><span>the MSCI EAFE Index, the parent index, through an optimization process that aims to maximize exposure to ESG factors, </span><span>subject to a target tracking error constraint of 50 basis points relative to the parent index. The Fund’s Index Provider begins </span><span>with the parent index and excludes securities of companies involved in the business of tobacco, companies involved with </span><span>controversial weapons, producers and retailers of civilian firearms, and companies involved in certain fossil fuels-related </span><span>activity such as the production of thermal coal, thermal coal-based power generation and extraction of oil sands based on </span><span>revenue or percentage of revenue thresholds for certain categories (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> $20 million or 5%) and categorical exclusions for </span><span>others (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> controversial weapons). The Index Provider also excludes companies involved in very severe business </span><span>controversies (in each case as determined by the Index Provider), and then follows a quantitative process that is designed to </span><span>determine optimal weights for securities to maximize exposure to securities of companies with higher ESG ratings, subject to </span><span>maintaining risk and return characteristics similar to the parent index. For each industry, the Index Provider identifies key ESG </span><span>issues that can lead to unexpected costs for companies in the medium to long term. The Index Provider then calculates the </span><span>size of each company’s exposure to each key issue based on the company’s business segment and geographic risk and </span><span>analyzes the extent to which companies have developed robust strategies and programs to manage ESG risks and </span><span>opportunities. Using a sector-specific key issue weighting model, companies are rated and ranked in comparison to their </span><span>industry peers.</span></div> <div><span>Calculation Methodology. </span><span>The Fund utilizes the Underlying Index calculated with net dividends reinvested.

Each security is evaluated based on certain value factors and growth factors, which </span><span>are then used to calculate a growth score and value score. Based upon these two scores, MSCI determines the extent to </span><span>which each security is assigned to the value or growth style.

The </span><span>Index Provider defines a controversy as an instance or ongoing situation in which company operations and/or products </span><span>allegedly have a negative environmental, social and/or governance impact. Each controversy case is assessed for the severity </span><span>of its impact on society. The Index Provider generally classifies companies as </span><span>“</span><span>involved</span><span>”</span><span> in a particular business based on </span><span>revenue or percentage of revenue thresholds (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> $1 billion or 50%) for certain products and activities in an excluded </span><span>industry. The securities of certain companies may be excluded regardless of revenue measures (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, all companies involved in </span><span>the manufacturing of nuclear weapons are excluded). The Index Provider then follows a quantitative process that is designed </span><span>to determine optimal weights for securities to maximize exposure to securities of companies with higher ESG ratings, subject </span><span>to maintaining 50% of the free float-adjusted market capitalization within each sector of the parent index. In order to </span><span>evaluate a security’s ESG rating for a given sector, the Index Provider identifies key ESG issues that can lead to unexpected </span><span>costs for companies in the medium- to long-term. The Index Provider then calculates the size of each company’s exposure to </span><span>each key issue based on the company’s business segment and geographic risk and analyzes the extent to which companies </span><span>have developed robust strategies and programs to manage ESG risks and opportunities. Using a sector-specific key issue </span><span>weighting model, companies are rated and ranked in comparison to their industry peers.

The Underlying Index, the MSCI USA Small Cap Extended ESG Focus Index, is designed to produce </span><span>investment results comparable to the MSCI USA Small Cap Index, the parent index, while reflecting a higher allocation than </span><span>that of the parent index to U.S. small-capitalization companies with favorable ESG profiles. The Underlying Index is </span><span>constructed by selecting constituents from the parent index through an optimization process that aims to maximize </span><span>exposure to ESG factors subject to a target tracking error constraint of 50 basis points relative to the parent index. In </span><span>constructing the Underlying Index, the Fund’s index provider begins with the parent index and excludes securities of </span><span>companies involved in the business of tobacco, companies involved with controversial weapons, producers and retailers of </span><span>civilian firearms, and companies involved in certain fossil fuels-related activity such as the production of thermal coal, </span><span>thermal coal-based power generation and extraction of oil sands based on revenue or percentage of revenue thresholds for </span><span>certain categories (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> $20 million or 5%) and categorical exclusions for others (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> controversial weapons). The Index </span><span>Provider also excludes companies involved in very severe business controversies (in each case as determined by the index </span><span>provider). The index provider identifies key ESG controversies, including, among other things, issues involving: (i) the </span><span>environment (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> biodiversity and land use, toxic emissions and waste, energy and climate change, water stress, </span><span>nonhazardous operational waste, and supply chain management); (ii) human rights and communities (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> impact on local </span><span>communities, human rights concerns, and civil liberties); (iii) labor rights and supply chains (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> child labor, collective </span><span>bargaining and union, health and safety, discrimination and workforce diversity, and labor management relations); (iv) </span><span>customers (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> anti-competitive practices, customer relations, privacy and data security, product safety and quality, and </span><span>marketing and advertising); and (v) governance (</span><span>e.g.,</span><span> bribery and fraud, governance structures, and controversial </span><span>investments). The index provider then rates each company’s exposure to these ESG issues and evaluates the extent to which </span><span>the company has created strategies and programs to manage ESG risks and opportunities. Companies are scored by the </span><span>index provider based on both their risk exposure and risk management, and then ranked in comparison to their industry </span><span>peers.

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Notations Regarding the iShares Emergent Food and AgTech Multisector ETF, iShares ESG Advanced MSCI EAFE ETF's, </span><span>iShares ESG Advanced MSCI USA ETF's, iShares ESG Aware MSCI EAFE ETF's, iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF's, iShares </span><span>ESG Aware MSCI USA Small-Cap ETF's, iShares ESG MSCI USA Leaders ETF's, iShares MSCI Japan Value ETF's and iShares </span><span>Paris-Aligned Climate MSCI USA ETF's Fundamental Investment Policies</span></div> <div><span>The following notations are not considered to be part of each Fund’s fundamental investment policies and are subject to </span><span>change without shareholder approval.</span></div> <div><span>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to concentration set forth in (1) above, the Investment Company Act does </span><span>not define what constitutes </span><span>“</span><span>concentration</span><span>”</span><span> in an industry. The SEC staff has taken the position that investment of 25% or </span><span>more of a fund’s total assets in one or more issuers conducting their principal activities in the same industry or group of </span><span>industries constitutes concentration. It is possible that interpretations of concentration could change in the future. The policy </span><span>in (1) above will be interpreted to refer to concentration as that term may be interpreted from time to time. The policy also </span><span>will be interpreted to permit investment without limit in the following: securities of the U.S. government and its agencies or </span><span>instrumentalities; securities of state, territory, possession or municipal governments and their authorities, agencies, </span><span>instrumentalities or political subdivisions; and repurchase agreements collateralized by any such obligations. Accordingly, </span><span>issuers of the foregoing securities will not be considered to be members of any industry. There also will be no limit on </span><span>investment in issuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or country. Finance companies will be considered to be in the </span><span>industries of their parents if their activities are primarily related to financing the activities of the parents. Each foreign </span><span>government will be considered to be a member of a separate industry. With respect to each Fund's industry classifications, </span><span>each Fund currently utilizes any one or more of the industry sub-classifications used by one or more widely recognized </span><span>market indexes or rating group indexes, and/or as defined by Fund management. The policy also will be interpreted to give </span><span>broad authority to each Fund as to how to classify issuers within or among industries.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to borrowing money set forth in (2) above, the Investment Company Act </span><span>permits each Fund to borrow money in amounts of up to one-third of the Fund's total assets from banks for any purpose, </span><span>and to borrow up to 5% of the Fund's total assets from banks or other lenders for temporary purposes. (The Fund's total </span><span>assets include the amounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks attendant to borrowing, the Investment Company Act requires </span><span>each Fund to maintain at all times an </span><span>“</span><span>asset coverage</span><span>”</span><span> of at least 300% of the amount of its borrowings. Asset coverage </span><span>means the ratio that the value of each Fund’s total assets (including amounts borrowed), minus liabilities other than </span><span>borrowings, bears to the aggregate amount of all borrowings. Borrowing money to increase portfolio holdings is known as </span><span>“</span><span>leveraging.</span><span>”</span><span> Certain trading practices and investments, such as reverse repurchase agreements, may be considered to be </span><span>borrowings or involve leverage and thus are subject to the Investment Company Act restrictions. In accordance with Rule 18f-4</span><span> under the Investment Company Act, when each Fund engages in reverse repurchase agreements and similar financing </span><span>transactions, the Fund may either (i) maintain asset coverage of at least 300% with respect to such transactions and any </span><span>other borrowings in the aggregate, or (ii) treat such transactions as </span><span>“</span><span>derivatives transactions</span><span>”</span><span> and comply with Rule 18f-4 </span><span>with respect to such transactions. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and </span><span>arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered to be borrowings under the policy. Practices and </span><span>investments that may involve leverage but are not considered to be borrowings are not subject to the policy.</span></div> <div><span>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to underwriting set forth in (5) above, the Investment Company Act does not </span><span>prohibit a fund from engaging in the underwriting business or from underwriting the securities of other issuers; in fact, in the </span><span>case of diversified funds, the Investment Company Act permits a fund to have underwriting commitments of up to 25% of its </span><span>assets under certain circumstances. Those circumstances currently are that the amount of a fund’s underwriting </span><span>commitments, when added to the value of a fund’s investments in issuers where a fund owns more than 10% of the </span><span>outstanding voting securities of those issuers, cannot exceed the 25% cap. A fund engaging in transactions involving the </span><span>acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act. Although it is </span><span>not believed that the application of the 1933 Act provisions described above would cause a fund to be engaged in the </span><span>business of underwriting, the policy in (5) above will be interpreted not to prevent a fund from engaging in transactions </span><span>involving the acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities, regardless of whether a fund may be considered to be an </span><span>underwriter under the 1933 Act or is otherwise engaged in the underwriting business to the extent permitted by applicable </span><span>law.</span></div> <div><span>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to lending set forth in (7) above, the Investment Company Act does not </span><span>prohibit each Fund from making loans (including lending its securities); however, SEC staff interpretations currently prohibit </span><span>funds from lending more than one-third of their total assets (including lending its securities), except through the purchase of </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>51</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, </span><span>depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render </span><span>them statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus delivery requirement and liability provisions of the 1933 Act.</span></div> <div><span>For example, a broker-dealer firm or its client may be deemed a statutory underwriter if it takes Creation Units after placing </span><span>an order with the Distributor, breaks them down into constituent shares and sells such shares directly to customers or if it </span><span>chooses to couple the creation of new shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand </span><span>for shares. A determination of whether one is an underwriter for purposes of the 1933 Act must take into account all of the </span><span>facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the broker-dealer or its client in the particular case and the examples </span><span>mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that could lead to a categorization as </span><span>an underwriter.</span></div> <div><span>Broker-dealer firms should also note that dealers who are not </span><span>“</span><span>underwriters</span><span>”</span><span> but are effecting transactions in shares, </span><span>whether or not participating in the distribution of shares, generally are required to deliver a prospectus. This is because the </span><span>prospectus delivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act is not available in respect of such transactions as a result of </span><span>Section 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that incur a prospectus delivery obligation with respect to shares of the Funds are </span><span>reminded that, pursuant to Rule 153 under the 1933 Act, a prospectus delivery obligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the 1933 </span><span>Act owed to an exchange member in connection with a sale on the Listing Exchange generally is satisfied by the fact that the </span><span>prospectus is available at the Listing Exchange upon request.

The Board has engaged BFA to manage the Funds on a </span><span>day-to-day basis. The Board is responsible for overseeing BFA and other service providers in the operations of the Funds in </span><span>accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, applicable provisions of state and other laws and the Trust’s charter. The </span><span>Board is currently composed of nine members, seven of whom are Independent Trustees. The Board currently conducts </span><span>regular in person meetings four times a year. In addition, the Board frequently holds special in person or telephonic meetings </span><span>or informal conference calls to discuss specific matters that may arise or require action between regular meetings. The </span><span>Independent Trustees meet regularly outside the presence of management, in executive session or with other service </span><span>providers to the Trust.</span></div> <div><span>The Board has appointed an Independent Trustee to serve in the role of Board Chair. The Board Chair’s role is to preside at all </span><span>meetings of the Board and to act as a liaison with service providers, officers, attorneys, and other Trustees generally between </span><span>meetings. The Board Chair may also perform such other functions as may be delegated by the Board from time to time. The </span><span>Board has established seven standing Committees: a Nominating and Governance Committee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c) </span><span>Committee, a Securities Lending Committee, a Risk Committee, an Equity Plus Committee and a Fixed Income Plus </span><span>Committee to assist the Board in the oversight and direction of the business and affairs of the Funds, and from time to time </span><span>the Board may establish ad hoc committees or informal working groups to review and address the policies and practices of </span><span>the Funds with respect to certain specified matters. The Chair of each standing Committee is an Independent Trustee. The </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>60</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>role of the Chair of each Committee is to preside at all meetings of the Committee and to act as a liaison with service </span><span>providers, officers, attorneys and other Trustees between meetings. Each standing Committee meets regularly to conduct the </span><span>oversight functions delegated to the Committee by the Board and reports its finding to the Board. The Board and each </span><span>standing Committee conduct annual assessments of their oversight function and structure. The Board has determined that </span><span>the Board’s leadership structure is appropriate because it allows the Board to exercise independent judgment over </span><span>management and it allocates areas of responsibility among committees of Independent Trustees and the full Board to </span><span>enhance effective oversight.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Day-to-day risk management with respect to the Funds is the responsibility of BFA or other service providers (depending on </span><span>the nature of the risk), subject to the supervision of BFA. Each Fund is subject to a number of risks, including investment, </span><span>compliance, operational, reputational, counterparty and valuation risks, among others. While there are a number of risk </span><span>management functions performed by BFA and other service providers, as applicable, it is not possible to identify and </span><span>eliminate all of the risks applicable to the Funds. The Trustees have an oversight role in this area, satisfying themselves that </span><span>risk management processes and controls are in place and operating effectively. Risk oversight forms part of the Board’s </span><span>general oversight of each Fund and is addressed as part of various Board and committee activities. In some cases, risk </span><span>management issues are specifically addressed in presentations and discussions. For example, BFA has an independent </span><span>dedicated Risk and Quantitative Analysis Group (</span><span>“</span><span>RQA</span><span>”</span><span>) that assists BFA in managing fiduciary and corporate risks, including </span><span>investment, operational, counterparty credit and enterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet with the Board to discuss their </span><span>analysis and methodologies, as well as specific risk topics such as operational and counterparty risks relating to the Funds. </span><span>The Board, directly or through a committee, also reviews reports from, among others, management and the independent </span><span>registered public accounting firm for the Trust, as appropriate, regarding risks faced by each Fund and management’s risk </span><span>functions. The Board has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer who oversees the implementation and testing of the Trust's </span><span>compliance program, including assessments by independent third parties, and reports to the Board regarding compliance </span><span>matters for the Trust and its principal service providers. In testing and maintaining the compliance program, the Chief </span><span>Compliance Officer (and his or her delegates) assesses key compliance risks affecting each Fund, and addresses them in </span><span>periodic reports to the Board. In addition, the Audit Committee meets with both the Funds' independent registered public </span><span>accounting firm and BFA’s internal audit group to review risk controls in place that support each Fund as well as test results. </span><span>Board oversight of risk is also performed as needed between meetings through communications between BFA and the Board. </span><span>The Independent Trustees have engaged independent legal counsel to assist them in performing their oversight </span><span>responsibilities. From time to time, the Board may modify the manner in which it conducts risk oversight. The Board’s </span><span>oversight role does not make it a guarantor of the Funds' investment performance or other activities.</span></div> <div><span>Committees of the Board of Trustees.</span><span>  </span><span>The members of the Audit Committee are Richard L. Fagnani (Chair), Cecilia H. </span><span>Herbert and Madhav V. Rajan, each of whom is an Independent Trustee.

BlackRock, its subsidiaries and their respective directors, </span><span>officers and employees, including the business units or entities and personnel who may be involved in the investment </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>75</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>activities and business operations of a Fund, are engaged worldwide in businesses, including managing equities, fixed-income</span><span> securities, cash and alternative investments, and have interests other than that of managing the Funds. These are </span><span>considerations of which investors in a Fund should be aware, and which may cause conflicts of interest that could </span><span>disadvantage a Fund and its shareholders. These businesses and interests include potential multiple advisory, financial and </span><span>other relationships with, or interests in, companies and interests in securities or other instruments that may be purchased or </span><span>sold by a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock has proprietary interests in, and may manage or advise with respect to, accounts or funds (including separate </span><span>accounts and other funds and collective investment vehicles) that have investment objectives similar to those of a Fund </span><span>and/or that engage in transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and instruments as the Funds. BlackRock is </span><span>also a major participant in the global currency, equities, swap and fixed income markets, in each case, for the accounts of </span><span>clients and, in some cases, on a proprietary basis. As such, BlackRock is or may be actively engaged in transactions in the </span><span>same securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests. Such activities could affect the prices and availability of </span><span>the securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests, which could have an adverse impact on a Fund's </span><span>performance. Such transactions, particularly in respect of most proprietary accounts or client accounts, will be executed </span><span>independently of a Fund's transactions and thus at prices or rates that may be more or less favorable than those obtained by </span><span>the Funds.</span></div> <div><span>When BlackRock seeks to purchase or sell the same assets for managed accounts, including a Fund, the assets actually </span><span>purchased or sold may be allocated among the accounts on a basis determined in its good faith discretion to be equitable. In </span><span>some cases, this system may adversely affect the size or price of the assets purchased or sold for a Fund. In addition, </span><span>transactions in investments by one or more other accounts managed by BlackRock may have the effect of diluting or </span><span>otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of a Fund, particularly, but not limited to, with respect to </span><span>small-capitalization, emerging market or less liquid strategies. This may occur with respect to BlackRock-advised accounts </span><span>when investment decisions regarding a Fund are based on research or other information that is also used to support </span><span>decisions for other accounts. When BlackRock implements a portfolio decision or strategy on behalf of another account </span><span>ahead of, or contemporaneously with, similar decisions or strategies for a Fund, market impact, liquidity constraints, or other </span><span>factors could result in the Fund receiving less favorable trading results and the costs of implementing such decisions or </span><span>strategies could be increased or the Fund could otherwise be disadvantaged. BlackRock may, in certain cases, elect to </span><span>implement internal policies and procedures designed to limit such consequences, which may cause a Fund to be unable to </span><span>engage in certain activities, including purchasing or disposing of securities, when it might otherwise be desirable for it to do </span><span>so.</span></div> <div><span>Conflicts may also arise because portfolio decisions regarding a Fund may benefit other accounts managed by BlackRock. For </span><span>example, the sale of a long position or establishment of a short position by a Fund may impair the price of the same security </span><span>sold short by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its other accounts or funds, and the purchase of a security or covering of a </span><span>short position in a security by a Fund may increase the price of the same security held by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or </span><span>its other accounts or funds. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, certain Funds may invest their assets in </span><span>other funds advised by BlackRock, including funds that are managed by one or more of the same portfolio managers, which </span><span>could result in conflicts of interest relating to asset allocation, timing of Fund purchases and sales, and increased </span><span>remuneration and profitability for BlackRock, and/or its personnel, including portfolio managers.</span></div> <div><span>In certain circumstances, BlackRock, on behalf of the Funds, may seek to buy from or sell securities to another fund or </span><span>account advised by BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is not required to) effect purchases and sales between BlackRock clients </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>cross trades</span><span>”</span><span>), including the Funds, if BlackRock believes such transactions are appropriate based on each party's </span><span>investment objectives and guidelines, subject to applicable law and regulation. There may be potential conflicts of interest or </span><span>regulatory issues relating to these transactions which could limit BlackRock’s decision to engage in these transactions for the </span><span>Funds. BlackRock may have a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities to the parties in such </span><span>transactions. On any occasion when a Fund participates in a cross trade, BlackRock will comply with procedures adopted </span><span>under applicable rules and SEC guidance.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock and its clients may pursue or enforce rights with respect to an issuer in which a Fund has invested, and those </span><span>activities may have an adverse effect on the Fund. As a result, prices, availability, liquidity and terms of a Fund's investments </span><span>may be negatively impacted by the activities of BlackRock or its clients, and transactions for the Fund may be impaired or </span><span>effected at prices or terms that may be less favorable than would otherwise have been the case.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>76</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>The results of a Fund’s investment activities may differ significantly from the results achieved by BlackRock for its proprietary </span><span>accounts or other accounts (including investment companies or collective investment vehicles) which it manages or advises. </span><span>It is possible that one or more accounts managed or advised by BlackRock and such other accounts will achieve investment </span><span>results that are substantially more or less favorable than the results achieved by a Fund. Moreover, it is possible that a Fund </span><span>will sustain losses during periods in which one or more proprietary or other accounts managed or advised by BlackRock </span><span>achieve significant profits. The opposite result is also possible.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>From time to time, a Fund may be restricted from purchasing or selling securities, or from engaging in other investment </span><span>activities because of regulatory, legal or contractual requirements applicable to BlackRock or other accounts managed or </span><span>advised by BlackRock, and/or the internal policies of BlackRock designed to comply with such requirements. As a result, </span><span>there may be periods, for example, when BlackRock will not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions in certain </span><span>securities or instruments with respect to which BlackRock is performing services or when position limits have been reached. </span><span>For example, the investment activities of BlackRock for its proprietary accounts and accounts under its management may </span><span>limit the investment opportunities for a Fund in certain emerging and other markets in which limitations are imposed upon </span><span>the amount of investment, in the aggregate or in individual issuers, by affiliated foreign investors.</span></div> <div><span>In connection with its management of a Fund, BlackRock may have access to certain fundamental analysis and proprietary </span><span>technical models developed by BlackRock. BlackRock will not be under any obligation, however, to effect transactions on </span><span>behalf of a Fund in accordance with such analysis and models. In addition, BlackRock will not have any obligation to make </span><span>available any information regarding its proprietary activities or strategies, or the activities or strategies used for other </span><span>accounts managed by them, for the benefit of the management of a Fund and it is not anticipated that BlackRock will have </span><span>access to such information for the purpose of managing the Fund. The proprietary activities or portfolio strategies of </span><span>BlackRock, or the activities or strategies used for accounts managed by BlackRock or other client accounts could conflict </span><span>with the transactions and strategies employed by BlackRock in managing a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>The Funds may be included in investment models developed by BlackRock for use by clients and financial advisors. To the </span><span>extent clients invest in these investment models and increase the assets under management of the Funds, the investment </span><span>management fee amounts paid by the Funds to BlackRock may also increase. The price, availability and liquidity of a Fund </span><span>may be impacted by purchases and sales of the Fund by model-driven investment portfolios, as well as by BlackRock itself </span><span>and by its advisory clients.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, certain principals and certain employees of a Fund’s investment adviser are also principals or employees of other </span><span>business units or entities within BlackRock. As a result, these principals and employees may have obligations to such other </span><span>business units or entities or their clients and such obligations to other business units or entities or their clients may be a </span><span>consideration of which investors in a Fund should be aware.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may enter into transactions and invest in securities, instruments and currencies on behalf of a Fund in which </span><span>clients of BlackRock or, to the extent permitted by the SEC and applicable law, BlackRock serves as the counterparty, principal </span><span>or issuer. In such cases, such party's interests in the transaction will be adverse to the interests of the Fund, and such party </span><span>may have no incentive to assure that the Fund obtains the best possible prices or terms in connection with the transactions. </span><span>In addition, the purchase, holding and sale of such investments by a Fund may enhance the profitability of BlackRock.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may also create, write or issue derivatives for clients based on the underlying securities, currencies or instruments </span><span>in which a Fund may invest or on the performance of the Fund. An entity in which BlackRock has a significant minority </span><span>interest will create, write or issue options which may be based on the performance of certain Funds. BlackRock has the right </span><span>to receive a portion of the gross revenue earned by such entity. Options writing by such entity on a Fund could potentially </span><span>lead to increased purchase activity with respect to the Fund and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock has entered into an arrangement with Markit Indices Limited, the index provider for underlying fixed-income </span><span>indexes used by certain iShares funds, related to derivative fixed-income products that are based on such iShares funds. </span><span>BlackRock may receive certain payments for licensing intellectual property belonging to BlackRock and for facilitating the </span><span>provision of data in connection with such derivative products, which may include payments based on the trading volumes of, </span><span>or revenues generated by, the derivative products. However, BlackRock will not receive any such payments on those derivative </span><span>products utilized by the Funds or other BlackRock funds or accounts. Other funds and accounts managed by BlackRock may </span><span>from time to time transact in such derivative products, which could contribute to the viability or success of such derivative </span><span>products by making them more appealing to funds and accounts managed by third parties, and in turn lead to increased </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>77</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>payments to BlackRock. Trading activity in such derivative products could also potentially lead to increased purchase activity </span><span>with respect to these iShares funds and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</span></div> <div><span>A Fund may, subject to applicable law, purchase investments that are the subject of an underwriting or other distribution by </span><span>BlackRock and may also enter into transactions with other clients of BlackRock where such other clients have interests </span><span>adverse to those of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>At times, these activities may cause business units or entities within BlackRock to give advice to clients that may cause these </span><span>clients to take actions adverse to the interests of a Fund. To the extent such transactions are permitted, a Fund will deal with </span><span>BlackRock on an arm’s-length basis.</span></div> <div><span>To the extent authorized by applicable law, BlackRock may act as broker, dealer, agent, lender or adviser or in other </span><span>commercial capacities for a Fund. It is anticipated that the commissions, mark-ups, mark-downs, financial advisory fees, </span><span>underwriting and placement fees, sales fees, financing and commitment fees, brokerage fees, other fees, compensation or </span><span>profits, rates, terms and conditions charged by BlackRock will be in its view commercially reasonable, although BlackRock, </span><span>including its sales personnel, will have an interest in obtaining fees and other amounts that are favorable to BlackRock and </span><span>such sales personnel, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. Index based funds may use an index provider that is </span><span>affiliated with another service provider of a Fund or BlackRock that acts as a broker, dealer, agent, lender or in other </span><span>commercial capacities for a Fund or BlackRock.</span></div> <div><span>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock (and its personnel and other distributors) will be entitled to retain fees and other </span><span>amounts that they receive in connection with their service to the Funds as broker, dealer, agent, lender, adviser or in other </span><span>commercial capacities. No accounting to the Funds or their shareholders will be required, and no fees or other compensation </span><span>payable by the Funds or their shareholders will be reduced by reason of receipt by BlackRock of any such fees or other </span><span>amounts.</span></div> <div><span>When BlackRock acts as broker, dealer, agent, adviser or in other commercial capacities in relation to the Funds, BlackRock </span><span>may take commercial steps in its own interests, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. A Fund will be required to </span><span>establish business relationships with its counterparties based on the Fund's own credit standing. BlackRock will not have any </span><span>obligation to allow its credit to be used in connection with a Fund's establishment of its business relationships, nor is it </span><span>expected that the Fund's counterparties will rely on the credit of BlackRock in evaluating the Fund's creditworthiness.</span></div> <div><span>BTC, an affiliate of BFA pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, acts as securities lending agent to, and receives a share of securities </span><span>lending revenues from, the Funds. BlackRock will also receive compensation for managing the reinvestment of the cash </span><span>collateral from securities lending. There are potential conflicts of interests in managing a securities lending program, </span><span>including but not limited to: (i) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to increase or decrease the </span><span>amount of securities on loan or to lend particular securities in order to generate additional risk-adjusted revenue for </span><span>BlackRock and its affiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to allocate loans to clients </span><span>that would provide more revenue to BlackRock. As described further below, BlackRock seeks to mitigate this conflict by </span><span>providing its securities lending clients with equal lending opportunities over time in order to approximate </span><span>pro rata </span><span>allocation. </span></div> <div><span>As part of its securities lending program, BlackRock indemnifies the Funds and certain other clients and/or funds against a </span><span>shortfall in collateral in the event of borrower default. On a regular basis, BlackRock calculates the potential dollar exposure of </span><span>collateral shortfall resulting from a borrower default (</span><span>“</span><span>shortfall risk</span><span>”</span><span>) in the securities lending program. BlackRock establishes </span><span>program-wide borrower limits (</span><span>“</span><span>credit limits</span><span>”</span><span>) to actively manage borrower-specific credit exposure. BlackRock oversees the </span><span>risk model that calculates projected collateral shortfall values using loan-level factors such as loan and collateral type and </span><span>market value as well as specific borrower credit characteristics. When necessary, BlackRock may adjust securities lending </span><span>program attributes by restricting eligible collateral or reducing borrower credit limits. As a result, the management of </span><span>program-wide exposure as well as BlackRock-specific indemnification exposure may affect the amount of securities lending </span><span>activity BlackRock may conduct at any given point in time by reducing the volume of lending opportunities for certain loans </span><span>(including by asset type, collateral type and/or revenue profile).</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock uses a predetermined systematic process in order to approximate </span><span>pro rata</span><span> allocation over time. In order to allocate </span><span>a loan to a portfolio: (i) BlackRock as a whole must have sufficient lending capacity pursuant to the various program limits </span><span>(</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> indemnification exposure limit and borrower credit limits); (ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset at the time a </span><span>loan opportunity arrives; and (iii) the lending portfolio must also have enough inventory, either on its own or when </span><span>aggregated with other portfolios into one single market delivery, to satisfy the loan request. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>78</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>provide equal lending opportunities for all portfolios, independent of whether BlackRock indemnifies the portfolio. Equal </span><span>opportunities for lending portfolios does not guarantee equal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-term outcomes for </span><span>individual clients may vary due to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on different securities, and the overall limits imposed by </span><span>the firm.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may decline to make a securities loan on behalf of a Fund, discontinue lending on behalf of a Fund or terminate a </span><span>securities loan on behalf of a Fund for any reason, including but not limited to regulatory requirements and/or market rules, </span><span>liquidity considerations, or credit considerations, which may impact Funds by reducing or eliminating the volume of lending </span><span>opportunities for certain types of loans, loans in particular markets, loans of particular securities or types of securities, or for </span><span>loans overall.</span></div> <div><span>Purchases and sales of securities and other assets for a Fund may be bunched or aggregated with orders for other BlackRock </span><span>client accounts, including with accounts that pay different transaction costs solely due to the fact that they have different </span><span>research payment arrangements. BlackRock, however, is not required to bunch or aggregate orders if portfolio management </span><span>decisions for different accounts are made separately, or if they determine that bunching or aggregating is not practicable or </span><span>required, or in cases involving client direction.</span></div> <div><span>Prevailing trading activity frequently may make impossible the receipt of the same price or execution on the entire volume of </span><span>securities purchased or sold. When this occurs, the various prices may be averaged, and the Funds will be charged or </span><span>credited with the average price. Thus, the effect of the aggregation may operate on some occasions to the disadvantage of </span><span>the Funds. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Funds will not be charged the same commission or commission </span><span>equivalent rates in connection with a bunched or aggregated order.</span></div> <div><span>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock may select brokers that furnish BlackRock, the Funds, other BlackRock client accounts or </span><span>personnel, directly or through correspondent relationships, with research or other appropriate services which provide, in </span><span>BlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to BlackRock in the investment decision-making process (including with respect to </span><span>futures, fixed-price offerings and OTC transactions). Such research or other services may include, to the extent permitted by </span><span>law, research reports on companies, industries and securities; economic and financial data; financial publications; proxy </span><span>analysis; trade industry seminars; computer data bases; research-oriented software and other services and products. </span><span>Research or other services obtained in this manner may be used in servicing any or all of the Funds and other BlackRock </span><span>client accounts, including in connection with BlackRock client accounts other than those that pay commissions to the broker </span><span>relating to the research or other service arrangements. Such products and services may disproportionately benefit other </span><span>BlackRock client accounts relative to the Funds based on the amount of brokerage commissions paid by the Funds and such </span><span>other BlackRock client accounts. For example, research or other services that are paid for through one client's commissions </span><span>may not be used in managing that client's account. In addition, other BlackRock client accounts may receive the benefit, </span><span>including disproportionate benefits, of economies of scale or price discounts in connection with products and services that </span><span>may be provided to the Funds and to such other BlackRock client accounts. To the extent that BlackRock uses soft dollars, it </span><span>will not have to pay for those products and services itself.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock does not currently enter into arrangements to use the Funds' assets for, or participate in, soft dollars, although </span><span>BlackRock may receive research that is bundled with the trade execution, clearing, and/or settlement services provided by a </span><span>particular broker-dealer. To the extent that BlackRock receives research on this basis, many of the same conflicts related to </span><span>traditional soft dollars may exist. For example, the research effectively will be paid by client commissions that also will be </span><span>used to pay for the execution, clearing, and settlement services provided by the broker-dealer and will not be paid by </span><span>BlackRock. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may endeavor to execute trades through brokers who, pursuant to </span><span>such arrangements, provide research or other services in order to ensure the continued receipt of research or other services </span><span>BlackRock believes are useful in its investment decision-making process. BlackRock may from time to time choose not to </span><span>engage in the above described arrangements to varying degrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may also </span><span>enter into commission sharing arrangements under which BlackRock may execute transactions through a broker-dealer, and </span><span>request that the broker-dealer allocate a portion of the commissions or commission credits to another firm that provides </span><span>research to BlackRock. To the extent that BlackRock engages in commission sharing arrangements, many of the same </span><span>conflicts related to traditional soft dollars may exist.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may utilize certain electronic crossing networks (</span><span>“</span><span>ECNs</span><span>”</span><span>) (including, without limitation, ECNs in which BlackRock </span><span>has an investment or other interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law) in executing client</span><span> </span><span>securities transactions for </span><span>certain types of securities. These ECNs may charge fees for their services, including access fees and transaction fees. The </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>79</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>transaction fees, which are similar to commissions or markups/markdowns, will generally be charged to clients and, like </span><span>commissions and markups/markdowns, would generally be included in the cost of the securities purchased. Access fees </span><span>may be paid by BlackRock even though incurred in connection with executing transactions on behalf of clients, including the </span><span>Funds. In certain circumstances, ECNs may offer volume discounts that will reduce the access fees typically paid by </span><span>BlackRock. BlackRock will only utilize ECNs consistent with its obligation to seek to obtain best execution in client </span><span>transactions.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock owns a minority interest in, and is a member of, Members Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>MEMX</span><span>”</span><span>), a newly created U.S. stock </span><span>exchange. Transactions for a Fund may be executed on MEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue </span><span>for execution of orders placed by BlackRock traders on behalf of such Funds. In addition, transactions in Fund shares may be </span><span>executed on MEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue for the execution of such orders.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock has adopted policies and procedures designed to prevent conflicts of interest from influencing proxy voting </span><span>decisions that it makes on behalf of advisory clients, including the Funds, and to help ensure that such decisions are made in </span><span>accordance with BlackRock's fiduciary obligations to its clients. Nevertheless, notwithstanding such proxy voting policies and </span><span>procedures, actual proxy voting decisions of BlackRock may have the effect of favoring the interests of other clients or </span><span>businesses of other divisions or units of BlackRock, provided that BlackRock believes such voting decisions to be in </span><span>accordance with its fiduciary obligations. For a more detailed discussion of these policies and procedures, see the </span><span>Proxy </span><span>Voting Policy</span><span> section of this SAI.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>It is also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients (including other funds and separately </span><span>managed accounts) may, subject to compliance with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of a Fund. Increasing a Fund’s </span><span>assets may enhance liquidity, investment flexibility and diversification and may contribute to economies of scale that tend to </span><span>reduce the Fund's expense ratio. BlackRock reserves the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to sell into the </span><span>market or redeem in Creation Units through an Authorized Participant at any time some or all of the shares of a Fund </span><span>acquired for its own accounts or the account of a BlackRock advisory client. A large sale or redemption of shares of a Fund by </span><span>BlackRock itself or a BlackRock advisory client could significantly reduce the asset size of the Fund, which might have an </span><span>adverse effect on the Fund's liquidity, investment flexibility, portfolio diversification, expense ratio or ability to comply with the </span><span>listing requirements for the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>It is possible that a Fund may invest in securities of, or engage in transactions with, companies in which BlackRock has </span><span>significant debt or equity investments or other interests. A Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by </span><span>entities for which BlackRock provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the </span><span>sale of such issuances. In making investment decisions for a Fund, BlackRock is not permitted to obtain or use material non-public</span><span> information acquired by any unit of BlackRock in the course of these activities. In addition, from time to time, the </span><span>activities of BlackRock may limit a Fund's flexibility in purchases and sales of securities. As indicated below, BlackRock may </span><span>engage in transactions with companies in which BlackRock-advised funds or other clients of BlackRock have an investment.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock, its personnel and other financial service providers may have interests in promoting sales of the Funds. With </span><span>respect to BlackRock and its personnel, the remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of the Funds or </span><span>other products may be greater than remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of certain funds or other </span><span>products that might be provided or offered. BlackRock and its sales personnel may directly or indirectly receive a portion of </span><span>the fees and commissions charged to the Funds or their shareholders. BlackRock and its advisory or other personnel may </span><span>also benefit from increased amounts of assets under management. Fees and commissions may also be higher than for other </span><span>products or services, and the remuneration and profitability to BlackRock and such personnel resulting from transactions on </span><span>behalf of or management of the Funds may be greater than the remuneration and profitability resulting from other funds or </span><span>products.</span></div> <div><span>Third parties, including service providers to BlackRock or a Fund, may sponsor events (including, but not limited to, </span><span>marketing and promotional activities and presentations, educational training programs and conferences) for registered </span><span>representatives, other professionals and individual investors. There is a potential conflict of interest as such sponsorships </span><span>may defray the costs of such activities to BlackRock, and may provide an incentive to BlackRock to retain such third parties to </span><span>provide services to a Fund.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may provide valuation assistance to certain clients with respect to certain securities or other investments and the </span><span>valuation recommendations made for such clients' accounts may differ from the valuations for the same securities or </span><span>investments assigned by a Fund's pricing vendors, especially if such valuations are based on broker-dealer quotes or other </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>80</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>data sources unavailable to the Fund's pricing vendors. While BlackRock will generally communicate its valuation information </span><span>or determinations to a Fund's pricing vendors and/or fund accountants, there may be instances where the Fund's pricing </span><span>vendors or fund accountants assign a different valuation to a security or other investment than the valuation for such </span><span>security or investment determined or recommended by BlackRock.</span></div> <div><span>As disclosed in more detail in the </span><span>Determination of Net Asset Value</span><span> section in this SAI, when market quotations are not </span><span>readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, each Fund’s investments are valued at fair value by BFA. BFA has been </span><span>designated as each Fund’s valuation designee pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act and acts through </span><span>BFA’s Rule 2a-5 Committee (the </span><span>“</span><span>2a-5 Committee</span><span>”</span><span>), with assistance from other BFA pricing committees and in accordance </span><span>with BFA’s policies and procedures (the </span><span>“</span><span>Valuation Procedures</span><span>”</span><span>). When determining a </span><span>“</span><span>fair value price,</span><span>”</span><span> the 2a-5 Committee </span><span>seeks to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or liability in </span><span>an arm’s-length transaction. The price generally may not be determined based on what a Fund might reasonably expect to </span><span>receive for selling an asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. While fair value </span><span>determinations will be based upon all available factors that BFA deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be </span><span>based on analytical values determined by BFA using proprietary or third-party valuation models, fair value represents only a </span><span>good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in </span><span>retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair </span><span>values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a </span><span>holding or holdings are valued by the 2a-5 Committee at fair value, may have the effect of diluting or increasing the economic </span><span>interest of existing shareholders and may affect the amount of revenue received by BFA with respect to services for which it </span><span>receives an asset-based fee.</span></div> <div><span>To the extent permitted by applicable law, a Fund may invest all or some of its short-term cash investments in any money </span><span>market fund or similarly-managed private fund advised or managed by BlackRock. In connection with any such investments, </span><span>a Fund, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, may pay its share of expenses of a money market fund or other similarly-managed</span><span> private fund in which it invests, which may result in a Fund bearing some additional expenses.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock and its directors, officers and employees, may buy and sell securities or other investments for their own accounts </span><span>and may have conflicts of interest with respect to investments made on behalf of a Fund. As a result of differing trading and </span><span>investment strategies or constraints, positions may be taken by directors, officers and employees that are the same, different </span><span>from or made at different times than positions taken for a Fund. To lessen the possibility that a Fund will be adversely </span><span>affected by this personal trading, each Fund, BFA and BlackRock have each adopted a code of ethics in compliance with </span><span>Section 17(j) of the 1940 Act that restricts securities trading in the personal accounts of investment professionals and others </span><span>who normally come into possession of information regarding a Fund's portfolio transactions. Each code of ethics is available </span><span>by contacting BlackRock at the telephone number on the back cover of each Fund’s Prospectus or by accessing the EDGAR </span><span>Database on the SEC's Internet site at http://www.sec.gov, and copies may be obtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by </span><span>e-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock will not purchase securities or other property from, or sell securities or other property to, a Fund, except that a </span><span>Fund may in accordance with rules or guidance adopted under the 1940 Act engage in transactions with another Fund or </span><span>accounts that are affiliated with a Fund as a result of common officers, directors, or investment advisers or pursuant to </span><span>exemptive orders granted to the Funds and/or BlackRock by the SEC. These transactions would be effected in circumstances </span><span>in which BlackRock determined that it would be appropriate for a Fund to purchase and another client of BlackRock to sell, or </span><span>a Fund to sell and another client of BlackRock to purchase, the same security or instrument on the same day. From time to </span><span>time, the activities of a Fund may be restricted because of regulatory requirements applicable to BlackRock and/or </span><span>BlackRock's internal policies designed to comply with, limit the applicability of, or otherwise relate to such requirements. A </span><span>client not advised by BlackRock would not be subject to some of those considerations. There may be periods when </span><span>BlackRock may not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions, or may otherwise restrict or limit its advice in certain </span><span>securities or instruments issued by or related to companies for which BlackRock is performing advisory or other services or </span><span>has proprietary positions. For example, when BlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or risk management services for a </span><span>company, BlackRock may be prohibited from or limited in purchasing or selling securities of that company on behalf of a </span><span>Fund, particularly where such services result in BlackRock obtaining material non-public information about the company </span><span>(</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, in connection with participation in a creditors’ committee). Similar situations could arise if personnel of BlackRock serve </span><span>as directors of companies the securities of which a Fund wishes to purchase or sell. However, if permitted by applicable law, </span><span>and where consistent with BlackRock’s policies and procedures (including the necessary implementation of appropriate </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>81</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>information barriers), the Funds may purchase securities or instruments that are issued by such companies, are the subject </span><span>of an advisory or risk management assignment by BlackRock, or where personnel of BlackRock are directors or officers of the </span><span>issuer.</span></div> <div><span>The investment activities of BlackRock for its proprietary accounts and for client accounts may also limit the investment </span><span>strategies and rights of the Funds. For example, in certain circumstances where the Funds invest in securities issued by </span><span>companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or international markets, or are subject to </span><span>corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or invest in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits </span><span>on the aggregate amount invested by BlackRock for their proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Funds) </span><span>that may not be exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if exceeded, may cause </span><span>BlackRock, the Funds or other client accounts to suffer disadvantages or business restrictions.</span></div> <div><span>If certain aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either through the actions of BlackRock or a Fund or as a result of </span><span>third-party transactions, the ability of BlackRock, on behalf of clients (including the Funds), to purchase or dispose of </span><span>investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. As </span><span>a result, BlackRock, on behalf of its clients (including the Funds), may limit purchases, sell existing investments, or otherwise </span><span>restrict, forgo or limit the exercise of rights (including transferring, outsourcing or limiting voting rights or forgoing the right </span><span>to receive dividends) when BlackRock, in its sole discretion, deems it appropriate in light of potential regulatory or other </span><span>restrictions on ownership or other consequences resulting from reaching investment thresholds.</span></div> <div><span>In those circumstances where ownership thresholds or limitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks to allocate limited </span><span>investment opportunities equitably among clients (including the Funds), taking into consideration benchmark weight and </span><span>investment strategy. BlackRock has adopted certain controls designed to prevent the occurrence of a breach of any </span><span>applicable ownership threshold or limits, including, for example, when ownership in certain securities nears an applicable </span><span>threshold, BlackRock may remove such securities from the list of Deposit Securities to be delivered to the Fund in connection </span><span>with purchases of Creation Units of such Fund and may limit purchases in such securities to the issuer's weighting in the </span><span>applicable benchmark used by BlackRock to manage such Fund. If client (including Fund) holdings of an issuer exceed an </span><span>applicable threshold and BlackRock is unable to obtain relief to enable the continued holding of such investments, it may be </span><span>necessary to sell down these positions to meet the applicable limitations. In these cases, benchmark overweight positions </span><span>will be sold prior to benchmark positions being reduced to meet applicable limitations.</span></div> <div><span>In addition to the foregoing, other ownership thresholds may trigger reporting requirements to governmental and regulatory </span><span>authorities, and such reports may entail the disclosure of the identity of a client or BlackRock’s intended strategy with respect </span><span>to such security or asset.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may not serve as an Authorized Participant in the creation and redemption of iShares ETFs.</span></div> <div><span>Under an ETF Services Agreement, certain Funds have retained BRIL, an Affiliate of BFA, to perform certain order processing, </span><span>Authorized Participant communications, and related services in connection with the issuance and redemption of Creation </span><span>Units of the Funds (</span><span>“</span><span>ETF Services</span><span>”</span><span>). BRIL will retain a portion of the standard transaction fee received from Authorized </span><span>Participants on each creation or redemption order from the Authorized Participant for the ETF Services provided. BlackRock </span><span>collaborated with, and received payment from, Citibank, N.A. (</span><span>“</span><span>Citibank</span><span>”</span><span>) on the design and development of the ETF Services </span><span>platform. Citibank may have, or from time to time may develop, additional relationships with BlackRock or funds managed by </span><span>BFA and its affiliates.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may maintain securities indices. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, the Funds may seek to license and use </span><span>such indices as part of their investment strategy. Index based funds that seek to track the performance of securities indices </span><span>also may use the name of the index or index provider in the fund name. Index providers, including BlackRock (to the extent </span><span>permitted by applicable law), may be paid licensing fees for use of their index or index name. BlackRock may benefit from the </span><span>Funds using BlackRock indices by creating increasing acceptance in the marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is not </span><span>obligated to license its indices to a Fund and the Funds are under no obligation to use BlackRock indices. Any Fund that </span><span>enters into a license for a BlackRock index cannot be assured that the terms of any index licensing agreement with BlackRock </span><span>will be as favorable as those terms offered to other licensees.</span></div> <div><span>The custody arrangement described in </span><span>“</span><span>Investment Advisory, Administrative and Distribution Services</span><span>”</span><span> may lead to potential </span><span>conflicts of interest with BlackRock where BlackRock has agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse ordinary operating expenses </span><span>in order to cap expenses of the Funds (or where BlackRock charges a unitary management fee). This is because the custody </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>82</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>arrangements with certain Funds' custodian may have the effect of reducing custody fees when the Funds leave cash </span><span>balances uninvested. This could be viewed as having the potential to provide BlackRock an incentive to keep high positive </span><span>cash balances for Funds in order to offset fund custody fees that BlackRock might otherwise reimburse or pay. However, </span><span>BlackRock’s portfolio managers do not intentionally keep uninvested balances high, but rather make investment decisions </span><span>that they anticipate will be beneficial to fund performance. For funds without a unitary management fee, when a fund’s </span><span>actual operating expense ratio exceeds a stated cap, a reduction in custody fees reduces the amount of waivers and/or </span><span>reimbursements BlackRock would be required to make to the fund.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock may enter into contractual arrangements with third-party service providers to a Fund (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, custodians, </span><span>administrators and index providers) pursuant to which BlackRock receives fee discounts or concessions in recognition of </span><span>BlackRock’s overall relationship with such service providers. BlackRock may also enter into contractual arrangements with </span><span>such service providers pursuant to which BlackRock incurs additional costs if the service provider’s services are terminated </span><span>with respect to a Fund. To the extent that BlackRock is responsible for paying these service providers out of its management </span><span>fee, the benefits of any such fee discounts or concessions, or any additional costs, may accrue, in whole or in part, to </span><span>BlackRock, which could result in conflicts of interest relating to the use or termination of service providers to a Fund.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock owns or has an ownership interest in certain trading, portfolio management, operations and/or information </span><span>systems used by Fund service providers. These systems are, or will be, used by a Fund service provider in connection with the </span><span>provision of services to accounts managed by BlackRock and funds managed and sponsored by BlackRock, including the </span><span>Funds, that engage the service provider (typically the custodian). A Fund’s service provider remunerates BlackRock for the </span><span>use of the systems. A Fund service provider’s payments to BlackRock for the use of these systems may enhance the </span><span>profitability of BlackRock.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock’s receipt of fees from a service provider in connection with the use of systems provided by BlackRock may create </span><span>an incentive for BlackRock to recommend that a Fund enter into or renew an arrangement with the service provider.</span></div> <div><span>In recognition of a BlackRock client’s overall relationship with BlackRock, BlackRock may offer special pricing arrangements </span><span>for certain services provided by BlackRock. Any such special pricing arrangements will not apply to the client’s investment in </span><span>a Fund.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Present and future activities of BlackRock (including BFA), its directors, officers and employees, in addition to those described </span><span>in this section, may give rise to additional conflicts of interest.</span></div> <div><span>Investment Advisory, Administrative and </span><span>Distribution Services</span></div> <div><span>Investment Adviser. </span><span> </span><span>BFA serves as investment adviser to each Fund pursuant to an investment advisory agreement between </span><span>the Trust, on behalf of each Fund, and BFA. BFA is a California corporation indirectly owned by BlackRock, Inc. and is </span><span>registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Under the investment advisory </span><span>agreement, BFA, subject to the supervision of the Board and in conformity with the stated investment policies of each Fund, </span><span>manages and administers the Trust and the investment of each Fund’s assets. BFA is responsible for placing purchase and </span><span>sale orders and providing continuous supervision of the investment portfolio of each Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Pursuant to the investment advisory agreement, BFA may, from time to time, in its sole discretion and to the extent permitted </span><span>by applicable law, appoint one or more sub-advisers, including, without limitation, affiliates of BFA, to perform investment </span><span>advisory or other services with respect to the Funds. In addition, BFA may delegate certain of its investment advisory </span><span>functions under the investment advisory agreement to one or more of its affiliates to the extent permitted by applicable law. </span><span>BFA may terminate any or all sub-advisers or such delegation arrangements in its sole discretion upon appropriate notice at </span><span>any time to the extent permitted by applicable law.</span></div> <div><span>BFA is responsible, under the investment advisory agreement, for substantially all expenses of the Funds, including the cost </span><span>of transfer agency, custody, fund administration, legal, audit and other services. BFA is not responsible for, and the Funds will </span><span>bear, the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of </span><span>portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or </span><span>expenses, and litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses (as determined by a majority of the Independent Trustees).</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>83</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

The management fee for all Funds is set forth in the table that follows the description of breakpoints.</span></div> <div><span>For its investment advisory services to the iShares MSCI Ireland ETF, iShares MSCI New Zealand ETF and iShares MSCI United </span><span>Kingdom ETF, BFA is paid a management fee from each Fund corresponding to the Fund’s allocable portion of the aggregate </span><span>management fee calculated based on the aggregate average daily net assets of the following iShares funds: iShares MSCI </span><span>Australia ETF, iShares MSCI Austria ETF, iShares MSCI Belgium ETF, iShares MSCI Canada ETF, iShares MSCI Eurozone ETF, </span><span>iShares MSCI France ETF, iShares MSCI Germany ETF, iShares MSCI Hong Kong ETF, iShares MSCI Ireland ETF, iShares MSCI </span><span>Italy ETF, iShares MSCI Japan ETF, iShares MSCI Japan Small-Cap ETF, iShares MSCI Malaysia ETF, iShares MSCI Mexico ETF, </span><span>iShares MSCI Netherlands ETF, iShares MSCI New Zealand ETF, iShares MSCI Singapore ETF, iShares MSCI Spain ETF, iShares </span><span>MSCI Sweden ETF, iShares MSCI Switzerland ETF and iShares MSCI United Kingdom ETF. The aggregate management fee is </span><span>calculated as follows: 0.59% per annum of the aggregate net assets less than or equal to $7.0 billion, plus 0.54% per annum </span><span>of the aggregate net assets over $7.0 billion, up to and including $11.0 billion, plus 0.49% per annum of the aggregate net </span><span>assets over $11.0 billion, up to and including $24.0 billion, plus 0.44% per annum of the aggregate net assets over $24.0 </span><span>billion, up to and including $48.0 billion, plus 0.40% per annum of the aggregate net assets over $48.0 billion, up to and </span><span>including $72.0 billion, plus 0.36% per annum of the aggregate net assets over $72.0 billion, up to and including $96.0 </span><span>billion, plus 0.32% per annum of the aggregate net assets in excess of $96.0 billion. </span></div> <div><span>For its investment advisory services to the iShares MSCI Indonesia ETF, iShares MSCI Philippines ETF and iShares MSCI </span><span>Poland ETF, BFA is paid a management fee from such Funds corresponding to each Fund’s allocable portion of an aggregate </span><span>management fee calculated based on the aggregate average daily net assets of the following iShares Funds: iShares MSCI </span><span>Brazil ETF, iShares MSCI Brazil Small-Cap ETF, iShares MSCI Chile ETF, iShares MSCI China ETF, iShares MSCI China Small-Cap </span><span>ETF, iShares MSCI Indonesia ETF, iShares MSCI Israel ETF, iShares MSCI Peru and Global Exposure ETF, iShares MSCI </span><span>Philippines ETF, iShares MSCI Poland ETF, iShares MSCI Qatar ETF, iShares MSCI Russia ETF, iShares MSCI South Africa ETF, </span><span>iShares MSCI South Korea ETF, iShares MSCI Taiwan ETF, iShares MSCI Thailand ETF, iShares MSCI Turkey ETF and iShares </span><span>MSCI UAE ETF. The aggregate management fee is calculated as follows: 0.7400% per annum of the aggregate net assets less </span><span>than or equal to $2.0 billion, plus 0.6900% per annum of the aggregate net assets over $2.0 billion, up to and including $4.0 </span><span>billion, plus 0.6400% per annum of the aggregate net assets over $4.0 billion, up to and including $8.0 billion, plus 0.5700% </span><span>per annum of the aggregate net assets over $8.0 billion, up to and including $16.0 billion, plus 0.5100% per annum of the </span><span>aggregate net assets over $16.0 billion, up to and including $24.0 billion, plus 0.4800% per annum of the aggregate net </span><span>assets over $24.0 billion, up to and including $32.0 billion, plus 0.4500% per annum of the aggregate net assets over $32.0 </span><span>billion, up to and including $40.0 billion, plus 0.4275% per annum of the aggregate net assets in excess of $40.0 billion.</span></div> <div><span>BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses to reduce the Total Annual Fund Operating </span><span>Expenses (excluding Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any).

Compensation may include a variety of </span><span>components and may vary from year to year based on a number of factors. The principal components of compensation </span><span>include a base salary, a performance-based discretionary bonus, participation in various benefits programs and one or more </span><span>of the incentive compensation programs established by BlackRock, Inc.</span></div> <div><span>Each portfolio manager receives base compensation based on their position with the firm, as well as retirement and other </span><span>benefits offered to all BlackRock employees. Additionally, each portfolio manager receives discretionary incentive </span><span>compensation, determined based on several components, including: the performance of BlackRock, Inc., the performance of </span><span>the portfolio manager’s group within BlackRock, the performance of portfolios managed by the portfolio manager and the </span><span>team relative to the portfolios’ investment objectives (which in the case of index ETFs would be how closely the ETF tracks its </span><span>Underlying Index), and the individual’s performance and contribution to the overall performance of these portfolios and </span><span>BlackRock. Discretionary incentive compensation is paid in cash up to a certain threshold with the remaining portion </span><span>represented by deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock awards. In some cases, additional deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock may be </span><span>granted to certain key employees as part of a long-term incentive award to aid in retention, align interests with long-term </span><span>shareholders and motivate performance.</span></div> <div><span>As of August 31, 2022, the Portfolio Managers beneficially owned shares of the Funds, for which they are primarily </span><span>responsible for the day-to-day management, in the amounts reflected in the following tables:</span></div> <div><span> </span></div> <div> </div> <div>

In addition, BFA Entities make </span><span>payments to Intermediaries that make shares of the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products available to </span><span>their clients, develop new products that feature iShares, create educational content about the Fund, other iShares funds or </span><span>exchange-traded products that is featured on an Intermediary’s platform, or otherwise promote the Funds, other iShares </span><span>funds and exchange-traded products.

These financial incentives may cause the Intermediary to recommend the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded</span><span> products, or otherwise promote the Fund, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products over other investments. </span><span>The same conflicts of interest and financial incentives exist with respect to your salesperson or other investment professional </span><span>if he or she receives similar payments from his or her Intermediary firm.</span></div> <div><span>In addition to the payments described above, BFA Entities have developed proprietary tools, calculators and related </span><span>interactive or digital content that is made available through the www.BlackRock.com website at no additional cost to </span><span>Intermediaries.

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>As of March 1, 2013, BFA Entities have contractual arrangements to make payments (in addition to payments for Education </span><span>Costs or Publishing Costs) to one Intermediary, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC (</span><span>“</span><span>FBS</span><span>”</span><span>). Effective June 4, 2016, this </span><span>relationship was expanded to include National Financial Services, LLC (</span><span>“</span><span>NFS</span><span>”</span><span>), an affiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this special, </span><span>long-term and significant arrangement (the </span><span>“</span><span>Marketing Program</span><span>”</span><span>), FBS, NFS and certain of their affiliates (collectively </span><span>“</span><span>Fidelity</span><span>”</span><span>) have agreed, among other things, to actively promote iShares funds to customers, investment professionals and </span><span>other intermediaries and in advertising campaigns as the preferred exchange-traded product, to offer certain iShares funds in </span><span>certain Fidelity platforms and investment programs, in some cases at a waived or reduced commission rate or ticket charge, </span><span>and to provide marketing data to BFA Entities. BFA Entities have agreed to facilitate the Marketing Program by, among other </span><span>things, making certain payments to FBS and NFS for marketing and implementing certain brokerage and investment </span><span>programs. Upon termination of the arrangement, the BFA Entities will make additional payments to FBS and/or NFS based </span><span>upon a number of criteria, including the overall success of the Marketing Program and the level of services provided by FBS </span><span>and NFS during the wind-down period.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, BFA Entities may enter into other contractual arrangements with Intermediaries and certain other third parties </span><span>that the BFA Entities believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in iShares funds. Such agreements may </span><span>include payments by BFA Entities to such Intermediaries and third parties for data collection and provision, technology </span><span>support, platform enhancement, or educational content, co-marketing and cross-promotional efforts. Payments made </span><span>pursuant to such arrangements may vary in any year and may be different for different Intermediaries and third parties. In </span><span>certain cases, the payments to Intermediaries are subject to certain minimum payment levels or tiered payments. As of the </span><span>date of this SAI, the Intermediaries and other third parties receiving one or more types of the contractual payments described </span><span>above include (in addition to FBS and NFS): Advisor Credit Exchange, Avantax Investment Services, Inc., BNY Mellon Capital </span><span>Markets, LLC, BNY Mellon Performance &amp; Risk Analytics, LLC, Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Inc., Clearstream Fund Centre AG, </span><span>Commonwealth Equity Services, LLC, Dorsey Wright and Associates, LLC, E*Trade Securities LLC, Envestnet Asset </span><span>Management, Inc., LPL Financial LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC, </span><span>Northwestern Mutual Investment Services, LLC, Orion Portfolio Solutions, LLC, Pershing LLC, Public Holdings, Inc., Raymond </span><span>James Financial Services, Inc., Riskalyze, Inc., TD Ameritrade, Inc., UBS Financial Services Inc., Wells Fargo Clearing Services, </span><span>LLC and Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, LLC. Any additions, modifications, or deletions to Intermediaries and other </span><span>third parties listed above that have occurred since the date of this SAI are not included in the list.</span></div> <div><span>Further, BFA Entities make Education Costs and Publishing Costs payments to other Intermediaries that are not listed in the </span><span>immediately preceding paragraph. BFA Entities may determine to make such payments based on any number of metrics. For </span><span>example, BFA Entities may make payments at year-end or other intervals in a fixed amount, an amount based upon an </span><span>Intermediary’s services at defined levels or an amount based on the Intermediary’s net sales of one or more iShares funds in a </span><span>year or other period, any of which arrangements may include an agreed-upon minimum or maximum payment, or any </span><span>combination of the foregoing. As of the date of this SAI, BFA anticipates that the payments paid by BFA Entities in connection </span><span>with the Funds, iShares funds and exchange-traded products in general will be immaterial to BFA Entities in the aggregate for </span><span>the next year. </span><span>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such </span><span>payments or financial incentives his or her Intermediary firm may receive. Any payments made, or financial incentives </span><span>offered, by the BFA Entities to an Intermediary may create the incentive for the Intermediary to encourage customers to </span><span>buy shares of the Funds, other iShares funds or other exchange-traded products.</span></div> <div><span>The Funds may participate in certain market maker incentive programs of a national securities exchange in which an affiliate </span><span>of the Funds would pay a fee to the exchange used for the purpose of incentivizing one or more market makers in the </span><span>securities of a Fund to enhance the liquidity and quality of the secondary market of securities of a Fund. The fee would then </span><span>be credited by the exchange to one or more market makers that meet or exceed liquidity and market quality standards with </span><span>respect to the securities of a Fund. Each market maker incentive program is subject to approval from the SEC. Any such fee </span><span>payments made to an exchange will be made by an affiliate of a Fund solely for the benefit of a Fund and will not be paid </span><span>from any Fund assets. Other funds managed by BFA may also participate in such programs.</span></div> <div><span>Determination of Net Asset Value</span></div> <div><span>Valuation of Shares. </span><span>The NAV for each Fund is generally calculated as of the close of regular trading hours on the New York </span><span>Stock Exchange (</span><span>“</span><span>NYSE</span><span>”</span><span>) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time) on each business day the NYSE is open.

However, under certain circumstances, other means of determining current market value may be used. If </span><span>an equity security is traded on more than one Exchange, the current market value of the security where it is primarily traded </span><span>generally will be used. In the event that there are no sales involving an equity security held by a Fund on a day on which a </span><span>Fund values such security, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BFA determines that such prior day’s price no longer </span><span>reflects the fair value of the security, in which case such asset would be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below).</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Options, Futures, Swaps and Other Derivatives. </span><span>Exchange-traded equity options (except those that are customized) for </span><span>which market quotations are readily available are valued at the mean of the last bid and ask prices as quoted on the </span><span>Exchange or the board of trade on which such options are traded. In the event that there is no mean price available for an </span><span>exchange traded equity option held by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values such option, the last bid (long positions) or </span><span>ask (short positions) price, if available, will be used as the value of such option. If no bid or ask price is available on a day on </span><span>which a Fund values such option, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BFA determines that such prior day’s price no </span><span>longer reflects the fair value of the option, in which case such option will be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below). </span><span>Customized exchange-traded equity options, as well as OTC derivatives, may be valued using a mathematical model which </span><span>may incorporate a number of market data factors. Financial futures contracts and options thereon, which are traded on </span><span>exchanges, are valued at their last sale price or settle price as of the close of such exchanges. Swap agreements and other </span><span>derivatives are generally valued daily based upon quotations from market makers or by a pricing service in accordance with </span><span>the Valuation Procedures.</span></div> <div><span>Underlying Funds. </span><span>Shares of underlying open-end funds (including money market funds) are valued at NAV. Shares of </span><span>underlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs will be valued at their most recent closing price.</span></div> <div><span>General Valuation Information. </span><span>Prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services, broker-dealers or market </span><span>makers to value a Fund’s securities and other assets and liabilities are based on information available at the time a Fund </span><span>values its assets and liabilities. In the event that a pricing service quotation is revised or updated subsequent to the day on </span><span>which a Fund valued such security, the revised pricing service quotation generally will be applied prospectively. Such </span><span>determination will be made considering pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding the revision.</span></div> <div><span>The price a Fund could receive upon the sale of any particular portfolio investment may differ from a Fund’s valuation of the </span><span>investment, particularly for assets that trade in thin or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair valuation methodology </span><span>or a price provided by an independent pricing service. As a result, the price received upon the sale of an investment may be </span><span>less than the value ascribed by a Fund, and a Fund could realize a greater than expected loss or lesser than expected gain </span><span>upon the sale of the investment. A Fund’s ability to value its investment may also be impacted by technological issues and/or </span><span>errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</span></div> <div><span>All cash, receivables and current payables are carried on a Fund’s books at their fair value.</span></div> <div><span>In the event that application of the methods of valuation discussed above result in a price for a security which is deemed not </span><span>to be representative of the fair market value of such security, the security will be valued by, under the direction of or in </span><span>accordance with a method approved by BFA, each Fund’s valuation designee, as reflecting fair value. All other assets and </span><span>liabilities (including securities for which market quotations are not readily available) held by a Fund (including restricted </span><span>securities) are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by BFA pursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any assets and </span><span>liabilities which are denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing market rates.</span></div> <div><span>Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate </span><span>a Fund’s NAV and the prices used in its Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between a Fund’s </span><span>performance and the performance of its Underlying Index.</span></div> <div><span>Fair Value.</span><span> When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BFA to be unreliable, a Fund’s investments are </span><span>valued at fair value (</span><span>“</span><span>Fair Value Assets</span><span>”</span><span>). Fair Value Assets are valued by BFA in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. </span><span>Pursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act, the Board of Trustees has designated BFA as the valuation </span><span>designee for the respective Funds for which it serves as investment adviser. BFA may reasonably conclude that a market </span><span>quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if, among other things, a security or other asset or liability does not have a </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>99</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>price source due to its complete lack of trading, if BFA believes a market quotation from a broker-dealer or other source is </span><span>unreliable (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, where it varies significantly from a recent trade, or no longer reflects the fair value of the security or other </span><span>asset or liability subsequent to the most recent market quotation), or where the security or other asset or liability is only </span><span>thinly traded or due to the occurrence of a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation. For this </span><span>purpose, a </span><span>“</span><span>significant event</span><span>”</span><span> is deemed to occur if BFA determines, in its reasonable business judgment, that an event has </span><span>occurred after the close of trading for an asset or liability but prior to or at the time of pricing a Fund’s assets or liabilities, is </span><span>likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or closing market price of one or more assets held by, or </span><span>liabilities of, a Fund. On any day the NYSE is open and a foreign market or the primary exchange on which a foreign asset or </span><span>liability is traded is closed, such asset or liability will be valued using the prior day’s price, provided that BFA is not aware of </span><span>any significant event or other information that would cause such price to no longer reflect the fair value of the asset or </span><span>liability, in which case such asset or liability would be treated as a Fair Value Asset.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>For certain foreign assets, a third-party vendor supplies evaluated, systematic fair value pricing based upon the movement of </span><span>a proprietary multi-factor model after the relevant foreign markets have closed. This systematic fair value pricing </span><span>methodology is designed to correlate the prices of foreign assets in one or more non-U.S. markets following the close of the </span><span>local markets to the prices that might have prevailed as of a Fund’s pricing time.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BFA’s Rule 2a-5 Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving methodologies by investment type and significant </span><span>inputs used in the fair valuation of Fund assets or liabilities. In addition, a Fund’s accounting agent assists BFA by periodically </span><span>endeavoring to confirm the prices it receives from all third-party pricing services, index providers and broker-dealers and </span><span>regularly evaluating the values assigned to the securities and other assets and liabilities of a Fund. The pricing of all Fair Value </span><span>Assets is subsequently reported to the Board or a committee thereof.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>When determining the price for a Fair Value Asset, BFA will seek to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect </span><span>to receive from the current sale of that asset or liability in an arm’s-length transaction on the date on which the asset or </span><span>liability is being valued, and does not seek to determine the price a Fund might reasonably expect to receive for selling an </span><span>asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. Fair value determinations will be based upon all </span><span>available factors that BFA deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be based on analytical values determined </span><span>by BFA using proprietary or third-party valuation models.</span></div> <div><span>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. When determining the fair value of an </span><span>investment, one or more fair value methodologies may be used (depending on certain factors, including the asset type). For </span><span>example, the investment may be initially priced based on the original cost of the investment or, alternatively, using proprietary </span><span>or third-party models that may rely upon one or more unobservable inputs. Prices of actual, executed or historical </span><span>transactions in the relevant investment (or comparable instruments) or, where appropriate, an appraisal by a third-party </span><span>experienced in the valuation of similar instruments, may also be used as a basis for establishing the fair value of an </span><span>investment.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could </span><span>have been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a </span><span>Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a holding or holdings are valued at fair value, may have the </span><span>effect of diluting or increasing the economic interest of existing shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund’s annual audited financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally </span><span>accepted in the United States of America (</span><span>“</span><span>US GAAP</span><span>”</span><span>), follow the requirements for valuation set forth in Financial </span><span>Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, </span><span>“</span><span>Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>ASC 820</span><span>”</span><span>), which defines and establishes a framework for measuring fair value under US GAAP and expands financial </span><span>statement disclosure requirements relating to fair value measurements.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Generally, ASC 820 and other accounting rules applicable to funds and various assets in which they invest are evolving. Such </span><span>changes may adversely affect a Fund. For example, the evolution of rules governing the determination of the fair market </span><span>value of assets or liabilities, to the extent such rules become more stringent, would tend to increase the cost and/or reduce </span><span>the availability of third-party determinations of fair market value. This may in turn increase the costs associated with selling </span><span>assets or affect their liquidity due to a Fund’s inability to obtain a third-party determination of fair market value.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>100</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Brokerage Transactions</span></div> <div><span>Subject to policies established by the Board, BFA is primarily responsible for the execution of a Fund’s portfolio transactions </span><span>and the allocation of brokerage. BFA does not execute transactions through any particular broker or dealer, but seeks to </span><span>obtain the best net results for the Funds, taking into account such factors as price (including the applicable brokerage </span><span>commission or dealer spread), size of order, difficulty of execution, operational facilities of the firm and the firm’s risk and skill </span><span>in positioning blocks of securities. While BFA generally seeks reasonable trade execution costs, a Fund does not necessarily </span><span>pay the lowest spread or commission available, and payment of the lowest commission or spread is not necessarily </span><span>consistent with obtaining the best price and execution in particular transactions. Subject to applicable legal requirements, </span><span>BFA may select a broker based partly upon brokerage or research services provided to BFA and its clients, including a Fund. In </span><span>return for such services, BFA may cause a Fund to pay a higher commission than other brokers would charge if BFA </span><span>determines in good faith that the commission is reasonable in relation to the services provided.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>In selecting brokers or dealers to execute portfolio transactions, BFA seeks to obtain the best price and most favorable </span><span>execution for a Fund and may take into account a variety of factors including: (i) the size, nature and character of the security </span><span>or instrument being traded and the markets in which it is purchased or sold; (ii) the desired timing of the transaction; (iii) </span><span>BFA’s knowledge of the expected commission rates and spreads currently available; (iv) the activity existing and expected in </span><span>the market for the particular security or instrument, including any anticipated execution difficulties; (v) the full range of </span><span>brokerage services provided; (vi) the broker’s or dealer’s capital; (vii) the quality of research and research services provided; </span><span>(viii) the reasonableness of the commission, dealer spread or its equivalent for the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA’s </span><span>knowledge of any actual or apparent operational problems of a broker or dealer. Brokers may also be selected because of </span><span>their ability to handle special or difficult executions, such as may be involved in large block trades, thinly traded securities, or </span><span>other circumstances.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act (</span><span>“</span><span>Section 28(e)</span><span>”</span><span>) permits a U.S. investment adviser, under certain circumstances, to cause an </span><span>account to pay a broker or dealer a commission for effecting a transaction in securities that exceeds the amount another </span><span>broker or dealer would have charged for effecting the same transaction in recognition of the value of brokerage and research </span><span>services provided by that broker or dealer. This includes commissions paid on riskless principal transactions in securities </span><span>under certain conditions.</span></div> <div><span>From time to time, a Fund may purchase new issues of securities in a fixed price offering. In these situations, the broker may </span><span>be a member of the selling group that will, in addition to selling securities, provide BFA with research services. FINRA has </span><span>adopted rules expressly permitting these types of arrangements under certain circumstances. Generally, the broker will </span><span>provide research </span><span>“</span><span>credits</span><span>”</span><span> in these situations at a rate that is higher than that available for typical secondary market </span><span>transactions. These arrangements may not fall within the safe harbor of Section 28(e).</span></div> <div><span>The Funds anticipate that brokerage transactions involving foreign equity securities generally will be conducted primarily on </span><span>the principal stock exchanges of the applicable country. Foreign equity securities may be held by the Funds in the form of </span><span>depositary receipts, or other securities convertible into foreign equity securities. Depositary receipts may be listed on stock </span><span>exchanges, or traded in OTC markets in the U.S. or Europe, as the case may be. ADRs, like other securities traded in the U.S., </span><span>will be subject to negotiated commission rates.</span></div> <div><span>OTC issues, including most fixed-income securities such as corporate debt and U.S. Government securities, are normally </span><span>traded on a </span><span>“</span><span>net</span><span>”</span><span> basis without a stated commission, through dealers acting for their own account and not as brokers. The </span><span>Funds will primarily engage in transactions with these dealers or deal directly with the issuer unless a better price or </span><span>execution could be obtained by using a broker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect to both foreign and domestic securities </span><span>will generally include a </span><span>“</span><span>spread,</span><span>”</span><span> which is the difference between the prices at which the dealer is willing to purchase and sell </span><span>the specific security at the time, and includes the dealer’s normal profit.</span></div> <div><span>Under the 1940 Act, persons affiliated with a Fund and persons who are affiliated with such affiliated persons are prohibited </span><span>from dealing with the Fund as principal in the purchase and sale of securities unless a permissive order allowing such </span><span>transactions is obtained from the SEC. Since transactions in the OTC market usually involve transactions with the dealers </span><span>acting as principal for their own accounts, the Funds will not deal with affiliated persons and affiliated persons of such </span><span>affiliated persons in connection with such transactions. The Funds will not purchase securities during the existence of any </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>101</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

The Funds do not </span><span>currently expect to incur any brokerage commission expense on such transactions because money market instruments are </span><span>generally traded on a </span><span>“</span><span>net</span><span>”</span><span> basis with dealers acting as principal for their own accounts without a stated commission. The </span><span>price of the security, however, usually includes a profit to the dealer.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BFA may, from time to time, effect trades on behalf of and for the account of the Funds with brokers or dealers that are </span><span>affiliated with BFA, in conformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under these provisions, </span><span>any commissions paid to affiliated brokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by </span><span>other brokers or dealers in comparable transactions.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Securities purchased in underwritten offerings include a fixed amount of compensation to the underwriter, generally referred </span><span>to as the underwriter’s concession or discount. When securities are purchased or sold directly from or to an issuer, no </span><span>commissions or discounts are paid.</span></div> <div><span>Investment decisions for the Funds and for other investment accounts managed by BFA and the other Affiliates are made </span><span>independently of each other in light of differing conditions. A variety of factors will be considered in making investment </span><span>allocations. These factors include: (i) investment objectives or strategies for particular accounts, including sector, industry, </span><span>country or region and capitalization weightings; (ii) tax considerations of an account; (iii) risk or investment concentration </span><span>parameters for an account; (iv) supply or demand for a security at a given price level; (v) size of available investment; (vi) </span><span>cash availability and liquidity requirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory restrictions; (viii) minimum investment size of an </span><span>account; (ix) relative size of account; and (x) such other factors as may be approved by BlackRock’s general counsel. </span><span>Moreover, investments may not be allocated to one client account over another based on any of the following considerations: </span><span>(i) to favor one client account at the expense of another; (ii) to generate higher fees paid by one client account over another </span><span>or to produce greater performance compensation to BlackRock; (iii) to develop or enhance a relationship with a client or </span><span>prospective client; (iv) to compensate a client for past services or benefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce future services </span><span>or benefits to be rendered to BlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize investment performance among different client </span><span>accounts. BFA and the other Affiliates may deal, trade and invest for their own respective accounts in the types of securities </span><span>in which the Funds may invest.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Initial public offerings (</span><span>“</span><span>IPOs</span><span>”</span><span>) of securities may be over-subscribed and subsequently trade at a premium in the secondary </span><span>market. When BFA is given an opportunity to invest in such an initial offering or </span><span>“</span><span>new</span><span>”</span><span> or </span><span>“</span><span>hot</span><span>”</span><span> issue, the supply of securities </span><span>available for client accounts is often less than the amount of securities the accounts would otherwise take. In order to </span><span>allocate these investments fairly and equitably among client accounts over time, each portfolio manager or a member of his </span><span>or her respective investment team will indicate to BFA’s trading desk their level of interest in a particular offering with respect </span><span>to eligible clients’ accounts for which that team is responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities will be identified as eligible for </span><span>particular client accounts that are managed by portfolio teams who have indicated interest in the offering based on market </span><span>capitalization of the issuer of the security and the investment mandate of the client account and in the case of international </span><span>equity securities, the country where the offering is taking place and the investment mandate of the client account. Generally, </span><span>shares received during the IPO will be allocated among participating client accounts within each investment mandate on a </span><span>pro rata</span><span> basis. This </span><span>pro rata</span><span> allocation may result in a Fund receiving less of a particular security than if pro-rating had not </span><span>occurred. All allocations of securities will be subject, where relevant, to share minimums established for accounts and </span><span>compliance constraints. In situations where supply is too limited to be allocated among all accounts for which the </span><span>investment is eligible, portfolio managers may rotate such investment opportunities among one or more accounts so long as </span><span>the rotation system provides for fair access for all client accounts over time. Other allocation methodologies that are </span><span>considered by BFA to be fair and equitable to clients may be used as well.</span></div> <div><span>Because different accounts may have differing investment objectives and policies, BFA may buy and sell the same securities </span><span>at the same time for different clients based on the particular investment objective, guidelines and strategies of those </span><span>accounts. For example, BFA may decide that it may be entirely appropriate for a growth fund to sell a security at the same </span><span>time a value fund is buying that security. To the extent that transactions on behalf of more than one client of BFA or the other </span><span>Affiliates during the same period increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, </span><span>there may be an adverse effect on price. For example, sales of a security by BlackRock on behalf of one or more of its clients </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>102</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>may decrease the market price of such security, adversely impacting other BlackRock clients that still hold the security. If </span><span>purchases or sales of securities arise for consideration at or about the same time that would involve the Funds or other </span><span>clients or funds for which BFA or another Affiliate act as investment manager, transactions in such securities will be made, </span><span>insofar as feasible, for the respective funds and clients in a manner deemed equitable to all.</span></div> <div><span>In certain instances, BFA may find it efficient for purposes of seeking to obtain best execution, to aggregate or </span><span>“</span><span>bunch</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>certain contemporaneous purchases or sale orders of its advisory accounts and advisory accounts of affiliates. In general, all </span><span>contemporaneous trades for client accounts under management by the same portfolio manager or investment team will be </span><span>bunched in a single order if the trader believes the bunched trade would provide each client with an opportunity to achieve a </span><span>more favorable execution at a potentially lower execution cost. The costs associated with a bunched order will be shared </span><span>pro </span><span>rata</span><span> among the clients in the bunched order. Generally, if an order for a particular portfolio manager or management team is </span><span>filled at several different prices through multiple trades, all accounts participating in the order will receive the average price </span><span>(except in the case of certain international markets where average pricing is not permitted). While in some cases this practice </span><span>could have a detrimental effect upon the price or value of the security as far as the Funds are concerned, in other cases it </span><span>could be beneficial to the Funds. Transactions effected by BFA or the other Affiliates on behalf of more than one of its clients </span><span>during the same period may increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, </span><span>causing an adverse effect on price. The trader will give the bunched order to the broker-dealer that the trader has identified </span><span>as being able to provide the best execution of the order. Orders for purchase or sale of securities will be placed within a </span><span>reasonable amount of time of the order receipt and bunched orders will be kept bunched only long enough to execute the </span><span>order.</span></div> <div><span>The table below sets forth the brokerage commissions paid by each Fund for the fiscal years noted. Any differences in </span><span>brokerage commissions paid by a Fund from year to year are</span><span> </span><span>principally due to increases or decreases in that Fund’s assets </span><span>over those periods</span><span> </span><span>or the magnitude of changes to the components of a Fund's Underlying Index:</span></div> <div><span> </span></div> <div> </div> <div>

Although the shares are not automatically redeemable </span><span>upon the occurrence of any specific event, the Declaration of Trust provides that the Board will have the unrestricted power </span><span>to alter the number of shares in a Creation Unit. Therefore, in the event of a termination of the Trust or a fund, the Board, in </span><span>its sole discretion, could determine to permit the shares to be redeemable in aggregations smaller than Creation Units or to </span><span>be individually redeemable. In such circumstance, the Trust or a fund may make redemptions in-kind, for cash or for a </span><span>combination of cash or securities. Further, in the event of a termination of the Trust or a fund, the Trust or a fund might elect </span><span>to pay cash redemptions to all shareholders, with an in-kind election for shareholders owning in excess of a certain stated </span><span>minimum amount.</span></div> <div><span>DTC as Securities Depository for Shares of the Funds. </span><span> </span><span>Shares of each Fund are represented by securities registered in the </span><span>name of DTC or its nominee and deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC.</span></div> <div><span>DTC was created in 1973 to enable electronic movement of securities between its participants (</span><span>“</span><span>DTC Participants</span><span>”</span><span>), and </span><span>NSCC was established in 1976 to provide a single settlement system for securities clearing and to serve as central </span><span>counterparty for securities trades among DTC Participants. In 1999, DTC and NSCC were consolidated within The Depository </span><span>Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (</span><span>“</span><span>DTCC</span><span>”</span><span>) and became wholly-owned subsidiaries of DTCC. The common stock of DTCC is </span><span>owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and FINRA, through subsidiaries, hold preferred shares in DTCC that provide them </span><span>with the right to elect one member each to the DTCC board of directors. Access to the DTC system is available to entities, </span><span>such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies, that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC </span><span>Participant, either directly or indirectly (</span><span>“</span><span>Indirect Participants</span><span>”</span><span>).</span></div> <div><span>Beneficial ownership of shares is limited to DTC Participants, Indirect Participants and persons holding interests through DTC </span><span>Participants and Indirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in shares (owners of such beneficial interests are </span><span>referred to herein as </span><span>“</span><span>Beneficial Owners</span><span>”</span><span>) is shown on, and the transfer of ownership is effected only through, records </span><span>maintained by DTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on the records of DTC Participants (with respect to Indirect </span><span>Participants and Beneficial Owners that are not DTC Participants). Beneficial Owners will receive from or through the DTC </span><span>Participant a written confirmation relating to their purchase of shares. The laws of some jurisdictions may require that certain </span><span>purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. Such laws may impair the ability of certain </span><span>investors to acquire beneficial interests in shares of the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Conveyance of all notices, statements and other communications to Beneficial Owners is effected as follows. Pursuant to the </span><span>Depositary Agreement between the Trust and DTC, DTC is required to make available to the Trust upon request and for a fee </span><span>to be charged to the Trust a listing of the shares of each Fund held by each DTC Participant. The Trust shall inquire of each </span><span>such DTC Participant as to the number of Beneficial Owners holding shares, directly or indirectly, through such DTC </span><span>Participant. The Trust shall provide each such DTC Participant with copies of such notice, statement or other communication, </span><span>in such form, number and at such place as such DTC Participant may reasonably request, in order that such notice, </span><span>statement or communication may be transmitted by such DTC Participant, directly or indirectly, to such Beneficial Owners. In </span><span>addition, the Trust shall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair and reasonable amount as reimbursement for the expenses </span><span>attendant to such transmittal, all subject to applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.</span></div> <div><span>Share distributions shall be made to DTC or its nominee, Cede &amp; Co., as the registered holder of all shares of the Trust. DTC or </span><span>its nominee, upon receipt of any such distributions, shall credit immediately DTC Participants’ accounts with payments in </span><span>amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in shares of each Fund as shown on the records of DTC or its </span><span>nominee. Payments by DTC Participants to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners of shares held through such DTC </span><span>Participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for the </span><span>accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in a </span><span>“</span><span>street name,</span><span>”</span><span> and will be the responsibility of such DTC Participants.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The Trust has no responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or notices to Beneficial Owners, or </span><span>payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in such shares, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any </span><span>records relating to such beneficial ownership interests, or for any other aspect of the relationship between DTC and the DTC </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>106</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

Initial investors participating in the seeding may be Authorized </span><span>Participants, a lead market maker or other third party investor or an affiliate of each Fund or each Fund’s adviser. Each such </span><span>initial investor may sell some or all of the shares underlying the Creation Unit(s) held by them pursuant to the registration </span><span>statement for each Fund (each, a </span><span>“</span><span>Selling Shareholder</span><span>”</span><span>), which shares have been registered to permit the resale from time to </span><span>time after purchase.

These sales may be effected through </span><span>brokerage transactions, privately negotiated trades, block sales, entry into options or other derivatives transactions or </span><span>through any other means authorized by applicable law. Selling Shareholders may redeem the shares held in Creation Unit size </span><span>by them through an Authorized Participant.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Any Selling Shareholder and any broker-dealer or agents participating in the distribution of shares may be deemed to be </span><span>“</span><span>underwriters</span><span>”</span><span> within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the 1933 Act, in connection with such sales.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Any Selling Shareholder and any other person participating in such distribution will be subject to applicable provisions of the </span><span>1934 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.</span></div> <div><span>Creation and Redemption of Creation Units</span></div> <div><span>General. </span><span> </span><span>The Trust issues and sells shares of each Fund only in Creation Units on a continuous basis through the Distributor </span><span>or its agent, without a sales load, at a price based on the NAV next determined after receipt, on any Business Day (as defined </span><span>below), of an order received by the Distributor or its agent in proper form. On days when the</span><span> </span><span>applicable Listing Exchange </span><span>closes earlier than normal, the Funds may require orders to be placed earlier in the day.

In the case of a partial or full cash purchase, the Authorized </span><span>Participant must pay the cash equivalent of the Deposit Securities it would otherwise be required to provide through an in-kind</span><span> purchase, plus the same Cash Component required to be paid by an in-kind purchaser.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Procedures for Creation of Creation Units.</span><span>  </span><span>To be eligible to place orders with the Distributor and to create a Creation Unit of </span><span>the Funds, an entity must be: (i) a </span><span>“</span><span>Participating Party,</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>i.e</span><span>., a broker-dealer or other participant in the clearing process </span><span>through the Continuous Net Settlement System of the NSCC (the </span><span>“</span><span>Clearing Process</span><span>”</span><span>), a clearing agency that is registered </span><span>with the SEC, or (ii) a DTC Participant, and must have executed an agreement with the Distributor, with respect to creations </span><span>and redemptions of Creation Units (</span><span>“</span><span>Authorized Participant Agreement</span><span>”</span><span>) (discussed below).

Such Authorized Participant will agree, pursuant to the terms of such Authorized Participant Agreement and on </span><span>behalf of itself or any investor on whose behalf it will act, to certain conditions, including that such Authorized Participant will </span><span>make available in advance of each purchase of shares an amount of cash sufficient to pay the Cash Component, once the </span><span>NAV of a Creation Unit is next determined after receipt of the purchase order in proper form, together with the transaction </span><span>fees described below. An Authorized Participant, acting on behalf of an investor, may require the investor to enter into an </span><span>agreement with such Authorized Participant with respect to certain matters, including payment of the Cash Component. </span><span>Investors who are not Authorized Participants must make appropriate arrangements with an Authorized Participant. Investors </span><span>should be aware that their particular broker may not be a DTC Participant or may not have executed an Authorized </span><span>Participant Agreement and that orders to purchase Creation Units may have to be placed by the investor's broker through an </span><span>Authorized Participant. As a result, purchase orders placed through an Authorized Participant may result in additional </span><span>charges to such investor. The Trust does not expect to enter into an Authorized Participant Agreement with more than a </span><span>small number of DTC Participants. A list of current Authorized Participants may be obtained from the Distributor. The </span><span>Distributor has adopted guidelines regarding Authorized Participants’ transactions in Creation Units that are made available </span><span>to all Authorized Participants. These guidelines set forth the processes and standards for Authorized Participants to transact </span><span>with the Distributor and its agents in connection with creation and redemption transactions. In addition, the Distributor may </span><span>be appointed as the proxy of the Authorized Participant and may be granted a power of attorney under its Authorized </span><span>Participant Agreement.</span></div> <div><span>Purchase Orders.</span><span>  </span><span> To initiate an order for a Creation Unit, an Authorized Participant must submit to the Distributor or its </span><span>agent an irrevocable order to purchase shares of a Fund, in proper form,</span><span> </span><span>generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any </span><span>Business Day to receive that day’s NAV. The Distributor or its agent will notify BFA and the custodian of such order. The </span><span>custodian will then provide such information to any appropriate sub-custodian. Procedures and requirements governing the </span><span>delivery of the Fund Deposit are set forth in the procedures handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time </span><span>to time. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements for a creation request to be </span><span>made through an Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current Authorized Participants </span><span>upon request. Those placing orders to purchase Creation Units through an Authorized Participant should allow sufficient time </span><span>to permit proper submission of the purchase order to the Distributor or its agent by the Cutoff Time (as defined below) on </span><span>such Business Day.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The Authorized Participant must also make available on or before the contractual settlement date, by means satisfactory to </span><span>the Funds, immediately available or same day funds estimated by the Funds to be sufficient to pay the Cash Component next </span><span>determined after acceptance of the purchase order, together with the applicable purchase transaction fees. Those placing </span><span>orders should ascertain the applicable deadline for cash transfers by contacting the operations department of the broker or </span><span>depositary institution effectuating the transfer of the Cash Component. This deadline is likely to be significantly earlier than </span><span>the Cutoff Time of the Funds. Investors should be aware that an Authorized Participant may require orders for purchases of </span><span>shares placed with it to be in the particular form required by the individual Authorized Participant.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>109</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

Orders </span><span>to create shares of a Fund that are submitted on the Business Day immediately preceding a holiday or a day (other than a </span><span>weekend) when the equity markets in the relevant non-U.S. market are closed may not be accepted. Each Fund's deadline </span><span>specified above for the submission of purchase orders is referred to as that Fund's </span><span>“</span><span>Cutoff Time.</span><span>”</span><span> The Distributor or its agent, </span><span>in their discretion, may permit the submission of such orders and requests by or through an Authorized Participant at any </span><span>time (including on days on which the Listing Exchange is not open for business) via communication through the facilities of </span><span>the Distributor's or its agent's proprietary website maintained for this purpose. Purchase orders and redemption requests, if </span><span>accepted by the Trust, will be processed based on the NAV next determined after such acceptance in accordance with a </span><span>Fund's Cutoff Times as provided in the Authorized Participant Agreement and disclosed in this SAI.</span></div> <div><span>Acceptance of Orders for Creation Units.</span><span>  </span><span> Subject to the conditions that (i) an irrevocable purchase order has been </span><span>submitted by the Authorized Participant (either on its own or another investor's behalf) and (ii) arrangements satisfactory to </span><span>the Funds are in place for payment of the Cash Component and any other cash amounts which may be due, the Funds will </span><span>accept the order, subject to each Fund's right (and the right of the Distributor and BFA) to reject any order until acceptance, </span><span>as set forth below.</span></div> <div><span>Once a Fund has accepted an order, upon the next determination of the NAV of the shares, the Fund will confirm the </span><span>issuance of a Creation Unit, against receipt of payment, at such NAV. The Distributor or its agent will then transmit a </span><span>confirmation of acceptance to the Authorized Participant that placed the order.</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund reserves the right to reject or revoke a creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor or its agent provided that </span><span>a rejection or revocation of a creation order does not violate Rule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act. For example, a </span><span>Fund may reject or revoke a creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor or its agent if (i) the order is not in proper form; </span><span>(ii) the investor(s), upon obtaining the shares ordered, would own 80% or more of the currently outstanding shares of the </span><span>Fund; (iii) the Deposit Securities delivered do not conform to the identity and number of shares specified, as described above; </span><span>(iv) acceptance of the Deposit Securities is not legally required or would, in the opinion of counsel, be unlawful or have an </span><span>adverse effect on the Fund or its shareholders (</span><span>e.g</span><span>., jeopardize the Fund's tax status); or (v) circumstances outside the control </span><span>of the Fund, the Distributor or its agent and BFA make it impracticable to process purchase orders. The Distributor or its </span><span>agent shall notify a prospective purchaser of a Creation Unit and/or the Authorized Participant acting on behalf of such </span><span>purchaser of its rejection of such order. The Funds, State Street or Citibank, as applicable, the sub-custodian and the </span><span>Distributor or its agent are under no duty, however, to give notification of any defects or irregularities in the delivery of Fund </span><span>Deposits nor shall any of them incur any liability for failure to give such notification.</span></div> <div><span>Issuance of a Creation Unit.</span><span>  </span><span> Except as provided herein, a Creation Unit will not be issued until the transfer of good title to </span><span>the applicable Fund of the Deposit Securities and the payment of the Cash Component have been completed. When the sub-custodian</span><span> has confirmed to the custodian that the securities included in the Fund Deposit (or the cash value thereof) have </span><span>been delivered to the account of the relevant sub-custodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor or its agent and BFA shall be </span><span>notified of such delivery and the applicable Fund will issue and cause the delivery of the Creation Unit. For the iShares </span><span>Emergent Food and AgTech Multisector ETF, iShares ESG Advanced MSCI EAFE ETF, iShares ESG Advanced MSCI USA ETF, </span><span>iShares ESG Aware MSCI EAFE ETF, iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF, iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA Small-Cap ETF, iShares </span><span>ESG MSCI USA Leaders ETF, iShares MSCI Denmark ETF, iShares MSCI Finland ETF, iShares MSCI Germany Small-Cap ETF, </span><span>iShares MSCI Indonesia ETF, iShares MSCI Ireland ETF, iShares MSCI Japan Value ETF, iShares MSCI New Zealand ETF, iShares </span><span>MSCI Norway ETF, iShares MSCI Philippines ETF, iShares MSCI Poland ETF, iShares MSCI United Kingdom ETF, iShares MSCI </span><span>United Kingdom Small-Cap ETF and iShares Paris-Aligned Climate MSCI USA ETF, Creation Units are generally issued on a </span><span>“</span><span>T+2 basis</span><span>”</span><span> (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, two Business Days after trade date). However, each Fund reserves the right to settle Creation Unit </span><span>transactions on a basis other than T+2, including a shorter settlement period, if necessary or appropriate under the </span><span>circumstances and compliant with applicable law. For example, certain Funds reserve the right to settle Creation Unit </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>110</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

The Trust may use such collateral at any time to buy Deposit Securities for </span><span>the Funds. Such collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the contractual </span><span>settlement date. Information concerning the Funds' current procedures for collateralization of missing Deposit Securities is </span><span>available from the Distributor or its agent. The Authorized Participant Agreement will permit the Funds to buy the missing </span><span>Deposit Securities at any time and will subject the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the cost to the </span><span>Funds of purchasing such securities and the collateral including, without limitation, liability for related brokerage, borrowings </span><span>and other charges.</span></div> <div><span>In certain cases, Authorized Participants may create and redeem Creation Units on the same trade date and in these </span><span>instances, the Funds reserve the right to settle these transactions on a net basis or require a representation from the </span><span>Authorized Participants that the creation and redemption transactions are for separate beneficial owners. All questions as to </span><span>the number of shares of each security in the Deposit Securities and the validity, form, eligibility and acceptance for deposit of </span><span>any securities to be delivered shall be determined by each Fund and the Fund's determination shall be final and binding.</span></div> <div><span>Costs Associated with Creation Transactions.</span></div> <div><span>All Funds (except iShares ESG Advanced MSCI USA ETF, iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF, iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA </span><span>Small-Cap ETF, iShares ESG MSCI USA Leaders ETF and iShares Paris-Aligned Climate MSCI USA ETF) </span></div> <div><span>A standard creation transaction fee is imposed to offset the transfer and other transaction costs associated with the issuance </span><span>of Creation Units. The standard creation transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized </span><span>Participant creates a Creation Unit, and is the same, regardless of the number of Creation Units purchased by the Authorized </span><span>Participant on the applicable Business Day. If a purchase consists solely or partially of cash, the Authorized Participant may </span><span>also be required to cover (up to the maximum amount shown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, </span><span>price movement and other costs and expenses related to the execution of trades resulting from such transaction (which may, </span><span>in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Authorized Participants will also bear the costs </span><span>of transferring the Deposit Securities to the Funds. Certain fees/costs associated with creation transactions may be waived in </span><span>certain circumstances. Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to acquire Fund shares may </span><span>be charged a fee for such services.</span></div> <div><span>The following table sets forth each Fund's standard creation transaction fee and maximum additional charge (as described </span><span>above):</span></div> <div><span> </span></div> <div> </div> <div>

Such Fund Securities and Cash Amount will remain in effect until such time as the </span><span>next announced composition of the Fund Securities and Cash Amount is made available. The Fund Securities and Cash </span><span>Amount are subject to possible amendment or correction. Fund Securities received on redemption may not be identical to </span><span>Deposit Securities that are applicable to creations of Creation Units. Procedures and requirements governing redemption </span><span>transactions are set forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time to time.</span></div> <div><span>Unless cash redemptions are available or specified for a Fund, the redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit generally consist </span><span>of Fund Securities, plus the Cash Amount, which is an amount equal to the difference between the NAV of the shares being </span><span>redeemed, as next determined after the receipt of a redemption request in proper form, and the value of Fund Securities, less </span><span>a redemption transaction fee (as described below).</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The Trust may, in its sole discretion, substitute a </span><span>“</span><span>cash in lieu</span><span>”</span><span> amount to replace any Fund Security in certain circumstances, </span><span>including: (i) when the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant (or to an investor on whose behalf the </span><span>Authorized Participant is acting) would be restricted under applicable securities or other local laws or due to a trading </span><span>restriction; (ii) when the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in the disposition of the Fund </span><span>Security by the Authorized Participant due to restrictions under applicable securities or other local laws; (iii) when the delivery </span><span>of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in unfavorable tax treatment; (iv) when a Fund Security cannot </span><span>be settled or otherwise delivered in time to facilitate an in-kind redemption; or (v) in certain other situations. The amount of </span><span>cash paid out in such cases will be equivalent to the value of the substituted security listed as a Fund Security. In the event </span><span>that the Fund Securities have a value greater than the NAV of the shares, a compensating cash payment equal to the </span><span>difference is required to be made by or through an Authorized Participant by the redeeming shareholder. Each Fund generally </span><span>redeems Creation Units for Fund Securities, but the Fund reserves the right to utilize a cash option for redemption of Creation </span><span>Units. Each Fund may, in its sole discretion, provide such redeeming Authorized Participant a portfolio of securities that differs </span><span>from the exact composition of the Fund Securities, but does not differ in NAV. The Redemption Basket may also be modified </span><span>to minimize the Cash Component by redistributing the cash to the Fund Securities portion of the Redemption Basket through </span><span>systematically rounding. The rounding methodology allows position sizes of securities in the Fund Securities to be </span><span>“</span><span>rounded </span><span>up,</span><span>”</span><span> while limiting the maximum allowed percentage change in weight and share quantity of any given security in the </span><span>Redemption Basket. Redemption Baskets may also be modified to position a fund towards a forward index rebalance to </span><span>reflect revisions that account for index additions, deletions, and re-weights.</span></div> <div><span>Cash Redemption Method.</span><span>  </span><span> Although the Trust does not generally permit partial or full cash redemptions of Creation Units </span><span>of its funds, when partial or full cash redemptions of Creation Units are available or specified for a Fund, they will be effected </span><span>in essentially the same manner as in-kind redemptions thereof. In the case of partial or full cash redemption, the Authorized </span><span>Participant receives the cash equivalent of the Fund Securities it would otherwise receive through an in-kind redemption, plus </span><span>the same Cash Amount to be paid to an in-kind redeemer.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Costs Associated with Redemption Transactions.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>All Funds (except iShares ESG Advanced MSCI USA ETF, iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF, iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA </span><span>Small-Cap ETF, iShares ESG MSCI USA Leaders ETF and iShares Paris-Aligned Climate MSCI USA ETF) </span></div> <div><span>A standard redemption transaction fee is imposed to offset transfer and other transaction costs that may be incurred by the </span><span>relevant Fund.

An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable </span><span>request to redeem shares of a Fund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day in order to receive that </span><span>day's NAV. On days when the Listing Exchange closes earlier than normal, a Fund may require orders to redeem Creation </span><span>Units to be placed earlier that day.

Investors should be aware that </span><span>their particular broker may not have executed an Authorized Participant Agreement and that, therefore, requests to redeem </span><span>Creation Units may have to be placed by the investor's broker through an Authorized Participant who has executed an </span><span>Authorized Participant Agreement. At any time, only a limited number of broker-dealers will have an Authorized Participant </span><span>Agreement in effect. Investors making a redemption request should be aware that such request must be in the form specified </span><span>by such Authorized Participant. Investors making a request to redeem Creation Units should allow sufficient time to permit </span><span>proper submission of the request by an Authorized Participant and transfer of the shares to the Funds' transfer agent; such </span><span>investors should allow for the additional time that may be required to effect redemptions through their banks, brokers or </span><span>other financial intermediaries if such intermediaries are not Authorized Participants.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>A redemption request is considered to be in </span><span>“</span><span>proper form</span><span>”</span><span> if: (i) an Authorized Participant has transferred or caused to be </span><span>transferred to the Funds' transfer agent the Creation Unit redeemed through the book-entry system of DTC so as to be </span><span>effective by the Listing Exchange closing time on any Business Day on which the redemption request is submitted; (ii) a </span><span>request in form satisfactory to the applicable Fund is received by the Distributor or its agent from the Authorized Participant </span><span>on behalf of itself or another redeeming investor within the time periods specified above; and (iii) all other procedures set </span><span>forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement are properly followed.</span></div> <div><span>Upon receiving a redemption request, the Distributor or its agent shall notify the applicable Fund and the Fund's transfer </span><span>agent of such redemption request.

However, each Fund reserves the right to </span><span>settle deliveries of redemption proceeds on a basis other than T+2, including a shorter settlement period, if necessary or </span><span>appropriate under the circumstances and compliant with applicable law. For example, certain Funds reserve the right to settle </span><span>redemption transactions on a basis other than T+2 to accommodate non-U.S. market holiday schedules, to account for </span><span>different treatment among non-U.S. and U.S. markets of dividend record dates and dividend ex-dates (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the last date the </span><span>holder of a security can sell the security and still receive dividends payable on the security sold) and in certain other </span><span>circumstances consistent with applicable law.</span></div> <div><span>If neither the Authorized Participant nor the Beneficial Owner on whose behalf the Authorized Participant is acting has </span><span>appropriate arrangements to take delivery of Fund Securities in the applicable non-U.S. jurisdiction and it is not possible to </span><span>make other such arrangements, or if it is not possible to effect deliveries of Fund Securities in such jurisdiction, a Fund may in </span><span>its discretion exercise its option to redeem such shares in cash, and the Beneficial Owner will be required to receive its </span><span>redemption proceeds in cash. In such case, the investor will receive a cash payment equal to the net asset value of its shares </span><span>based on the NAV of the relevant Fund next determined after the redemption request is received in proper form (minus a </span><span>redemption transaction fee and additional charges specified above to offset the Fund's brokerage and other transaction costs </span><span>associated with the disposition of Fund Securities). Redemptions of shares for Fund Securities will be subject to compliance </span><span>with applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws and each Fund (whether or not it otherwise permits cash redemptions) </span><span>reserves the right to redeem Creation Units for cash to the extent that the Fund cannot lawfully deliver specific Fund </span><span>Securities upon redemptions or cannot do so without first registering the Fund Securities under such laws.</span></div> <div><span>Although the Trust does not ordinarily permit cash redemptions of Creation Units, in the event that cash redemptions are </span><span>permitted or required by the Trust, proceeds will be paid to the Authorized Participant redeeming shares as soon as </span><span>practicable after the date of redemption (within seven calendar days thereafter). If a Fund includes a foreign investment in its </span><span>basket, and if a local market holiday, or series of consecutive holidays, or the extended delivery cycles for transferring foreign </span><span>investments to redeeming Authorized Participants prevents timely delivery of the foreign investment in response to a </span><span>redemption request, a Fund may delay delivery of the foreign investment more than seven days if a Fund delivers the foreign </span><span>investment as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 days.</span></div> <div><span>To the extent contemplated by an Authorized Participant's agreement with the Distributor or its agent, in the event an </span><span>Authorized Participant has submitted a redemption request in proper form but is unable to transfer all or part of the Creation </span><span>Unit to be redeemed to a Fund, at or prior to the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the Business Day after the date </span><span>of submission of such redemption request, the Distributor or its agent will accept the redemption request in reliance on the </span><span>undertaking by the Authorized Participant to deliver the missing shares as soon as possible. Such undertaking shall be </span><span>secured by the Authorized Participant's delivery and maintenance of collateral as set forth in the handbook for Authorized </span><span>Participants. Such collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the Business Day </span><span>after the date of submission of such redemption request and shall be held by State Street or Citibank, as applicable, and </span><span>marked-to-market daily. The fees of State Street or Citibank, as applicable, and any sub-custodians in respect of the delivery, </span><span>maintenance and redelivery of the collateral shall be payable by the Authorized Participant. The Authorized Participant </span><span>Agreement permits the Funds to acquire shares of the Funds at any time and subjects the Authorized Participant to liability </span><span>for any shortfall between the aggregate of the cost to the Funds of purchasing such shares, plus the value of the Cash </span><span>Amount, and the value of the collateral together with liability for related brokerage and other charges.</span></div> <div><span>Because the portfolio securities of a Fund may trade on exchange(s) on days that the Listing Exchange is closed or are </span><span>otherwise not Business Days for such Fund, shareholders may not be able to redeem their shares of such Fund or purchase </span><span>or sell shares of such Fund on the Listing Exchange on days when the NAV of such a Fund could be significantly affected by </span><span>events in the relevant non-U.S. markets.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The right of redemption may be suspended or the date of payment postponed with respect to any Fund: (i) for any period </span><span>during which the applicable Listing Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday closings); (ii) for any </span><span>period during which trading on the applicable Listing Exchange is suspended or restricted; (iii) for any period during which an </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>116</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

Each Fund has adopted policies and </span><span>procedures that govern the construction and acceptance of baskets, including heightened requirements for certain types of </span><span>custom baskets. Such policies and procedures provide the parameters for the construction and acceptance of custom </span><span>baskets that are in the best interests of a Fund and its shareholders, establish processes for revisions to, or deviations from, </span><span>such parameters, and specify the titles and roles of the employees of BFA who are required to review each custom basket for </span><span>compliance with those parameters. In addition, when constructing custom baskets for redemptions, the tax efficiency of a </span><span>Fund may be taken into account. The policies and procedures distinguish among different types of custom baskets that may </span><span>be used for each Fund and impose different requirements for different types of custom baskets in order to seek to mitigate </span><span>against potential risks of conflicts and/or overreaching by an Authorized Participant. BlackRock has established a governance </span><span>process to oversee basket compliance for the Funds, as set forth in each Fund's policies and procedures.</span></div> <div><span>Taxation on Creations and Redemptions of Creation Units.</span><span>  </span><span> An Authorized Participant generally will recognize either gain or </span><span>loss upon the exchange of Deposit Securities for Creation Units. This gain or loss is calculated by taking the market value of </span><span>the Creation Units purchased over the Authorized Participant’s aggregate basis in the Deposit Securities exchanged therefor. </span><span>However, the IRS may apply the wash sales rules to determine that any loss realized upon the exchange of Deposit Securities </span><span>for Creation Units is not currently deductible. Authorized Participants should consult their own tax advisors.</span></div> <div><span>Current U.S. federal income tax laws dictate that capital gain or loss realized from the redemption of Creation Units will </span><span>generally create long-term capital gain or loss if the Authorized Participant holds the Creation Units for more than one year, </span><span>or short-term capital gain or loss if the Creation Units were held for one year or less, if the Creation Units are held as capital </span><span>assets.</span></div> <div><span>Taxes</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The following is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations regarding the purchase, ownership and </span><span>disposition of shares of a Fund. This summary does not address all of the potential U.S. federal income tax consequences </span><span>that may be applicable to a Fund or to all categories of investors, some of which may be subject to special tax rules. Current </span><span>and prospective shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the specific U.S. federal, state, local </span><span>and non-U.S. tax consequences of investing in a Fund. The summary is based on the laws and judicial and administrative </span><span>interpretations thereof in effect on the date of this SAI, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Regulated Investment Company Qualifications. </span><span> </span><span>Each Fund intends to continue to qualify for treatment as a separate RIC </span><span>under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify for treatment as a RIC, each Fund must annually distribute at </span><span>least 90% of its investment company taxable income (which includes dividends, interest and net short-term capital gains) </span><span>and meet several other requirements. Among such other requirements are the following: (i) at least 90% of each Fund’s </span><span>annual gross income must be derived from dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans, gains from the sale </span><span>or other disposition of stock or securities or non-U.S. currencies, other income (including, but not limited to, gains from </span><span>options, futures or forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies, </span><span>and net income derived from interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships (</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> partnerships that are traded on an </span><span>established securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than partnerships that derive at least 90% of their </span><span>income from interest, dividends, capital gains and other traditionally permitted RIC income); and (ii) at the close of each </span><span>quarter of each Fund's taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the market value of each Fund’s total assets must be represented by </span><span>cash and cash items, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs and other securities, with such other securities </span><span>limited for purposes of this calculation in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of the </span><span>Fund’s assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (b) not more than 25% of the </span><span>value of each Fund's total assets may be invested in the securities (other than U.S. government securities or the securities of </span><span>other RICs) of any one issuer, of two or more issuers of which 20% or more of the voting stock is held by the Fund and that </span><span>are engaged in the same or similar trades or businesses or related trades or businesses, or the securities of one or more </span><span>qualified publicly-traded partnerships.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>117</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A Fund may be able to cure a failure to derive at least 90% of its income from the sources specified above or a failure to </span><span>diversify its holdings in the manner described above by paying a tax</span><span> </span><span>and/or by disposing of certain assets. If, in any taxable </span><span>year, a Fund fails one of these tests and does not timely cure the failure, that Fund will be taxed in the same manner as an </span><span>ordinary corporation and distributions to its shareholders will not be deductible by that Fund in computing its taxable </span><span>income.</span></div> <div><span>Although, in general, the passive loss rules of the Internal Revenue Code do not apply to RICs, such rules do apply to a RIC </span><span>with respect to items attributable to interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships. A Fund's investments in partnerships, </span><span>including in qualified publicly-traded partnerships, may result in the Fund being subject to state, local, or non-U.S. income, </span><span>franchise or withholding tax liabilities.</span></div> <div><span>Taxation of RICs. </span><span> </span><span>As a RIC, a Fund will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of its taxable investment </span><span>income and capital gains that it distributes to its shareholders, provided that it satisfies a minimum distribution requirement. </span><span>To satisfy the minimum distribution requirement, a Fund must distribute to its shareholders at least the sum of (i) 90% of its </span><span>“</span><span>investment company taxable income</span><span>”</span><span> (</span><span>i.e.,</span><span> income other than its net realized long-term capital gain over its net realized </span><span>short-term capital loss), plus or minus certain adjustments, and (ii) 90% of its net tax-exempt income for the taxable year. A </span><span>Fund will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates on any taxable income or gains that it does not distribute to its </span><span>shareholders. If a Fund fails to qualify for any taxable year as a RIC or fails to meet the distribution requirement, all of its </span><span>taxable income will be subject to tax at regular corporate income tax rates without any deduction for distributions to </span><span>shareholders, and such distributions generally will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends to the extent of the </span><span>Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits. In such event, distributions to individuals should be eligible to be </span><span>treated as qualified dividend income and distributions to corporate shareholders generally should be eligible for the dividends </span><span>received deduction. Although each Fund intends to distribute substantially all of its net investment income and its capital </span><span>gains for each taxable year, a Fund may decide to retain a portion of its income or gains if the Fund determines that doing so </span><span>is in the interest of its shareholders. Each Fund will be subject to U.S. federal income taxation to the extent any such income </span><span>or gains are not distributed. If a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC in any year, it must pay out its earnings and profits accumulated </span><span>in that year in order to qualify again as a RIC.

For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital </span><span>gain net income retained by a Fund that is subject to corporate income tax will be considered to have been distributed by </span><span>year-end. In addition, the minimum amounts that must be distributed in any year to avoid the excise tax will be increased or </span><span>decreased to reflect any underdistribution or overdistribution, as the case may be, from the previous year.

However, if a Fund retains for investment an amount equal to all or a portion of its net long-term capital gains in </span><span>excess of its net short-term capital losses (including any capital loss carryovers), it will be subject to a corporate tax (at a flat </span><span>rate of 21%) on the amount retained. In that event, the Fund will designate such retained amounts as undistributed capital </span><span>gains in a notice to its shareholders who (a) will be required to include in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as </span><span>long-term capital gains, their proportionate shares of the undistributed amount, (b) will be entitled to credit their </span><span>proportionate shares of the tax paid by the Fund on the undistributed amount against their U.S. federal income tax liabilities, </span><span>if any, and to claim refunds to the extent their credits exceed their liabilities, if any, and (c) will be entitled to increase their tax </span><span>basis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in their shares by an amount equal to the excess of the amount in clause (a) over </span><span>the amount in clause (b). Organizations or persons not subject to U.S. federal income tax on such capital gains will be </span><span>entitled to a refund of their </span><span>pro rata</span><span> share of such taxes paid by the Fund upon filing appropriate returns or claims for refund </span><span>with the IRS.</span></div> <div><span>Distributions of net realized long-term capital gains, if any, that a Fund reports as capital gains dividends are taxable as long-term</span><span> capital gains, whether paid in cash or in shares and regardless of how long a shareholder has held shares of the Fund. </span><span>All other dividends of a Fund (including dividends from short-term capital gains) from its current and accumulated earnings </span><span>and profits (</span><span>“</span><span>regular dividends</span><span>”</span><span>) are generally subject to tax as ordinary income, subject to the discussion of qualified </span><span>dividend income below. Long-term capital gains are eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate </span><span>shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts.</span></div> <div><span>If an individual receives a regular dividend qualifying for the long-term capital gains rates and such dividend constitutes an </span><span>“</span><span>extraordinary dividend,</span><span>”</span><span> and the individual subsequently recognizes a loss on the sale or exchange of stock in respect of </span><span>which the extraordinary dividend was paid, then the loss will be long-term capital loss to the extent of such extraordinary </span><span>dividend.

Distributions in excess of a Fund’s minimum distribution </span><span>requirements, but not in excess of a Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute </span><span>nontaxable returns of capital. Shareholders receiving dividends or distributions in the form of additional shares should be </span><span>treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as receiving a distribution in an amount equal to the amount of money that the </span><span>shareholders receiving cash dividends or distributions will receive and should have a cost basis in the shares received equal to </span><span>such amount.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>A 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on net investment income, including, but not limited to, interest, </span><span>dividends, and net gain from investments, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and </span><span>filing jointly) and of estates and trusts.</span></div> <div><span>Investors considering buying shares just prior to a dividend or capital gain distribution should be aware that, although the </span><span>price of shares purchased at that time may reflect the amount of the forthcoming distribution, such dividend or distribution </span><span>may nevertheless be taxable to them. If a Fund is the holder of record of any security on the record date for any dividends </span><span>payable with respect to such security, such dividends will be included in the Fund’s gross income not as of the date received </span><span>but as of the later of (a) the date such security became ex-dividend with respect to such dividends (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, the date on which a </span><span>buyer of the security would not be entitled to receive the declared, but unpaid, dividends); or (b) the date the Fund acquired </span><span>such security. Accordingly, in order to satisfy its income distribution requirements, a Fund may be required to pay dividends </span><span>based on anticipated earnings, and shareholders may receive dividends in an earlier year than would otherwise be the case.</span></div> <div><span>In certain situations, a Fund may, for a taxable year, defer all or a portion of its net capital loss (or if there is no net capital </span><span>loss, then any net long-term or short-term capital loss) realized after October and its late-year ordinary loss (defined as the </span><span>sum of (i) the excess of post-October foreign currency and passive foreign investment company (</span><span>“</span><span>PFIC</span><span>”</span><span>) losses over post-October</span><span> foreign currency and PFIC gains and (ii) the excess of post-December ordinary losses over post-December ordinary </span><span>income) until the next taxable year in computing its investment company taxable income and net capital gain, which will </span><span>defer the recognition of such realized losses. Such deferrals and other rules regarding gains and losses realized after October </span><span>(or December) may affect the tax character of shareholder distributions.</span></div> <div><span>Sales of Shares. </span><span> </span><span>Upon the sale or exchange of shares of a Fund, a shareholder will realize a taxable gain or loss equal to the </span><span>difference between the amount realized and the shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund. A redemption of shares by a Fund </span><span>will be treated as a sale for this purpose. Such gain or loss will be treated as capital gain or loss if the shares are capital assets </span><span>in the shareholder’s hands and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the shares are held for more than one year and short-term</span><span> capital gain or loss if the shares are held for one year or less. Any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed </span><span>to the extent the shares disposed of are replaced, including replacement through the reinvesting of dividends or capital gains </span><span>distributions, or by an option or contract to acquire substantially identical shares, within a 61-day period beginning 30 days </span><span>before and ending 30 days after the disposition of the shares. In such a case, the basis of the shares acquired will be </span><span>increased to reflect the disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a shareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by the shareholder </span><span>for six months or less will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any </span><span>distributions or deemed distributions of long-term capital gains received by the shareholder with respect to such share. The </span><span>Medicare contribution tax described above will apply to the sale of Fund shares.</span></div> <div><span>If a shareholder incurs a sales charge in acquiring shares of a Fund, disposes of those shares within 90 days and then, on or </span><span>before January 31 of the following calendar year, acquires shares in a mutual fund for which the otherwise applicable sales </span><span>charge is reduced by reason of a reinvestment right (</span><span>e.g.</span><span>, an exchange privilege), the original sales charge will not be taken </span><span>into account in computing gain/loss on the original shares to the extent the subsequent sales charge is reduced. Instead, the </span><span>disregarded portion of the original sales charge will be added to the tax basis of the newly acquired shares. Furthermore, the </span><span>same rule also applies to a disposition of the newly acquired shares made within 90 days of the second acquisition. This </span><span>provision prevents shareholders from immediately deducting the sales charge by shifting their investments within a family of </span><span>mutual funds.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>120</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

If a Fund’s basis in </span><span>such securities on the date of deposit was less than market value on such date, the Fund, upon disposition of the securities, </span><span>would recognize more taxable gain or less taxable loss than if its basis in the securities had been equal to market value. It is </span><span>not anticipated that the Trust will exercise the right of rejection except in a case where the Trust determines that accepting </span><span>the order could result in material adverse tax consequences to a Fund or its shareholders. The Trust also has the right to </span><span>require information necessary to determine beneficial share ownership for purposes of the 80% determination.</span></div> <div><span>Taxation of Certain Derivatives.</span><span>  </span><span>A Fund’s transactions in zero coupon securities, non-U.S. currencies, forward contracts, </span><span>options and futures contracts (including options and futures contracts on non-U.S. currencies), to the extent permitted, will </span><span>be subject to special provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (including provisions relating to </span><span>“</span><span>hedging transactions</span><span>”</span><span> and </span><span>“</span><span>straddles</span><span>”</span><span>) that, among other consequences, may affect the character of gains and losses realized by the Fund (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, may </span><span>affect whether gains or losses are ordinary or capital), accelerate recognition of income to the Fund and defer Fund losses. </span><span>These rules could therefore affect the character, amount and timing of distributions to shareholders. These provisions also </span><span>(a) will require a Fund to mark-to-market certain types of the positions in its portfolio (</span><span>i.e.</span><span>, treat them as if they were closed </span><span>out at the end of each year) and (b) may cause a Fund to recognize income without receiving cash with which to pay </span><span>dividends or make distributions in amounts necessary to satisfy the distribution requirements for avoiding income and excise </span><span>taxes. Each Fund will monitor its transactions, will make the appropriate tax elections and will make the appropriate entries in </span><span>its books and records when it acquires any zero coupon security, non-U.S. currency, forward contract, option, futures </span><span>contract or hedged investment in order to mitigate the effect of these rules and prevent disqualification of a Fund as a RIC.</span></div> <div><span>A Fund’s investments in so-called </span><span>“</span><span>Section 1256 contracts,</span><span>”</span><span> such as regulated futures contracts, most non-U.S. currency </span><span>forward contracts traded in the interbank market and options on most security indexes, are subject to special tax rules. All </span><span>Section 1256 contracts held by a Fund at the end of its taxable year are required to be marked to their market value, and any </span><span>unrealized gain or loss on those positions will be included in a Fund’s income as if each position had been sold for its fair </span><span>market value at the end of the taxable year. The resulting gain or loss will be combined with any gain or loss realized by a </span><span>Fund from positions in Section 1256 contracts closed during the taxable year.

A Fund may also make or </span><span>receive a payment when a swap is terminated prior to maturity through an assignment of the swap or other closing </span><span>transaction. Periodic net payments will generally constitute ordinary income or deductions, while termination of a swap will </span><span>generally result in capital gain or loss (which will be a long-term capital gain or loss if a Fund has been a party to the swap for </span><span>more than one year). With respect to certain types of swaps, a Fund may be required to currently recognize income or loss </span><span>with respect to future payments on such swaps or may elect under certain circumstances to mark such swaps to market </span><span>annually for tax purposes as ordinary income or loss.</span></div> <div><span>Qualified Dividend Income. </span><span> </span><span>Distributions by a Fund of investment company taxable income (including any short-term </span><span>capital gains), whether received in cash or shares, will be taxable either as ordinary income or as qualified dividend income, </span><span>which is eligible to be taxed at long-term capital gain rates to the extent a Fund receives qualified dividend income on the </span><span>securities it holds and a Fund reports the distribution as qualified dividend income.

Dividends received by a Fund from a REIT or another RIC may be treated </span><span>as qualified dividend income only to the extent the dividend distributions are attributable to qualified dividend income </span><span>received by such REIT or other RIC. It is expected that dividends received by a Fund from a REIT and distributed to a </span><span>shareholder generally will be taxable to the shareholder as ordinary income. However, for tax years beginning after December </span><span>31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, a non-corporate taxpayer who is a direct REIT shareholder may claim a 20% </span><span>“</span><span>qualified </span><span>business income</span><span>”</span><span> deduction for ordinary REIT dividends, and a RIC may report dividends as eligible for this deduction to the </span><span>extent the RIC’s income is derived from ordinary REIT dividends (reduced by allocable RIC expenses). A shareholder may treat </span><span>the dividends as such provided the RIC and the shareholder satisfy applicable holding period requirements.

Restrictions may apply if indebtedness, including a short sale, is attributable to </span><span>the investment.</span></div> <div><span>Excess Inclusion Income. </span><span> </span><span>Under current law, the Funds serve to block unrelated business taxable income (</span><span>“</span><span>UBTI</span><span>”</span><span>) from </span><span>being realized by their tax-exempt shareholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a tax-exempt shareholder could realize UBTI </span><span>by virtue of its investment in a Fund if shares in the Fund constitute debt-financed property in the hands of the tax-exempt </span><span>shareholder within the meaning of Section 514(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. Certain types of income received by a Fund </span><span>from REITs, real estate mortgage investment conduits, taxable mortgage pools or other investments may cause the Fund to </span><span>report some or all of its distributions as </span><span>“</span><span>excess inclusion income.</span><span>”</span><span> To Fund shareholders, such excess inclusion income may: </span><span>(i) constitute taxable income, as UBTI for those shareholders who would otherwise be tax-exempt such as individual </span><span>retirement accounts, 401(k) accounts, Keogh plans, pension plans and certain charitable entities; (ii) not be offset by </span><span>otherwise allowable deductions for tax purposes; (iii) not be eligible for reduced U.S. withholding for non-U.S. shareholders </span><span>even from tax treaty countries; and (iv) cause the Fund to be subject to tax if certain </span><span>“</span><span>disqualified organizations,</span><span>”</span><span> as defined </span><span>by the Internal Revenue Code, are Fund shareholders. If a charitable remainder annuity trust or a charitable remainder </span><span>unitrust (each as defined in Section 664 of the Internal Revenue Code) has UBTI for a taxable year, a 100% excise tax on the </span><span>UBTI is imposed on the trust.</span></div> <div><span>Each Fund tries to avoid investing in REITs that are expected to generate excess inclusion income, but a Fund may not always </span><span>be successful in doing so. Because information about a REIT’s investments may be inadequate or inaccurate, or because a </span><span>REIT may change its investment program, a Fund may not be successful in avoiding the consequences described above. </span><span>Avoidance of investments in REITs that generate excess inclusion income may require a Fund to forego otherwise attractive </span><span>investment opportunities.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>122</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

In general, gains (and losses) realized on debt instruments will be treated as Section 988 gain (or </span><span>loss) to the extent attributable to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which the </span><span>instruments are denominated. Similarly, gains or losses on non-U.S. currency, non-U.S. currency forward contracts and </span><span>certain non-U.S. currency options or futures contracts denominated in non-U.S. currency, to the extent attributable to </span><span>fluctuations in exchange rates between the acquisition and disposition dates, are also treated as ordinary income or loss </span><span>unless a Fund was to elect otherwise.</span></div> <div><span>Certain Funds may be subject to non-U.S. income taxes withheld at the source. Each Fund, if permitted to do so, may elect to </span><span>“</span><span>pass through</span><span>”</span><span> to its investors the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid by the Fund provided that the Fund held the </span><span>security on the dividend settlement date and for at least 15 additional days immediately before and/or thereafter, with the </span><span>result that each investor with respect to shares of the Fund held for a minimum 16-day holding period at the time of deemed </span><span>distribution will (i) include in gross income, even though not actually received, the investor’s </span><span>pro rata</span><span> share of the Fund’s </span><span>non-U.S. income taxes, and (ii) either deduct (in calculating U.S. taxable income, but only for investors who itemize their </span><span>deductions on their personal tax returns) or credit (in calculating U.S. federal income tax) the investor’s </span><span>pro rata</span><span> share of the </span><span>Fund’s non-U.S. income taxes. Withholding taxes on dividends on non-U.S. securities while such securities are lent out by a </span><span>Fund are not eligible for non-U.S. tax credit pass through. Taxes not </span><span>“</span><span>passed through</span><span>”</span><span> for tax purposes will not be available to </span><span>shareholders for foreign tax credit purposes. A non-U.S. person invested in the Fund in a year that the Fund elects to </span><span>“</span><span>pass </span><span>through</span><span>”</span><span> its non-U.S. taxes may be treated as receiving additional dividend income subject to U.S. withholding tax. A non-U.S.</span><span> tax credit may not exceed the investor’s U.S. federal income tax otherwise payable with respect to the investor’s non-U.S. </span><span>source income. For this purpose, shareholders must treat as non-U.S. source gross income (i) their proportionate shares of </span><span>non-U.S. taxes paid by the Fund and (ii) the portion of any dividend paid by the Fund that represents income derived from </span><span>non-U.S. sources; the Fund’s gain from the sale of securities will generally be treated as U.S.-source income. Certain </span><span>limitations will be imposed to the extent to which the non-U.S. tax credit may be claimed. If your Fund shares are loaned </span><span>pursuant to securities lending arrangements, you may lose the ability to use any non-U.S. tax credits passed through by a </span><span>Fund or to treat Fund dividends (paid while the shares are held by the borrower) as qualified dividends. Regarding a short sale </span><span>with respect to shares of a Fund, substitute payments made to the lender of such shares may not be deductible under certain </span><span>circumstances. Consult your financial intermediary or tax advisor.</span></div> <div><span>Passive Foreign Investment Companies. </span><span> </span><span>If a Fund purchases shares in PFICs, it may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on </span><span>a portion of any </span><span>“</span><span>excess distribution</span><span>”</span><span> or gain from the disposition of such shares even if such income is distributed as a </span><span>taxable dividend by the Fund to its shareholders. Additional charges in the nature of interest may be imposed on the Fund in </span><span>respect of deferred taxes arising from such distributions or gains.</span></div> <div><span>If a Fund were to invest in a PFIC and elect to treat the PFIC as a </span><span>“</span><span>qualified electing fund</span><span>”</span><span> under the Internal Revenue Code, in </span><span>lieu of the foregoing requirements, a Fund might be required to include in income each year a portion of the ordinary </span><span>earnings and net capital gains of the qualified electing fund, even if not distributed to a Fund, and such amounts would be </span><span>subject to the 90% and excise tax distribution requirements described above. In order to make this election, a Fund would be </span><span>required to obtain certain annual information from the PFICs in which it invests, which may be difficult or impossible to </span><span>obtain. Currently proposed IRS regulations, if adopted, would treat such included amounts as nonqualifying RIC income to a </span><span>Fund unless such amounts were also distributed to the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>Alternatively, a Fund may make a mark-to-market election that would result in a Fund being treated as if it had sold and </span><span>repurchased its PFIC stock at the end of each year. In such case, a Fund would report any such gains as ordinary income and </span><span>would deduct any such losses as ordinary losses to the extent of previously recognized gains. The election must be made </span><span>separately for each PFIC owned by a Fund and, once made, would be effective for all subsequent taxable years, unless </span><span>revoked with the consent of the IRS. By making the election, a Fund could potentially ameliorate the adverse tax </span><span>consequences with respect to its ownership of shares in a PFIC, but in any particular year may be required to recognize </span><span>income in excess of the distributions it receives from PFICs and its proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock. A Fund may </span><span>have to distribute this </span><span>“</span><span>phantom</span><span>”</span><span> income and gain to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement and to avoid imposition of the </span><span>4% excise tax.</span></div> <div><span>A Fund will make the appropriate tax elections, if possible, and take any additional steps that are necessary to mitigate the </span><span>effects of these rules.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>123</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Reporting. </span><span> </span><span>If a shareholder recognizes a loss with respect to a Fund’s shares of $2 million or more for an individual </span><span>shareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate shareholder, the shareholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement </span><span>on IRS Form 8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases exempted from this reporting requirement, </span><span>but under current guidance, shareholders of a RIC are not exempted. The fact that a loss is reportable under these </span><span>regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer’s treatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders </span><span>should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual circumstances.</span></div> <div><span>Other Taxes. </span><span> </span><span>Dividends, distributions and redemption proceeds may also be subject to additional state, local and non-U.S. </span><span>taxes depending on each shareholder’s particular situation.</span></div> <div><span>Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders. </span><span> </span><span>Dividends paid by a Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are generally subject to withholding </span><span>tax at a 30% rate or a reduced rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty to the extent derived from investment income </span><span>and short-term capital gains. Dividends paid by a Fund from net tax-exempt income or long-term capital gains are generally </span><span>not subject to such withholding tax. In order to obtain a reduced rate of withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder will be required </span><span>to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying its entitlement to benefits under a treaty. The withholding </span><span>tax does not apply to regular dividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who provides an IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that the </span><span>dividends are effectively connected with the non-U.S. shareholder’s conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. Instead, </span><span>the effectively connected dividends will be subject to regular U.S. income tax as if the non-U.S. shareholder were a U.S. </span><span>shareholder. A non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively connected dividends may also be subject to additional </span><span>“</span><span>branch </span><span>profits tax</span><span>”</span><span> imposed at a rate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S. shareholder who fails to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN, </span><span>IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable form may be subject to backup withholding at the appropriate rate.</span></div> <div><span>Properly-reported dividends are generally exempt from U.S. federal withholding tax where they (i) are paid in respect of a </span><span>Fund’s </span><span>“</span><span>qualified net interest income</span><span>”</span><span> (generally, the Fund’s U.S. source interest income, other than certain contingent </span><span>interest and interest from obligations of a corporation or partnership in which the Fund is at least a 10% shareholder or </span><span>partner, reduced by expenses that are allocable to such income) or (ii) are paid in respect of a Fund’s </span><span>“</span><span>qualified short-term </span><span>capital gains</span><span>”</span><span> (generally, the excess of the Fund’s net short-term capital gain over the Fund’s long-term capital loss for such </span><span>taxable year). However, depending on its circumstances, a Fund may report all, some or none of its potentially eligible </span><span>dividends as such qualified net interest income or as qualified short-term capital gains and/or treat such dividends, in whole </span><span>or in part, as ineligible for this exemption from withholding. In order to qualify for this exemption from withholding, a non-U.S.</span><span> shareholder will need to comply with applicable certification requirements relating to its non-U.S. status (including, in </span><span>general, furnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or substitute Form). In the case of shares held through an </span><span>intermediary, the intermediary may withhold even if a Fund reports the payment as qualified net interest income or qualified </span><span>short-term capital gain. Non-U.S. shareholders should contact their intermediaries with respect to the application of these </span><span>rules to their accounts.</span></div> <div><span>Special rules may apply to a foreign shareholder receiving a Fund distribution if at least 50% of the Fund's assets consist of </span><span>interests in U.S. real property interests, including certain REITs and U.S. real property holding corporations (as defined in the </span><span>Internal Revenue Code and Treasury regulations). Fund distributions that are attributable to gains from the disposition of a </span><span>U.S. real property interest will be taxable as ordinary dividends and subject to withholding at a 30% or lower treaty rate if the </span><span>foreign shareholder held no more than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of </span><span>the distribution. If the foreign shareholder held at least 5% of the Fund's shares, the distribution would be treated as income </span><span>effectively connected with a trade or business within the U.S. and the foreign shareholder would be subject to withholding </span><span>tax at a rate of 21% and would generally be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return.</span></div> <div><span>Similar consequences would generally apply to a foreign shareholder's gain on the sale of Fund shares unless the Fund is </span><span>domestically controlled (meaning that more than 50% of the value of the Fund's shares is held by U.S. shareholders) or the </span><span>foreign shareholder owns no more than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of </span><span>sale. Finally, a domestically controlled Fund may be required to recognize a portion of its gain on the in-kind distribution of </span><span>certain U.S. real property interests. Shareholders that are nonresident aliens or foreign entities are urged to consult their own </span><span>tax advisors concerning the particular tax consequences to them of an investment in the Fund.</span></div> <div><span>The rules laid out in the previous two paragraphs, other than the withholding rules, will apply notwithstanding a Fund’s </span><span>participation in a wash sale transaction or its payment of a substitute dividend.</span></div> <div><span>Shareholders that are nonresident aliens or foreign entities are urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning the </span><span>particular tax consequences to them of an investment in a Fund.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>124</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Introduction to BlackRock</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock’s purpose is to help more and more people experience financial well-being. We manage assets on behalf of </span><span>institutional and individual clients, across a full spectrum of investment strategies, asset classes, and regions. Our client base </span><span>includes pension plans, endowments, foundations, charities, official institutions, insurers, and other financial institutions, as </span><span>well as individuals around the world. As part of our fiduciary duty to our clients, we consider it one of our responsibilities to </span><span>promote sound corporate governance, as an informed, engaged shareholder on their behalf. At BlackRock, this is the </span><span>responsibility of the Investment Stewardship team.</span></div> <div><span>Philosophy on investment stewardship</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Companies are responsible for ensuring they have appropriate governance structures to serve the interests of shareholders </span><span>and other key stakeholders. We believe that there are certain fundamental rights attached to shareholding. Companies and </span><span>their boards should be accountable to shareholders and structured with appropriate checks and balances to ensure that they </span><span>operate in shareholders’ best interests to create sustainable value. Shareholders should have the right to vote to elect, </span><span>remove, and nominate directors, approve the appointment of the auditor, and amend the corporate charter or by-laws. </span><span>Shareholders should be able to vote on key board decisions that are material to the protection of their investment, including </span><span>but not limited to, changes to the purpose of the business, dilution levels and pre-emptive rights, and the distribution of </span><span>income and capital structure. In order to make informed decisions, shareholders need sufficient and timely information. In </span><span>addition, shareholder voting rights should be proportionate to their economic ownership—the principle of </span><span>“</span><span>one share, one </span><span>vote</span><span>”</span><span> helps achieve this balance.</span></div> <div><span>Consistent with these shareholder rights, BlackRock has a responsibility to monitor and provide feedback to companies in our </span><span>role as stewards of our clients’ investments. Investment stewardship is how we use our voice as an investor to promote </span><span>sound corporate governance and business practices to help maximize long-term shareholder value for our clients, the vast </span><span>majority of whom are investing for long-term goals such as retirement. BlackRock Investment Stewardship (BIS) does this </span><span>through engagement with management teams and/or board members on material business issues and, for those clients </span><span>who have given us authority, through voting proxies in their best long-term financial interests.</span><span>1</span><span> We also contribute to </span><span>consultations on public policy and private sector initiatives on industry standards, consistent with our clients’ interests as </span><span>long-term shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock looks to companies to provide timely, accurate, and comprehensive disclosure on all material governance and </span><span>business matters. This transparency allows shareholders to appropriately understand and assess how relevant risks and </span><span>opportunities are being effectively identified and managed. Where company reporting and disclosure is inadequate or where </span><span>the governance approach taken may be inconsistent with durable, long-term value creation for shareholders, we will engage </span><span>with a company and/or vote in a manner that advances long-term shareholders’ interests.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock views engagement as an important activity; engagement provides us with the opportunity to improve our </span><span>understanding of the business and of the risks and opportunities that are material to the companies in which our clients </span><span>invest. Engagement may also inform our voting decisions. As long-term investors on behalf of clients, we seek to have regular </span><span>and continuing dialogue with executives and board directors to advance sound governance and durable business practices </span><span>aligned with long-term value creation, as well as to understand the effectiveness of the company’s management and </span><span>oversight of material issues. Engagement is an important mechanism for providing feedback on company practices and </span><span>disclosures, particularly where we believe they could be enhanced to support a company’s ability to deliver financial </span><span>performance. Similarly, it provides us with an opportunity to hear directly from company boards and management on how </span><span>they believe their actions are aligned with durable, long-term value creation.</span></div> <div><span>We generally vote in support of management and boards that exhibit an approach to decision-making that is consistent with </span><span>creating durable, long-term value for shareholders. If we have concerns about a company’s approach, we may choose to </span><span>explain our expectations to the company’s board and management. Following that engagement, we may signal through our </span><span>voting that we have outstanding concerns, generally by voting against the re-election of directors we view as having </span><span>responsibility for an issue. We apply our regional proxy voting guidelines to achieve the outcome that is most aligned with </span><span>our clients’ long-term financial interests.</span></div> <div><span>Key Themes</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>1</span></div> <div><span>Through BlackRock Voting Choice we have, since January 2022, made proxy voting easier and more accessible for investors in separate accounts and </span><span>certain pooled vehicles. As a result, the shares attributed to BlackRock in company share registers may be voted differently depending on whether our </span><span>clients have authorized BIS to vote on their behalf, have authorized BIS to vote in accordance with a third party policy, or have elected to vote shares in </span><span>accordance with their own policy. We are not able to disclose which clients have opted to exercise greater control over their voting, nor are we able to </span><span>disclose which proxy voting policies they have selected.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-4</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>We recognize that accepted standards and norms of corporate governance can differ between markets. However, in our </span><span>experience, there are certain fundamental elements of governance practice that are intrinsic globally to a company’s ability to </span><span>create long-term value for shareholders. These global themes are set out in this overarching set of principles (the Principles), </span><span>which are anchored in transparency and accountability. At a minimum, it is our view that companies should observe the </span><span>accepted corporate governance standards in their domestic market and ask that, if they do not, they explain how their </span><span>approach better supports durable, long-term value creation.</span></div> <div><span>These Principles cover seven key themes:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Boards and directors</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Auditors and audit-related issues</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Capital structure, mergers, asset sales, and other special transactions</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Compensation and benefits</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Material sustainability-related risks and opportunities</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Other corporate governance matters and shareholder protections</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Shareholder proposals</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>Our regional and market-specific </span><span>voting guidelines</span><span> explain how these Principles inform our voting decisions in relation to </span><span>specific ballot items for shareholder meetings.</span></div> <div><span>Boards and directors</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Our primary focus is on the performance of the board of directors to promote sound corporate governance. The performance </span><span>of the board is critical to the economic success of the company and the protection of shareholders’ interests. As part of their </span><span>responsibilities, board members owe fiduciary duties to shareholders in overseeing the strategic direction and operation of </span><span>the company. For this reason, BIS sees engaging with and the election of directors as one of our most important and </span><span>impactful responsibilities.</span></div> <div><span>We support boards whose approach is consistent with creating durable, long-term value. This includes the effective </span><span>corporate governance and management of material sustainability-related risks and opportunities,</span><span>2</span><span> as well as the </span><span>consideration of the company’s key constituents including their employees, clients, suppliers, and the communities within </span><span>which they operate. The board should establish and maintain a framework of robust and effective governance mechanisms </span><span>to support its oversight of the company’s strategic aims. We look to the board to articulate the effectiveness of these </span><span>mechanisms in overseeing the management of business risks and opportunities and the fulfillment of the company’s </span><span>purpose. Disclosure of all material issues that affect the company’s long-term strategy and ability to create value is essential </span><span>for shareholders to be able to appropriately understand and assess how risks are effectively identified, managed and </span><span>mitigated.</span></div> <div><span>Where a company has not adequately disclosed and demonstrated that they have fulfilled these responsibilities, we will </span><span>consider voting against the re-election of directors whom we consider to have particular responsibility for the issue. We </span><span>assess director performance on a case-by-case basis and in light of each company’s circumstances, taking into consideration </span><span>our assessment of their governance, business practices that support durable, long-term value creation, and performance. In </span><span>serving the interests of shareholders, the responsibility of the board of directors includes, but is not limited to, the following:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Establishing an appropriate corporate governance structure</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Supporting and overseeing management in setting long-term strategic goals and applicable measures of value-creation </span><span>and milestones that will demonstrate progress, and taking steps to address anticipated or actual obstacles to success</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Providing oversight on the identification and management of material governance and sustainability-related risks</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>2</span></div> <div><span>By material sustainability-related risks and opportunities, we mean the drivers of risk and value creation in a company’s business model that have an </span><span>environmental or social dependency or impact. Examples of environmental issues include, but are not limited to, water use, land use, waste </span><span>management and climate risk. Examples of social issues include, but are not limited to, human capital management, impacts on the communities in </span><span>which a company operates, customer loyalty and relationships with regulators. It is our view that well-managed companies will effectively evaluate </span><span>and manage material sustainability-related risks and opportunities relevant to their businesses. Governance is the core means by which boards can </span><span>oversee the creation of durable, long-term value. Appropriate risk oversight of business-relevant and material sustainability-related considerations is a </span><span>component of a sound governance framework.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-5</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

Set out below are ways in which boards and directors can demonstrate a commitment to acting in the </span><span>best long-term economic interests of all shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>We will seek to engage with the appropriate directors where we have concerns about the performance of the company, </span><span>board, or individual directors and may signal outstanding concerns in our voting. While we consider these principles to be </span><span>globally relevant, when assessing a board’s composition and governance processes, we consider local market norms and </span><span>regulations.</span></div> <div><span>Regular accountability</span></div> <div><span>It is our view that directors should stand for re-election on a regular basis, ideally annually. In our experience, annual re-elections</span><span> allow shareholders to reaffirm their support for board members or hold them accountable for their decisions in a </span><span>timely manner. When board members are not re-elected annually, in our experience, it is good practice for boards to have a </span><span>rotation policy to ensure that, through a board cycle, all directors have had their appointment re-confirmed, with a </span><span>proportion of directors being put forward for re-election at each annual general meeting.</span></div> <div><span>Effective board composition</span></div> <div><span>Regular director elections also give boards the opportunity to adjust their composition in an orderly way to reflect the </span><span>evolution of the company’s strategy and the market environment. In our view, it is beneficial for new directors to be brought </span><span>onto the board periodically to refresh the group’s thinking and in a manner that supports both continuity and appropriate </span><span>succession planning. We consider the average overall tenure of the board, where we are seeking a balance between the </span><span>knowledge and experience of longer-serving members and the fresh perspectives of newer members. We encourage </span><span>companies to keep under regular review the effectiveness of their board (including its size), and assess directors nominated </span><span>for election or re-election in the context of the composition of the board as a whole. This assessment should consider a </span><span>number of factors, including the potential need to address gaps in skills, experience, independence, and diversity.</span></div> <div><span>In our view, there should be a sufficient number of independent directors, free from conflicts of interest or undue influence </span><span>from connected parties, to ensure objectivity in the decision-making of the board and its ability to oversee management. </span><span>Common impediments to independence may include but are not limited to:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Current or recent employment at the company or subsidiary</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Being, or representing, a shareholder with a substantial shareholding in the company</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Interlocking directorships</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Having any other interest, business or other relationship which could, or could reasonably be perceived to, materially </span><span>interfere with a director’s ability to act in the best interests of the company and their shareholders</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>In our experience, boards are most effective at overseeing and advising management when there is a senior independent </span><span>board leader. This director may chair the board, or, where the chair is also the CEO (or is otherwise not independent), be </span><span>designated as a lead independent director. The role of this director is to enhance the effectiveness of the independent </span><span>members of the board through shaping the agenda, ensuring adequate information is provided to the board, and </span><span>encouraging independent director participation in board deliberations. The lead independent director or another appropriate </span><span>director should be available to shareholders in those situations where an independent director is best placed to explain and </span><span>contextualize a company’s approach.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>3</span></div> <div><span>Enterprise risk management is a process, effected by the entity’s board of directors, management, and other personnel, applied in strategy setting and </span><span>across the enterprise, designed to identify potential events that may affect the entity, and manage risk to be within the risk appetite, to provide </span><span>reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives.

<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>When nominating new directors to the board, we look to companies to provide sufficient information on the individual </span><span>candidates so that shareholders can assess the suitability of each individual nominee and the overall board composition. </span><span>These disclosures should give an understanding of how the collective experience and expertise of the board aligns with the </span><span>company’s long-term strategy and business model. Highly qualified, engaged directors with professional characteristics </span><span>relevant to a company’s business enhance the ability of the board to add value and be the voice of shareholders in board </span><span>discussions. In our view, a strong board provides a competitive advantage to a company, providing valuable oversight and </span><span>contributing to the most important management decisions that support long-term financial performance.</span></div> <div><span>It is in this context that we are interested in diversity in the board room. We see it as a means to promoting diversity of </span><span>thought and avoiding </span><span>“</span><span>group think</span><span>”</span><span> in the board’s exercise of its responsibilities to advise and oversee management. It allows </span><span>boards to have deeper discussions and make more resilient decisions. We ask boards to disclose how diversity is considered </span><span>in board composition, including professional characteristics, such as a director’s industry experience, specialist areas of </span><span>expertise and geographic location; as well as demographic characteristics such as gender, race/ethnicity and age.</span></div> <div><span>We look to understand a board’s diversity in the context of a company’s domicile, market capitalization, business model and </span><span>strategy. Increasingly, we see leading boards adding members whose experience deepens the board’s understanding of the </span><span>company’s customers, employees and communities. Self-identified board demographic diversity can usefully be disclosed in </span><span>aggregate, consistent with local law. We believe boards should aspire to meaningful diversity of membership, at least </span><span>consistent with local regulatory requirements and best practices, while recognizing that building a strong, diverse board can </span><span>take time.</span></div> <div><span>This position is based on our view that diversity of perspective and thought – in the board room, in the management team </span><span>and throughout the company – leads to better long term economic outcomes for companies. Academic research already </span><span>reveals correlations between specific dimensions of diversity and effects on decision-making processes and outcomes.</span><span>4</span><span> In </span><span>our experience, greater diversity in the board room contributes to more robust discussions and more innovative and resilient </span><span>decisions. Over time, greater diversity in the board room can also promote greater diversity and resilience in the leadership </span><span>team, and the workforce more broadly. That diversity can enable companies to develop businesses that more closely reflect </span><span>and resonate with the customers and communities they serve.</span></div> <div><span>There are matters for which the board has responsibility that may involve a conflict of interest for executives or for affiliated </span><span>directors. It is our view that objective oversight of such matters is best achieved when the board forms committees </span><span>comprised entirely of independent directors. In many markets, these committees of the board specialize in audit, director </span><span>nominations, and compensation matters. An ad hoc committee might also be formed to decide on a special transaction, </span><span>particularly one involving a related party, or to investigate a significant adverse event.</span></div> <div><span>Sufficient capacity</span></div> <div><span>As the role and expectations of a director are increasingly demanding, directors must be able to commit an appropriate </span><span>amount of time to board and committee matters. It is important that directors have the capacity to meet all of their </span><span>responsibilities - including when there are unforeseen events – and therefore, they should not take on an excessive number of </span><span>roles that would impair their ability to fulfill their duties.</span></div> <div><span>Auditors and audit-related issues</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock recognizes the critical importance of financial statements, which should provide a true and fair picture of a </span><span>company’s financial condition. Accordingly, the assumptions made by management and reviewed by the auditor in preparing </span><span>the financial statements should be reasonable and justified.</span></div> <div><span>The accuracy of financial statements, inclusive of financial and non-financial information as required or permitted under </span><span>market-specific accounting rules, is of paramount importance to BlackRock. Investors increasingly recognize that a broader </span><span>range of risks and opportunities have the potential to materially impact financial performance. Over time, we anticipate </span><span>investors and other users of company reporting will increasingly seek to understand and scrutinize the assumptions </span><span>underlying financial statements, particularly those that pertain to the impact of the transition to a low carbon economy on a </span><span>company’s business model and asset mix. We recognize that this is an area of evolving practice and we look to international </span><span>standards setters, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International Auditing and Assurance </span><span>Standards Board (IAASB) to provide additional guidance to companies.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>4</span></div> <div><span>For a discussion on the different impacts of diversity see: McKinsey, </span><span>“</span><span>Diversity Wins: How Inclusion Matters</span><span>”</span><span>, May 2022; Harvard Business Review, </span><span>Diverse Teams Feel Less Comfortable – and That’s Why They Perform Better, September 2016; </span><span>“</span><span>Do Diverse Directors Influence DEI Outcomes</span><span>”</span><span>, </span><span>September 2022.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-7</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
<p> </p>
<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>In this context, audit committees, or equivalent, play a vital role in a company’s financial reporting system by providing </span><span>independent oversight of the accounts, material financial and, where appropriate to the jurisdiction, non-financial </span><span>information, internal control frameworks, and in the absence of a dedicated risk committee, Enterprise Risk Management </span><span>systems. In our view, effective audit committee oversight strengthens the quality and reliability of a company’s financial </span><span>statements and provides an important level of reassurance to shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>We hold members of the audit committee or equivalent responsible for overseeing the management of the audit function. </span><span>Audit committees or equivalent should have clearly articulated charters that set out their responsibilities and have a rotation </span><span>plan in place that allows for a periodic refreshment of the committee membership to introduce fresh perspectives to audit </span><span>oversight. We recognize that audit committees will rely on management, internal audit and the independent auditor in </span><span>fulfilling their responsibilities but look to committee members to demonstrate they have relevant expertise to monitor and </span><span>oversee those functions.</span></div> <div><span>We take particular note of unexplained changes in reporting methodology, cases involving significant financial restatements, </span><span>or ad hoc notifications of material financial weakness. In this respect, audit committees should provide timely disclosure on </span><span>the remediation of Key and Critical Audit Matters identified either by the external auditor or internal audit function.</span></div> <div><span>The integrity of financial statements depends on the auditor being free of any impediments to being an effective check on </span><span>management. To that end, it is important that auditors are, and are seen to be, independent. Where an audit firm provides </span><span>services to the company in addition to the audit, the fees earned should be disclosed and explained. Audit committees </span><span>should have in place a procedure for assessing annually the independence of the auditor and the quality of the external audit </span><span>process.</span></div> <div><span>Comprehensive disclosure provides investors with a sense of the company’s long-term operational risk management </span><span>practices and, more broadly, the quality of the board’s oversight. The audit committee or equivalent, or a dedicated risk </span><span>committee, should periodically review the company’s risk assessment and risk management policies and the significant risks </span><span>and exposures identified by management, the internal auditors or the independent accountants, and management’s steps to </span><span>address them. In the absence of robust disclosures, we may reasonably conclude that companies are not adequately </span><span>managing risk.</span></div> <div><span>Capital structure, mergers, asset sales, and other special transactions</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The capital structure of a company is critical to shareholders as it impacts the value of their investment and the priority of </span><span>their interest in the company relative to that of other equity or debt investors. Pre-emptive rights are a key protection for </span><span>shareholders against the dilution of their interests.</span></div> <div><span>Effective voting rights are basic rights of share ownership. It is our view that one vote for one share as a guiding principle </span><span>supports effective corporate governance. Shareholders, as the residual claimants, have the strongest interest in protecting </span><span>company value, and voting rights should match economic exposure.</span></div> <div><span>In principle, we disagree with the creation of a share class with equivalent economic exposure and preferential, differentiated </span><span>voting rights. In our view, this structure violates the fundamental corporate governance principle of proportionality and </span><span>results in a concentration of power in the hands of a few shareholders, thus disenfranchising other shareholders and </span><span>amplifying any potential conflicts of interest. However, we recognize that in certain markets, at least for a period of time, </span><span>companies may have a valid argument for listing dual classes of shares with differentiated voting rights. In our view, such </span><span>companies should review these share class structures on a regular basis or as company circumstances change.</span></div> <div><span>Additionally, they should seek shareholder approval of their capital structure on a periodic basis via a management proposal </span><span>at the company’s shareholder meeting. The proposal should give unaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to affirm the </span><span>current structure or establish mechanisms to end or phase out controlling structures at the appropriate time, while </span><span>minimizing costs to shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>In assessing mergers, asset sales, or other special transactions, BlackRock’s primary consideration is the long-term economic </span><span>interests of our clients as shareholders. Boards proposing a transaction need to clearly explain the economic and strategic </span><span>rationale behind it. We will review a proposed transaction to determine the degree to which it can enhance long-term </span><span>shareholder value. We would prefer that proposed transactions have the unanimous support of the board and have been </span><span>negotiated at arm’s length. We may seek reassurance from the board that executives’ and/or board members’ financial </span><span>interests in a given transaction have not adversely affected their ability to place shareholders’ interests before their own. </span><span>Where the transaction involves related parties, the recommendation to support should come from the independent directors, </span><span>a best practice in most markets, and ideally, the terms should have been assessed through an independent appraisal process. </span><span>In addition, it is good practice that it be approved by a separate vote of the non-conflicted parties.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-8</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>As a matter of sound governance practice, shareholders should have a right to dispose of company shares in the open </span><span>market without unnecessary restriction. In our view, corporate mechanisms designed to limit shareholders’ ability to sell their </span><span>shares are contrary to basic property rights. Such mechanisms can serve to protect and entrench interests other than those </span><span>of the shareholders. In our experience, shareholders are broadly capable of making decisions in their own best interests. We </span><span>encourage any so-called </span><span>“</span><span>shareholder rights plans</span><span>”</span><span> proposed by a board to be subject to shareholder approval upon </span><span>introduction and periodically thereafter.</span></div> <div><span>Compensation and benefits</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>In most markets, one of the most important roles for a company’s board of directors is to put in place a compensation </span><span>structure that incentivizes and rewards executives appropriately. There should be a clear link between variable pay and </span><span>operational and financial performance. Performance metrics should be stretching and aligned with a company’s strategy and </span><span>business model. BIS does not have a position on the use of sustainability-related criteria, but in our view, where companies </span><span>choose to include them, they should be as rigorous as other financial or operational targets. Long-term incentive plans </span><span>should vest over timeframes aligned with the delivery of long-term shareholder value. Compensation committees should </span><span>guard against contractual arrangements that would entitle executives to material compensation for early termination of their </span><span>employment. Finally, pension contributions and other deferred compensation arrangements should be reasonable in light of </span><span>market practice.</span></div> <div><span>We are not supportive of one-off or special bonuses unrelated to company or individual performance. Where discretion has </span><span>been used by the compensation committee or its equivalent, we expect disclosure relating to how and why the discretion </span><span>was used, and how the adjusted outcome is aligned with the interests of shareholders. We acknowledge that the use of peer </span><span>group evaluation by compensation committees can help ensure competitive pay; however, we are concerned when the </span><span>rationale for increases in total compensation at a company is solely based on peer benchmarking rather than a rigorous </span><span>measure of outperformance. We encourage companies to clearly explain how compensation outcomes have rewarded </span><span>outperformance against peer firms.</span></div> <div><span>We believe consideration should be given to building claw back provisions into incentive plans such that executives would be </span><span>required to forgo rewards when they are not justified by actual performance and/or when compensation was based on faulty </span><span>financial reporting or deceptive business practices. We also favor recoupment from any senior executive whose behavior </span><span>caused material financial harm to shareholders, material reputational risk to the company, or resulted in a criminal </span><span>investigation, even if such actions did not ultimately result in a material restatement of past results.</span></div> <div><span>Non-executive directors should be compensated in a manner that is commensurate with the time and effort expended in </span><span>fulfilling their professional responsibilities. Additionally, these compensation arrangements should not risk compromising </span><span>directors’ independence or aligning their interests too closely with those of the management, whom they are charged with </span><span>overseeing.</span></div> <div><span>We use third party research, in addition to our own analysis, to evaluate existing and proposed compensation structures. We </span><span>may vote against members of the compensation committee or equivalent board members for poor compensation practices </span><span>or structures.</span></div> <div><span>Material sustainability-related risks and opportunities</span></div> <div><span>It is our view that well-managed companies will effectively evaluate and manage material sustainability-related risks and </span><span>opportunities relevant to their businesses. Appropriate oversight of sustainability considerations is a core component of </span><span>having an effective governance framework, which supports durable, long-term value creation.</span></div> <div><span>Robust disclosure is essential for investors to effectively evaluate companies’ strategy and business practices related to </span><span>material sustainability-related risks and opportunities. Given the increased understanding of material sustainability-related </span><span>risks and opportunities and the need for better information to assess them, BlackRock advocates for continued improvement </span><span>in companies’ reporting, where necessary, and will express any concerns through our voting where a company’s actions or </span><span>disclosures are inadequate.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock encourages companies to use the framework developed by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial </span><span>Disclosures (TCFD) to disclose their approach to ensuring they have a sustainable business model and to supplement that </span><span>disclosure with industry-specific metrics such as those identified by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), </span><span>now part of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) under the International Financial Reporting Standards </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-9</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

SASB’s industry-specific </span><span>guidance (as identified in its materiality map) is beneficial in helping companies identify key performance indicators (KPIs) </span><span>across various dimensions of sustainability that are considered to be financially material and decision-useful within their </span><span>industry. In particular, we encourage companies to consider reporting on nature-related factors, given the growing materiality </span><span>of these issues for many businesses.</span><span>6</span><span> We recognize that some companies may report using different standards, which may </span><span>be required by regulation, or one of a number of voluntary standards. In such cases, we ask that companies highlight the </span><span>metrics that are industry- or company-specific.</span></div> <div><span>Climate and other sustainability-related disclosures often require companies to collect and aggregate data from various </span><span>internal and external sources. We recognize that the practical realities of data-collection and reporting may not line up with </span><span>financial reporting cycles and companies may require additional time after their fiscal year-end to accurately collect, analyze </span><span>and report this data to investors. To give investors time to assess the data, we encourage companies to produce climate and </span><span>other sustainability-related disclosures sufficiently in advance of their annual meeting.</span></div> <div><span>Companies may also adopt or refer to guidance on sustainable and responsible business conduct issued by supranational </span><span>organizations such as the United Nations or the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Further, industry </span><span>initiatives on managing specific operational risks may provide useful guidance to companies on best practices and </span><span>disclosures. Companies should disclose any relevant global climate and other sustainability-related standards adopted, the </span><span>industry initiatives in which they participate, any peer group benchmarking undertaken, and any assurance processes to help </span><span>investors understand their approach to sustainable and responsible business practices.</span></div> <div><span>Climate risk</span></div> <div><span>It is our view that climate change has become a key factor in many companies’ long-term prospects. As such, as long-term </span><span>investors we are interested in understanding how companies may be impacted by material climate-related risks and </span><span>opportunities – just as we seek to understand other business-relevant risks and opportunities – and how these factors are </span><span>considered within strategy in a manner consistent with the company’s business model and sector. Specifically, we look for </span><span>companies to disclose strategies they have in place that mitigate and are resilient to any material risks to their long-term </span><span>business model associated with a range of climate-related scenarios, including a scenario in which global warming is limited </span><span>to well below 2°C, considering global ambitions to achieve a limit of 1.5°C.</span><span>7</span><span> It is, of course, up to each company to define </span><span>their own strategy: that is not the role of BlackRock or other investors.</span></div> <div><span>BIS recognizes that climate change can be challenging for many companies, as they seek to drive long-term value by </span><span>mitigating risks and capturing opportunities. A growing number of companies, financial institutions, as well as governments, </span><span>have committed to advancing decarbonization in line with the Paris Agreement. There is growing consensus that companies </span><span>can benefit from the more favorable macro-economic environment under an orderly, timely and equitable global energy </span><span>transition.</span><span>8</span><span> Yet the path ahead is deeply uncertain and uneven, with different parts of the economy moving at different </span><span>speeds.</span><span>9</span><span> Many companies are asking what their role should be in contributing to an orderly and equitable transition – in </span><span>ensuring a reliable energy supply and energy security, and in protecting the most vulnerable from energy price shocks and </span><span>economic dislocation. In this context, we encourage companies to include in their disclosure a business plan for how they </span><span>intend to deliver long-term financial performance through a transition to global net zero carbon emissions, consistent with </span><span>their business model and sector.</span></div> <div><span>We look to companies to disclose short-, medium- and long-term targets, ideally science-based targets where these are </span><span>available for their sector, for Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reductions and to demonstrate how their </span><span>targets are consistent with the long-term economic interests of their shareholders.

We also recognize that continued investment in traditional energy sources, including oil and </span><span>gas, is required to maintain an orderly and equitable transition — and that divestiture of carbon-intensive assets is unlikely to </span><span>contribute to global emissions reductions. We encourage companies to disclose how their capital allocation to various energy </span><span>sources is consistent with their strategy.</span></div> <div><span>At this stage, we view Scope 3 emissions differently from Scopes 1 and 2, given methodological complexity, regulatory </span><span>uncertainty, concerns about double-counting, and lack of direct control by companies. While we welcome any disclosures </span><span>and commitments companies choose to make regarding Scope 3 emissions, we recognize these are provided on a good-faith </span><span>basis as methodology develops. Our publicly available commentary provides more information on our approach to climate </span><span>risk.</span></div> <div><span>Key stakeholder interests</span></div> <div><span>In order to advance long-term shareholders’ interests, companies should consider the interests of the various parties on </span><span>whom they depend for their success over time. It is for each company to determine their key stakeholders based on what is </span><span>material to their business and long-term financial performance. Most commonly, key stakeholders include employees, </span><span>business partners (such as suppliers and distributors), clients and consumers, regulators, and the communities in which they </span><span>operate.</span></div> <div><span>Considering the interests of key stakeholders recognizes the collective nature of long-term value creation and the extent to </span><span>which each company’s prospects for growth are tied to its ability to foster strong sustainable relationships with and support </span><span>from those stakeholders. Companies should articulate how they address adverse impacts that could arise from their business </span><span>practices and affect critical business relationships with their stakeholders. We encourage companies to implement, to the </span><span>extent appropriate, monitoring processes (often referred to as due diligence) to identify and mitigate potential adverse </span><span>impacts and grievance mechanisms to remediate any actual adverse material impacts. In our view, maintaining trust within </span><span>these relationships can contribute to a company’s long-term success.</span></div> <div><span>As a long-term shareholder on behalf of our clients, we find it helpful when companies disclose how they have identified </span><span>their key stakeholders and considered their interests in business decision-making. We are also interested to understand the </span><span>role of the board, which is well positioned to ensure that the approach taken is informed by and aligns with the company’s </span><span>strategy and purpose.</span></div> <div><span>Other corporate governance matters and shareholder protections</span></div> <div><span>It is our view that shareholders have a right to material and timely information on the financial performance and viability of </span><span>the companies in which they invest. In addition, companies should publish information on the governance structures in place </span><span>and the rights of shareholders to influence these structures. The reporting and disclosure provided by companies help </span><span>shareholders assess whether their economic interests have been protected and the quality of the board’s oversight of </span><span>management. We believe shareholders should have the right to vote on key corporate governance matters, including </span><span>changes to governance mechanisms, to submit proposals to the shareholders’ meeting, and to call special meetings of </span><span>shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>Corporate Form</span></div> <div><span>In our view, it is the responsibility of the board to determine the corporate form that is most appropriate given the company’s </span><span>purpose and business model.</span><span>10</span><span> Companies proposing to change their corporate form to a public benefit corporation or </span><span>similar entity should put it to a shareholder vote if not already required to do so under applicable law. Supporting </span><span>documentation from companies or shareholder proponents proposing to alter the corporate form should clearly articulate </span><span>how the interests of shareholders and different stakeholders would be impacted as well as the accountability and voting </span><span>mechanisms that would be available to shareholders. As a fiduciary on behalf of clients, we generally support management </span><span>proposals if our analysis indicates that shareholders’ interests are adequately protected. Relevant shareholder proposals are </span><span>evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</span></div> <div><span>Shareholder proposals</span></div> <div><span>In most markets in which BlackRock invests on behalf of clients, shareholders have the right to submit proposals to be voted </span><span>on by shareholders at a company’s annual or extraordinary meeting, as long as eligibility and procedural requirements are </span><span>met. The matters that we see put forward by shareholders address a wide range of topics, including governance reforms, </span><span>capital management, and improvements in the management or disclosure of sustainability-related risks.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>10</span></div> <div><span>Corporate form refers to the legal structure by which a business is organized.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-11</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

As noted above, we can vote, on behalf of clients who authorize us to do so, on proposals put forth by </span><span>others.</span></div> <div><span>When assessing shareholder proposals, we evaluate each proposal on its merit, with a singular focus on its implications for </span><span>long-term value creation. We consider the business and economic relevance of the issue raised, as well as its materiality and </span><span>the urgency with which we believe it should be addressed. We take into consideration the legal effect of the proposal, as </span><span>shareholder proposals may be advisory or legally binding depending on the jurisdiction. We would not support proposals that </span><span>we believe would result in over-reaching into the basic business decisions of the company.</span></div> <div><span>Where a proposal is focused on a material governance or sustainability-related risk that we agree needs to be addressed and </span><span>the intended outcome is consistent with long-term value creation, we will look to the board and management to </span><span>demonstrate that the company has met the intent of the request made in the shareholder proposal. Where our analysis </span><span>and/or engagement indicate an opportunity for improvement in the company’s approach to the issue, we may support </span><span>shareholder proposals that are reasonable and not unduly prescriptive or constraining on management. Alternatively, or in </span><span>addition, we may vote against the re-election of one or more directors if, in our assessment, the board has not responded </span><span>sufficiently or with an appropriate sense of urgency. While we may not agree with all aspects of a shareholder proponent’s </span><span>views or all facets of the proponent’s supporting statement, we may still support proposals that address material governance </span><span>or sustainability-related risks where we believe it would be helpful for shareholders to have more detailed information on how </span><span>those risks are identified, monitored, and managed to support a company’s ability to deliver long-term financial returns. We </span><span>may also support a proposal if management is on track, but we believe that voting in favor might accelerate progress.</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock’s oversight of its investment stewardship activities</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Oversight</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>BlackRock maintains three regional advisory committees (Stewardship Advisory Committees) for a) the Americas; b) Europe, </span><span>the Middle East and Africa (EMEA); and c) Asia-Pacific, generally consisting of senior BlackRock investment professionals </span><span>and/or senior employees with practical boardroom experience.

The Global Oversight Committee does not determine voting decisions, which </span><span>are the responsibility of BIS.</span></div> <div><span>The Global Head has primary oversight of the activities of BIS, including voting in accordance with the Guidelines, which </span><span>require the application of professional judgment and consideration of each company’s unique circumstances. The Global </span><span>Committee reviews and approves amendments to these Principles. The Global Committee also reviews and approves </span><span>amendments to the regional Guidelines, as proposed by the regional Stewardship Advisory Committees.</span></div> <div><span>In addition, the Global Committee receives and reviews periodic reports regarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as updates on </span><span>material process issues, procedural changes, and other risk oversight considerations.

The Guidelines are reviewed annually and are amended consistent with changes in the local market practice, </span><span>as developments in corporate governance occur, or as otherwise deemed advisable by the applicable Stewardship Advisory </span><span>Committees. BIS analysts may, in the exercise of their professional judgment, conclude that the Guidelines do not cover the </span><span>specific matter upon which a proxy vote is required or that an exception to the Guidelines would be in the best long-term </span><span>economic interests of BlackRock’s clients.</span></div> <div><span>In the uncommon circumstance of there being a vote with respect to fixed income securities or the securities of privately </span><span>held issuers, the decision generally will be made by a Fund’s portfolio managers and/or BIS based on their assessment of the </span><span>particular transactions or other matters at issue.</span></div> <div><span>In certain markets, proxy voting involves logistical issues which can affect BlackRock’s ability to vote such proxies, as well as </span><span>the desirability of voting such proxies. These issues include, but are not limited to: i) untimely notice of shareholder meetings; </span><span>ii) restrictions on a foreigner’s ability to exercise votes; iii) requirements to vote proxies in person; iv) </span><span>“</span><span>share-blocking</span><span>”</span><span> </span><span>(requirements that investors who exercise their voting rights surrender the right to dispose of their holdings for some </span><span>specified period in proximity to the shareholder meeting); v) potential difficulties in translating the proxy; vi) regulatory </span><span>constraints; and vii) requirements to provide local agents with unrestricted powers of attorney to facilitate voting </span><span>instructions. We are not supportive of impediments to the exercise of voting rights such as share-blocking or overly </span><span>burdensome administrative requirements.</span></div> <div><span>As a consequence, BlackRock votes proxies in these situations on a </span><span>“</span><span>best-efforts</span><span>”</span><span> basis. In addition, BIS may determine that it </span><span>is generally in the best interests of BlackRock’s clients not to vote proxies (or not to vote our full allocation) if the costs </span><span>(including but not limited to opportunity costs associated with share-blocking constraints) associated with exercising a vote </span><span>are expected to outweigh the benefit the client would derive by voting on the proposal.</span></div> <div><span>Portfolio managers have full discretion to vote the shares in the Funds they manage based on their analysis of the economic </span><span>impact of a particular ballot item on their investors. Portfolio managers may, from time to time, reach differing views on how </span><span>best to maximize economic value with respect to a particular investment. Therefore, portfolio managers may, and sometimes </span><span>do, vote shares in the Funds under their management differently from BIS or from one another.

Clients or business partners are not given special treatment or differentiated access to BIS. BIS prioritizes </span><span>engagements based on factors including, but not limited to, our need for additional information to make a voting </span><span>decision or our view on the likelihood that an engagement could lead to positive outcome(s) over time for the economic </span><span>value of the company. Within the normal course of business, BIS may engage directly with BlackRock clients, business </span><span>partners and/or third parties, and/or with employees with sales, vendor management, or business partnership roles, in </span><span>discussions regarding our approach to stewardship, general corporate governance matters, client reporting needs, </span><span>and/or to otherwise ensure that proxy-related client service levels are met</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Determined to engage, in certain instances, an independent third party voting service provider to make proxy voting </span><span>recommendations as a further safeguard to avoid potential conflicts of interest, to satisfy regulatory compliance </span><span>requirements, or as may be otherwise required by applicable law. In such circumstances, the voting service provider </span><span>provides BlackRock with recommendations, in accordance with the Guidelines, as to how to vote such proxies. </span><span>BlackRock uses an independent voting service provider to make proxy voting recommendations for shares of BlackRock, </span><span>Inc. and companies affiliated with BlackRock, Inc. BlackRock may also use an independent voting service provider to </span><span>make proxy voting recommendations for:</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>public companies that include BlackRock employees on their boards of directors</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>public companies of which a BlackRock, Inc. board member serves as a senior executive or a member of </span><span>the board of directors</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>public companies that are the subject of certain transactions involving BlackRock Funds</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>public companies that are joint venture partners with BlackRock, and</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>public companies when legal or regulatory requirements compel BlackRock to use an independent voting </span><span>service provider</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>In selecting a voting service provider, we assess several characteristics, including but not limited to: independence, an ability </span><span>to analyze proxy issues and make recommendations in the best economic interest of our clients in accordance with the </span><span>Guidelines, reputation for reliability and integrity, and operational capacity to accurately deliver the assigned </span><span>recommendations in a timely manner. We may engage more than one voting service provider, in part to mitigate potential or </span><span>perceived conflicts of interest at a single voting service provider. The Global Committee appoints and reviews the </span><span>performance of the voting service providers, generally on an annual basis.</span></div> <div><span>Securities lending</span></div> <div><span>When so authorized, BlackRock acts as a securities lending agent on behalf of Funds. Securities lending is a well-regulated </span><span>practice that contributes to capital market efficiency. It also enables funds to generate additional returns for a fund, while </span><span>allowing fund providers to keep fund expenses lower.</span></div> <div><span>With regard to the relationship between securities lending and proxy voting, BlackRock’s approach is informed by our </span><span>fiduciary responsibility to act in our clients’ best interests. In most cases, BlackRock anticipates that the potential long-term </span><span>value to the Fund of voting shares would be less than the potential revenue the loan may provide the Fund. However, in </span><span>certain instances, BlackRock may determine, in its independent business judgment as a fiduciary, that the value of voting </span><span>outweighs the securities lending revenue loss to clients and would therefore recall shares to be voted in those instances.</span></div> <div><span>The decision to recall securities on loan as part of BlackRock’s securities lending program in order to vote is based on an </span><span>evaluation of various factors that include, but are not limited to, assessing potential securities lending revenue alongside the </span><span>potential long-term value to clients of voting those securities (based on the information available at the time of recall </span><span>consideration).</span><span>12</span><span> BIS works with colleagues in the Securities Lending and Risk and Quantitative Analysis teams to evaluate </span><span>the costs and benefits to clients of recalling shares on loan.</span></div> <div><span>Periodically, BlackRock reviews our process for determining whether to recall securities on loan in order to vote and may </span><span>modify it as necessary.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>12</span></div> <div><span>Recalling securities on loan can be impacted by the timing of record dates. In the United States, for example, the record date of a shareholder meeting </span><span>typically falls before the proxy statements are released. Accordingly, it is not practicable to evaluate a proxy statement, determine that a vote has a </span><span>material impact on a fund and recall any shares on loan in advance of the record date for the annual meeting. As a result, managers must weigh </span><span>independent business judgement as a fiduciary, the benefit to a fund’s shareholders of recalling loaned shares in advance of an estimated record date </span><span>without knowing whether there will be a vote on matters which have a material impact on the fund (thereby forgoing potential securities lending </span><span>revenue for the fund’s shareholders) or leaving shares on loan to potentially earn revenue for the fund (thereby forgoing the opportunity to vote).</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-14</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Voting guidelines</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>The issue-specific Guidelines published for each region/country in which we vote are intended to summarize BlackRock’s </span><span>general philosophy and approach to issues that may commonly arise in the proxy voting context in each market where we </span><span>invest. The Guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. BIS applies the Guidelines on a case-by-case basis, in the context of </span><span>the individual circumstances of each company and the specific issue under review. As such, the Guidelines do not indicate </span><span>how BIS will vote in every instance. Rather, they reflect our view about corporate governance issues generally, and provide </span><span>insight into how we typically approach issues that commonly arise on corporate ballots.</span></div> <div><span>Reporting and vote transparency</span></div> <div><span>We are committed to transparency in the stewardship work we do on behalf of clients. We inform clients about our </span><span>engagement and voting policies and activities through direct communication and through disclosure on our website. Each </span><span>year we publish an annual report that provides a global overview of our investment stewardship engagement and voting </span><span>activities and a voting spotlight that summarizes our voting over a proxy year.</span><span>13</span><span> Additionally, we make public our market-specific</span><span> voting guidelines for the benefit of clients and companies with whom we engage. We also publish commentaries to </span><span>share our perspective on market developments and emerging key themes.</span></div> <div><span>At a more granular level, we publish quarterly our vote record for each company that held a shareholder meeting during the </span><span>period, showing how we voted on each proposal and explaining any votes against management proposals or on shareholder </span><span>proposals. For shareholder meetings where a vote might be high profile or of significant interest to clients, we may publish a </span><span>vote bulletin after the meeting, disclosing and explaining our vote on key proposals. We also publish a quarterly list of all </span><span>companies with which we engaged and the key topics addressed in the engagement meeting.</span></div> <div><span>In this way, we help inform our clients about the work we do on their behalf in promoting the governance and business </span><span>models that support durable, long-term value creation.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>13</span></div> <div><span>The proxy year runs from July 1 to June 30 of the proceeding calendar year.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-15</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

These Guidelines are not intended to limit the </span><span>analysis of individual issues at specific companies or provide a guide to how BIS will engage and/or vote in every instance. </span><span>They are to be applied with discretion, taking into consideration the range of issues and facts specific to the company, as well </span><span>as individual ballot items at shareholder meetings.</span></div> <div><span>Voting guidelines</span></div> <div><span>These guidelines are divided into eight key themes, which group together the issues that frequently appear on the agenda of </span><span>shareholder meetings:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Boards and directors</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Auditors and audit-related issues</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Capital structure</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Mergers, acquisitions, asset sales, and other special transactions</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Executive compensation</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Material sustainability-related risks and opportunities</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>General corporate governance matters</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Shareholder protections</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>Boards and directors</span></div> <div><span>An effective and well-functioning board is critical to the economic success of the company and the protection of </span><span>shareholders’ interests, inducting the establishment of appropriate governance structures that facilitate oversight of </span><span>management and the company’s strategic initiatives. As part of their responsibilities, board members owe fiduciary duties to </span><span>shareholders in overseeing the strategic direction, operations, and risk management of the company. For this reason, BIS sees </span><span>engagement with and the election of directors as one of our most critical responsibilities.</span></div> <div><span>Disclosure of material issues that affect the company’s long-term strategy and value creation, including, when relevant, </span><span>material sustainability-related factors, is essential for shareholders to appropriately understand and assess how effectively </span><span>the board is identifying, managing, and mitigating risks.</span></div> <div><span>Where a company has not adequately demonstrated, through actions and/or disclosures, how material issues are </span><span>appropriately identified, managed, and overseen, we will consider voting against the re-election of those directors </span><span>responsible for the oversight of such issues, as indicated below.</span></div> <div><span>Independence</span></div> <div><span>It is our view that a majority of the directors on the board should be independent to ensure objectivity in the decision-making </span><span>of the board and its ability to oversee management. In addition, all members of audit, compensation, and </span><span>nominating/governance committees should be independent. Our view of independence may vary from listing standards.</span></div> <div><span>Common impediments to independence may include:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Employment as a senior executive by the company or a subsidiary within the past five years</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>An equity ownership in the company in excess of 20%</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Having any other interest, business, or relationship (professional or personal) which could, or could reasonably be </span><span>perceived to, materially interfere with the director’s ability to act in the best interests of the company and its </span><span>shareholders. We may vote against directors who we do not consider to be independent, including at controlled </span><span>companies, when we believe oversight could be enhanced with greater independent director representation.

In particular, where a director maintains a Chair role of a publicly listed company in European markets, we </span><span>may consider that responsibility as equal to two board commitments, consistent with our EMEA Proxy Voting Guidelines. We </span><span>will take the total number of board commitments across our global policies into account for director elections.</span></div> <div><span>Risk oversight</span></div> <div><span>Companies should have an established process for identifying, monitoring, and managing business and material risks. </span><span>Independent directors should have access to relevant management information and outside advice, as appropriate, to ensure </span><span>they can properly oversee risk. We encourage companies to provide transparency around risk management, mitigation, and </span><span>reporting to the board. We are particularly interested in understanding how risk oversight processes evolve in response to </span><span>changes in corporate strategy and/or shifts in the business and related risk environment. Comprehensive disclosures provide </span><span>investors with a sense of the company’s long-term risk management practices and, more broadly, the quality of the board’s </span><span>oversight.

While we will typically support proposals requesting board de-classification, we </span><span>may make exceptions, should the board articulate an appropriate strategic rationale for a classified board structure.

However, in </span><span>these instances, boards should periodically review the rationale for a classified structure and consider when annual elections </span><span>might be more appropriate.</span></div> <div><span>Without a voting mechanism to immediately address concerns about a specific director, we may choose to vote against the </span><span>directors up for election at the time (see </span><span>“</span><span>Shareholder rights</span><span>”</span><span> for additional detail).</span></div> <div><span>Independent leadership</span></div> <div><span>There are two commonly accepted structures for independent leadership to balance the CEO role in the boardroom: 1) an </span><span>independent Chair; or 2) a Lead Independent director when the roles of Chair and CEO are combined, or when the Chair is </span><span>otherwise not independent.</span></div> <div><span>In the absence of a significant governance concern, we defer to boards to designate the most appropriate leadership </span><span>structure to ensure adequate balance and independence.</span><span>17</span><span> However, BIS may vote against the most senior non-executive </span><span>member of the board when appropriate independence is lacking in designated leadership roles.</span></div> <div><span>In the event that the board chooses to have a combined Chair/CEO or a non-independent Chair, we support the designation </span><span>of a Lead Independent director, with the ability to: 1) provide formal input into board meeting agendas; 2) call meetings of </span><span>the independent directors; and 3) preside at meetings of independent directors.

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>CEO and management succession planning</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Companies should have a robust CEO and senior management succession plan in place at the board level that is reviewed </span><span>and updated on a regular basis. Succession planning should cover scenarios over both the long-term, consistent with the </span><span>strategic direction of the company and identified leadership needs over time, as well as the short-term, in the event of an </span><span>unanticipated executive departure. We encourage the company to explain their executive succession planning process, </span><span>including where accountability lies within the boardroom for this task, without prematurely divulging sensitive information </span><span>commonly associated with this exercise.</span></div> <div><span>During a CEO transition, companies may elect for the departing CEO to maintain a role in the boardroom. We ask for </span><span>disclosures to understand the timeframe and responsibilities of this role. In such instances, we typically look for the board to </span><span>have appropriate independent leadership structures in place. (See chart above.)</span></div> <div><span>Director</span><span> </span><span>compensation</span><span> </span><span>and</span><span> </span><span>equity</span><span> programs</span></div> <div><span>Compensation for directors should generally be structured to attract and retain directors, while also aligning their interests </span><span>with those of shareholders. In our view, director compensation packages that are based on the company’s long-term value </span><span>creation and include some form of long-term equity compensation are more likely to meet this goal.</span></div> <div><span>Board composition and effectiveness</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Director</span><span> </span><span>qualifications</span><span> </span><span>and</span><span> </span><span>skills</span></div> <div><span>We encourage boards to periodically review director qualifications and skills to ensure relevant experience and diverse </span><span>perspectives are represented in the boardroom. To this end, performance reviews and skills assessments should be </span><span>conducted by the nominating/governance committee or the Lead Independent Director. This process may include internal </span><span>board evaluations; however, boards may also find it useful to periodically conduct an assessment with a third party. We </span><span>encourage boards to disclose their approach to evaluations, including objectives of the evaluation; if an external party </span><span>conducts the evaluation; the frequency of the evaluations; and, whether that evaluation occurs on an individual director </span><span>basis.</span></div> <div><span>Board</span><span> </span><span>term</span><span> </span><span>limits and</span><span> </span><span>director</span><span> tenure</span></div> <div><span>Where boards find that age limits or term limits are the most efficient and objective mechanism for ensuring periodic board </span><span>refreshment, we generally defer to the board’s determination in setting such limits. BIS will also consider the average board </span><span>tenure to evaluate processes for board renewal. We may oppose boards that appear to have an insufficient mix of short-, </span><span>medium-, and long-tenured directors.</span></div> <div><span>Board</span><span> </span><span>diversity</span></div> <div><span>As noted above, highly qualified, engaged directors with professional characteristics relevant to a company’s business </span><span>enhance the ability of the board to add value and be the voice of shareholders in board discussions. In our view, a strong </span><span>board provides a competitive advantage to a company, providing valuable oversight and contributing to the most important </span><span>management decisions that support long-term financial performance.</span></div> <div><span>It is in this context that we are interested in diversity in the boardroom. We see it as a means to promoting diversity of </span><span>thought and avoiding ‘group think’ in the board’s exercise of its responsibilities to advise and oversee management. It allows </span><span>boards to have deeper discussions and make more resilient decisions. We ask boards to disclose how diversity is considered </span><span>in board composition, including professional characteristics, such as a director’s industry experience, specialist areas of </span><span>expertise and geographic location; as well as demographic characteristics such as gender, race/ ethnicity, and age.</span></div> <div><span>We look to understand a board’s diversity in the context of a company’s domicile, market capitalization, business model, and </span><span>strategy. Increasingly, we see leading boards adding members whose experience deepens the board’s understanding of the </span><span>company’s customers, employees, and communities. Self- identified board demographic diversity can usefully be disclosed in </span><span>aggregate, consistent with local law. We believe boards should aspire to meaningful diversity of membership, at least </span><span>consistent with local regulatory requirements and best practices, while recognizing that building a strong, diverse board can </span><span>take time.</span></div> <div><span>This position is based on our view that diversity of perspective and thought—in the boardroom, in the management team </span><span>and throughout the company—leads to better long-term economic outcomes for companies.

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>reveals correlations between specific dimensions of diversity and effects on decision-making processes and outcomes.</span><span>19</span><span> In </span><span>our experience, greater diversity in the boardroom contributes to more robust discussions and more innovative and resilient </span><span>decisions. Over time, greater diversity in the boardroom can also promote greater diversity and resilience in the leadership </span><span>team, and the workforce more broadly. That diversity can enable companies to develop businesses that more closely reflect </span><span>and resonate with the customers and communities they serve.</span></div> <div><span>In the U.S., we believe that boards should aspire to at least 30% diversity of membership,</span><span>20</span><span> and we encourage large </span><span>companies, such as those in the S&amp;P 500, to lead in achieving this standard. In our view, an informative indicator of diversity </span><span>for such companies is having at least two women and a director who identifies as a member of an underrepresented group.</span><span>21</span><span> </span><span>We recognize that it may take time and that companies with smaller market capitalizations and in certain sectors may face </span><span>more challenges in pursuing diversity. Among these smaller companies, we look for the presence of diversity and take into </span><span>consideration the progress that companies are making.</span></div> <div><span>In order to help investors understand overall diversity, we look to boards to disclose:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>How diversity, including demographic factors and professional characteristics, is considered in board composition, given </span><span>the company’s long-term strategy and business model</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>How directors’ professional characteristics, which may include domain expertise such as finance or technology, and </span><span>sector- or market-specific experience, are complementary and link to the company’s long-term strategy</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The process by which candidates for board positions are identified, including whether professional firms or other </span><span>resources outside of incumbent directors’ networks are engaged to identify and/or assess candidates, and whether a </span><span>diverse slate of nominees is considered for all available board nominations</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>To the extent that, based on our assessment of corporate disclosures, a company has not adequately explained their </span><span>approach to diversity in their board composition, we may vote against members of the nominating/governance committee. </span><span>Our publicly available commentary provides more information on our approach to board diversity.</span></div> <div><span>Board</span><span> </span><span>size</span></div> <div><span>We typically defer to the board in setting the appropriate size and believe that directors are generally in the best position to </span><span>assess the optimal board size to ensure effectiveness. However, we may vote against the appropriate committees and/or </span><span>individual directors if, in our view, the board is ineffective in its oversight, either because it is too small to allow for the </span><span>necessary range of skills and experience or too large to function efficiently.</span></div> <div><span>Board responsiveness and shareholder rights</span></div> <div><span>Shareholder rights</span></div> <div><span>Where we determine that a board has not acted in the best interests of the company’s shareholders, or takes action to </span><span>unreasonably limit shareholder rights, we may vote against the appropriate committees and/or individual directors. Common </span><span>circumstances are illustrated below:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The Independent Chair or Lead Independent Director and members of the nominating/governance committee, where a </span><span>board implements or renews a poison pill without shareholder approval</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The Independent Chair or Lead Independent Director and members of the nominating/governance committee, where a </span><span>board amends the charter/articles/bylaws and where the effect may be to entrench directors or to unreasonably reduce </span><span>shareholder rights</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Members of the compensation committee where the company has repriced options without shareholder approval If a </span><span>board maintains a classified structure, it is possible that the director(s) or committee members with whom we have a </span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>19</span></div> <div><span>For a discussion on the different impacts of diversity see: McKinsey, </span><span>“</span><span>Diversity Wins: How Inclusion Matters</span><span>”</span><span>, May 2022; Harvard Business Review, </span><span>Diverse Teams Feel Less Comfortable – and That’s Why They Perform Better, September 2016; </span><span>“</span><span>Do Diverse Directors Influence DEI Outcomes</span><span>”</span><span>, </span><span>September 2022</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>20</span></div> <div><span>We take a case-by-case approach and consider the size of the board in our evaluation of overall composition and diversity.

In such situations, we may register </span><span>our concern by voting against the most relevant director(s) up for election.</span></div> <div><span>Responsiveness to shareholders</span></div> <div><span>A board should be engaged and responsive to the company’s shareholders, including acknowledging voting outcomes for </span><span>director elections, compensation, shareholder proposals, and other ballot items. Where we determine that a board has not </span><span>substantially addressed shareholder concerns that we deem material to the business, we may vote against the responsible </span><span>committees and/or individual directors. Common circumstances are illustrated below:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The Independent Chair or Lead Independent Director, members of the nominating/governance committee, and/or the </span><span>longest tenured director(s), where we observe a lack of board responsiveness to shareholders, evidence of board </span><span>entrenchment, and/or failure to plan for adequate board member succession</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The chair of the nominating/governance committee, or where no chair exists, the nominating/governance committee </span><span>member with the longest tenure, where board member(s) at the most recent election of directors have received against </span><span>votes from more than 25% of shares voted, and the board has not taken appropriate action to respond to shareholder </span><span>concerns. This may not apply in cases where BIS did not support the initial vote against such board member(s)</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The Independent Chair or Lead Independent Director and/or members of the nominating/governance committee, </span><span>where a board fails to consider shareholder proposals that (1) receive substantial support, and (2) in our view, have a </span><span>material impact on the business, shareholder rights, or the potential for long-term value creation</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>Majority vote requirements</span></div> <div><span>Directors should generally be elected by a majority of the shares voted. We will normally support proposals seeking to </span><span>introduce bylaws requiring a majority vote standard for director elections. Majority vote standards generally assist in ensuring </span><span>that directors who are not broadly supported by shareholders are not elected to serve as their representatives. As a best </span><span>practice, companies with either a majority vote standard or a plurality vote standard should adopt a resignation policy for </span><span>directors who do not receive support from at least a majority of votes cast. Where the company already has a sufficiently </span><span>robust majority voting process in place, we may not support a shareholder proposal seeking an alternative mechanism.</span></div> <div><span>We note that majority voting may not be appropriate in all circumstances, for example, in the context of a contested election, </span><span>or for majority-controlled companies or those with concentrated ownership structures.</span></div> <div><span>Cumulative voting</span></div> <div><span>As stated above, a majority vote standard is generally in the best long-term interests of shareholders, as it ensures director </span><span>accountability through the requirement to be elected by more than half of the votes cast. As such, we will generally oppose </span><span>proposals requesting the adoption of cumulative voting, which may disproportionately aggregate votes on certain issues or </span><span>director candidates.</span></div> <div><span>Auditors and audit-related issues</span></div> <div><span>BIS recognizes the critical importance of financial statements to provide a complete and accurate portrayal of a company’s </span><span>financial condition. Consistent with our approach to voting on directors, we seek to hold the audit committee of the board </span><span>responsible for overseeing the management of the independent auditor and the internal audit function at a company.</span></div> <div><span>We may vote against the audit committee members where the board has failed to facilitate quality, independent auditing. We </span><span>look to public disclosures for insight into the scope of the audit committee responsibilities, including an overview of audit </span><span>committee processes, issues on the audit committee agenda, and key decisions taken by the audit committee. We take </span><span>particular note of cases involving significant financial restatements or material weakness disclosures, and we look for timely </span><span>disclosure and remediation of accounting irregularities.</span></div> <div><span>The integrity of financial statements depends on the auditor effectively fulfilling its role. To that end, we favor an independent </span><span>auditor. In addition, to the extent that an auditor fails to reasonably identify and address issues that eventually lead to a </span><span>significant financial restatement, or the audit firm has violated standards of practice, we may also vote against ratification.</span></div> <div><span>From time to time, shareholder proposals may be presented to promote auditor independence or the rotation of audit firms. </span><span>We may support these proposals when they are consistent with our views as described above.</span><span> </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-23</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Capital structure proposals</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Equal voting rights</span></div> <div><span>In our view, shareholders should be entitled to voting rights in proportion to their economic interests. In addition, companies </span><span>that have implemented dual or multiple class share structures should review these structures on a regular basis, or as </span><span>company circumstances change. Companies with multiple share classes should receive shareholder approval of their capital </span><span>structure on a periodic basis via a management proposal on the company’s proxy. The proposal should give unaffiliated </span><span>shareholders the opportunity to affirm the current structure or establish mechanisms to end or phase out controlling </span><span>structures at the appropriate time, while minimizing costs to shareholders. Where companies are unwilling to voluntarily </span><span>implement </span><span>“</span><span>one share, one vote</span><span>”</span><span> within a specified timeframe, or are unresponsive to shareholder feedback for change over </span><span>time, we generally support shareholder proposals to recapitalize stock into a single voting class.</span></div> <div><span>Blank check preferred stock</span></div> <div><span>We frequently oppose proposals requesting authorization of a class of preferred stock with unspecified voting, conversion, </span><span>dividend distribution, and other rights (</span><span>“</span><span>blank check</span><span>”</span><span> preferred stock) because they may serve as a transfer of authority from </span><span>shareholders to the board and as a possible entrenchment device. We generally view the board’s discretion to establish </span><span>voting rights on a when-issued basis as a potential anti-takeover device, as it affords the board the ability to place a block of </span><span>stock with an investor sympathetic to management, thereby foiling a takeover bid without a shareholder vote.</span></div> <div><span>Nonetheless, we may support the proposal where the company:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Appears to have a legitimate financing motive for requesting blank check authority</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Has committed publicly that blank check preferred shares will not be used for anti-takeover purposes</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Has a history of using blank check preferred stock for financings</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Has blank check preferred stock previously outstanding such that an increase would not necessarily provide further anti-</span><span>takeover protection but may provide greater financing flexibility</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>Increase in authorized common shares</span></div> <div><span>BIS will evaluate requests to increase authorized shares on a case-by-case basis, in conjunction with industry-specific norms </span><span>and potential dilution, as well as a company’s history with respect to the use of its common shares.</span></div> <div><span>Increase or issuance of preferred stock</span></div> <div><span>We generally support proposals to increase or issue preferred stock in cases where the company specifies the voting, </span><span>dividend, conversion, and other rights of such stock and where the terms of the preferred stock appear reasonable.</span></div> <div><span>Stock splits</span></div> <div><span>We generally support stock splits that are not likely to negatively affect the ability to trade shares or the economic value of a </span><span>share. We generally support reverse stock splits that are designed to avoid delisting or to facilitate trading in the stock, where </span><span>the reverse split will not have a negative impact on share value (e.g., one class is reduced while others remain at pre-split </span><span>levels). In the event of a proposal for a reverse split that would not proportionately reduce the company’s authorized stock, </span><span>we apply the same analysis we would use for a proposal to increase authorized stock.</span></div> <div><span>Mergers, acquisitions, transactions, and other special situations</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Mergers, acquisitions, and transactions</span></div> <div><span>In assessing mergers, acquisitions, or other transactions – including business combinations involving Special Purpose </span><span>Acquisition Companies (</span><span>“</span><span>SPACs</span><span>”</span><span>) – BIS’ primary consideration is the long-term economic interests of our clients as </span><span>shareholders. Boards should clearly explain the economic and strategic rationale for any proposed transactions or material </span><span>changes to the business. We will review a proposed transaction to determine the degree to which it has the potential to </span><span>enhance long-term shareholder value. While mergers, acquisitions, asset sales, business combinations, and other special </span><span>transaction proposals vary widely in scope and substance, we closely examine certain salient features in our analyses, such </span><span>as:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The degree to which the proposed transaction represents a premium to the company’s trading price.

We evaluate a number of factors, </span><span>which may include: the qualifications and past performance of the dissident and management candidates; the validity of the </span><span>concerns identified by the dissident; the viability of both the dissident’s and management’s plans; the ownership stake and </span><span>holding period of the dissident; the likelihood that the dissident’s strategy will produce the desired change; and whether the </span><span>dissident represents the best option for enhancing long-term shareholder value.</span></div> <div><span>We will evaluate the actions that the company has taken to limit shareholders’ ability to exercise the right to nominate </span><span>dissident director candidates, including those actions taken absent the immediate threat of a contested situation. BIS may </span><span>take voting action against directors (up to and including the full board) where those actions are viewed as egregiously </span><span>infringing on shareholder rights.</span></div> <div><span>We will consider a variety of possible voting outcomes in contested situations, including the ability to support a mix of </span><span>management and dissident nominees.</span></div> <div><span>Poison pill plans</span></div> <div><span>Where a poison pill is put to a shareholder vote by management, our policy is to examine these plans individually. Although </span><span>we have historically opposed most plans, we may support plans that include a reasonable </span><span>“</span><span>qualifying offer clause.</span><span>”</span><span> Such </span><span>clauses typically require shareholder ratification of the pill and stipulate a sunset provision whereby the pill expires unless it is </span><span>renewed. These clauses also tend to specify that an all-cash bid for all shares that includes a fairness opinion and evidence of </span><span>financing does not trigger the pill, but forces either a special meeting at which the offer is put to a shareholder vote or </span><span>requires the board to seek the written consent of shareholders, where shareholders could rescind the pill at their discretion. </span><span>We may also support a pill where it is the only effective method for protecting tax or other economic benefits that may be </span><span>associated with limiting the ownership changes of individual shareholders. Lastly, we look for shareholder approval of poison </span><span>pill plans within one year of adoption of implementation.</span></div> <div><span>Reimbursement of expenses for successful shareholder campaigns</span></div> <div><span>We generally do not support shareholder proposals seeking the reimbursement of proxy contest expenses, even in situations </span><span>where we support the shareholder campaign. Introducing the possibility of such reimbursement may incentivize disruptive </span><span>and unnecessary shareholder campaigns.</span></div> <div><span>Executive compensation</span></div> <div><span>A company’s board of directors should put in place a compensation structure that balances incentivizing, rewarding, and </span><span>retaining executives appropriately across a wide range of business outcomes. This structure should be aligned with </span><span>shareholder interests, particularly the generation of sustainable, long-term value.</span></div> <div><span>The compensation committee should carefully consider the specific circumstances of the company and the key individuals </span><span>the board is focused on incentivizing. We encourage companies to ensure that their compensation plans incorporate </span><span>appropriate and rigorous performance metrics, consistent with corporate strategy and market practice.

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>research, in addition to our own analysis, to evaluate existing and proposed compensation structures. We hold members of </span><span>the compensation committee, or equivalent board members, accountable for poor compensation practices and/or </span><span>structures.</span></div> <div><span>There should be a clear link between variable pay and company performance that drives sustained value creation for our </span><span>clients as shareholders. Where compensation structures provide for a front-loaded</span><span>23</span><span> award, we look for appropriate </span><span>structures (including vesting and/or holding periods) that motivate sustained performance for shareholders over a number </span><span>of years. We generally do not favor programs focused on awards that require performance levels to be met and maintained </span><span>for a relatively short time period for payouts to be earned, unless there are extended vesting and/or holding requirements.</span><span> </span></div> <div><span>Compensation structures should generally drive outcomes that align the pay of the executives with performance of the </span><span>company and the value received by shareholders. When evaluating performance, we examine both executive teams’ efforts, </span><span>as well as outcomes realized by shareholders. Payouts to executives should reflect both the executive’s contributions to the </span><span>company’s ongoing success, as well as exogenous factors that impacted shareholder value. Where discretion has been used </span><span>by the compensation committee, we look for disclosures relating to how and why the discretion was used and how the </span><span>adjusted outcome is aligned with the interests of shareholders. While we believe special awards</span><span>24</span><span> should be used sparingly, </span><span>we acknowledge that there may be instances when such awards are appropriate. When evaluating these awards, we consider </span><span>a variety of factors, including the magnitude and structure of the award, the scope of award recipients, the alignment of the </span><span>grant with shareholder value, and the company’s historical use of such awards, in addition to other company-specific </span><span>circumstances.</span></div> <div><span>We acknowledge that the use of peer group evaluation by compensation committees can help calibrate competitive pay; </span><span>however, we are concerned when the rationale for increases in total compensation is solely based on peer benchmarking.</span></div> <div><span>We support incentive plans that foster the sustainable achievement of results – both financial and non-financial – consistent </span><span>with the company’s strategic initiatives. Compensation committees should guard against contractual arrangements that </span><span>would entitle executives to material compensation for early termination of their contract. Finally, pension contributions and </span><span>other deferred compensation arrangements should be reasonable in light of market practices. Our publicly available </span><span>commentary provides more information on our approach to executive compensation.</span></div> <div><span>Where executive compensation appears excessive relative to the performance of the company and/or compensation paid by </span><span>peers, or where an equity compensation plan is not aligned with shareholders’ interests, we may vote against members of </span><span>the compensation committee.</span></div> <div><span>“</span><span>Say on Pay</span><span>”</span><span> advisory resolutions</span></div> <div><span>In cases where there is a </span><span>“</span><span>Say on Pay</span><span>”</span><span> vote, BIS will respond to the proposal as informed by our evaluation of compensation </span><span>practices at that particular company and in a manner that appropriately addresses the specific question posed to </span><span>shareholders. Where we conclude that a company has failed to align pay with performance, we will vote against the </span><span>management compensation proposal and relevant compensation committee members.</span></div> <div><span>Frequency of </span><span>“</span><span>Say on Pay</span><span>”</span><span> advisory resolutions</span></div> <div><span>BIS will generally support annual advisory votes on executive compensation. It is our view that shareholders should have the </span><span>opportunity to express feedback on annual incentive programs and changes to long-term compensation before multiple </span><span>cycles are issued. Where a company has failed to implement a </span><span>“</span><span>Say on Pay</span><span>”</span><span> advisory vote within the frequency period that </span><span>received the most support from shareholders or a </span><span>“</span><span>Say on Pay</span><span>”</span><span> resolution is omitted without explanation, BIS may vote </span><span>against members of the compensation committee.</span></div> <div><span>Clawback proposals</span></div> <div><span>We generally favor prompt recoupment from any senior executive whose compensation was based on faulty financial </span><span>reporting or deceptive business practices. We also favor prompt recoupment from any senior executive whose behavior </span><span>caused material financial harm to shareholders, material reputational risk to the company, or resulted in a criminal </span><span>proceeding, even if such actions did not ultimately result in a material restatement of past results. This includes, but is not </span><span>limited to, settlement agreements arising from such behavior and paid for directly by the company. We typically support </span><span>shareholder proposals on these matters unless the company already has a robust clawback policy that sufficiently addresses </span><span>our concerns.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>23</span></div> <div><span>Front-loaded awards are generally those that accelerate the grant of multiple years’ worth of compensation in a single year.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>24</span></div> <div><span>“</span><span>Special awards</span><span>”</span><span> refers to awards granted outside the company’s typical compensation program.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-26</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

The most common </span><span>form of ESPP qualifies for favorable tax treatment under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. We will typically support </span><span>qualified ESPP proposals.</span></div> <div><span>Equity compensation plans</span></div> <div><span>BIS supports equity plans that align the economic interests of directors, managers, and other employees with those of </span><span>shareholders. Boards should establish policies prohibiting the use of equity awards in a manner that could disrupt the </span><span>intended alignment with shareholder interests, such as the excessive pledging or heading of stock. We may support </span><span>shareholder proposals requesting the establishment of such policies.</span></div> <div><span>Our evaluation of equity compensation plans is based on a company’s executive pay and performance relative to peers and </span><span>whether the plan plays a significant role in a pay-for-performance disconnect. We generally oppose plans that contain </span><span>“</span><span>evergreen</span><span>”</span><span> provisions, which allow for automatic annual increases of shares available for grant without requiring further </span><span>shareholder approval; we note that the aggregate impacts of such increases are difficult to predict and may lead to significant </span><span>dilution. We also generally oppose plans that allow for repricing without shareholder approval. We may oppose plans that </span><span>provide for the acceleration of vesting of equity awards even in situations where an actual change of control may not occur. </span><span>We encourage companies to structure their change of control provisions to require the termination of the covered employee </span><span>before acceleration or special payments are triggered (commonly referred to as </span><span>“</span><span>double trigger</span><span>”</span><span> change of control </span><span>provisions).</span></div> <div><span>Golden parachutes</span></div> <div><span>We generally view golden parachutes as encouragement to management to consider transactions that might be beneficial to </span><span>shareholders. However, a large potential payout under a golden parachute arrangement also presents the risk of motivating a </span><span>management team to support a sub-optimal sale price for a company.</span></div> <div><span>When determining whether to support or oppose an advisory vote on a golden parachute plan, BIS may consider several </span><span>factors, including:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Whether we determine that the triggering event is in the best interests of shareholders</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Whether management attempted to maximize shareholder value in the triggering event</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>The percentage of total premium or transaction value that will be transferred to the management team, rather than </span><span>shareholders, as a result of the golden parachute payment</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Whether excessively large excise tax gross-up payments are part of the pay-out</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Whether the pay package that serves as the basis for calculating the golden parachute payment was reasonable in light </span><span>of performance and peers</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Whether the golden parachute payment will have the effect of rewarding a management team that has failed to </span><span>effectively manage the company It may be difficult to anticipate the results of a plan until after it has been triggered; as a </span><span>result, BIS may vote against a golden parachute proposal even if the golden parachute plan under review was approved </span><span>by shareholders when it was implemented.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>We may support shareholder proposals requesting that implementation of such arrangements require shareholder approval.</span></div> <div><span>Option exchanges</span></div> <div><span>There may be legitimate instances where underwater options create an overhang on a company’s capital structure and a </span><span>repricing or option exchange may be warranted.

At the </span><span>board level, appropriate governance structures and responsibilities allow for effective oversight of the strategic </span><span>implementation of material sustainability issues.</span></div> <div><span>When assessing how to vote – including on the election of directors and relevant shareholder proposals – robust disclosures </span><span>are essential for investors to understand, where appropriate, how companies are integrating material sustainability risks and </span><span>opportunities across their business and strategic, long-term planning. Where a company has failed to appropriately provide </span><span>robust disclosures and evidence of effective business practices, BIS may express concerns through our engagement and </span><span>voting. As part of this consideration, we encourage companies to produce sustainability-related disclosures sufficiently in </span><span>advance of their annual meeting so that the disclosures can be considered in relevant vote decisions.</span></div> <div><span>We encourage disclosures aligned with the reporting framework developed by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial </span><span>Disclosures (TCFD), supported by industry-specific metrics, such as those identified by the Sustainability Accounting </span><span>Standards Board (SASB), now part of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) under the International Financial </span><span>Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation.</span><span>26</span><span> While the TCFD framework was developed to support climate-related risk </span><span>disclosures, the four pillars of the TCFD – governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets – are a useful way </span><span>for companies to disclose how they identify, assess, manage, and oversee a variety of sustainability-related risks and </span><span>opportunities. SASB’s</span><span>27</span><span> industry-specific metrics are beneficial in helping companies identify key performance indicators </span><span>(</span><span>“</span><span>KPIs</span><span>”</span><span>) across various dimensions of sustainability that are considered to be financially material. We recognize that some </span><span>companies may report using different standards, which may be required by regulation, or one of a number of private </span><span>standards. In such cases, we ask that companies highlight the metrics that are industry- or company-specific.</span></div> <div><span>We look to companies to:</span></div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Disclose the identification, assessment, management, and oversight of material sustainability- related risks and </span><span>opportunities in accordance with the four pillars of TCFD</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>•</span></div> <div><span>Publish material, investor-relevant, industry-specific metrics and rigorous targets, aligned with SASB (ISSB) or </span><span>comparable sustainability reporting standards</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div><span>Companies should also disclose any material supranational standards adopted, the industry initiatives in which they </span><span>participate, any peer group benchmarking undertaken, and any assurance processes to help investors understand their </span><span>approach to sustainable and responsible business conduct.</span></div> <div><span>Climate risk</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>25</span></div> <div><span>By material sustainability-related risks and opportunities, we mean the drivers of risk and value creation in a company’s business model that have an </span><span>environmental or social dependency or impact.

Examples of social issues include, but are not limited to, human capital management, impacts on the communities in </span><span>which a company operates, customer loyalty, and relationships with regulators. It is our view that well-run companies will effectively evaluate and </span><span>manage material sustainability-related risks and opportunities relevant to their businesses.

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>It is our view that climate change has become a key factor in many companies’ long-term prospects. As such, as long-term </span><span>investors, we are interested in understanding how companies may be impacted by material climate-related risks and </span><span>opportunities—just as we seek to understand other business-relevant risks and opportunities—and how these factors are </span><span>considered within their strategy in a manner that is consistent with the company’s business model and sector. Specifically, </span><span>we look for companies to disclose strategies that they have in place that mitigate and are resilient to any material risks to </span><span>their long-term business model associated with a range of climate-related scenarios, including a scenario in which global </span><span>warming is limited to well below 2°C, and considering global ambitions to achieve a limit of 1.5°C.</span><span>28</span><span> It is, of course, up to </span><span>each company to define their own strategy: that is not the role of BlackRock or other investors.</span></div> <div><span>BIS recognizes that climate change can be challenging for many companies, as they seek to drive long-term value by </span><span>mitigating risks and capturing opportunities. A growing number of companies, financial institutions, as well as governments, </span><span>have committed to advancing decarbonization in line with the Paris Agreement. There is growing consensus that companies </span><span>can benefit from the more favorable macro-economic environment under an orderly, timely, and equitable global energy </span><span>transition.</span><span>29</span><span> Yet, the path ahead is deeply uncertain and uneven, with different parts of the economy moving at different </span><span>speeds.</span><span>30</span><span> Many companies are asking what their role should be in contributing to an orderly and equitable transition—in </span><span>ensuring a reliable energy supply and energy security and in protecting the most vulnerable from energy price shocks and </span><span>economic dislocation. In this context, we encourage companies to include in their disclosures a business plan for how they </span><span>intend to deliver long-term financial performance through a transition to global net zero carbon emissions, consistent with </span><span>their business model and sector.</span></div> <div><span>We look to companies to disclose short-, medium-, and long-term targets, ideally science-based targets where these are </span><span>available for their sector, for Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reductions and to demonstrate how their </span><span>targets are consistent with the long-term economic interests of their shareholders. Many companies have an opportunity to </span><span>use and contribute to the development of low carbon energy sources and technologies that will be essential to decarbonizing </span><span>the global economy over time. We also recognize that continued investment in traditional energy sources, including oil and </span><span>gas, is required to maintain an orderly and equitable transition—and that divestiture of carbon-intensive assets is unlikely to </span><span>contribute to global emissions reductions. We encourage companies to disclose how their capital allocation to various energy </span><span>sources is consistent with their strategy.</span></div> <div><span>At this stage, we view Scope 3 emissions differently from Scopes 1 and 2, given methodological complexity, regulatory </span><span>uncertainty, concerns about double-counting, and lack of direct control by companies. While we welcome any disclosures </span><span>and commitments companies choose to make regarding Scope 3 emissions, we recognize that these are provided on a good-faith</span><span> basis as methodology develops. Our publicly available commentary provides more information on our approach to </span><span>climate risk and the global energy transition.</span></div> <div><span>Natural capital</span></div> <div><span>The management of nature-related factors is increasingly a core component of some companies’ ability to generate </span><span>sustainable, long-term financial returns for shareholders, particularly where a company’s strategy is heavily reliant on the </span><span>availably of natural capital, or whose supply chains are exposed to locations with nature-related risks. We look for such </span><span>companies to disclose</span><span>31</span><span> how they consider their reliance and use of natural capital, including appropriate risk oversight and </span><span>relevant metrics and targets, to understand how these factors are integrated into strategy. We will evaluate these disclosures </span><span>to inform our view of how a company is managing material nature-related risks and opportunities, as well as in our </span><span>assessment of relevant shareholder proposals. Our publicly available commentary provides more information on our </span><span>approach to natural capital.</span></div> <div><span>Key stakeholder interests</span></div> <div><span>In order to deliver long-term value for shareholders, companies should also consider the interests of their key stakeholders. </span><span>While stakeholder groups may vary across industries, they are likely to include employees; business partners (such as </span><span>suppliers and distributors); clients and consumers; government and regulators; and the constituents of the communities in </span><span>which a company operates. Companies that build strong relationships with their key stakeholders are more likely to meet </span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>28</span></div> <div><span>The global aspiration to achieve a net-zero global economy by 2050 is reflective of aggregated efforts; governments representing over 90% of GDP </span><span>have committed to move to net-zero over the coming decades. In determining how to vote on behalf of clients who have authorized us to do so, we </span><span>look to companies only to address issues within their control and do not anticipate that they will address matters that are the domain of public policy.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>29</span></div> <div><span>For example, BlackRock’s Capital Markets Assumptions anticipate 25 points of cumulative economic gains over a 20-year period in an orderly </span><span>transition as compared to the alternative.

Where we determine that company is not appropriately considering their key stakeholder </span><span>interests in a way that poses material financial risk to the company and its shareholders, we may vote against relevant </span><span>directors or support shareholder proposals related to these topics. Our publicly available commentary provides more </span><span>information on our approach.</span></div> <div><span>Conversely, we note that some shareholder proposals seek to address topics that are clearly within the purview of certain </span><span>stakeholders. For example, we recognize that topics around taxation and tax reporting are within the domain of local, state, </span><span>and federal authorities. BIS will generally not support these proposals.</span></div> <div><span>Human capital management</span></div> <div><span>A company’s approach to human capital management (</span><span>“</span><span>HCM</span><span>”</span><span>) is a critical factor in fostering an inclusive, diverse, and </span><span>engaged workforce, which contributes to business continuity, innovation, and long-term value creation. Consequently, we </span><span>ask companies to demonstrate a robust approach to HCM and provide shareholders with disclosures to understand how </span><span>their approach aligns with their stated strategy and business model.</span></div> <div><span>Clear and consistent disclosures on these matters are critical for investors to make an informed assessment of a company’s </span><span>HCM practices. Companies should disclose the steps they are taking to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion; job categories </span><span>and workforce demographics; and their responses to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s EEO-1 Survey. </span><span>Where we believe a company’s disclosures or practices fall short relative to the market or peers, or we are unable to ascertain </span><span>the board and management’s effectiveness in overseeing related risks and opportunities, we may vote against members of </span><span>the appropriate committee or support relevant shareholder proposals. Our publicly available commentary provides more </span><span>information on our approach to HCM.</span></div> <div><span>Corporate political activities</span></div> <div><span>Companies may engage in certain political activities, within legal and regulatory limits, in order to support public policy </span><span>matters material to the companies’ long-term strategies. These activities can also create risks, including: the potential for </span><span>allegations of corruption; certain reputational risks; and risks that arise from the complex legal, regulatory, and compliance </span><span>considerations associated with corporate political spending and lobbying activity. Companies that engage in political </span><span>activities should develop and maintain robust processes to guide these activities and mitigate risks, including board </span><span>oversight.</span></div> <div><span>When depend on companies to provide accessible and clear disclosures so that investors can easily understand how their </span><span>political activities support their long-term strategy, including on stated public policy priorities. When presented with </span><span>shareholder proposals requesting increased disclosure on corporate political activities, BIS will evaluate publicly available </span><span>information to consider how a company’s lobbying and political activities may impact the company. We will also evaluate </span><span>whether there is general consistency between a company’s stated positions on policy matters material to their strategy and </span><span>the material positions taken by significant industry groups of which they are a member. We may decide to support a </span><span>shareholder proposal requesting additional disclosures if we identify a material inconsistency or feel that further transparency </span><span>may clarify how the company’s political activities support its long-term strategy. Our publicly available commentary provides </span><span>more information on our approach to corporate political activities.</span></div> <div><span>General corporate governance matters</span></div> <div><span>IPO governance</span></div> <div><span>Boards should disclose how the corporate governance structures adopted upon a company’s initial public offering (</span><span>“</span><span>IPO</span><span>”</span><span>) are </span><span>in shareholders’ best long-term interests. We also ask boards to conduct a regular review of corporate governance and </span><span>control structures, such that boards might evolve foundational corporate governance structures as company circumstances </span><span>change, without undue costs and disruption to shareholders. In our letter on unequal voting structures, we articulate our </span><span>view that </span><span>“</span><span>one vote for one share</span><span>”</span><span> is the preferred structure for publicly-traded companies. We also recognize the potential </span><span>benefits of dual class shares to newly public companies as they establish themselves; however, these structures should have </span><span>a specific and limited duration. We will generally engage new companies on topics such as classified boards and </span><span>supermajority vote provisions to amend bylaws, as we think that such arrangements may not be in the best interests of </span><span>shareholders over the long-term.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-30</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

An EGC should have an independent audit committee by the </span><span>first anniversary of its IPO, with our standard approach to voting on auditors and audit-related issues applicable in full for an </span><span>EGC on the first anniversary of its IPO.</span></div> <div><span>Corporate form</span></div> <div><span>Proposals to change a corporation’s form, including those to convert to a public benefit corporation (</span><span>“</span><span>PBC</span><span>”</span><span>) structure, </span><span>should clearly articulate the stakeholder groups the company seeks to benefit and provide detail on how the interests of </span><span>shareholders would be augmented or adversely affected with the change to a PBC. These disclosures should also include the </span><span>accountability and voting mechanisms that would be available to shareholders. We generally support management proposals </span><span>to convert to a PBC if our analysis indicates that shareholders’ interests are adequately protected. Corporate form </span><span>shareholder proposals are evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</span></div> <div><span>Exclusive forum provisions</span></div> <div><span>BIS generally supports proposals to seek exclusive forum for certain shareholder litigation. In cases where a board unilaterally </span><span>adopts exclusive forum provisions that we consider unfavorable to the interests of shareholders, we will vote against the </span><span>Independent Chair or Lead Independent director and members of the nominating/governance committee.</span></div> <div><span>Reincorporation</span></div> <div><span>We will evaluate the economic and strategic rationale behind the company’s proposal to reincorporate on a case-by-case </span><span>basis. In all instances, we will evaluate the changes to shareholder protections under the new charter/articles/bylaws to </span><span>assess whether the move increases or decreases shareholder protections. Where we find that shareholder protections are </span><span>diminished, we may support reincorporation if we determine that the overall benefits outweigh the diminished rights.</span></div> <div><span>Multi-jurisdictional companies</span></div> <div><span>Where a company is listed on multiple exchanges or incorporated in a country different from their primary listing, we will </span><span>seek to apply the most relevant market guideline(s) to our analysis of the company’s governance structure and specific </span><span>proposals on the shareholder meeting agenda. In doing so, we typically consider the governance standards of the company’s </span><span>primary listing, the market standards by which the company governs themselves, and the market context of each specific </span><span>proposal on the agenda. If the relevant standards are silent on the issue under consideration, we will use our professional </span><span>judgment as to what voting outcome would best protect the long-term economic interests of investors. Companies should </span><span>disclose the rationale for their selection of primary listing, country of incorporation, and choice of governance structures, </span><span>particularly where there is conflict between relevant market governance practices.</span></div> <div><span>Adjourn meeting to solicit additional votes</span></div> <div><span>We generally support such proposals unless the agenda contains items that we judge to be detrimental to shareholders’ best </span><span>long-term economic interests.</span></div> <div><span>Bundled proposals</span></div> <div><span>Shareholders should have the opportunity to review substantial governance changes individually without having to accept </span><span>bundled proposals. Where several measures are grouped into one proposal, BIS may reject certain positive changes when </span><span>linked with proposals that generally contradict or impede the rights and economic interests of shareholders.</span></div> <div><span>Other business</span></div> <div><span>We oppose voting on matters where we are not given the opportunity to review and understand those measures and carry </span><span>out an appropriate level of shareholder oversight.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-31</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

<hr/> <div><a></a> <div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>Shareholder protections</span></div> <div><span>Amendment to charter/articles/bylaws</span></div> <div><span>Shareholders should have the right to vote on key corporate governance matters, including changes to governance </span><span>mechanisms and amendments to the charter/articles/bylaws. We may vote against certain directors where changes to </span><span>governing documents are not put to a shareholder vote within a reasonable period of time, particularly if those changes have </span><span>the potential to impact shareholder rights (see </span><span>“</span><span>Director elections</span><span>”</span><span>). In cases where a board’s unilateral adoption of changes </span><span>to the charter/articles/bylaws promotes cost and operational efficiency benefits for the company and its shareholders, we </span><span>may support such action if it does not have a negative effect on shareholder rights or the company’s corporate governance </span><span>structure.</span></div> <div><span>When voting on a management or shareholder proposal to make changes to the charter/articles/bylaws, we will consider in </span><span>part the company’s and/or proponent’s publicly stated rationale for the changes; the company’s governance profile and </span><span>history; relevant jurisdictional laws; and situational or contextual circumstances which may have motivated the proposed </span><span>changes, among other factors. We will typically support amendments to the charter/articles/bylaws where the benefits to </span><span>shareholders outweigh the costs of failing to make such changes</span></div> <div><span>Proxy access</span></div> <div><span>It is our view that long-term shareholders should have the opportunity, when necessary and under reasonable conditions, to </span><span>nominate directors on the company’s proxy card.</span><span>32</span><span> Securing the right of shareholders to nominate directors without </span><span>engaging in a control contest can enhance shareholders’ ability to meaningfully participate in the director election process, </span><span>encourage board attention to shareholder interests, and provide shareholders an effective means of directing that attention </span><span>where it is lacking. Proxy access mechanisms should provide shareholders with a reasonable opportunity to use this right </span><span>without stipulating overly restrictive or onerous parameters for use, and also provide assurances that the mechanism will not </span><span>be subject to abuse by short-term investors, investors without a substantial investment in the company, or investors seeking </span><span>to take control of the board.</span></div> <div><span>In general, we support market-standardized proxy access proposals, which allow a shareholder (or group of up to 20 </span><span>shareholders) holding three percent of a company’s outstanding shares for at least three years the right to nominate the </span><span>greater of up to two directors or 20% of the board. Where a standardized proxy access provision exists, we will generally </span><span>oppose shareholder proposals requesting outlier thresholds.</span></div> <div><span>Right to act by written consent</span></div> <div><span>In exceptional circumstances and with sufficiently broad support, shareholders should have the opportunity to raise issues of </span><span>substantial importance without having to wait for management to schedule a meeting. Accordingly, shareholders should </span><span>have the right to solicit votes by written consent provided that: 1) there are reasonable requirements to initiate the consent </span><span>solicitation process (in order to avoid the waste of corporate resources in addressing narrowly supported interests); and 2) </span><span>shareholders receive a minimum of 50% of outstanding shares to effectuate the action by written consent.</span></div> <div><span>We may oppose shareholder proposals requesting the right to act by written consent in cases where the proposal is </span><span>structured for the benefit of a dominant shareholder to the exclusion of others, or if the proposal is written to discourage the </span><span>board from incorporating appropriate mechanisms to avoid the waste of corporate resources when establishing a right to act </span><span>by written consent. Additionally, we may oppose shareholder proposals requesting the right to act by written consent if the </span><span>company already provides a shareholder right to call a special meeting that offers shareholders a reasonable opportunity to </span><span>raise issues of substantial importance without having to wait for management to schedule a meeting.</span></div> <div><span>Right to call a special meeting</span></div> <div><span>In exceptional circumstances and with sufficiently broad support, shareholders should have the opportunity to raise issues of </span><span>substantial importance without having to wait for management to schedule a meeting. Accordingly, shareholders should </span><span>have the right to call a special meeting in cases where a reasonably high proportion of shareholders (typically a minimum of </span><span>15% but no higher than 25%) are required to agree to such a meeting before it is called. However, we may oppose this right </span><span>in cases where the proposal is structured for the benefit of a dominant shareholder, or where a lower threshold may lead to </span><span>an ineffective use of corporate resources. We generally think that a right to act via written consent is not a sufficient </span><span>alternative to the right to call a special meeting.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div> <hr/> </div> <div> <div> <div><span>32</span></div> <div><span>BlackRock is subject to certain regulations and laws in the United States that place restrictions and limitations on how BlackRock can interact with the </span><span>companies in which we invest on behalf of our clients, including our ability to submit shareholder proposals or elect directors to the board.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-32</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>

As a result, </span><span>BlackRock will generally not participate in consent solicitations or related processes. However, once an item comes to a </span><span>shareholder vote, we uphold our fiduciary duty to vote in the best long-term interests of our clients, where we are authorized </span><span>to do so.</span></div> <div><span>Simple majority voting</span></div> <div><span>We generally favor a simple majority voting requirement to pass proposals. Therefore, we will generally support the reduction </span><span>or the elimination of supermajority voting requirements to the extent that we determine shareholders’ ability to protect their </span><span>economic interests is improved. Nonetheless, in situations where there is a substantial or dominant shareholder, </span><span>supermajority voting may be protective of minority shareholder interests, and we may support supermajority voting </span><span>requirements in those situations.</span></div> <div><span>Virtual meetings</span></div> <div><span>Shareholders should have the opportunity to participate in the annual and special meetings for the companies in which they </span><span>are invested, as these meetings facilitate an opportunity for shareholders to provide feedback and hear from the board and </span><span>management. While these meetings have traditionally been conducted in-person, virtual meetings are an increasingly viable </span><span>way for companies to utilize technology to facilitate shareholder accessibility, inclusiveness, and cost efficiencies. </span><span>Shareholders should have a meaningful opportunity to participate in the meeting and interact with the board and </span><span>management in these virtual settings; companies should facilitate open dialogue and allow shareholders to voice concerns </span><span>and provide feedback without undue censorship. Relevant shareholder proposals are assessed on a case-by-case basis.</span></div> </div> <div> </div> <div> <div><span>A-33</span></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> </div> <hr/>
