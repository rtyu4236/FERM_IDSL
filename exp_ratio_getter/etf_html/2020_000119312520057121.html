remaining maturity of less than or equal to one year. Under normal circumstances, the Fund will seek to maintain a weighted average maturity of less than one year. Weighted average maturity is
the U.S. dollar weighted average of the remaining term to maturity of the underlying securities in the Fund’s portfolio. As of December 31, 2019, there were 94 components in the Underlying Index. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">The Underlying Index is market value weighted based on amounts outstanding of issuances consisting of publicly issued U.S. Treasury securities with at least 50 days
to final maturity at the time of issuance, a remaining term to final maturity of less than or equal to one year as of the rebalance date and have $1 billion or more of outstanding face value, excluding amounts held by the Federal Reserve System
Open Market Account . In addition, the securities in the Underlying Index must have a fixed coupon schedule and be denominated in U.S. dollars. Excluded from the Underlying Index are inflation-linked debt, cash management bills, and <font>zero-coupon</font> bonds that have been stripped from coupon-paying bonds (<i>e.g.</i>, Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities (“STRIPS”)). However, the amounts outstanding of
qualifying coupon securities in the Underlying Index are not reduced by any individual components of such securities (i.e., coupon or principal) that have been stripped after inclusion in the Underlying Index. The Underlying Index is rebalanced on
the last calendar day of each month. </font></p> <p><font size="2"><b><i>Change in the Fund’s “Construction and Maintenance of the Underlying Indexes”

payments and redemptions are retained in the Underlying Index until end of the month and then removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the Underlying Index. New issues must be auctioned on or
before the rebalancing date in order to qualify for the coming month. </font></p> <p> </p> <p><font size="2">If you
