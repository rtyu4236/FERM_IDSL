</td></tr></table> </div> <div>Investment Objective</div>
<div>The iShares ESG U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (the
“Fund”) seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of U.S. dollar-denominated, investment-grade bonds from issuers generally evaluated for favorable environmental, social and governance practices while exhibiting risk and
return characteristics similar to those of the broad U.S. dollar-denominated investment-grade bond market.</div>
<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you
will incur if you own shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides that BFA will pay
all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage
commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses. The Fund may incur “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses.” Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses reflect the Fund's <font>pro
rata</font> share of the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies. The impact of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses is included in the total returns of the Fund. Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses are not included in the
calculation of the ratio of expenses to average net assets shown in the <font>Financial Highlights</font> section of the Fund's prospectus (the “Prospectus”). BFA, the investment adviser to the Fund, has
contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fees in an amount equal to the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if any, attributable to investments by the Fund in other registered investment companies advised by BFA or its affiliates,
through June 30, 2024. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to June 30, 2024 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA.</div>
<div>You may also incur usual and customary brokerage commissions
and other charges when buying or selling shares of the Fund, which are not reflected in the Example that follows:</div> <div>

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund may pay
transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in
a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance.</font></div>
<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Bloomberg
Barclays MSCI US Aggregate ESG Focus Index (the “Underlying Index”), which has been developed by Bloomberg Barclays Capital Inc. (the “Index Provider” or “Bloomberg Barclays”) with environmental, social and
governance (“ESG”) rating inputs from MSCI ESG Research LLC (“MSCI ESG Research”) pursuant to an agreement between MSCI ESG Research and Bloomberg Index Services Limited (a subsidiary of Bloomberg Barclays) or an affiliate.
The Underlying Index is an optimized fixed-income index designed to reflect the performance of U.S. dollar-denominated, investment-grade (as determined by the Index Provider)</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>bonds from issuers generally evaluated for favorable ESG practices (as
determined by MSCI ESG Research), while exhibiting risk and return characteristics similar to those of the Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index (the “Parent Index”).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index includes investment-grade U.S. Treasury
bonds, non-securitized government-related bonds (“government-related bonds”), corporate bonds, mortgage-backed pass-through securities (“MBS”), commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) and asset-backed
securities (“ABS”) that are publicly offered for sale in the U.S.</div>
<div>To construct the Underlying Index, the Index Provider begins
with the Parent Index and replicates its U.S. Treasury bond, MBS, CMBS and ABS exposures. These exposures are preserved at the weights of the Parent Index and are not subject to the Index Provider’s optimization process, which is a
quantitative process that seeks to determine optimal weights for securities to maximize exposure to securities of entities with higher MSCI ESG Research ratings, subject to maintaining risk and return characteristics similar to the Parent Index. For
the remaining constituents of the Parent Index (i.e.,</div> </div> </div> <div>  </div> <div type="Block"> 
<div>S-2</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>corporate bonds and government-related bonds), the Index Provider excludes
securities of entities involved in the business of tobacco, entities involved with controversial weapons, producers and retailers of civilian firearms, as well as entities involved in very severe business controversies (in each case as determined by
MSCI ESG Research), and then follows the Index Provider’s optimization process.</div>
<div>For each industry, MSCI ESG Research identifies key ESG issues
that can lead to substantial costs or opportunities for entities (<font>e.g.</font>, climate change, resource scarcity, demographic shifts). MSCI ESG Research then rates each entity’s exposure to each key issue based
on the entity’s business segment and geographic risk and analyzes the extent to which entities have developed robust strategies and programs to manage ESG risks and opportunities. MSCI ESG Research scores entities based on both their risk
exposure and risk management. To score well on a key issue, MSCI ESG Research assesses management practices, management performance (through demonstrated track record and other quantitative performance indicators), governance structures, and/or
implications in controversies, which all may be taken as a proxy for overall management quality. Controversies, including, among other things, issues involving anti-competitive practices, toxic emissions and waste, and health and safety, occurring
within the last three years lead to a deduction from the overall management score on each issue. Using a sector-specific key issue weighting model, entities are rated and ranked in comparison to their industry peers. Key issues and weights are
reviewed at the end of each calendar year. Corporate governance is</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>always weighted and analyzed for all entities.</div>
<div>The securities in the Underlying Index must have at least one
year remaining to maturity, with the exception of amortizing securities such as ABS and MBS, which have lower thresholds as defined by the Index Provider. In addition, the securities in the Underlying Index must be denominated in U.S. dollars and
must be fixed-rate and nonconvertible. Certain types of securities, such as state and local government series bonds, structured notes with embedded swaps or other special features, private placements (other than those offered pursuant to Rule 144A
or Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”)), floating rate securities and bonds that have been issued in one country’s currency but are traded outside of that country in a different
monetary and regulatory system (Eurobonds), are excluded from the Underlying Index. The securities in the Underlying Index are updated on the last business day of each month.</div>
<div>As of September 4, 2018, bonds that are subject to the Index
Provider’s optimization process, which comprised approximately 32% of the bonds in the Underlying Index, received an MSCI ESG Research weighted average rating of 8.45 on a scale from 0 to 10, with 10 being the highest rating. As of September
4, 2018, U.S. Treasury bonds, which comprised approximately 38% of the bonds in the Underlying Index, received an MSCI ESG Research rating of 6.98. As of September 4, 2018, there were 4,992 issues in the Underlying Index. As of September 4, 2018, a
significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by MBS, treasury securities and debt</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>securities issued by entities in the industrials industry or sector. The
components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time.</div>
<div>As of September 4, 2018, approximately 28% of the bonds in the
Underlying Index were U.S. fixed-rate agency MBS. U.S. fixed-rate agency MBS are securities issued by entities such as the Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”), the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie
Mae”), and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”) and are backed by pools of mortgages. Per the index methodology, U.S. fixed-rate agency MBS exposure does not receive any MSCI ESG Research rating as the Index
Provider believes that U.S. fixed-rate agency MBS exposure is neither additive nor decremental to the Underlying Index's ESG rating profile. As such, based on currently available data, the Index Provider believes U.S. fixed-rate agency MBS exposure
is ESG neutral and not inconsistent with an ESG focused exposure. Most transactions in fixed-rate MBS occur through standardized contracts for future delivery in which the exact mortgage pools to be delivered are not specified until a few days prior
to settlement (to-be-announced (“TBA”) transactions). The Fund may enter into such contracts on a regular basis. The Fund, pending settlement of such contracts, will invest its assets in high-quality, liquid short-term instruments,
including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates. The Fund will assume its pro rata share of the fees and expenses of any money market fund that it may invest in, in addition to the Fund’s own fees and expenses. The Fund
may also acquire interests in</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>mortgage pools through means other than such standardized contracts for future
delivery. The securities in the Underlying Index are updated on the last business day of each month.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to that of an applicable underlying index. The securities
selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability, duration, maturity, credit ratings and
yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its assets in
the component securities of the Underlying Index and in investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities of the Underlying Index (<font>i.e.</font>, TBAs)
and</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap
contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates (“BlackRock Cash Funds”), as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the
Fund track the Underlying Index. From time to time when conditions warrant, the Fund may invest at least 80% of its assets in the component securities of the Underlying Index and in investments that have economic characteristics that are
substantially identical to the component securities of the Underlying Index (<font>i.e.</font>, TBAs) and may invest up to 20% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,
including shares of BlackRock Cash Funds, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index
before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div> <div>The Fund may lend
securities representing up to one-third of the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by Bloomberg Barclays, MSCI
ESG Research or their affiliates, which are independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the
Underlying Index.</div> <div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font> The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to approximately the
same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities), repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities, and
securities of state or municipal governments and their political subdivisions are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share
(“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or other asset classes.
Securities of companies that have positive or favorable ESG characteristics may underperform other securities.</font></div>
<div>Assets Under Management (AUM) Risk<font>.</font><font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of the Prospectus), a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a specific period
of time in order to facilitate commencement of the Fund’s operations or to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</font><font> </font><font>can be no</font></div>

<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>assurance that any such entity would not redeem its investment or that the
size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an
agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed
with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units (as defined in the </font><font>Purchase and Sale of Fund
Shares</font><font> section of the Prospectus), Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting.</font></div>
<div>Calculation Methodology Risk. <font>The Underlying Index relies on various sources of information to assess the criteria of issuers included in the Underlying Index, including information that may be based on assumptions and estimates.
Neither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances that the Underlying Index’s calculation methodology or sources of information will provide an accurate assessment of included issuers.</font></div>
<div>Call Risk<font>. </font><font>During periods of falling interest rates, an issuer of a callable bond held by the Fund may “call” or repay the security before its stated maturity, and the Fund may have to reinvest the
proceeds in securities with lower yields, which would result in a decline in the Fund's income, or in</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>securities with greater risks or with other less favorable features.</div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
investments are concentrated in the securities of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector or asset class.</font></div>
<div>Credit Risk<font>.</font><font> Debt issuers and other counterparties may be unable or unwilling to make timely interest and/or principal payments when due or otherwise honor their obligations. Changes in an issuer’s credit
rating or the market’s perception of an issuer’s creditworthiness may also adversely affect the value of the Fund’s investment in that issuer. The degree of credit risk depends on an issuer’s or counterparty’s financial
condition and on the terms of an obligation.</font></div> <div>Cyber
Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, and other service providers, market makers,
Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions and negatively impact the Fund’s business operations, potentially resulting in financial losses to the Fund and its
shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the
cyber security plans and systems of the Fund’s service providers, the Index</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Provider, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in
which the Fund invests.</div> <div>ESG Investment Strategy Risk. <font>The Fund’s ESG investment strategy limits the types and number of investment opportunities available to the Fund and, as a result, the Fund may underperform other funds that do not have an ESG
focus. The Fund’s ESG investment strategy may result in the Fund investing in securities or industry sectors that underperform the market as a whole or underperform other funds screened for ESG standards. In addition, entities selected by the
Index Provider may not exhibit positive or favorable ESG characteristics.</font></div>
<div>Extension Risk. <font>During periods of rising interest rates, certain debt obligations may be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated and the value of those securities may fall sharply, resulting in a
decline in the Fund’s income and potentially in the value of the Fund’s investments.</font></div>
<div>High Portfolio Turnover Risk.<font> High portfolio turnover (considered by the Fund to mean higher than 100% annually) may result in increased transaction costs to the Fund, including brokerage commissions, dealer mark-ups and other
transaction costs on the sale of the securities and on reinvestment in other securities.</font></div>
<div>Income Risk.
<font>The Fund's income may decline when interest rates fall. This decline can occur because the Fund may subsequently invest in lower-yielding bonds as bonds in its portfolio mature, are near maturity
or are called, bonds in the Underlying Index are substituted, or the Fund otherwise needs to purchase additional bonds.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of
the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its
shareholders.</font></div> <div>Industrials Sector Risk.<font> Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by changes in the supply of and demand for products and services, product obsolescence and changes in general economic conditions, among
other factors. While the Fund seeks to invest in companies with positive or favorable environmental and social characteristics, companies in the industrials sector may also be adversely affected by claims for environmental damage or product
liability.</font></div> <div>Interest Rate Risk<font>.</font><font> An increase in interest rates may cause the value of securities held by the Fund to decline, may lead to heightened volatility in the fixed-income markets and
may adversely affect the liquidity of certain fixed-income investments. The historically low interest rate environment, together with recent modest rate increases, heightens the risks associated with rising interest rates.</font></div> </div>

<div>S-7</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may
cause the value of the securities to decline.</font></div>
<div>Liquidity Risk<font>.</font><font> Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. This can reduce the Fund's returns because the Fund may be unable to transact at advantageous times or
prices.</font></div> <div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund may not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended
results.</font></div> <div>Market
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market
downturns.</font></div> <div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets,
periods of high volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>Mortgage-Backed Securities Risk. <font>The Fund invests in MBS, some of which may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. MBS are subject to prepayment or call risk and extension risk. Because of these risks, MBS
react differently than other bonds to changes in interest rates. Small movements in interest rates (both increases and decreases) may quickly and significantly reduce the value of</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>certain MBS. Default or bankruptcy of a counterparty to a TBA transaction
would expose the Fund to possible loss.</div> <div>Operational Risk<font>. The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund’s service
providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address
every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Prepayment Risk.<font> During periods of falling interest rates, issuers of certain debt obligations may repay principal prior to the security’s maturity, which may cause the Fund to have to reinvest in securities with
lower yields or higher risk of default, resulting in a decline in the Fund’s income or return potential.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the
U.S<font>.</font><font> Certain changes in the U.S. economy, such as when the U.S. economy weakens or when its financial markets decline, may have an adverse effect on the
securities to which the Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-8</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any
investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund.</div>
<div>Small Fund Risk. <font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain
conditions of the listing exchange. If the Fund were to be required to delist from the listing exchange, the value of the Fund may rapidly decline and performance may be negatively impacted. In addition, any resulting liquidation of the Fund could
cause the Fund to incur elevated transaction costs for the Fund and negative tax consequences for its shareholders.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the Fund's
valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund's NAV), differences in transaction costs, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of distributions, the requirements to
maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing
regulatory</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market
volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not. <font>BFA EXPECTS THAT THE FUND MAY EXPERIENCE HIGHER TRACKING
ERROR THAN IS TYPICAL FOR SIMILAR INDEX ETFs.</font></div>
<div>U.S. Agency Debt Risk. <font>The Fund invests in unsecured bonds or debentures issued by U.S. government agencies. Bonds or debentures issued by U.S. government agencies, government-sponsored entities, or government corporations,
including, among others, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are generally backed only by the general creditworthiness and reputation of the U.S. government agency, government-sponsored entity, or government corporation issuing the bond or debenture and are

<div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or other asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index,
particularly for securities or other assets that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. In addition, the value of the securities or other
assets in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund's shares. Authorized Participants who purchase</font></div> </div>

may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s ability to value investments may be impacted
by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</div>

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an exchange-traded fund (commonly referred to as an
“ETF”). Individual shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange. Most investors will buy and sell shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer. The price of Fund shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares
trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund will only issue or redeem shares that have been aggregated into blocks of 100,000 shares or multiples thereof
(“Creation Units”) to Authorized Participants who have entered into agreements with the Fund's distributor. The Fund generally will issue or redeem Creation Units in return for a designated portfolio of securities (and an amount of cash)
that the Fund specifies each day.</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make distributions that may be taxable to
you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an individual retirement account (“IRA”), in which case, your distributions generally will be taxed when
withdrawn.</div> <div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and other Financial
Intermediaries</div> <div>If you purchase shares of the Fund through
a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms
and reporting systems or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another
investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.<br/> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
