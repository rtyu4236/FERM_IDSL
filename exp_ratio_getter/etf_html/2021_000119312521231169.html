<div>Notice to Shareholders</div>
<div>On June 16, 2021, the Board of Trustees of the Trust
unanimously voted to close and liquidate the Fund. After the close of business on August 23, 2021, the Fund will no longer accept creation orders. Trading in the Fund will be halted prior to market open on August 24, 2021. Proceeds of the
liquidation are currently scheduled to be sent to shareholders on August 26, 2021.</div>
<div>When the Fund is in the process of liquidating its portfolio,
which is anticipated to commence prior to August 24, 2021, the Fund will hold cash and securities that may not be consistent with the Fund’s investment objective and strategies and is likely to incur higher tracking error than is typical for
the Fund. Furthermore, during the time between market open on August 24, 2021 and August 26, 2021, because shares will not be traded on Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (“Cboe BZX”), we cannot assure you that there will be a trading market for
your shares.</div> <div>Shareholders may sell their holdings of the
Fund on Cboe BZX until the market close on August 23, 2021 and may incur the usual and customary brokerage commissions associated with the sale of Fund shares. At the time the liquidation of the Fund is complete, shares of the Fund will be
individually redeemed. If you still hold shares of the Fund on August 26, 2021, the Fund will automatically redeem your shares for cash based on the net asset value as of the close of business on August 23, 2021, which will include any dividends or
distributions calculated as of that date.</div> <div>If you are
subject to federal income tax, the liquidation of the Fund will result in one or more taxable events for you. A sale or exchange of Fund shares prior to the liquidation will generally give rise to a capital gain or loss to you for federal income tax
purposes. In connection with the liquidation, the Fund may declare taxable distributions of its investment income and/or taxable distributions of its net capital gain. Any liquidation proceeds paid to you should generally be treated as received by
you in exchange for your shares and will therefore generally give rise to a capital gain or loss depending on your tax basis. Please consult your personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences.</div>

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund
may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are
held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance. From inception (April 14, 2020) to the most recent fiscal year end, the Fund’s
portfolio turnover rate was 111% of the average value of its portfolio.</font></div>
<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Russell
US Small Cap Factors Blend Style Index (the “Underlying Index”), which is an objective, rules-based equity index provided by FTSE Russell (the “Index Provider” or “Russell”). The Underlying Index is designed to
select equity securities from the Russell 2000<sup>®</sup> Index (the “Parent Index”), with exposure to five equity style factors (momentum,
quality, value, size and low volatility) while maintaining a level of risk similar to that of the Parent Index. The Parent Index, which measures the performance of the small-capitalization segment of the U.S. equity market, is a float-adjusted
capitalization-weighted index consisting of approximately 2000 of the smallest issuers in the Russell 3000 Index.</div>
<div>Russell, in selecting equity securities from the Parent Index,
assigns a weighted composite score for a security using a proprietary model based on five commonly-used equity style factors (momentum, quality, value, size and low</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>volatility). The value score is calculated from the following value factor
metrics: 12-month trailing book-to-price, dividend yield, earnings yield and cash flow yield (<font>i.e</font>., cash flow divided by the full market capitalization). The momentum score is calculated from three momentum
factor metrics: price momentum, earnings momentum and earnings announcement drift (<font>i.e.</font>, the difference between a stock's performance on and immediately following an earnings announcement date). The quality
score is calculated from four quality factor metrics: gross profitability, dilution, accruals and changes in net operating assets. The low volatility score is calculated based on a 12-month trailing realized volatility, and the size score seeks to
measure the market capitalization of a company as compared to other companies of the Parent Index. The Underlying Index excludes constituents in the Parent Index that rank in the least liquid 20%, as determined by the Index Provider (<font>i.e.</font>, approximately 400 constituents).</div>
<div>As of March 31, 2021, a significant portion of the Underlying
Index is represented by securities of companies in the consumer discretionary, financials and healthcare industries or sectors. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is reviewed monthly using an optimization
process designed to maximize, in aggregate, the Underlying Index's exposure to the weighted combination of the five target investment style factors while maintaining total risk similar to that of the Parent Index.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-2</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it
tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover
low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to that of an applicable underlying index. The securities
selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar
to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 80% of its assets in
the component securities of its Underlying Index and in investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities of its Underlying Index (<font>i.e</font>., depositary
receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index) and may invest up to 20% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as well as in securities
not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash equivalent investments associated with a derivative position will be treated as part of that position for the purposes of
calculating investments not included in the Underlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of
the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by Russell, which is part of
the London Stock Exchange Group and is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the
Underlying Index.</div> <div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font> The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or
group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements
collateralized by U.S. government securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</font></div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-3</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks,
including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share (“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk
factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or other asset
classes.</font></div> <div>Assets Under Management (AUM) Risk<font>.</font><font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this prospectus (the “Prospectus”)), a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its
investment for a specific period of time to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</font><font> </font><font>can be no assurance that any such entity would not redeem
its investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption
transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other
market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step
forward to create or redeem, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting.</div>
<div>Calculation Methodology Risk. <font>The Underlying Index relies on various sources of information to assess the criteria of issuers included in the Underlying Index, including information that may be based on assumptions and estimates.
Neither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances that the Underlying Index’s calculation methodology or sources of information will provide an accurate assessment of included issuers.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector, market segment or asset class.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Discretionary Sector Risk.<font> The consumer discretionary sector may be affected by changes in domestic and international economies, exchange and interest rates, competition, consumers' disposable income, consumer preferences,
social trends and marketing campaigns.</font></div> <div>Cybersecurity
Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, the Index Provider and other service providers, market
makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests have the</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-4</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s business
operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent
limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems of the Fund’s Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which
the Fund invests.</div> <div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is composed of
common stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the
bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div> <div>Financials Sector Risk<font>.</font><font> Performance of companies in the financials sector may be adversely impacted by many factors, including, among others, changes in government regulations,
economic conditions, and interest rates, credit rating downgrades, and decreased liquidity in credit markets. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law.
The impact of changes in capital requirements and recent or future regulation of any individual financial company, or of the financials sector as a whole, cannot be predicted. In recent years, cyberattacks and technology malfunctions and
failures</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>have become increasingly frequent in this sector and have caused significant
losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund.</div>
<div>Healthcare Sector Risk<font>.</font><font> The profitability of companies in the healthcare sector may be affected by government regulations and government healthcare programs, increases or decreases in the cost of medical products and
services, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, demand for medical products and services and product liability claims, among other factors. Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent on patent protection, and the expiration of a
company’s patent may adversely affect that company’s profitability. Healthcare companies are subject to competitive forces that may result in price discounting, and may be thinly capitalized and susceptible to product
obsolescence.</font></div> <div>High Portfolio Turnover Risk.<font> High portfolio turnover (considered by the Fund to mean higher than 100% annually) may result in increased transaction costs to the Fund, including brokerage commissions, dealer mark-ups and other
transaction costs on the sale of the securities and on reinvestment in other securities.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the
construction</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>of the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time
to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market conditions may cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled
rebalance, which could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition.</div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk. <font>An outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus has resulted in travel restrictions, disruption of healthcare systems, prolonged quarantines, cancellations,
supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings downgrades, defaults and other significant economic impacts. Certain markets have experienced temporary closures, extreme volatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity and increased
trading costs. These events will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and could impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities or cause elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV. Other
infectious illness outbreaks in the future may result in similar impacts.</font></div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may
cause the value of the securities to decline.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of
terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s
NAV.</font></div> <div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets,
periods of high volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>Model Risk<font>.</font><font> Neither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances that the Index Provider’s model will result in the Fund meeting its investment objective. The Fund may underperform other funds that do not similarly
invest.</font></div> <div>Non-Diversification Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may invest a large percentage of its assets in securities issued by or representing a small number of issuers. As a result, the Fund's performance may
depend on the performance of a small number of issuers.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund’s service providers,
counterparties or other third parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible
risk and may be</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-6</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>inadequate to address significant operational risks.</div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the
U.S<font>.</font><font> Certain changes in the U.S. economy, such as when the U.S. economy weakens or when its financial markets decline, may have an adverse effect on the
securities to which the Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax
consequences for the Fund.</font></div> <div>Small-Capitalization
Companies Risk<font>.</font><font> Compared to mid- and large-capitalization companies, small-capitalization companies may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse
developments. In addition, the securities of small-capitalization companies may be more volatile and less liquid than those of mid- and large-capitalization companies.</font></div>
<div>Small Fund Risk. <font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain
conditions of the listing exchange. Any resulting liquidation of the Fund could cause the Fund to incur elevated transaction costs for the Fund and negative tax consequences for its shareholders.</font></div>
<div>Style Factors Risk<font>.</font><font> Each of the five equity style factors (momentum, quality,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>value, size and low volatility) that determine the weight of each component
security in the Underlying Index has characteristics which may cause the Fund to underperform the Parent Index or the market as a whole.</div>
<div>Low Size Strategy Risk<font>.
Companies with relatively lower market capitalization within a broader index or market capitalization range (“low size companies”) may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse developments, and their securities may be more volatile
and less liquid, than companies with higher market capitalization.</font></div>
<div>Low Volatility Strategy Risk<font>.
Although the Underlying Index was created by the Index Provider to seek high exposure to the five style factors while maintaining a risk similar to that of the Parent Index, there is no guarantee that the Index Provider will be successful.
Securities in the Fund’s portfolio may be subject to price volatility, and the prices may not be any less volatile than the market as a whole, and could be more volatile.</font></div>
<div>Momentum Strategy Risk<font>. Stocks
that previously exhibited high momentum characteristics may not experience positive momentum or may experience more volatility than the market as a whole.</font></div>
<div>Quality Strategy Risk<font>. Stocks
included in the Underlying Index are deemed by the Index Provider to be quality stocks, but there is no guarantee that the past performance of these stocks will continue. Companies that issue these stocks may experience lower than expected returns
or may experience negative growth, as well as increased leverage, resulting in lower than expected or negative returns to Fund shareholders. Many factors can affect a</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>

<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>stock’s quality and performance, and the impact of these factors on a
stock or its price can be difficult to predict.</div> <div>Value
Strategy Risk<font>. Securities issued by companies that may be perceived as undervalued, particularly securities of a company that appear to trade at a significant discount to the company’s intrinsic value, may fail
to appreciate for long periods of time and may never realize their full potential value. Value securities have generally performed better than non-value securities during periods of economic recovery (although there is no assurance that they will
continue to do so). Value securities may go in and out of favor over time.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences, transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the
accrual of or</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>the valuation of dividends or interest, the requirements to maintain
pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or
existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does
not. <font>BFA EXPECTS THAT THE FUND MAY EXPERIENCE HIGHER TRACKING ERROR THAN IS TYPICAL FOR SIMILAR INDEX ETFs, ESPECIALLY BEFORE THE FUND REACHES SUFFICIENT SCALE AND FURTHER BROADENS ITS HOLDINGS.</font></div>

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an exchange-traded fund (commonly referred to as an

less than NAV (a discount). An investor may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for shares of the Fund

Intermediaries</div> <div>If you purchase shares of the Fund through
a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms
and reporting systems or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another
investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.<br/> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
