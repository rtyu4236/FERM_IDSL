<div>The iShares MSCI Water Management Multisector ETF (the
“Fund”) seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of U.S. and non-U.S. companies that either 1) derive a proportion of their revenues from sustainable water products or services or 2) demonstrate relative efficiency in
their water management.</div> <div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you
will incur if you buy, hold and sell shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides
that BFA will pay all operating expenses of the Fund, except: (i) the management fees, (ii) interest expenses, (iii) taxes, (iv) expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio
transactions, including brokerage commissions, (v) distribution fees or expenses, and (vi) litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses.</div>

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund
may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are
held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance.</font></div>
<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the MSCI ACWI
IMI Sustainable Water Transition Extended Capped Index (the “Underlying Index”), which has been developed by MSCI, Inc. (the “Index Provider” or “MSCI”). The Underlying Index is composed of U.S. and non-U.S.
equity securities selected from the MSCI ACWI Investable Market Index (IMI) (the “Parent Index”). The Underlying Index is composed of two sets of constituents: 1) companies that provide, or have high exposure to, water-focused products
or services and derive at least 10% of their revenues from “sustainable water” (the “water supply universe”), or 2) companies that demonstrate relatively efficient water management (the “water usage universe”),
each as determined by MSCI and described below. MSCI defines “sustainable water” as products and services that address water scarcity or water quality issues, including specialized wastewater treatment chemicals, smart metering devices,
drought-resistant seeds, wastewater filters, desalination equipment and services, maintenance of water distribution infrastructure, and construction of wastewater plants and</div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>stormwater systems. To assess water management efficiency, MSCI calculates a
water stress management score using metrics related to a company's water usage governance, strategy, targets and performance as well as water conflicts controversies.</div>
<div>The Parent Index includes large-, mid- and small-capitalization
representation across 23 developed markets and 24 emerging markets countries.</div>
<div>The Index Provider begins with the Parent Index and excludes
the securities of issuers that it identifies as being involved in the business of tobacco, companies involved with controversial weapons, producers and retailers of civilian firearms, and companies involved in thermal coal mining or sales, thermal
coal-based power generation or the extraction of oil sands. Certain exclusions (<font>e.g.</font>, controversial weapons) are categorical, and others are based on revenue or percentage of revenue thresholds.</div>
<div>Additional exclusions are based on certain environmental- or
sustainability-related criteria. The Index Provider excludes companies that it determines are involved in “very severe” controversies related to the environmental, social or governance (“ESG”) impact of the company’s
operations and/or products and services. To evaluate ESG controversies, the Index Provider monitors across five categories of ESG impact – environment, human rights and communities, labor rights and supply chain, customers and governance
– and 28 sub-categories. Companies that are involved in “noteworthy,” “severe” or “very severe” environmental controversies, as determined by the Index Provider, are also excluded. Environmental
controversies can relate</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-2</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>to, among other things, toxic emissions and waste, water stress, biodiversity
and supply chain management.</div> <div>Additionally, the Index
Provider excludes companies belonging to the bottom 25% of the environmental pillar of the MSCI ESG Ratings framework, relative to their relevant ESG Ratings industry, as well as companies belonging to the bottom 25% of the water stress management
score under the MSCI ESG Ratings framework, each as determined by the Index Provider. A company’s water stress management score is based on its efforts to manage water-related risks and opportunities. Also excluded are companies that are
assessed by the Index Provider as “strongly misaligned” or “misaligned” to any of three United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”): Clean Water and Sanitation, Responsible Consumption and Production,
and Life Below Water. The alignment assessment considers, among other things, revenues from products and services with positive or negative impact. The SDG assessment factors could include, among others, water consumption or withdrawal targets,
exposure to water-intensive or water-polluting operations, and revenues from activities such as wastewater treatment.</div>
<div>From the universe of issuers remaining after the exclusions are
applied (the “filtered universe”), the Index Provider selects two subsets of constituents, the water supply universe and the water usage universe, as described below.</div>
<div>Water Supply Universe<font>.
Constituents in the water supply universe of the Underlying Index engage in, or have high exposure to, the business activities of water supply, water utilities, water treatment or water-related equipment. Certain GICS sub-industries are</font></div>
</div> <div type="Block">
<div>excluded from the water supply universe, including, among others, diversified
metals and mining, paper packaging and products, electric and gas utilities, and oil and gas equipment services, exploration, production, storage and transportation.</div>
<div>There are four possible ways for a company to be deemed to be
engaged in, or have high exposure to, the business activities of water supply, water utilities, water treatment or water-related equipment and, therefore, included in the water supply universe. First, all companies from the water utility GICS
sub-industry are included.</div> <div>Second, companies with a
“business segment relevance” to water score of 25% or more, as determined by the Index Provider, are included. This score represents the percentage of a company’s total revenues derived from water-based business segments. The Index
Provider considers a business segment to be water-based if 1) its name includes at least one instance of any of the key words “water,” “plumbing,” or “flow” or 2) the segment is assigned to certain Standard
Industrial Classification codes (<font>e.g.</font>, pumps and pumping equipment, plumbing fixtures, water well drilling, sewerage system, air and water resource and solid waste management, water supply).</div>
<div>Third, companies within the GICS sectors of materials,
information technology, industrials and utilities are included if they have a “business description relevance” to water score of 75% or more, as determined by the Index Provider. Companies in the GICS sub-industries of diversified
chemicals, specialty chemicals and electronic equipment are included if they have a “business description relevance” score</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-3</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>of 25% or more, as determined by the Index Provider. This score is based
primarily on the frequency of the key words “water,” “plumbing” and “flow” as a percentage of the total number of words in the company’s business description.</div>
<div>Fourth, companies that derive 25% or more revenues from
“sustainable water” products and services (as defined above) are included. Revenue figures associated with “sustainable water” activities are sourced from publicly available information when available. Revenue figures may be
estimated by the Index Provider when companies do not report exact revenue figures for “sustainable water” products and services; these estimates are based on certain assumptions, including that a given company's product lines are of
equal weight in terms of revenue contribution in the absence of information indicating otherwise.</div>
<div>As a final filter, companies that derive less than 10% of their
revenues from “sustainable water” products and services are excluded from the water supply universe.</div>
<div>Water Usage Universe<font>. The
water usage universe of the Underlying Index is constructed by selecting stocks from the filtered universe that are not part of the water supply universe. The water usage selection process generally focuses on certain sub-industries within the GICS
consumer discretionary, consumer staples, energy, information technology, materials and utilities sectors and other companies for which water stress is a key issue, as determined by the Index Provider. These include, among others, hotels, resorts,
cruise lines, soft drinks, semiconductors, industrial gases, electric utilities and specialty</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>chemicals. The Index Provider uses water stress management scores, as
calculated under the MSCI ESG Ratings framework, to identify companies that the Index Provider has determined have better management strategies to address water stress, relative to their industry peers.</div>
<div>A company’s water stress management score is based on the
following factors: (1) governance and strategy (<font>e.g.</font>, executive body responsible for water management strategy and performance, implementation of water-efficient production processes); (2) targets (<font>e.g.</font>, targets to improve water consumption performance, demonstrated track record of achieving water reduction targets); (3) performance (<font>e.g.</font>, water intensity trend, as a
proportion of sales); and (4) water conflicts controversies (<font>e.g.</font>, if a company is competing for water in a drought area). The Index Provider calculates a sector-relative version of the water stress management
score by dividing the company’s score by the highest score among other companies in the same sector. Companies that are in the top 5% of the sector-relative water stress management scores across the relevant set of sub-industries and companies
are selected for the water usage universe.</div> <div>Securities
included in the Underlying Index are weighted within their respective universe (<font>i.e.</font>, water supply or water usage) in proportion to their free float-adjusted market capitalization. The Index Provider targets a
weight of 50% of the Underlying Index for each of the water supply and water usage universes. The maximum weight of an issuer in its respective universe is 12%.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is reconstituted and rebalanced
semi-annually, when the Index Provider updates the filtered</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-4</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>universe, the water supply universe and the water usage universe. The
Underlying Index is also reviewed quarterly, at which time existing constituents in the filtered universe are deleted from the Underlying Index if they fall within an exclusions category.</div>
<div>As of August 22, 2022, the Underlying Index consisted of
approximately 54 constituents and included securities of companies from the following countries or regions: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands,
New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) and the U.S. As of August 22, 2022, a significant portion of the Underlying Index was represented by securities of companies in the consumer
staples, industrials and utilities industries or sectors. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover
low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund.</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>“Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves
investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to that of an applicable underlying index. The securities selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on
factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the
securities in the Underlying Index.</div> <div>The Fund generally
will invest at least 90% of its assets in the component securities of the Underlying Index and in investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities of the Underlying Index (<font>i.e.</font>, depositary receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index) and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money
market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. Cash and cash equivalent investments associated with a derivative
position will be treated as part of that position for the purposes of calculating the percentage of investments included in the Underlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the
Fund.</div> <div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to
one-third of the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by MSCI, which
is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font>
The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to
approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government
securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</font></div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share
(“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or other asset classes.
Securities of companies that have positive or favorable ESG characteristics may underperform other securities.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Assets Under Management (AUM) Risk<font>.</font><font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this prospectus (the “Prospectus”)), a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its
investment for a specific period of time to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</font><font> </font><font>can be no assurance that any such entity would not redeem
its investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this
prospectus (the “Prospectus”)) may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption transactions. The Fund has a limited
number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that
Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, Fund shares may be more likely to trade
at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened for exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S.
issuers or other securities or instruments that have lower trading volumes.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Calculation Methodology Risk. <font>The Underlying Index relies on various sources of information to assess the criteria of issuers included in the Underlying Index, including information that may be based on assumptions and estimates.
Neither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances that the Underlying Index’s calculation methodology or sources of information will provide an accurate assessment of included issuers.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector, market segment or asset class.</font></div>
<div>Consumer Staples Sector Risk.<font> The consumer staples sector may be affected by, among other things, marketing campaigns, changes in consumer demands, government regulations and changes in commodity prices.</font></div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the currency of a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are
delays or limits on repatriation of such currency. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may change quickly and without warning.</font></div>
<div>Cybersecurity Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>the Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized
Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the Fund and its shareholders. While
the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and
systems of the Fund’s Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is composed of common stocks, which generally
subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>ESG Risk. <font>To
the extent that the Underlying Index uses criteria related to the ESG characteristics of issuers, this may limit the types and number of investment opportunities available to the Fund and, as a result, the Fund may underperform other funds whose
underlying index does not use ESG criteria. The Underlying Index’s use of ESG criteria may result in the Fund investing in securities or market sectors that underperform the market as a whole or underperform other funds that use ESG criteria.
The issuers of</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-7</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>securities selected for the Underlying Index may not be the same issuers
selected by other index providers that use ESG criteria. In addition, issuers selected by the Index Provider may not later display positive or favorable ESG characteristics.</div>
<div>Geographic Risk<font>.</font><font> A natural disaster could occur in a geographic region in which the Fund invests, which could adversely affect the economy or the business operations of companies in the specific geographic region,
causing an adverse impact on the Fund's investments in, or which are exposed to, the affected region.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of
the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders.
Unusual market conditions may cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance, which could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition.</font></div>
<div>Industrials Sector Risk.<font> Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by changes in the supply of and demand for products and services, product obsolescence, claims for</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>environmental damage or product liability and changes in general economic
conditions, among other factors. While the Fund seeks to invest in companies with positive or favorable environmental and social characteristics, companies in the industrials sector may also be adversely affected by claims for environmental damage
or product liability.</div> <div>Infectious Illness Risk. <font>An outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus has resulted in travel restrictions, disruption of healthcare systems, prolonged quarantines, cancellations,
supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings downgrades, defaults and other significant economic impacts. Certain markets have experienced temporary closures, extreme volatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity and increased
trading costs. These events will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and could impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities or cause elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV. Other
infectious illness outbreaks in the future may result in similar impacts.</font></div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may
cause the value of the securities to decline.</font></div>
<div>Large-Capitalization Companies Risk.<font> Large-capitalization companies may be less able than smaller capitalization companies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large-capitalization companies may be more mature and subject to more
limited growth potential</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-8</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>compared with smaller capitalization companies. During different market
cycles, the performance of large-capitalization companies has trailed the overall performance of the broader securities markets.</div>
<div>Large Shareholder and Large-Scale Redemption Risk.<font> Certain shareholders, including an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, a market maker, or another entity, may from time
to time own or manage a substantial amount of Fund shares, or may invest in the Fund and hold their investment for a limited period of time. There can be no assurance that any large shareholder or large group of shareholders would not redeem their
investment. Redemptions of a large number of Fund shares could require the Fund to dispose of assets to meet the redemption requests, which can accelerate the realization of taxable income and/or capital gains and cause the Fund to make taxable
distributions to its shareholders earlier than the Fund otherwise would have. In addition, under certain circumstances, non-redeeming shareholders may be treated as receiving a disproportionately large taxable distribution during or with respect to
such year. In some circumstances, the Fund may hold a relatively large proportion of its assets in cash in anticipation of large redemptions, diluting its investment returns. These large redemptions may also force the Fund to sell portfolio
securities when it might not otherwise do so, which may negatively impact the Fund’s NAV, increase the Fund’s brokerage costs and/or have a material effect on the market price of the Fund shares.</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of
terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s
NAV.</font></div> <div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets,
periods of high volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>Mid-Capitalization Companies
Risk<font>.</font><font> Compared to large-capitalization companies, mid-capitalization companies may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse developments. In addition,
the securities of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile and less liquid than those of large-capitalization companies.</font></div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities and/or other assets held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s shares trade is open, there</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>are likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying
security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (<font>i.e</font>., the Fund’s quote from the closed foreign market). The impact of a closed foreign market on the Fund is likely to be greater
where a large portion of the Fund’s underlying securities and/or other assets trade on that closed foreign market or when the foreign market is closed for unscheduled reasons. These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the
Fund’s NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</div>
<div>Non-Diversification Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may invest a large percentage of its assets in securities issued by or representing a small number of issuers. As a result, the Fund's performance may depend on the performance of a small
number of issuers.</font></div> <div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of
inflation or nationalization. The Fund may lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting issuers of non-U.S. securities or non-U.S. markets. In addition, non-U.S. securities markets may trade a small number of securities
and may be unable to respond effectively to changes in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. The Fund is specifically exposed to </font><font>European Economic
Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Fund’s service providers, counterparties or other third parties, failed
or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address
significant operational risks.</div> <div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining
markets.</font></div> <div>Reliance on Trading Partners Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund invests in countries or regions whose economies are heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in this trading may have an adverse
impact on the Fund's investments. Through its holdings of securities of certain issuers, the Fund is specifically exposed to </font><font>Asian Economic Risk </font><font>and
</font><font>North American Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries<font>. </font><font>The Fund’s investment in developed country issuers may subject the Fund to regulatory, political, currency, security, economic and other risks associated
with developed countries. Developed countries tend to represent a significant portion of the global economy and have generally experienced slower economic growth than some less developed countries. Certain developed countries have experienced
security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents involving a country’s or region’s security may cause uncertainty in its markets and may adversely affect its economy and the Fund’s investments.

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>developed countries may be adversely impacted by changes to the economic
conditions of certain key trading partners, regulatory burdens, debt burdens and the price or availability of certain commodities.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the
U.S<font>.</font><font> Certain changes in the U.S. economy, such as when the U.S. economy weakens or when its financial markets decline, may have an adverse effect on the
securities to which the Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax
consequences for the Fund.</font></div> <div>Security Risk<font>.</font><font> Some countries and regions in which the Fund invests have experienced security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents
involving a country's or region's security may cause uncertainty in its markets and may adversely affect its economy and the Fund's investments.</font></div>
<div>Small Fund Risk. <font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the Fund does not meet certain
conditions of the listing exchange. Any resulting liquidation of the Fund could cause the Fund to incur elevated transaction costs for the Fund and negative tax consequences for its shareholders.</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Structural Risk<font>.</font><font> The countries in which the Fund invests may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability.</font></div>
<div>Thematic Investing Risk.<font> The Fund relies on the Index Provider for the identification of securities for inclusion in the Underlying Index that reflect themes and sub-themes, and its performance may suffer if such securities
are not correctly identified or if a theme or sub-theme develops in an unexpected manner. Performance may also suffer if the stocks included in the Underlying Index do not benefit from the development of such themes or sub-themes. Performance may
also be impacted by the inclusion of non-theme-relevant exposures in the Underlying Index. There is no guarantee that the Underlying Index will reflect the theme and sub-theme exposures intended.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to “tracking error,” which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences
between the securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close
and the Fund's valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund's NAV), transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or
interest received by the Fund or distributions paid to the Fund’s shareholders, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to
shareholders,</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>acceptance of custom baskets, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to
the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements, among other reasons. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the
Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not. Tracking error may occur due to differences between the methodologies used in calculating the value of the Underlying Index and determining the Fund’s NAV.</div>
<div>Utilities Sector Risk.<font> The utilities sector is subject to significant government regulation and oversight. Deregulation, however, may subject utility companies to greater competition and may reduce their profitability.
Companies in the utilities sector may be adversely affected due to increases in fuel and operating costs, rising costs of financing capital construction and the cost of complying with regulations, among other factors.</font></div>
<div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or other asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index,
particularly for securities or other assets that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. In addition, the value of the securities or other
assets in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund's shares. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund is holding
fair-valued securities</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than
they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party
service providers.</div> <div>Water Management Investment Strategy
Risk.<font> The Fund's investment strategy of tracking an Underlying Index, the constituents of which either provide water-focused products or services and derive at least 10% of their revenues from
“sustainable water” or demonstrate relatively efficient water management may limit the types and number of investment opportunities available to the Fund and, as a result, the Fund may underperform other funds whose underlying index does
not use these criteria or other funds that use similar criteria. Companies that provide water-focused products or services and derive at least 10% of their revenues from “sustainable water” or demonstrate relatively efficient water
management are exposed to risks associated with the water industry; therefore, the Fund's shares may be affected by events or trends that adversely affect the water industry, such as water availability, climate changes and events, new technologies,
changes in water consumption and water conservation. Further, companies in the water industry are subject to environmental considerations, taxes, government regulation, price and supply fluctuations, competition and water conservation influences.

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only be
bought and sold in the secondary market through a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An investor may incur costs
attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for shares of the Fund (ask) when buying or selling shares in the secondary
market (the “bid-ask spread”).<br/> </div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make distributions that may be taxable to
you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an individual retirement account (“IRA”), in which case, your distributions generally will be taxed when
withdrawn.</div> <div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial
Intermediaries</div> <div>If you purchase shares of the Fund through
a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms
and reporting systems or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another
investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.<br/> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
