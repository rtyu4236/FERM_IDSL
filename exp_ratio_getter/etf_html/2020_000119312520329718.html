<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you
will incur if you buy, hold and sell shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides
that BFA will pay all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions,
including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses.</div>
<div>You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and other
fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the tables and examples below.</div> <div>

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund
may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are
held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 32% of the
average value of its portfolio.</font></div> <div>Principal
Investment Strategies</div> <div>The Fund seeks to track the
investment results of the MSCI India Small Cap Index (the “Underlying Index”), which is designed to measure the performance of equity securities of small-capitalization companies in the Indian securities market. As of August 31, 2020, a
significant portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the financials, industrials and materials industries or sectors. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time.</div>
<div>The Fund may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures,
options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the
Underlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund carries out its investment strategies by investing
substantially all</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>of its assets through a wholly-owned subsidiary in the Republic of Mauritius
(the “Subsidiary”). The remaining assets will be invested directly by the Fund. The Subsidiary and the Fund generally will collectively invest at least 90% of the Fund's assets in the component securities of the Underlying Index and in
investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities of the Underlying Index (<font>i.e</font>., depositary receipts representing securities of the Underlying Index).
BFA serves as investment adviser to both the Fund and the Subsidiary. Unless otherwise indicated, the term “Fund,” as used in this prospectus (the “Prospectus”), means the Fund and/or the Subsidiary, as applicable.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover
low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to that of an applicable</div> </div>
<div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>underlying index. The securities selected are expected to have, in the
aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying
index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by MSCI Inc. (the
“Index Provider” or “MSCI”), which is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding
the market value of the Underlying Index.</div> <div>Industry
Concentration Policy.<font> The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total assets) in a
particular industry or group of industries to approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase
agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</font></div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share
(“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective.</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any
particular risk factor.</div> <div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or other asset
classes.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this
prospectus (the “Prospectus”)) may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption transactions. The Fund has a limited
number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that
Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, Fund shares may be more likely to trade
at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting. Authorized Participant concentration risk may be heightened for exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), such as the Fund, that invest in securities issued by non-U.S.
issuers or other securities or instruments that have lower trading volumes.</font></div>
<div>Cash Transactions Risk<font>. </font><font>The Fund expects to effect all of its creations and redemptions for cash, rather than in-kind securities. As a result, the Fund may have to sell portfolio securities at inopportune times in order to
obtain the</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-3</div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>cash needed to meet redemption orders. This may cause the Fund to sell a
security and recognize a capital gain or loss that might not have been incurred if it had made a redemption in-kind. The use of cash creations and redemptions may also cause the Fund’s shares to trade in the market at wider bid-ask spreads or
greater premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV.</div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector, market segment or asset class.</font></div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>.</font><font> Because the Fund's NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the Fund's NAV could decline if the currency of a non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests depreciates against the U.S. dollar or if there are
delays or limits on repatriation of such currency. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the Fund's NAV may change quickly and without warning.</font></div>
<div>Custody Risk<font>.</font><font> The Indian securities market is less developed and is more likely than more developed securities markets to experience problems with the clearing and settling of trades, as well as the holding of
securities by local banks, agents and depositories.</font></div>
<div>Cybersecurity Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, the Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests have the
ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems
seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems of the Fund’s Index Provider and other service providers, market
makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common stocks, which generally
subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>Financials Sector Risk<font>.</font><font> Performance of companies in the financials sector may be adversely impacted by many factors, including, among others, changes in government regulations, economic conditions, and interest rates, credit
rating downgrades, and decreased liquidity in credit markets. The extent to which the Fund may invest in a company that engages in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law. The impact of changes in capital requirements
and recent or future regulation of any individual financial company, or of the financials sector as a whole, cannot be predicted.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>In recent years, cyberattacks and technology malfunctions and failures have
become increasingly frequent in this sector and have caused significant losses to companies in this sector, which may negatively impact the Fund.</div>
<div>Geographic Risk<font>.</font><font> A natural disaster could occur in India or Mauritius, which could adversely affect the Indian economy or operations of the Subsidiary, causing an adverse impact on the Fund's investments in, or which
are exposed to, India or Mauritius.</font></div> <div>Index-Related
Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective.
Market disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the
construction of the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its
shareholders. Unusual market conditions may cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance, which could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition.</font></div>
<div>Industrials Sector Risk.<font> Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by changes in the supply of and demand for products and services, product obsolescence, claims for environmental damage or product
liability and changes in general</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>economic conditions, among other factors.</div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk. <font>An outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus has resulted in travel restrictions, disruption of healthcare systems, prolonged quarantines, cancellations,
supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings downgrades, defaults and other significant economic impacts. Certain markets have experienced temporary closures, extreme volatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity and increased
trading costs. These events will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and could impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities or cause elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV. Other
infectious illness outbreaks in the future may result in similar impacts.</font></div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an issuer of those securities may
cause the value of the securities to decline.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts of
terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the
Fund’s NAV.</div> <div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets,
periods of high volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>Materials Sector Risk<font>.</font><font> Companies in the materials sector may be adversely impacted by the volatility of commodity prices, changes in exchange rates, social and political unrest, depletion of resources, decreases in demand,
over-production, litigation and changes in government regulations, among other factors.</font></div>
<div>National Closed Market Trading Risk.<font> To the extent that the underlying securities and/or other assets held by the Fund trade on foreign exchanges or in foreign markets that may be closed when the securities exchange on which the
Fund’s shares trade is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of such an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security (</font><font>i.e</font><font>., the Fund’s quote from the closed foreign market). The impact of a closed foreign market on the Fund is likely to be greater where a large portion of the Fund’s underlying securities
and/or other assets trade on that closed foreign market or when the foreign market is closed for unscheduled reasons. These deviations could result in premiums or discounts to the Fund’s</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.</div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Investments in the securities of non-U.S. issuers are subject to the risks associated with investing in those non-U.S. markets, such as heightened risks of inflation or nationalization. The Fund may
lose money due to political, economic and geographic events affecting issuers of non-U.S. securities or non-U.S. markets. In addition, non-U.S. securities markets may trade a small number of securities and may be unable to respond effectively
to changes in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. The Fund is specifically exposed to </font><font>Asian Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund’s service providers,
counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible
risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Privatization Risk<font>.</font><font> The country in which the Fund invests has privatized, or has begun the process of privatizing, certain entities and industries. Privatized entities may lose money or be re-nationalized.</font></div>

<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Reliance on Trading Partners
Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund invests in India, which is heavily dependent upon trading with key partners. Any reduction in this trading may have an adverse impact on the
Fund's investments. Through its holdings of securities of certain issuers, the Fund is specifically exposed to </font><font>Asian Economic Risk, Middle Eastern Economic Risk</font><font> and </font><font>U.S. Economic Risk</font><font>.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets<font>.</font><font> Investments in India may be subject to a greater risk of loss than investments in issuers located or operating in more developed markets. Emerging markets may
be more likely to experience inflation, political turmoil and rapid changes in economic conditions than more developed markets. Companies in many emerging markets are not subject to the same degree of regulatory requirements, accounting standards or
auditor oversight as companies in more developed countries, and as a result, information about the securities in which the Fund invests may be less reliable or complete. Emerging markets often have less reliable securities valuations and greater
risk associated with custody of securities than developed markets. There may be significant obstacles to obtaining information necessary for investigations into or litigation against companies and shareholders may have limited legal remedies. The
Fund is not actively managed and does not select investments based on investor protection considerations.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in
India<font>.</font><font> Investments in Indian issuers involve risks that are specific to India, including legal, regulatory, political, currency and economic risks. Political
and legal</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>uncertainty, greater government control over the economy, currency
fluctuations or blockage, and the risk of nationalization or expropriation of assets may result in higher potential for losses. The securities markets in India are relatively underdeveloped and may subject the Fund to higher transaction costs or
greater uncertainty than investments in more developed securities markets.</div>
<div>Security Risk<font>.</font><font> India has experienced security concerns, such as terrorism and strained international relations. Incidents involving a country's or region's security may cause uncertainty in Indian markets and may
adversely affect its economy and the Fund's investments.</font></div>
<div>Small-Capitalization Companies Risk<font>.</font><font> Compared to mid- and large-capitalization companies, small-capitalization companies may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse developments. In
addition, the securities of small-capitalization companies may be more volatile and less liquid than those of mid- and large-capitalization companies.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences (including, as applicable, differences between a security’s price at the local market close and the Fund's
valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund's NAV), transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest, the
requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to
shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other
unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not. INDEX ETFs THAT TRACK INDICES WITH SIGNIFICANT WEIGHT IN EMERGING MARKETS ISSUERS MAY EXPERIENCE HIGHER
TRACKING ERROR THAN OTHER INDEX ETFs THAT DO NOT TRACK SUCH INDICES.</div>
<div>Treaty/Tax Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund and the Subsidiary rely on the Double Tax Avoidance Agreement between India and Mauritius (“DTAA”) for relief from certain Indian taxes. The DTAA has been renegotiated and as such,
treaty relief is reduced or not available on investments in securities made on or after April 1, 2017, which may result in higher taxes and/or lower returns for the Fund. After April 1, 2017, the Fund may continue to invest in the Subsidiary until
an alternative method for investing in the securities of Indian issuers is selected. Further, Mauritius has not notified its tax treaty with India as a Covered Tax Agreement (“CTA”) for purposes of the Multilateral Instrument to
Implement</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS (the “MLI”). Therefore
the MLI will not apply to the DTAA. However, India and Mauritius may again renegotiate the DTAA, which could impact the returns received by the Fund on its investments.</div>
<div>Valuation Risk<font>.</font><font> The price the Fund could receive upon the sale of a security or other asset may differ from the Fund's valuation of the security or other asset and from the value used by the Underlying Index,
particularly for securities or other assets that trade in low volume or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology as a result of trade suspensions or for other reasons. In addition, the value of the securities or other
assets in the Fund's portfolio may change on days or during time periods when shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell the Fund's shares. Authorized Participants who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund is holding
fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares, or lower or higher redemption proceeds, than they would have received had the Fund not fair-valued securities or used a different valuation methodology. The Fund’s ability to value
investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<td>After-tax returns in the
table above are calculated using the historical highest individual U.S. federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state or local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor’s tax situation and may differ from
those shown, and after-tax returns shown are not relevant to tax-exempt investors or investors who hold shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”). Fund returns after taxes
on distributions and sales of Fund shares are calculated assuming that an investor has sufficient capital gains of the same character from other investments to offset any capital losses from the sale of Fund shares. As a result, Fund returns after
taxes on distributions and sales of Fund shares may exceed Fund returns before taxes and/or returns after taxes on distributions. </td></tr></table> </div> </div> <div type="Block">

Fund Advisors.</font></div> <div>Portfolio Managers.<font> Rachel Aguirre, Jennifer Hsui, Alan Mason, Greg Savage and Amy Whitelaw (the “Portfolio Managers”) are primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund. Each Portfolio Manager supervises a
portfolio management team. Ms. Hsui and Mr. Savage have been Portfolio Managers of the Fund since 2012. Mr. Mason has been a Portfolio Manager of the Fund since 2016. Ms. Aguirre and Ms. Whitelaw have been Portfolio Managers of the Fund since
2018.</font></div> <div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an ETF. Individual shares of the Fund may only be
bought and sold in the secondary market through a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An investor may incur costs
attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for shares of the Fund (ask) when buying or selling shares in the secondary
market (the “bid-ask spread”).<br/> </div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make distributions that may be taxable to
you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA, in which case, your distributions generally will be taxed when withdrawn.</div>
<div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial
Intermediaries</div> <div>If you purchase shares of the Fund through
a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms
and reporting systems or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another
investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.<br/> </div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
