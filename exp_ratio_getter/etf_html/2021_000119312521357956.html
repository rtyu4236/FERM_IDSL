Green bonds are fixed income securities whose proceeds are exclusively applied to projects or activities that promote </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> climate or other environmental sustainability purposes. For inclusion in the Underlying Index, securities are independently evaluated by MSCI ESG Research pursuant to an agreement between MSCI ESG Research and Bloomberg Index Services Limited (or an affiliate) based on four criteria aligned with themes articulated in the Green Bond Principles, which are published by the International Capital Market Association (“Green Bond Principles”). </div> <div>The first criterion is whether the use of proceeds falls within at least one of six eligible environmental categories defined by MSCI ESG Research: alternative energy, energy efficiency, pollution prevention and control, sustainable water, green building, and climate adaption. The remaining three criteria for evaluation and inclusion in the Underlying Index are processes for green project evaluation and selection, processes for management of proceeds, and a commitment to ongoing reporting of the environmental impact of the use of proceeds. </div> <div>Self-labeled green bonds are evaluated for potential inclusion in the Underlying Index using the four criteria. Meeting all four criteria is required for bonds issued after the publication of the Green Bond Principles in January 2014. Green bonds issued prior to 2014 that are widely accepted by investors as green bonds may still qualify for the Underlying Index, even if not all four criteria are satisfied, since no formal guidelines were available at the time of issuance. </div> <div>Use of proceeds and project bonds are considered eligible if the use of proceeds falls within at least one of the six eligible environmental categories defined by MSCI ESG Research. In cases where project categories do not overlap entirely, MSCI ESG Research will consider bonds eligible if at least 90% of the projected use of proceeds falls within eligible categories. General purpose bonds from issuers that are considered by the Index Provider to be a pure-play green company (defined as a legal entity with greater than 90% of activities, as measured by revenues, within one or more of the eligible environmental categories) must meet all four criteria of the Underlying Index to be eligible. </div> <div><span>Index Methodology.</span> The Underlying Index includes sovereign and government-related debt, corporate bonds and securitized bonds denominated in U.S. dollars from both developed and emerging market issuers. Eligible securities include fixed-rate coupon bonds; bonds that convert from fixed to floating rate (including fixed‑to‑float perpetuals); senior and subordinated issues; fixed-rate bullet, putable, sinkable/amortizing and callable bonds; taxable municipal securities; original issue zero coupon bonds; bonds issued through underwritten medium </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div>term note programs; enhanced equipment trust certificates; certificates of deposit; loan participation notes; and U.S. agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”). Fixed‑to‑floating rate bonds are eligible during their fixed-rate term only. </div> <div>Certain types of securities are excluded from the Underlying Index, including contingent capital securities (including traditional CoCos and contingent write-down securities), bonds with equity-type features (<span>e.g.</span>, warrants, convertibles, preferreds, and Dividend Received Deduction (“DRD”)/ Qualified Dividend Income (“QDI”)-eligible issues), inflation-linked bonds, floating-rate issues, fixed-rate perpetuals, tax‑exempt municipal securities, private placements (other than those offered pursuant to Rule 144A or Regulation S promulgated under the 1933 Act), retail bonds, USD25/USD50 par bonds, structured notes, pass-through certificates, non‑ERISA eligible CMBS, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities with hybrid adjustable rate mortgages, Formosa bonds, and illiquid securities with no available internal or third-party pricing source. </div> <div>The Underlying Index does not have a one‑year minimum time to maturity requirement and will hold bonds until final maturity. As of October 31, 2021, the weighted average duration of the securities in the Underlying Index was 6.6 years and the weighted average maturity of the securities in the Underlying Index was 8.5 years. </div> <div>The securities in the Underlying Index are weighted using an issuer capping methodology that sets a 23.75% cap on the aggregate weight of all large issuers, which are defined by the Index Provider as individually having at least 4.75% of the market value of the uncapped index. Small issuers, defined as individually having less than 4.75% of the market value of the uncapped index, are individually capped at 4.75% of the Underlying Index. The excess market value over the caps is redistributed on a <span>pro rata</span> basis to all other issuers’ bonds that are under the caps until no limits are breached. This methodology is applied at each rebalancing, which occurs on the last business day of each month. </div> <div>The Index Provider deems securities rated Baa3 / BBB‑ / BBB‑ or higher, using the middle rating of Fitch Ratings, Inc., Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., and Standard &amp; Poor’s Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of S&amp;P Global (S&amp;P Global Ratings), to be investment grade. When a rating from only two rating agencies is available, the lower rating is used; when only one rating agency rates a bond, that rating is used. If explicit bond level ratings are not available, the Index Provider may use other sources to classify securities by credit quality, such as expected ratings </div> <div> </div> <hr/> <div> at issuance, issuer rating or other criteria as determined by the Index Provider. </div> <div><span>Changes to “Investment Advisory, Administrative and Distribution Services” </span></div> <div>Footnote 9 to the table in the section entitled “Investment Adviser” on pages 99‑100 of the SAI is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: </div> <div> </div> <div>For the iShares Global Green Bond ETF, BFA had contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fee such that the Fund’s total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver would not exceed 0.20% through March 1, 2022.
