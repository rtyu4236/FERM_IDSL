Income Balanced Risk ETF previously operated as a series of iShares U.S. ETF Trust (the “Predecessor Fund”). Before the Fund commenced operations, all of the assets and liabilities of the Predecessor Fund were transferred to the Fund in
a reorganization (the “Reorganization”), which was tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Reorganization occurred on February 5, 2018. As a result of the Reorganization, the Fund assumed the performance and accounting history
of the Predecessor Fund, which was actively managed by BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) using an investment strategy substantially similar to the methodology of the Underlying Index. A portion of the financial and performance information
included in this SAI is that of the Predecessor Fund. </td></tr>

<div>Each Fund is managed by BFA, an indirect wholly-owned

<div>Each Fund offers and issues shares at their
net asset value per share (“NAV”) only in aggregations of a specified number of shares (each, a “Creation Unit”), generally in exchange for a designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for
which cash may be substituted) included in its Underlying Index (the “Deposit Securities”), together with the deposit of a specified cash payment (the “Cash Component”) (other than the iShares Core International Aggregate
Bond ETF and iShares GNMA Bond ETF, which currently issue Creation Units of their shares solely for cash). Shares of the Funds are listed and trade on national securities exchanges such as Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (“Cboe BZX”), The Nasdaq
Stock Market, LLC (“NASDAQ”) or the NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”) (each, a “Listing Exchange”). Shares of each Fund are traded in the secondary market and elsewhere at market prices that may be at, above or below
the Fund's NAV. Shares are redeemable only in Creation Units, by Authorized Participants (as defined in the <font>Portfolio Holdings Information</font> section of this SAI), and, generally, in exchange for portfolio
securities and a Cash Amount (as defined in the <font>Redemption of Creation Units</font> section of this SAI) (other than the iShares Core International Aggregate Bond ETF and iShares GNMA Bond ETF, which currently redeem
Creation Units of their shares solely for cash). Creation Units typically are a specified number of shares, generally ranging from 50,000 to 100,000 or multiples thereof.</div>
<div>The Trust reserves the right to permit or require that
creations and redemptions of shares are effected fully or partially in cash and reserves the right to permit or require the substitution of Deposit Securities in lieu of cash. Shares may be issued in advance of receipt of Deposit Securities, subject
to various conditions, including a requirement that the Authorized Participant maintain with the Trust a cash deposit equal to at least 105% and up to 122%, which percentage BFA may change from time to time, of the market value of the omitted
Deposit Securities. The Trust may use such cash deposit at any time to purchase Deposit Securities. See the <font>Creation and Redemption of Creation Units</font> section of this SAI. Transaction fees and other costs
associated with creations or redemptions that include a cash portion may be higher than the transaction fees and other costs associated with in-kind creations or redemptions. In all cases, conditions with respect to creations and redemptions of
shares and fees will be limited in accordance with the requirements of SEC rules and regulations applicable to management investment companies offering redeemable securities.</div>
<div>Exchange Listing and Trading</div>
<div>A discussion of exchange listing and trading matters
associated with an investment in each Fund is contained in the <font>Shareholder Information</font> section of each Fund's Prospectus. The discussion below supplements, and should be read in conjunction with, that section
of the applicable Prospectus.</div> <div></div>
<div>Shares of each Fund are listed for trading,
and trade throughout the day, on the applicable Listing Exchange and in other secondary markets. Shares of certain Funds may also be listed on certain non-U.S. exchanges. There can be no assurance that the requirements of the Listing Exchange
necessary to maintain the listing of shares of any Fund will continue to be met. The Listing Exchange may, but is not required to, remove the shares of a Fund from listing if, among other things: (i) following the initial 12-month period beginning
upon the commencement of trading of Fund shares, there are fewer than 50 record and/or beneficial owners of shares of the Fund for 30 or more consecutive trading days, (ii) the value of the Underlying Index on which a Fund is based is no longer
calculated or available, or (iii) any other event shall occur or condition shall exist that, in the opinion of the Listing Exchange, makes further dealings on the Listing Exchange inadvisable. The Listing Exchange will also remove shares of a Fund
from listing and trading upon termination of the Fund or in the event a Fund does not comply with the continuous listing standards of the Listing Exchange, as described in the Fund’s Prospectus.</div>
<div>As in the case of other publicly-traded securities, when you
buy or sell shares of a Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission determined by that broker, as well as other charges.</div>
<div>In order to provide additional information regarding the
indicative value of shares of the Funds, the Listing Exchange or a market data vendor disseminates information every 15 seconds through the facilities of the Consolidated Tape Association, or through other widely disseminated means, an updated
indicative optimized portfolio value (“IOPV”) for the Funds as calculated by an information provider or market data vendor. The Trust is not involved in or responsible for any aspect of the calculation or dissemination of the IOPV and
makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy of the IOPV.</div>
<div>An IOPV has a fixed-income securities component and a cash
component. The fixed-income securities values included in an IOPV are the values of the Deposit Securities for a Fund. While the IOPV reflects the current value of the Deposit Securities required to be deposited in connection with the purchase of a
Creation Unit, it does not necessarily reflect the precise composition of the current portfolio of securities held by the Fund at a particular point in time because the current portfolio</div> </div>

<div>of the Fund may include securities that are not a part of the current Deposit
Securities. Therefore, a Fund’s IOPV disseminated during the Listing Exchange trading hours should not be viewed as a real-time update of the Fund’s NAV, which is calculated only once a day.</div>
<div>The cash component included in an IOPV consists of estimated
accrued interest, dividends and other income, less expenses. If applicable, each IOPV also reflects changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the applicable currency.</div>
<div>The Trust reserves the right to adjust the share prices of the
Funds in the future to maintain convenient trading ranges for investors. Any adjustments would be accomplished through stock splits or reverse stock splits, which would have no effect on the net assets of the Funds or an investor's equity interest
in the Funds.</div> <div>Investment Strategies and Risks</div>
<div></div>
<div>Each Fund (other than iShares Core
International Aggregate Bond ETF) seeks to achieve its objective by investing primarily in both fixed-income securities that comprise its relevant Underlying Index and in investments that provide substantially similar exposure to securities in the
Underlying Index. Each Fund (other than iShares Core International Aggregate Bond ETF) operates as an index fund and is not actively managed. Adverse performance of a security in a Fund’s portfolio will ordinarily not result in the elimination
of the security from the Fund’s portfolio.</div> <div>Each
Fund (other than iShares Core International Aggregate Bond ETF) engages in representative sampling, which is investing in a sample of securities selected by BFA to have a collective investment profile similar to that of the Fund's Underlying Index.
Securities selected have aggregate investment characteristics (based on market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as yield, credit rating, maturity and duration) and liquidity measures similar to those of the
Fund’s Underlying Index. A fund that uses representative sampling generally does not hold all of the securities that are in its underlying index.</div>

<div>Although the Funds do not seek leveraged returns, certain

<div>Each Fund (other than the iShares Core 1-5

as in securities not included in its Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track its Underlying Index. From time to time when conditions warrant, however, each Fund may invest at least 80% of its assets in the component
securities of its Underlying Index and may invest up to 20% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of BlackRock Cash Funds, as well as in securities not included in its Underlying

<div>The iShares Core International Aggregate Bond ETF generally
will invest at least 90% of its assets in the component securities and other instruments of the Underlying Index and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including BlackRock
Cash Funds, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. From time to time when conditions warrant, however, the Fund may invest at least 80% of its assets in

Funds, as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. Components of the Underlying Index include fixed-income securities and foreign currency forward contracts
(both deliverable and non-deliverable) designed to hedge against non-U.S. currency fluctuations. The notional exposure to foreign currency forward contracts (both deliverable and non-deliverable) generally will be a short position that hedges the
currency risk of the fixed-income portfolio. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before the fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index sells forward the total value of the
underlying non-U.S. dollar currencies at a one-month forward rate to create a hedge against fluctuations in the relative value of the component currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar. The hedge is reset on a monthly basis. The Underlying Index is
designed to have higher returns than an equivalent unhedged investment when the component currencies are weakening relative to the U.S. dollar and appreciation in some of the component currencies does not exceed the aggregate depreciation of the
others. Conversely, the Underlying Index is designed to have lower returns than an equivalent unhedged investment when the component currencies, on a net basis, are rising relative to the U.S. dollar.</div>
<div>In order to replicate the “hedging” component of
the Underlying Index, the Fund intends to enter into foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the Fund’s exposure to the component currencies. A foreign currency forward contract is an over-the-counter (“OTC”) contract
between two parties, each of which is an eligible contract participant, as defined in the Commodity Exchange Act (the “CEA”), to buy or sell a specified amount of a specific currency in the future at an agreed upon exchange rate. The
Fund's exposure to foreign currency forward contracts is based on the aggregate exposure of the Fund to the component currencies. While this approach is designed to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations on Fund returns, it does not
necessarily eliminate the Fund’s exposure to the component currencies. The return of the foreign currency forward contracts may not perfectly offset the actual fluctuations between the component currencies and the U.S. dollar. Moreover,
volatility in one or more of the component currencies may offset lower volatility in the Fund and reduce the effectiveness of the hedging transactions.</div>
<div>The Fund may also use non-deliverable forward contracts
(“NDF”) to execute its hedging transactions. NDFs are cash-settled, short-term forward contracts that may be thinly traded or are denominated in non-convertible foreign currencies, where the profit or loss at the time of settlement date
is calculated by taking the difference between the agreed upon exchange rate and the spot rate at the time of settlement, for an agreed upon notional amount of funds. NDFs generally have a fixing date and a settlement date. The fixing date is the
valuation date at which the difference between the prevailing market exchange rate and the agreed upon exchange rate is calculated. The settlement date is the date by which the payment of the difference is due to the party receiving payment. NDFs
are commonly quoted for time periods ranging from one month to up to two years, and are normally quoted and settled in U.S. dollars. They are often used to gain exposure to and/or hedge exposure to foreign currencies that are not internationally
traded.</div> <div>Foreign currency forward contracts and NDFs are
subject to regulation under The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) in the U.S. and under comparable regimes in Europe, Asia and other non-U.S.</div> </div>

<div>jurisdictions. Physically-settled forwards between eligible contract
participants, such as the Fund, are generally subject to lighter regulation in the U.S. than NDFs and cash-settled foreign currency forward contracts. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, NDFs are regulated as swaps and are subject to rules requiring central
clearing and mandatory trading on an exchange or facility that is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”). NDFs traded in the OTC market are subject to margin requirements that are expected to be finalized over
the next year or two. Implementation of the regulations regarding clearing, mandatory trading and margining of NDFs are likely to increase the cost to the Fund of hedging currency risk and, as a result, may affect returns to investors in the
Fund.</div> <div>As a result of regulatory requirements under the
1940 Act, the Fund is required to maintain an amount of liquid assets, accrued on a daily basis, having an aggregate value at least equal to the value of the Fund’s obligations under the foreign currency forward contract or NDF. To the extent
that foreign currency forward contracts are settled on a physical basis, the Fund will generally be required to maintain an amount of liquid assets equal to the notional value of the contract. In connection with NDFs and cash-settled foreign
currency forward contracts, on the other hand, which are performed on a net basis, with the Fund receiving or paying only the net amount of a specified exchange rate, the Fund will generally maintain liquid assets, accrued daily, equal to the
accrued excess, if any, of the Fund’s obligations over those of its counterparty under the contract. Accordingly, reliance by the Fund on physically-settled foreign currency forward contracts may adversely impact investors by requiring the
Fund to set aside a greater amount of liquid assets than would generally be required if the Fund were relying on cash-settled foreign currency forward contracts or NDFs.</div>
<div>The iShares TIPS Bond ETF generally invests at least 90% of
its assets in the bonds of its Underlying Index and at least 95% of its assets in U.S. government bonds. The Fund may invest up to 10% of its assets in U.S. government bonds not included in its Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the
Fund track its Underlying Index. The Fund also may invest up to 5% of its assets in repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government obligations and in cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its
affiliates.</div> <div>Asset-Backed and Commercial Mortgage-Backed
Securities.<font>   Certain of the Funds may invest in asset-backed securities (“ABS”) and commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”). ABS are securities backed by installment contracts,
credit-card receivables or other assets. CMBS are securities backed by commercial real estate properties. Both ABS and CMBS represent interests in “pools” of assets in which payments of both interest and principal on the securities are
made on a regular basis. The payments are, in effect, “passed through” to the holder of the securities (net of any fees paid to the issuer or guarantor of the securities). The average life of ABS and CMBS varies with the maturities of
the underlying instruments and, as a result of prepayments, can often be less than the original maturity of the assets underlying the securities. For this and other reasons, the stated maturity of an ABS or CMBS may be shortened, and the
security’s total return may be difficult to predict precisely. </font></div>
<div>Beginning in the second half of 2007 through 2009, the market
for ABS and mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) experienced substantially, often dramatically, lower valuations and reduced liquidity. These instruments continue to be subject to liquidity constraints, price volatility, credit downgrades
and increases in default rates and, therefore, may be more difficult to value and more difficult to dispose of than previously.</div> <div></div>
<div>Bonds.<font>
 Each Fund</font><font> (other than the iShares 1-3 Year International Treasury Bond ETF, iShares Core International Aggregate Bond ETF and iShares International Treasury Bond ETF) invests a substantial portion of
its assets in U.S. dollar-denominated bonds. The iShares 1-3 Year International Bond ETF, iShares Core International Aggregate Bond ETF and iShares International Treasury Bond ETF invest a substantial portion of their assets in non-U.S.
dollar-denominated bonds. A bond is an interest-bearing security issued by a U.S. or non-U.S. company, or U.S. or non-U.S. governmental unit. The issuer of a bond has a contractual obligation to pay interest at a stated rate on specific dates and to
repay principal (the bond’s face value) periodically or on a specified maturity date. Bonds generally are used by corporations and governments to borrow money from investors.</font></div>
<div>An issuer may have the right to redeem or “call” a
bond before maturity, in which case a fund may have to reinvest the proceeds at lower market rates. Similarly, a fund may have to reinvest interest income or payments received when bonds mature, sometimes at lower market rates. Most bonds bear
interest income at a “coupon” rate that is fixed for the life of the bond. The value of a fixed-rate bond usually rises when market interest rates fall, and falls when market interest rates rise. Accordingly, a fixed-rate bond’s
yield (income as a percent of the bond’s current value) may differ from its coupon rate as its value rises or falls. When an investor purchases a fixed-rate bond at a price that is greater than its face value, the investor is purchasing the
bond at a premium. Conversely, when an investor purchases a fixed-rate bond at a price that is less than its</div> </div> <div type="Block">

bonds that are purchased at a discount pay less current income than securities with comparable yields that are purchased at face value, with the result that prices for such fixed-rate securities can be more volatile than prices for such securities
that are purchased at face value. Other types of bonds bear interest at an interest rate that is adjusted periodically. Interest rates on “floating rate” or “variable rate” bonds may be higher or lower than current market
rates for fixed-rate bonds of comparable quality with similar final maturities. Because of their adjustable interest rates, the value of “floating rate” or “variable rate” bonds fluctuates much less in response to market
interest rate movements than the value of fixed-rate bonds, but their value may decline if their interest rates do not rise as much, or as quickly, as interest rates in general. Each Fund or an Underlying Fund may treat some of these bonds as having
a shorter maturity for purposes of calculating the weighted average maturity of its investment portfolio. Generally, prices of higher quality issues tend to fluctuate less with changes in market interest rates than prices of lower quality issues and
prices of longer maturity issues tend to fluctuate more than prices of shorter maturity issues. Bonds may be senior or subordinated obligations. Senior obligations generally have the first claim on a corporation’s earnings and assets and, in
the event of liquidation, are paid before subordinated obligations. Bonds may be unsecured (backed only by the issuer’s general creditworthiness) or secured (backed by specified collateral).</div>
<div>Borrowing.<font>  Each Fund may
borrow for temporary or emergency purposes, including to meet payments due from redemptions or to facilitate the settlement of securities or other transactions. Under normal market conditions, any borrowing by a Fund (except the iShares Fallen
Angels USD Bond ETF and the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield ex Oil &amp; Gas Corporate ETF) will not exceed 10% of the Fund’s net assets; however, each Fund (except the iShares Fallen Angels USD Bond ETF and the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield ex Oil
&amp; Gas Corporate ETF) generally does not intend to borrow money.</font></div>
<div>The purchase of securities while borrowings are outstanding
may have the effect of leveraging a Fund. The incurrence of leverage increases a Fund’s exposure to risk, and borrowed funds are subject to interest costs that will reduce net income. Purchasing securities while borrowings are outstanding
creates special risks, such as the potential for greater volatility in the net asset value of Fund shares and in the yield on a Fund’s portfolio. In addition, the interest expenses from borrowings may exceed the income generated by a
Fund’s portfolio and, therefore, the amount available (if any) for distribution to shareholders as dividends may be reduced. BFA may determine to maintain outstanding borrowings if it expects that the benefits to a Fund’s shareholders
will outweigh the current reduced return.</div> <div>Certain types
of borrowings by a Fund must be made from a bank or may result in a Fund being subject to covenants in credit agreements relating to asset coverage, portfolio composition requirements and other matters. It is not anticipated that observance of such
covenants would impede BFA’s management of a Fund’s portfolio in accordance with a Fund’s investment objectives and policies. However, a breach of any such covenants not cured within the specified cure period may result in
acceleration of outstanding indebtedness and require a Fund to dispose of portfolio investments at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so.</div>
<div>Brady Bonds.<font>  Certain of
the Funds may invest in Brady bonds. Brady bonds are securities created through the exchange of existing commercial bank loans to public and private entities in certain emerging markets for new bonds in connection with debt restructurings. Brady
bonds have been issued since 1989. In light of the history of defaults of countries issuing Brady bonds on their commercial bank loans, investments in Brady bonds may be viewed as speculative and subject to the same risks as emerging market
securities. Brady bonds may be fully or partially collateralized or uncollateralized, are issued in various currencies (but primarily the U.S. dollar) and are actively traded in OTC secondary markets. Incomplete collateralization of interest or
principal payment obligations results in increased credit risk. U.S. dollar-denominated collateralized Brady bonds, which may be either fixed-rate or floating rate bonds, are generally collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities.</font></div>
<div>Corporate Bonds.<font>  Certain
of the Funds may invest in investment-grade and/or high yield corporate bonds. High yield corporate bonds may be deemed speculative and more volatile than higher rated securities of similar maturity. The investment return of corporate bonds reflects
interest earned on the security and changes in the market value of the security. The market value of a corporate bond may be affected by changes in the market rate of interest, the credit rating of the corporation, the corporation’s
performance and perceptions of the corporation in the marketplace. There is a risk that the issuers of the securities may not be able to meet their obligations on interest or principal payments at the time called for by an instrument.</font></div>

<div>Currency Transactions.<font>  A
currency forward contract is an OTC obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency at a future date, which may be any fixed number of days greater than two days from the date on which the contract is agreed upon by the parties, at a price set at
the time of the contract. A non-deliverable currency forward is an OTC currency forward settled in a specified currency, on a specified date, based on the difference between the agreed-upon exchange rate and the market exchange rate. A currency
futures contract is a contract that trades on an organized futures exchange involving an obligation to deliver or acquire a specified amount of a specific currency, at a specified price and at a specified future time. Currency futures contracts may
be settled on a net cash payment basis rather than by the sale and delivery of the underlying currency. To the extent required by law, liquid assets committed to futures contracts will be maintained. The iShares Core International Aggregate Bond ETF
expects to engage in currency transactions for the purpose of hedging against declines in the value of the Fund's assets that are denominated in a non-U.S. currency. The Fund may also enter into physically-settled non-U.S. currency forwards,
and non-U.S. currency futures transactions and spot currency transactions to facilitate local securities settlements or to protect against currency exposure in connection with its distributions to shareholders As described above, reliance on
physically-settled foreign currency may require the Fund to set aside a greater amount of liquid assets than would generally be required if the fund were relying on cash-settled foreign currency forward contracts or NDFs. This would also generally
be true if the Fund were to use other types of physically-settled currency contracts to track the Underlying Index, facilitate local securities settlements or protect against currency exposure.</font></div> <div></div>
<div>Foreign exchange transactions may
involve a significant degree of risk and the markets in which foreign exchange transactions are effected may be highly volatile, highly specialized and highly technical. Significant changes, including changes in liquidity and prices, can occur in
such markets within very short periods of time, often within minutes. Foreign exchange trading risks include, but are not limited to, exchange rate risk, counterparty risk, maturity gap, interest rate risk, and potential interference by foreign
governments through regulation of local exchange markets, foreign investment or particular transactions in non-U.S. currency. If BFA utilizes foreign exchange transactions at an inappropriate time or judges market conditions, trends or correlations
incorrectly, foreign exchange transactions may not serve their intended purpose of improving the correlation of the Fund's return with the performance of its Underlying Index and may lower the Fund’s return. The Fund could experience losses if
the value of its currency forwards and other currency transactions positions were poorly correlated with its other investments or with its other currency hedges or if it could not close out its positions because of an illiquid market or otherwise.
In addition, the Fund could incur transaction costs, including trading commissions, in connection with non-U.S. currency transactions and costs related to investment opportunities due to the fact it will be required to set aside liquid assets
equal to its obligations under its currency forwards in order to satisfy applicable requirements under the 1940 Act. Similarly, because the Fund seeks to hedge currency risk in accordance with the Underlying Index, investors will not share in
appreciation in the securities comprising the Underlying Index to the extent that such appreciation is due to increases in the currency value of the underlying securities.</div>
<div>Derivatives.<font>  The iShares
Core International Aggregate Bond ETF and iShares Edge U.S. Fixed Income Balanced Risk ETF may use instruments referred to as derivatives. Derivatives are financial instruments the value of which is derived from another security, a commodity (such
as gold or oil), a currency or an index (a measure of value or rates, such as the S&amp;P 500 Index or the prime lending rate). Derivatives allow a Fund to increase or decrease the level of risk to which a Fund is exposed more quickly and
efficiently than transactions in other types of instruments. The Funds may use derivatives for hedging purposes. The Funds may also use derivatives for speculative purposes to seek to enhance returns. The use of a derivative is speculative if a Fund
is primarily seeking to achieve gains, rather than to offset the risk of other positions. When a Fund invests in a derivative for speculative purposes, a Fund will be fully exposed to the risks of loss of that derivative, which may sometimes be
greater than the derivative’s cost. Unless otherwise permitted, a Fund may not use any derivatives to gain exposure to an asset or class of assets that it would be prohibited by its investment restrictions from purchasing
directly.</font></div> <div>Diversification Status.<font>   The following table sets forth the diversification status of each Fund:</font></div> <div>

<div>A fund classified as “diversified” under the 1940
Act may not purchase securities of an issuer (other than (i) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities and (ii) securities of other investment companies) if, with respect to 75% of its total assets,
(a) more than 5% of the fund’s total assets would be invested in securities of that issuer or (b) the fund would hold more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of that issuer. With respect to the remaining 25% of its total assets, the
fund may invest more than 5% of its assets in one issuer. Under the 1940 Act, a fund cannot change its classification from diversified to non-diversified without shareholder approval.</div>
<div> A “non-diversified” fund is a fund that is
not limited by the 1940 Act with regard to the percentage of its assets that may be invested in the securities of a single issuer. The securities of a particular issuer (or securities of issuers in particular industries) may constitute a significant
percentage of the underlying index of such a fund and, consequently, the fund’s investment portfolio. This may adversely affect a fund’s performance or subject the fund’s shares to greater price volatility than that experienced by
more diversified investment companies.</div> <div>Each Fund
(whether diversified or non-diversified) intends to maintain the required level of diversification and otherwise conduct its operations so as to qualify as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) for purposes of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”), and to relieve the Fund of any liability for U.S. federal income tax to the extent that its earnings are distributed to shareholders, provided that the Fund satisfies a minimum
distribution requirement. Compliance with the diversification requirements of the Internal Revenue Code may limit the investment flexibility of the Funds and may make it less likely that the Funds will meet their respective investment
objectives.</div> <div></div>
<div>Dollar
Rolls.<font>  A dollar roll transaction involves a sale by a Fund of a mortgage-backed or other security concurrently with an agreement by the Fund to repurchase a similar security at a later date at an agreed-upon
price. The securities that are repurchased will bear the same interest rate and a similar maturity as those sold, but pools of mortgages collateralizing those securities may have different prepayment histories than those sold. During the period
between the sale and repurchase, the Fund will not be entitled to receive interest and principal payments on the securities sold. Proceeds of the sale will be invested in additional instruments for the Fund, and the income from these investments
will generate income for the Fund. If such income does not exceed the income, capital appreciation and gain or loss that would have been realized on the securities sold as part of the dollar roll, the use of this technique will diminish the
investment performance of the Fund compared with what the performance would have been without the use of dollar rolls. At the time the Fund enters into a dollar roll transaction, BFA will designate assets on its books and records in an amount equal
to the amount of the Fund’s commitments and will subsequently monitor the account to ensure that its value is maintained.</font></div>
<div>Dollar rolls involve the risk that the market value of the
securities subject to the Fund’s forward purchase commitment may decline below, or the market value of the securities subject to the Fund’s forward sale commitment may increase above, the exercise price of the forward commitment. In the
event the buyer of the securities files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent, the Fund’s use of the proceeds of the current sale portion of the transaction may be restricted pending a determination by the other party, or its trustee or
receiver, whether to enforce the Fund’s obligation to purchase the similar securities in the forward transaction. Dollar rolls are speculative techniques that can be deemed to involve leverage. At the time the Fund sells securities and agrees
to repurchase securities at a future date, the Fund will segregate liquid assets with a value equal to the repurchase price. The Fund may engage in dollar roll transactions to enhance return. Each dollar roll transaction is accounted for as a sale
or purchase of a portfolio security and a subsequent purchase or sale of a substantially similar security in the forward market. Successful use of mortgage dollar rolls may depend upon BFA’s ability to correctly predict interest rates and
prepayments. There is no assurance that dollar rolls can be successfully employed.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Futures, Options on Futures and Securities
Options.<font>  Futures contracts, options on futures and securities options may be used by a Fund to simulate investment in its Underlying Index, to facilitate trading or to reduce transaction costs. Each Fund may
enter into futures contracts and options on futures that are traded on a U.S. or non-U.S. futures exchange. Each Fund will not use futures, options on futures or securities options for speculative purposes. Each Fund intends to use futures and
options on futures in accordance with Rule 4.5 of the CFTC promulgated under the CEA. BFA, with respect to certain Funds, has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term “commodity pool operator” in accordance with Rule 4.5 so
that BFA, with respect to such Funds, is not subject to registration or regulation as a commodity pool operator under the CEA. See the </font><font>Regulation Regarding Derivatives </font><font>section of this SAI for more information.</font></div>
<div>Futures contracts provide for the future sale by one party and
purchase by another party of a specified amount of a specific instrument or index at a specified future time and at a specified price. Stock index contracts are based on investments that reflect the market value of common stock of the firms included
in the applicable interest. Each Fund may enter into futures contracts to purchase securities indexes when BFA anticipates purchasing the underlying securities and believes prices will rise before the purchase will be made. Upon entering into a
futures contract, a Fund will be required to deposit with the broker an amount of cash or cash equivalents known as “initial margin,” which is similar to a performance bond or good faith deposit on the contract and is returned to the
Fund upon termination of the futures contract if all contractual obligations have been satisfied. Subsequent payments, known as “variation margin,” will be made to and from the broker daily as the price of the instrument or index
underlying the futures contract fluctuates, making the long and short positions in the futures contract more or less valuable, a process known as “marking-to-market.” At any time prior to the expiration of a futures contract, each Fund
may elect to close the position by taking an opposite position, which will operate to terminate the Fund’s existing position in the contract. To the extent required by law, each Fund will segregate liquid assets in an amount equal to its
delivery obligations under the futures contracts. An option on a futures contract, as contrasted with a direct investment in such a contract, gives the purchaser the right, but no obligation, in return for the premium paid, to assume a position in
the underlying futures contract at a specified exercise price at any time prior to the expiration date of the option. Upon exercise of an option, the delivery of the futures position by the writer of the option to the holder of the option will be
accompanied by delivery of the accumulated balance in the writer’s futures margin account that represents the amount by which the market price of the futures contract exceeds (in the case of a call) or is less than (in the case of a put) the
exercise price of the option on the futures contract. The potential for loss related to the purchase of an option on a futures contract is limited to the premium paid for the option plus transaction costs. Because the value of the option is fixed at
the point of sale, there are no daily cash payments by the purchaser to reflect changes in the value of the underlying contract; however, the value of the option changes daily and that change would be reflected in the NAV of each Fund. The potential
for loss related to writing call options is unlimited. The potential for loss related to writing put options is limited to the agreed-upon price per share, also known as the “strike price,” less the premium received from writing the put.
Certain of the Funds may purchase and write put and call options on futures contracts that are traded on an exchange as a hedge against changes in value of their portfolio securities or in anticipation of the purchase of securities, and may enter
into closing transactions with respect to such options to terminate existing positions. There is no guarantee that such closing transactions can be effected.</div>
<div>Securities options may be used by a Fund to obtain access to
securities in its Underlying Index or to dispose of securities in its Underlying Index at favorable prices, to invest cash in a securities index that offers similar exposure to that provided by its Underlying Index or otherwise to achieve the
Fund’s objective of tracking its Underlying Index. A call option gives a holder the right to purchase a specific security at a specified price (“exercise price”) within a specified period of time. A put option gives a holder
the right to sell a specific security at an exercise price within a specified period of time. The initial purchaser of a call option pays the “writer” a premium, which is paid at the time of purchase and is retained by the writer whether
or not such option is exercised. Each Fund may purchase put options to hedge its portfolio against the risk of a decline in the market value of securities held and may purchase call options to hedge against an increase in the price of securities it
is committed to purchase. Each Fund may write put and call options along with a long position in options to increase its ability to hedge against a change in the market value of the securities it holds or is committed to purchase. Each Fund may
purchase or sell securities options on a U.S. or non-U.S. securities exchange or in the OTC market through a transaction with a dealer. Options on a securities index are typically settled on a net basis based on the appreciation or depreciation of
the index level over the strike price. Options on single name securities may be cash- or physically-settled, depending upon the market in which they are traded. Options may be structured so as to be exercisable only on certain dates or on a daily
basis. Options may also be structured to have conditions to exercise (<font>i.e.</font>, “Knock-in Events”) or conditions that trigger termination (<font>i.e.</font>, “Knock-out
Events”). Investments in futures contracts and other investments that contain leverage may require each Fund to maintain liquid assets in an amount equal to its delivery obligations under these contracts and other investments. Generally, each

<div>maintains an amount of liquid assets equal to its obligations relative to the
position involved, adjusted daily on a marked-to-market basis. With respect to futures contracts that are contractually required to “cash-settle,” each Fund maintains liquid assets in an amount at least equal to the Fund’s daily
marked-to-market obligation (<font>i.e.</font>, each Fund’s daily net liability, if any), rather than the contracts’ notional value (<font>i.e.</font>, the value of the underlying
asset). By maintaining assets equal to its net obligation under cash-settled futures contracts, each Fund may employ leverage to a greater extent than if the Fund were required to set aside assets equal to the futures contracts’ full notional
value. Each Fund bases its asset maintenance policies on methods permitted by the SEC and its staff and may modify these policies in the future to comply with any changes in the guidance articulated from time to time by the SEC or its staff. Changes
in SEC guidance regarding the use of derivatives by registered investment companies may adversely impact a Fund’s ability to invest in futures, options or other derivatives or make investments in such instruments more expensive.</div>
<div>Hedging.<font>  Hedging is a
strategy in which a derivative is used to offset particular risks associated with other Fund holdings. Losses on the other investment may be substantially reduced by gains on a derivative that reacts in an opposite manner to market movements. While
hedging can reduce losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains or cause losses if the market moves in a manner different from that anticipated by a Fund or if the cost of the derivative outweighs the benefit of the hedge. Establishment of hedges,
if not tailored properly or timed in accordance with market changes, may not be effective in meeting a Fund’s intended objectives. This is due to the fact that hedging also involves correlation risk, </font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the risk that changes in the value of the derivative will not match those of the holdings being hedged as expected by a Fund, in which case any losses on
the holdings being hedged may not be reduced or may be increased. In connection with its trading in foreign currency forward contracts, the iShares Core International Aggregate Bond ETF will contract with a foreign or domestic bank, foreign or
domestic securities dealer or other intermediary, to make or take future delivery of a specified amount of a particular currency. Physically settled currency contracts are not subject to centralized clearing and trading requirements in the U.S. but
may be in other jurisdictions. In the U.S., NDFs must be traded into foreign currency contracts on a regulated exchange or facility and cleared through a central counterparty (a “CCP”). The Fund may also be subject to position limits in
respect to the contracts established by a regulatory authority or exchange. There are no limitations on daily price moves in such foreign currency forward contracts, and banks and dealers are not required to continue to make markets in such
contracts. There have been periods during which certain banks or dealers have refused to quote prices for such foreign currency forward contracts or have quoted prices with an unusually wide spread between the price at which the bank or dealer is
prepared to buy and that at which it is prepared to sell. Governmental imposition of credit controls might limit any such foreign currency forward contract trading. With respect to its trading of foreign currency forward contracts, if any, the Fund
will be subject to the risk of bank or dealer failure and the inability of, or refusal by, a bank or dealer to perform with respect to such contracts or, in the case of cleared contracts, the refusal of a CCP to clear a contract that is subject to
mandatory clearing. Any such default would deprive the Fund of any potential profit or force the Fund to cover its commitments for resale at the then market price and could result in a loss to the Fund. The cost to the Fund of engaging in foreign
currency forward contracts varies with such factors as the currencies involved, the length of the contract period, whether the contract is cash settled and, thus, would be subject to posting and collection of margin in the U.S. and the market
conditions then prevailing. The inability to close options and futures positions also could have an adverse impact on the Fund’s ability to hedge effectively its portfolio. There is also a risk of loss by the Fund of margin deposits or
collateral in the event of bankruptcy of a broker or other intermediary with whom the Fund has an open position in a currency forward or NDF, a swap, an option, a futures contract, a related option or another hedging instrument.</font></div>
<div>High Yield Securities.<font>
 Certain Funds may invest in non-investment grade securities. Non-investment grade or “high yield” fixed-income or convertible securities, commonly known to investors as “junk bonds” or “high yield bonds,”
are generally debt securities that are rated below investment grade by one or more of the major rating agencies or are unrated securities that BFA believes are of comparable quality. While generally providing greater income and opportunity for gain,
non-investment grade debt securities may be subject to greater risks than securities that have higher credit ratings, including a high risk of default, and their yields will fluctuate over time. High yield securities will generally be in the lower
rating categories of recognized rating agencies (rated below Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody's”) and below BBB- by Standard &amp; Poor's<sup>®</sup> Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of S&amp;P Global (“S&amp;P Global Ratings”) or Fitch Ratings, Inc. (“Fitch”)) or be
unrated. The credit rating of a high yield security does not necessarily address its market value risk, and ratings may from time to time change, positively or negatively, to reflect developments regarding the issuer’s financial condition.
High yield securities are considered to be speculative with respect to the capacity of the issuer to timely repay principal and pay interest in accordance with the terms of the obligation and may have more credit risk than higher rated
securities.</font></div> <div>The major risks of high yield bond
investments include the following:</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<td>High yield bonds are
frequently ranked junior to claims by other creditors. If the issuer cannot meet its obligations, the senior obligations are generally paid off before the junior obligations, which will potentially limit a Fund’s ability to fully recover
principal, to receive interest payments when senior securities are in default or to receive restructuring benefits paid to holders of more senior classes of debt. Thus, investors in high yield securities frequently have a lower degree of protection
with respect to principal and interest payments than do investors in higher rated securities. </td></tr>

high yield securities are not as liquid as the secondary markets for higher rated securities. The secondary markets for high yield securities are concentrated in relatively few market makers and participants in the markets are mostly institutional
investors, including insurance companies, banks, other financial institutions and mutual funds. In addition, the trading volume for high yield securities is generally lower than that for higher rated securities and the secondary markets could
contract under adverse market or economic conditions independent of any specific adverse changes in the condition of a particular issuer. Under certain economic and/or market conditions, a Fund may have difficulty disposing of certain high yield
securities due to the limited number of investors in that sector of the market. An illiquid secondary market may adversely affect the market price of the high yield security, which may result in increased difficulty selling the particular issue and
obtaining accurate market quotations on the issue when valuing a Fund’s assets. Market quotations on high yield securities are available only from a limited number of dealers, and such quotations may not be the actual prices available for a
purchase or sale. When the secondary market for high yield securities becomes more illiquid, or in the absence of readily available market quotations for such securities, the relative lack of reliable objective data makes it more difficult to value
such securities, and judgment plays a more important role in determining such valuations. </td></tr></table> </div> <div>

affected by legislative and regulatory developments. These developments could adversely affect a Fund’s net asset value and investment practices, the secondary market for high yield securities, the financial condition of issuers of these
securities and the value and liquidity of outstanding high yield securities, especially in a thinly traded market. For example, federal legislation requiring the divestiture by federally insured savings and loan associations of their investments in
high yield bonds and limiting the deductibility of interest by certain corporate issuers of high yield bonds adversely affected the market in the past. </td></tr></table> </div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Illiquid Investments.<font>  Each Fund may invest up to an aggregate amount of 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that a Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current
market conditions in seven calendar days or less</font><font> without significantly changing the market value of the investment. The liquidity of a security will be determined based on relevant market, trading and
investment specific considerations as set out in the Funds'</font><font> liquidity risk management program</font><font> (the</font><font> “Liquidity
Program”)</font><font> as required by Rule 22e-4 under the 1940 Act (the “Liquidity Rule”). Illiquid securities may trade at a discount to comparable, more liquid securities and a Fund may not be able to
dispose of illiquid securities in a timely fashion or at their expected prices. If illiquid investments exceed 15% of a Fund’s net assets, the Liquidity Rule and the Liquidity Program will require that certain remedial actions be
taken.</font></div> <div>Inflation-Protected Obligations.<font>   Certain of the Funds invest almost exclusively in inflation-protected public obligations of the U.S. Treasury, commonly known as “TIPS,” and in comparable securities issued by governments of other
countries. Inflation-protected obligations are designed to provide inflation protection to investors. Inflation-protected obligations are income-generating instruments whose interest and principal payments are adjusted for inflation - a sustained
increase in prices that erodes the purchasing power of money. The inflation adjustment, which is typically applied monthly to the principal of the bond, follows a designated inflation index, the consumer price index (“CPI”), and
TIPS’ principal payments are adjusted according to changes in the CPI. A fixed-coupon rate is applied to the inflation-adjusted principal so that as inflation rises, both the principal value and the interest payments increase. This can provide
investors with a hedge against inflation, as it helps preserve the purchasing power of an investment. Because of this inflation adjustment feature, inflation-protected bonds typically have lower yields than conventional fixed-rate
bonds.</font></div> <div>Certain of the Funds are also subject to
the risk that inflation rates of certain countries may be significantly higher than the rates indicated by official reports. As a result, the value of the bonds held by the Funds may decline in value even if payments to investors track reported
inflation. Such securities are also subject to the risk of default by the issuing country.</div> <div></div>
<div>Lending Portfolio Securities.<font>  Each Fund may lend portfolio securities to certain borrowers that BFA determines to be creditworthy, including borrowers affiliated with BFA. The borrowers provide collateral that is maintained in an amount at
least equal to the current market value of the securities loaned. No securities loan shall be made on behalf of a Fund if, as a result, the aggregate value of all securities loaned by the particular Fund exceeds one-third of the value of such Fund's
total assets (including the value of the collateral received). A Fund may terminate a loan at any time and obtain the return of the securities loaned. Each Fund receives, by way of substitute payment, the value of any interest or cash or non-cash
distributions paid on the loaned securities that it would have received if the securities were not on loan. For the iShares Edge U.S. Fixed Income Balanced Risk ETF, iShares Fallen Angels USD Bond ETF and iShares iBoxx $ High Yield ex Oil &amp; Gas
Corporate Bond ETF, substitute payments received on tax-exempt securities loaned out will not be tax-exempt income.</font></div>
<div>With respect to loans that are collateralized by cash, the
borrower may be entitled to receive a fee based on the amount of cash collateral. The Funds are typically compensated by the difference between the amount earned on the reinvestment of cash collateral and the fee paid to the borrower. In the case of
collateral other than cash, a Fund is typically compensated by a fee paid by the borrower equal to a percentage of the market value of the loaned securities. Any cash collateral may be reinvested in certain short-term instruments either directly on
behalf of each lending Fund or through one or more joint accounts or money market funds, including those affiliated with BFA; such investments are subject to investment risk.</div> <div></div>
<div>Each Fund conducts its securities lending
pursuant to an exemptive order from the SEC permitting it to lend portfolio securities to borrowers affiliated with the Fund and to retain an affiliate of the Fund to act as securities lending agent. To the extent that a Fund engages in securities
lending, BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) acts as securities lending agent for the Fund, subject to the overall supervision of BFA. BTC administers the lending program in accordance with guidelines approved by the
Trust's Board of Trustees (the “Board,” the trustees of which are the “Trustees”).</div>
<div>Securities lending involves exposure to certain risks,
including operational risk (<font>i.e.,</font> the risk of losses resulting from problems in the settlement and accounting process), “gap” risk (<font>i.e.,</font> the risk of a
mismatch between the return on cash collateral reinvestments and the fees a Fund has agreed to pay a borrower), and credit, legal, counterparty and market risk. If a securities lending counterparty were to default, a Fund would be subject to the
risk of a possible delay in receiving collateral or in recovering the loaned securities, or to a possible loss of rights in the collateral. In the event a borrower does not return a Fund’s securities as agreed, the Fund may experience losses
if the proceeds received from liquidating the collateral do not at least equal the value of the loaned security at the time the collateral is liquidated, plus the transaction costs incurred in purchasing replacement securities. This event could
trigger adverse tax consequences for a Fund. A Fund could lose money if its short-term investment of the collateral declines in value over the period of the loan. Substitute payments received by a</div> </div>

<div>Mortgage-Backed Securities.<font>
 A significant portion of the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. GNMA Bond Index represents mortgage backed pass-through securities issued by the Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”). The iShares Core 1-5 Year USD Bond ETF
may invest in mortgage backed pass-through securities issued by Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”). The iShares Edge U.S. Fixed Income Balanced
Risk ETF may invest in mortgage backed pass-through securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae. MBS represent interests in pools of mortgages in which payments of both principal and interest on the securities are generally made
monthly,</font><font> in effect</font><font> “passing through”</font><font> monthly payments made by borrowers on the residential or commercial mortgage
loans</font><font> that underlie the securities</font><font> (net of any fees paid to the issuer or guarantor of the securities). MBS differ from other forms of debt securities,</font><font> which normally provide for</font><font> periodic payment</font><font> of interest in fixed amounts with</font><font> principal payments
at</font><font> maturity or specified call dates.</font></div>
<div>MBS are subject to the general risks associated with investing
in real estate securities; that is, they may lose value if the value of the underlying real estate to which a pool of mortgages relates declines. In addition, investments in MBS involve certain specific risks. These risks include the failure of a
party to meet its commitments under the related operative documents, adverse interest rate changes and the effects of prepayments on mortgage cash flows. MBS are “pass-through” securities, meaning that principal and interest payments
made by the borrower on the underlying mortgages are passed through to a Fund. The value of MBS, like that of traditional fixed-income securities, typically increases when interest rates fall and decreases when interest rates rise. However, MBS
differ from traditional fixed-income securities because of their potential for prepayment without penalty. The price paid by a Fund for its MBS, the yield a Fund expects to receive from such securities and the weighted average life of the securities
are based on a number of factors, including the anticipated rate of prepayment of the underlying mortgages. In a period of declining interest rates, borrowers may prepay the underlying mortgages more quickly than anticipated, thereby reducing the
yield to maturity and the average life of the MBS. Moreover, when a Fund reinvests the proceeds of a prepayment in these circumstances, it will likely receive a rate of interest that is lower than the rate on the security that was prepaid.</div>
<div>To the extent that a Fund purchases MBS at a premium, mortgage
foreclosures and principal prepayments may result in a loss to the extent of the premium paid. If a Fund buys such securities at a discount, both scheduled payments of principal and unscheduled prepayments will increase current and total returns and
will accelerate the recognition of income, which, when distributed to shareholders, will be taxable as ordinary income. In a period of rising interest rates, prepayments of the underlying mortgages may occur at a slower than expected rate, creating
maturity extension risk. This particular risk may effectively change a security that was considered short- or intermediate-term at the time of purchase into a long-term security. Since the value of long-term securities generally fluctuates more
widely in response to changes in interest rates than that of shorter-term securities, maturity extension risk could increase the inherent volatility of a Fund. Under certain interest rate and prepayment scenarios, a Fund may fail to recoup fully its
investment in MBS notwithstanding any direct or indirect governmental or agency guarantee.</div>
<div>Mortgage Pass-Through Securities<font>. There are currently three types of mortgage pass-through securities: (1) those issued by the U.S. government or one of its agencies or instrumentalities, such as Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac; (2) those issued
by private issuers that represent an interest in or are collateralized by pass-through securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or one of its agencies or instrumentalities; and (3) those issued by private issuers that represent an
interest in or are collateralized by whole mortgage loans or pass-through securities without a government guarantee but that usually have some form of private credit enhancement.</font></div>
<div>Ginnie Mae is a wholly owned U.S. government corporation
within the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Ginnie Mae is authorized to guarantee, with the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, the timely payment of principal and interest on securities issued by the institutions approved by
Ginnie Mae (such as savings and loan institutions, commercial banks and mortgage banks), and backed by pools of Federal Housing Administration-insured or Veterans’ Administration-guaranteed mortgages. Pass-through certificates guaranteed by
Ginnie Mae (such certificates are also known as “Ginnie Maes”) are guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest by Ginnie Mae, whose guarantee is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Ginnie Mae
certificates also are supported by the authority of Ginnie Mae to borrow funds from the U.S. Treasury Department to make payments under its guarantee. Mortgage-related securities issued by Fannie Mae include Fannie Mae guaranteed Mortgage
Pass-Through Certificates (also known as “Fannie Maes”),</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>which are guaranteed as to timely payment of
principal and interest by Fannie Mae. They are not backed by or entitled to the full faith and credit of the United States, but are supported by the right of Fannie Mae to borrow from the U.S. Treasury Department. Fannie Mae was established as a
federal agency in 1938 and in 1968 was chartered by Congress as a private shareholder-owned company. Mortgage-related securities issued by Freddie Mac include Freddie Mac Mortgage Participation Certificates (also known as “Freddie Macs”
or “PCs”). Freddie Mac is a stockholder-owned corporation chartered by Congress in 1970. Freddie Macs are not guaranteed by the United States or by any Federal Home Loan Banks and do not constitute a debt or obligation of the United
States or of any Federal Home Loan Bank. Freddie Macs entitle the holder to timely payment of interest, which is guaranteed by Freddie Mac. Freddie Mac guarantees either ultimate collection or timely payment of all principal payments on the
underlying mortgage loans. While Freddie Mac generally does not guarantee timely payment of principal, Freddie Mac may remit the amount due on account of its guarantee of ultimate payment of principal at any time after default on an underlying
mortgage, but in no event later than one year after it becomes payable. On September 6, 2008, Director James Lockhart of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (“FHFA”) appointed FHFA as conservator of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In
addition the U.S. Treasury Department agreed to provide Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac up to $100 billion of capital each on an as needed basis to insure that they continue to provide liquidity to the housing and mortgage markets.</div>
<div>The iShares Core 1-5 Year USD Bond ETF, iShares Core
International Aggregate Bond ETF, iShares GNMA Bond ETF and iShares Edge U.S. Fixed Income Balanced Risk ETF seek to obtain exposure to the fixed-rate portion of the U.S. agency MBS, which represent a significant portion of their respective
portfolios, primarily through the use of TBAs. “TBA” refers to a commonly used mechanism for the forward settlement of U.S. agency MBS, and not to a separate type of MBS. Most transactions in fixed-rate MBS occur through the use of TBA
transactions. TBA transactions generally are conducted in accordance with widely-accepted guidelines which establish commonly observed terms and conditions for execution, settlement and delivery. In a TBA transaction, the buyer and seller decide on
general trade parameters, such as agency, settlement date, par amount, and price. The actual pools delivered generally are determined two days prior to settlement date. The iShares Core 1-5 Year USD Bond ETF, iShares Core International Aggregate
Bond ETF, iShares GNMA Bond ETF and iShares Edge U.S. Fixed Income Balanced Risk ETF may use TBA transactions in several ways. For example, each Fund may regularly enter into TBA agreements and “roll over” such agreements prior to the
settlement date stipulated in such agreements. This type of TBA transaction is sometimes known as a “TBA roll.” In a TBA roll, each Fund generally will sell the obligation to purchase the pools stipulated in the TBA agreement prior to
the stipulated settlement date and will enter into a new TBA agreement for future delivery of pools of MBS. In addition, each Fund may enter into TBA agreements and settle such transactions on the stipulated settlement date by accepting actual
receipt or delivery of the pools of MBS stipulated in the TBA agreement. Each Fund is not required to use TBA transactions to gain exposure to mortgage pools, and each Fund may choose to purchase those interests in any manner believed by BFA to be
in the best interests of the Fund. Each Fund’s use of TBA rolls may cause the Fund to experience higher portfolio turnover, higher transaction costs, and to pay higher capital gain distributions to shareholders (which may be taxable) than
other Funds described in this SAI that do not use TBA rolls.</div>
<div>The iShares Core 1-5 Year USD Bond ETF, iShares Core
International Aggregate Bond ETF and iShares GNMA Bond ETF intend to invest cash pending settlement of any TBA transactions in money market instruments, repurchase agreements or other high-quality, liquid short-term instruments, including money
market funds advised by BFA. Each Fund will assume its <font>pro rata</font> share of fees and expenses of any money market fund that it may invest in, in addition to the Fund's own fees and expenses.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Non-U.S. Securities.<font>  Certain of the Funds invest in certain obligations or securities of non-U.S. issuers. An issuer of a security may be deemed to be located in a particular country if: (i) the principal trading market for the
security is in such country, (ii) the issuer is organized under the laws of such country, (iii) the issuer derives at least 50% of its revenues or profits from such country or has at least 50% of its assets situated in such country or, (iv) the
issuer is the government of the particular country.</font></div>
<div>If your Fund shares are loaned pursuant to securities lending
arrangements, you may lose the ability to use any non-U.S. tax credits passed through by a Fund or to treat Fund dividends (paid while the shares are held by the borrower) as qualified dividends. Regarding a short sale with respect to shares of a
Fund, substitute payments made to the lender of such shares may not be deductible under certain circumstances. Consult your financial intermediary or tax advisor.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Passive Foreign Investment Companies.<font>  If a Fund purchases shares in PFICs, it may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a portion of any “excess distribution” or gain from the disposition of such shares even if such income is
distributed as a taxable dividend by the Fund to its shareholders. Additional charges in the nature of interest may be imposed on the Fund in respect of deferred taxes arising from such distributions or gains.</font></div>
<div>If a Fund were to invest in a PFIC and elect to treat the PFIC
as a “qualified electing fund” under the Internal Revenue Code, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, a Fund might be required to include in income each year a portion of the ordinary earnings and net capital gains of the qualified
electing fund, even if not distributed to a Fund, and such amounts would be subject to the 90% and excise tax distribution requirements described above. In order to make this election, a Fund would be required to obtain certain annual information
from the PFICs in which it invests, which may be difficult or impossible to obtain. Currently proposed IRS regulations, if adopted, would treat such included amounts as nonqualifying RIC income to a Fund unless such amounts were also distributed to
the Fund.</div> <div>Alternatively, a Fund may make a
mark-to-market election that would result in a Fund being treated as if it had sold and repurchased its PFIC stock at the end of each year. In such case, a Fund would report any such gains as ordinary income and would deduct any such losses as
ordinary losses to the extent of previously recognized gains. The election must be made separately for each PFIC owned by a Fund and, once made, would be effective for all subsequent taxable years, unless revoked with the consent of the IRS. By
making the election, a Fund could potentially ameliorate the adverse tax consequences with respect to its ownership of shares in a PFIC, but in any particular year may be required to recognize income in excess of the distributions it receives from
PFICs and its proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock. A Fund may have to distribute this “phantom” income and gain to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement and to avoid imposition of the 4% excise tax.</div>
<div>A Fund will make the appropriate tax elections, if possible,
and take any additional steps that are necessary to mitigate the effects of these rules.</div> <div></div>
<div>Privately-Issued Securities.<font>   The iShares 5-10 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares 10+ Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares Aaa - A Rated Corporate Bond ETF, iShares Broad USD High Yield Corporate Bond ETF, iShares
Convertible Bond ETF, iShares Core 1-5 Year USD Bond ETF, iShares Edge U.S. Fixed Income Balanced Risk ETF, iShares Floating Rate Bond ETF and iShares J.P. Morgan USD Emerging Markets Bond ETF may invest in privately-issued securities, including
those that may be resold only in accordance with Rule 144A or Regulation S under the 1933 Act (“Restricted Securities”). Restricted Securities are not publicly-traded and are subject to a variety of restrictions, which limit a
purchaser's ability to acquire or resell such securities. Accordingly, the liquidity of the market for specific Restricted Securities may vary. Delay or difficulty in selling such securities may result in a loss to a Fund.</font></div>
<div>Ratings.<font>  An
investment-grade rating generally means the security or issuer is rated investment-grade by one or more of Moody’s, S&amp;P Global Ratings, Fitch, or another credit rating agency designated as a nationally recognized statistical rating
organization (“NRSRO”) by the SEC, or is unrated but considered to be of equivalent quality by BFA. Generally, bonds rated Baa3 or above by Moody’s or BBB- or above by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch are considered
“investment-grade” securities, bonds rated Baa are considered medium grade obligations subject to moderate credit risk and may possess certain speculative characteristics, while bonds rated BBB are regarded as having adequate capacity to
meet financial commitments.</font></div> <div>Subsequent to
purchase by a Fund, a rated security may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below an investment-grade rating. Bonds rated lower than Baa3 by Moody’s or BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings or Fitch are generally considered below
investment-grade quality and are obligations of issuers that are generally considered predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal according to the terms of the obligation and, therefore,
carry greater investment risk, including the possibility of issuer default and bankruptcy and increased market price volatility. Such lower-rated securities are commonly referred to as “junk bonds” and are subject to a substantial degree
of credit risk. Please see Appendix B of this SAI for a description of each rating category of Moody's, S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch and BFA's treatment of investments that are not rated by any of the rating agencies.</div>
<div>Regulation Regarding Derivatives.<font>  The CFTC subjects advisers to registered investment companies to regulation by the CFTC if a fund that is advised by the adviser either (i) invests, directly or indirectly, more than a prescribed level of its
liquidation value in CFTC-regulated futures, options and swaps (“CFTC Derivatives”), or (ii) markets itself as providing investment exposure to such instruments. The CFTC also subjects advisers to registered investment companies to
regulation by the CFTC if the registered investment company invests in one or more commodity pools. NDFs and cash-settled currency forwards as well as futures, options on futures, currency options and swaps entered into by the Fund will be
treated as CFTC</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Derivatives for these purposes, whereas physically-settled foreign currency
forward contracts generally will not be treated as CFTC Derivatives. To the extent a Fund uses CFTC Derivatives, it intends to do so below such prescribed levels and intends not to market itself as a “commodity pool” or a vehicle for
trading such instruments.</div> <div></div>
<div>BFA has claimed an exclusion from the
definition of the term “commodity pool operator” under the CEA pursuant to Rule 4.5 under the CEA with respect to each of the Funds . BFA is not, therefore, subject to registration or regulation as a “commodity pool operator”
under the CEA with respect to the Funds.</div> <div>Derivative
contracts, including, without limitation, swaps, currency forwards, and NDFs, are subject to regulation under the Dodd-Frank Act in the U.S. and under comparable regimes in Europe, Asia and other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Swaps, NDFs and certain other
derivatives traded in the OTC market are subject to variation margin requirements, and initial margining requirements will be phased in through 2020. Implementation of the margining and other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding clearing,
mandatory trading, reporting and documentation of swaps and other derivatives have impacted and may continue to impact the costs to a Fund of trading these instruments and, as a result, may affect returns to investors in a Fund.</div>
<div>As a result of regulatory requirements under the 1940 Act, a
Fund is required to maintain an amount of liquid assets, accrued on a daily basis, having an aggregate value at least equal to the value of a Fund’s obligations under the applicable derivatives contract. To the extent that derivatives
contracts are settled on a physical basis, a Fund will generally be required to maintain an amount of liquid assets equal to the notional value of the contract. On the other hand, in connection with derivatives contracts that are performed on a net
basis, a Fund will generally be required to maintain liquid assets, accrued daily, equal only to the accrued excess, if any, of a Fund’s obligations over those of its counterparty under the contract. Accordingly, reliance by a Fund on
physically-settled derivatives contracts may adversely impact investors by requiring a Fund to set aside a greater amount of liquid assets than would generally be required if a Fund were relying on cash-settled derivatives contracts.</div>

U.S. Fixed Income Balanced Risk ETF (the “No-Action Letter Funds”) may also have investments in “underlying funds” (and such underlying funds themselves may invest in underlying funds) not advised by BFA (the term
“underlying fund” for purposes of the no-action letter referenced below may include, but is not limited to, certain securitized vehicles, mortgage or international real estate investment trusts, business development companies and/or
investment companies that may invest in CFTC Derivatives or in any of the foregoing), and therefore may be viewed by the CFTC as commodity pools. BFA has no transparency into the holdings of these underlying funds because they are not advised by
BFA. To address this issue of lack of transparency, the CFTC staff issued a no-action letter on November 29, 2012 permitting the adviser of a fund that invests in such underlying funds and that would otherwise have filed a claim of exclusion
pursuant to CFTC Rule 4.5 to delay registration as a “commodity pool operator” until six months from the date on which the CFTC issues additional guidance on the treatment of CFTC Derivatives held by underlying funds. BFA, the adviser of
the No-Action Letter Funds, has filed a claim with the CFTC for such Funds to rely on this no-action relief. Accordingly, BFA is not currently subject to registration or regulation as a “commodity pool operator” under the CEA in respect
of such Funds.</div> <div>Repurchase Agreements.<font>  A repurchase agreement is an instrument under which the purchaser (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, a Fund) acquires a security and the
seller agrees, at the time of the sale, to repurchase the security at a mutually agreed-upon time and price, thereby determining the yield during the purchaser’s holding period. Repurchase agreements may be construed to be collateralized loans
by the purchaser to the seller secured by the securities transferred to the purchaser. If a repurchase agreement is construed to be a collateralized loan, the underlying securities will not be considered to be owned by a Fund but only to constitute
collateral for the seller’s obligation to pay the repurchase price, and, in the event of a default by the seller, the Fund may suffer time delays and incur costs or losses in connection with the disposition of the collateral.</font></div>
<div>In any repurchase transaction, the collateral for a
repurchase agreement may include: (i) cash items; (ii) obligations issued by the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities; or (iii) obligations that, at the time the repurchase agreement is entered into, are determined to (A) have
exceptionally strong capacity to meet their financial obligations and (B) are sufficiently liquid such that they can be sold at approximately their carrying value in the ordinary course of business within seven days.</div>
<div>Repurchase agreements pose certain risks for a Fund that
utilizes them. Such risks are not unique to the Funds, but are inherent in repurchase agreements. Each Fund seeks to minimize such risks, but because of the inherent legal uncertainties</div> </div>

<div>involved in repurchase agreements, such risks cannot be eliminated. Lower
quality collateral and collateral with a longer maturity may be subject to greater price fluctuations than higher quality collateral and collateral with a shorter maturity. If the repurchase agreement counterparty were to default, lower quality
collateral may be more difficult to liquidate than higher quality collateral. Should the counterparty default and the amount of collateral not be sufficient to cover the counterparty’s repurchase obligation, a Fund would likely retain the
status of an unsecured creditor of the counterparty (<font>i.e.</font>, the position a Fund would normally be in if it were to hold, pursuant to its investment policies, other unsecured debt securities of the defaulting
counterparty) with respect to the amount of the shortfall. As an unsecured creditor, a Fund would be at risk of losing some or all of the principal and income involved in the transaction.</div>
<div>Reverse Repurchase Agreements.<font>
 Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities with an agreement to repurchase the securities at an agreed-upon price, date and interest payment and have the characteristics of borrowing. Generally, the effect of such
transactions is that a Fund can recover all or most of the cash invested in the portfolio securities involved during the term of the reverse repurchase agreement, while in many cases the Fund is able to keep some of the interest income associated
with those securities. Such transactions are advantageous only if a Fund has an opportunity to earn a rate of interest on the cash derived from these transactions that is greater than the interest cost of obtaining the same amount of cash.
Opportunities to realize earnings from the use of the proceeds equal to or greater than the interest required to be paid may not always be available, and a Fund intends to use the reverse repurchase technique only when BFA believes it will be
advantageous to the Fund. The use of reverse repurchase agreements may exaggerate any increase or decrease in the value of a Fund’s assets. A Fund’s exposure to reverse repurchase agreements will be covered by liquid assets having a
value equal to or greater than the Fund’s obligations under such commitments. The use of reverse repurchase agreements is a form of leverage, and the proceeds obtained by a Fund through reverse repurchase agreements may be invested in
additional securities.</font></div> <div></div>
<div>Securities of Investment Companies.<font>  Each Fund may invest in the securities of other investment companies (including money market funds) to the extent permitted by law, regulation, exemptive order or SEC staff guidance. Under the 1940 Act, a
fund’s investment in investment companies is limited to, subject to certain exceptions, (i) 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of any one investment company, (ii) 5% of the fund’s total assets with respect to any one investment
company, and (iii) 10% of the fund’s total assets with respect to investment companies in the aggregate. To the extent allowed by law or regulation, the Funds intend from time to time to invest their assets in securities of investment
companies, including, but not limited to, money market funds, including those advised by BFA or otherwise affiliated with BFA, in excess of the limits discussed above. Other investment companies in which a Fund invests can be expected to incur fees
and expenses for operations, such as investment advisory and administration fees, which would be in addition to those incurred by a Fund. Pursuant to guidance issued by the SEC staff, fees and expenses of money market funds used for cash collateral
received in connection with loans of securities are not treated as Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, which reflect a Fund’s </font><font>pro rata </font><font>share of
the fees and expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies (as disclosed in the Prospectus, as applicable).</font></div>
<div>Short-Term Instruments and Temporary Investments.<font>   Each Fund may invest in short-term instruments, including variable rate demand notes, short-term municipal securities, short-term municipal money market funds and money market instruments, on an ongoing basis to
provide liquidity or for other reasons. Money market instruments are generally short-term investments that may include, but are not limited to: (i) shares of money market funds (including those advised by BFA or otherwise affiliated with BFA); (ii)
obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities (including government-sponsored enterprises); (iii) negotiable certificates of deposit, bankers’ acceptances, fixed-time deposits and other obligations
of U.S. and non-U.S. banks (including non-U.S. branches) and similar institutions; (iv) commercial paper rated, at the date of purchase, “Prime-1” by Moody's, “F-1” by Fitch or “A-1” by S&amp;P Global Ratings, or
if unrated, of comparable quality as determined by BFA; (v) non-convertible corporate debt securities (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, bonds and debentures) with remaining
maturities at the date of purchase of not more than 397 days and that have been determined to present minimal credit risks, in accordance with the requirements set forth in Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act; (vi) repurchase agreements; and (vii)
short-term U.S. dollar-denominated obligations of non-U.S. banks (including U.S. branches) that, in the opinion of BFA, are of comparable quality to obligations of U.S. banks that may be purchased by a Fund. Any of these instruments may be purchased
on a current or forward-settled basis. Time deposits are non-negotiable deposits maintained in banking institutions for specified periods of time at stated interest rates. Bankers’ acceptances are time drafts drawn on commercial banks by
borrowers, usually in connection with international transactions.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Short Sales.<font>
 The iShares Edge U.S. Fixed Income Balanced Risk ETF may make short sales of securities, either as a hedge against potential declines in value of a portfolio security or to realize appreciation when a security that the Fund does not own
declines in value. When the Fund makes a short sale, it borrows the security sold short and delivers it to the broker-dealer through which it made the short sale. The Fund may have to pay a fee to borrow particular securities and is often obligated
to turn over any payments received on such borrowed securities to the lender of the securities.</font></div>
<div>The Fund secures its obligation to replace the borrowed
security by depositing collateral with the broker-dealer, usually in cash, U.S. government securities or other liquid securities similar to those borrowed. With respect to uncovered short positions, the Fund is required to deposit similar collateral
with its custodian, if necessary, to the extent that the value of both collateral deposits in the aggregate is at all times equal to at least 100% of the current market value of the security sold short. Depending on arrangements made with the
broker-dealer from which the Fund borrowed the security, regarding payment received by the Fund on such security, the Fund may not receive any payments (including interest) on its collateral deposited with such broker-dealer.</div>
<div>Sovereign and Quasi-Sovereign Obligations.<font>  Certain of the Funds may invest in sovereign and quasi-sovereign obligations. An investment in sovereign debt obligations involves special risks not present in corporate debt obligations. Sovereign debt includes
securities issued or guaranteed by a foreign sovereign government. Quasi-sovereign debt includes securities issued or guaranteed by an entity affiliated with or backed by a sovereign government. The issuer of the sovereign debt that controls the
repayment of the debt may be unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due, and a Fund may have limited recourse in the event of a default. Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial condition or credit rating of a non-U.S.
government may cause the value of a sovereign debt to decline. During periods of economic uncertainty, the market prices of sovereign debt obligations may be more volatile than prices of U.S. debt obligations, which may affect a Fund's NAV. In the
past, certain emerging market countries have encountered difficulties in servicing their debt obligations, withheld payments of principal and interest and declared moratoria on the payment of principal and interest on their sovereign debts. Several
sovereign issuers have experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about rising government debt levels, including Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. In the past, sovereign issuers have also defaulted on their debt obligations,
including Russia, Argentina, Indonesia and Uruguay.</font></div>
<div>A sovereign debtor's willingness or ability to repay principal
and pay interest in a timely manner may be affected by, among other factors, its cash flow situation, the extent of its non-U.S. currency reserves, the availability of sufficient foreign exchange, the relative size of the debt service burden, the
sovereign debtor's policy toward principal international lenders and local political constraints. Sovereign debtors may also be dependent on expected disbursements from foreign governments, multilateral agencies and other entities to reduce
principal and interest arrears on their debt. The failure of a sovereign debtor to implement economic reforms, achieve specified levels of economic performance or repay principal or interest when due may result in the cancellation of third-party
commitments to lend funds to the sovereign debtor, which may further impair such debtor's ability or willingness to service its debts. Quasi-sovereign debt obligations are typically less liquid and less standardized than government debt.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Stripped Securities.<font>  Stripped securities are created when the issuer separates the interest and principal components of an instrument and sells them as separate securities. In general, one security is entitled to receive the interest
payments on the underlying assets (the interest only, or “IO” security) and the other to receive the principal payments (the principal only, or “PO” security). Some stripped securities may receive a combination of interest
and principal payments. The yields to maturity on IOs and POs are sensitive to the expected or anticipated rate of principal payments (including prepayments) on the related underlying assets, and principal payments may have a material effect on
yield to maturity. If the underlying assets experience greater than anticipated prepayments of principal, the Fund may not fully recoup its initial investment in IOs. Conversely, if the underlying assets experience less than anticipated prepayments
of principal, the yield on POs could be adversely affected. Stripped securities may be highly sensitive to changes in interest rates and rates of prepayment.</font></div>
<div>Swap Agreements.<font>  Swap
agreements are contracts between parties in which one party agrees to make periodic payments to the other party based on a pre-determined underlying</font><font> investment or notional amount. In return, the other party
agrees to make periodic payments to the first party based on the return (or differential in rates of return)</font><font> earned or realized</font><font> on the underlying investment or
notional amount. Swap agreements will usually be performed on a net basis, with a Fund receiving or paying only the net amount of the two payments. The net amount of the excess, if any, of a Fund’s obligations over its entitlements with
respect to each swap is accrued on a daily basis, and an amount of liquid assets having an aggregate value at least equal to the accrued excess will be maintained by the Fund.</font></div> </div>

<div>Certain of the Funds may enter into swap
agreements, including currency swaps, interest rate swaps and index swaps. The use of swaps is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio security transactions.
These transactions generally do not involve the delivery of securities or other underlying assets.</div>
<div>U.S. Government Obligations.<font>
 Certain of the Funds may invest in various types of U.S. government obligations. U.S. government obligations are a type of bond and include securities issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S. government, its agencies or
instrumentalities. Payment of principal and interest on U.S. government obligations (i) may be backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. or (ii) may be backed solely by the issuing or guaranteeing agency or instrumentality itself (as with
Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Federal Home Loan Bank notes). In the latter case, each Fund must look principally to the agency or instrumentality issuing or guaranteeing the obligation for ultimate repayment, which agency or instrumentality may be
privately owned. There can be no assurance that the U.S. government would provide financial support to its agencies or instrumentalities where it is not obligated to do so. As a general matter, the value of debt instruments, including U.S.
government obligations, declines when market interest rates increase and rises when market interest rates decrease. Certain types of U.S. government obligations are subject to fluctuations in yield or value due to their structure or contract
terms.</font></div> <div></div>
<div>U.S.-Registered and Restricted Securities of
Non-U.S. Issuers.<font>  Each Fund (other than the iShares 0-5 Year TIPS Bond ETF, iShares Core International Aggregate Bond ETF, iShares GNMA Bond ETF, iShares TIPS Bond ETF, and iShares U.S. Treasury Bond ETF) may
invest in U.S.-registered, U.S. dollar-denominated bonds of non-U.S. governments, agencies, supranational entities and corporate issuers. The iShares 5-10 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares 10+ Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond
ETF, iShares Broad USD High Yield Corporate Bond ETF, iShares Edge U.S. Fixed Income Balanced Risk ETF, iShares Fallen Angels USD Bond ETF and iShares iBoxx $ High Yield ex Oil &amp; Gas Corporate Bond ETF may invest in Restricted Securities issued
by non-U.S. issuers. Investing in U.S.-registered, U.S. dollar-denominated bonds (or Restricted Securities for iShares 5-10 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares 10+ Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares Broad USD High Yield
Corporate Bond ETF, iShares Edge U.S. Fixed Income Balanced Risk ETF, iShares Fallen Angels USD Bond ETF and iShares iBoxx $ High Yield ex Oil &amp; Gas Corporate Bond ETF) issued by non-U.S. issuers involves some risks and considerations not
typically associated with investing in U.S. issuers. These include differences in accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards; the possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation; adverse changes in investment or exchange control
regulations; political instability, which could affect U.S. investments in foreign countries; and potential restrictions of the flow of international capital. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject to less governmental regulation than U.S. issuers. In
addition, the risk that the issuer may fail to meet its obligations on these securities may be affected by fluctuations in non-U.S. currency exchange rates between the issuer's local currency and the U.S. dollar. Moreover, individual non-U.S.
economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy in such respects as growth of gross domestic product (“GDP”), rate of inflation, capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency and balance of payment
positions.</font></div> <div>When Issued Securities, Delayed Delivery
Securities and Forward Commitments.<font>  Each Fund may purchase or sell securities that it is entitled to receive on a when issued basis. Each Fund may also purchase or sell securities on a delayed delivery basis
or through a forward commitment (including on TBA transactions). These transactions involve the purchase or sale of securities by each Fund at an established price with payment and delivery taking place in the future. Each Fund enters into these
transactions to obtain what is considered an advantageous price to each Fund at the time of entering into the transaction. When each Fund purchases securities in these transactions, each Fund segregates liquid securities in an amount equal to the
amount of its purchase commitments. TBAs also require the Fund entering into the transaction to post margin with the broker-dealer in connection with the transaction, which increases costs to the Fund.</font></div>
<div>There can be no assurance that a security purchased on a when
issued basis will be issued or that a security purchased or sold on a delayed delivery basis or through a forward commitment will be delivered. Also, the value of securities in these transactions on the delivery date may be more or less than the
price paid by each Fund to purchase the securities.</div> <div>Each
Fund will lose money if the value of the security in such a transaction declines below the purchase price and will not benefit if the value of the security appreciates above the sale price during the commitment period.</div>
<div>Each Fund may dispose of or renegotiate a commitment after it
has been entered into, and may sell securities it has committed to purchase before those securities are delivered to each Fund on the settlement date. In these cases each Fund may realize a taxable capital gain or loss.</div> </div>

<div>When each Fund engages in when-issued, TBA
transactions or forward commitment transactions, it relies on the other party to consummate the trade. Failure of such party to do so may result in the Fund’s incurring a loss or missing an opportunity to obtain a price considered to be
advantageous.</div> <div>The market value of the securities
underlying a commitment to purchase securities, and any subsequent fluctuations in their market value, is taken into account when determining the market value of each Fund starting on the day each Fund agrees to purchase the securities. Each Fund
does not earn interest on the securities it has committed to purchase until they are paid for and delivered on the settlement date.</div>
<div>Future Developments.<font>  The
Board may, in the future, authorize each Fund to invest in securities contracts and investments other than those listed in this SAI and in the applicable Prospectus, provided they are consistent with each Fund's investment objective and do not
violate any investment restrictions or policies.</font></div>
<div>General Considerations and Risks</div>
<div>A discussion of some of the principal risks associated with an
investment in a Fund is contained in each Fund's Prospectus. An investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding that the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities may fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of
the issuers of the portfolio securities, the value of bonds in general, and other factors that affect the market.</div>
<div>Agency Debt Risk.<font>
 Certain of the Funds may invest in unsecured bonds or debentures issued by U.S. government agencies, including Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Bonds or debentures issued by U.S. government agencies, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are
generally backed only by the general creditworthiness and reputation of the government agency issuing the bond or debenture and are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Ginnie Mae securities are generally backed by the
full faith and credit of the U.S. government.</font></div>
<div>Some government agencies, including Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac, purchase and guarantee residential mortgages and form MBS that they issue to the market. These agencies also hold their own MBS as well as those of other institutions with funding from the agency debentures they issue. Recent events in the
markets for MBS have adversely affected the value of those MBS held and/or issued by these agencies.</div> <div></div>
<div>Borrowing Risk.<font>  Borrowing may exaggerate changes in the net asset value of Fund shares and in the return on a Fund’s portfolio. Borrowing will cause a Fund to incur interest expense and other fees. The costs of borrowing
may reduce a Fund’s return. Borrowing may cause a Fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations.</font></div>
<div>Custody Risk.<font>  Custody
risk refers to the risks inherent in the process of clearing and settling trades and to the holding of securities, cash and other assets by local banks, agents and depositories. Low trading volumes and volatile prices in less developed markets make
trades harder to complete and settle, and governments or trade groups may compel local agents to hold securities in designated depositories that may not be subject to independent evaluation. Local agents are held only to the standards of care of
their local markets, and thus may be subject to limited or no government oversight. Communications between the U.S. and emerging market countries may be unreliable, increasing the risk of delayed settlements or losses of security certificates. In
general, the less developed a country’s securities market is, the greater the likelihood of custody problems. Practices in relation to the settlement of securities transactions in emerging markets involve higher risks than those in developed
markets, in part because of the use of brokers and counterparties that are often less well capitalized, and custody and registration of assets in some countries may be unreliable. The possibility of fraud, negligence or undue influence being exerted
by the issuer or refusal to recognize ownership exists in some emerging markets, and, along with other factors, could result in ownership registration being lost. In addition, the laws of certain countries may put limits on a Fund’s ability to
recover its assets if a foreign bank or depository or issuer of a security or an agent of any of the foregoing goes bankrupt. A Fund would absorb any loss resulting from such custody problems and may have no successful claim for
compensation.</font></div> <div>Issuer Insolvency Risk.<font>  Each Fund's potential exposure to financially or operationally troubled issuers involves a high degree of credit and market risk, which may be heightened during an economic downturn or recession. Should an issuer
of securities held by a Fund become involved in a bankruptcy proceeding, reorganization or financial restructuring, a wide variety of considerations make an evaluation of the outcome of a Fund’s exposure to the issuer uncertain.</font></div>

 Table of Contents </a> </div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>During the period of a bankruptcy proceeding, reorganization
or financial restructuring, it is unlikely that each Fund will receive any interest payments on the securities of the issuer. Each Fund will be subject to significant uncertainty as to whether the reorganization or restructuring will be completed,
and each Fund may bear certain extraordinary expenses to protect and recover its investment. Each Fund will also be subject to significant uncertainty as to when and in what manner and for what value the obligations evidenced by the securities of
the issuer held by each Fund will eventually be satisfied. Even if a plan of reorganization or restructuring is adopted with respect to the securities of the issuer held by each Fund, there can be no assurance that the securities or other assets
received by each Fund in connection with such plan of reorganization or restructuring will not have a lower value or income potential than may have been anticipated or no value. A Fund may be unable to enforce its claims or rights in any collateral
or may have its claims or security interest in any collateral challenged, disallowed or subordinated to the claims or security interests of other creditors. In addition, amendments to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or other relevant laws could alter the
expected outcome or introduce greater uncertainty regarding the outcome of each Fund’s securities holdings in the issuer. In a bankruptcy proceeding, a reorganization or restructuring, the securities of the issuer held by each Fund could be
re-characterized or each Fund may receive different securities or other assets, including equity securities. These types of equity securities include, but are not limited to: common stock; preferred stock (including convertible preferred stock);
bonds, notes and debentures convertible into common or preferred stock; stock purchase warrants and rights; equity interests in trusts; and depositary receipts. Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their value may be more volatile
than those of other asset classes. Holders of equity securities are subject to more risk than holders of debt securities because the status of equity holders is subordinate to debtholders in an issuer's capital structure. The value of equity
securities received by each Fund could decline if the financial condition of the issuer deteriorates or if overall market and economic conditions, or conditions within the issuer’s region or industry, deteriorate. Equity securities received by
a Fund through a bankruptcy proceeding, reorganization or restructuring of an issuer would not be component securities of a Fund’s Underlying Index, which could subject a Fund to additional tracking error risk.</div>
<div>To the extent that each Fund receives other assets in
connection with a bankruptcy proceeding, reorganization or financial restructuring, each Fund may also be subject to additional risks associated with the assets received. One example of assets that each Fund could receive is an interest in one or
more loans made to the issuer as part of a workout agreed to by a consortium of lienholders and creditors of the issuer. Each Fund may receive such interests in loans to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act.</div>
<div>Securities or other assets received in a reorganization or
restructuring typically entail a higher degree of risk than investments in securities of issuers that have not undergone a reorganization or restructuring and may be subject to heavy selling or downward pricing pressure after completion of the
reorganization or restructuring. The post-reorganization/restructuring assets and securities may also be illiquid and difficult to sell or value. If each Fund participates in negotiations with respect to a plan of reorganization or restructuring
with respect to securities of the issuer held by each Fund, each Fund also may be restricted from disposing such securities for a period of time. If each Fund becomes involved in such proceedings, each Fund may have more active participation in the
affairs of the issuer than that assumed generally by an investor.</div> <div></div>
<div>Liquidity Risk.<font>  Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are difficult to purchase or sell. To the extent a Fund invests in illiquid investments, such investments may have a negative effect on the returns of the Fund
because the Fund may be unable to sell the illiquid investments at an advantageous time or price.</font></div>
<div>Liquidity Risk Management Rule Risk.<font>  In October 2016, the SEC adopted the Liquidity Rule requiring open-end funds, including exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) such as the Funds, to establish a liquidity risk management program and enhance
disclosures regarding fund liquidity. Effective December 1,</font><font> 2018,</font><font> as required by the Liquidity Rule,</font><font> the Funds have
implemented</font><font> the</font><font> initial</font><font> portions of the Funds'</font><font> Liquidity Program,</font><font> and the Board,</font><font> including a majority of the</font><font> Independent</font><font> Trustees of the Funds has appointed BFA
as the</font><font> liquidity risk program administrator of the Liquidity Program.</font><font> Under</font><font> the Liquidity Program,</font><font> BFA, assesses,</font><font> manages,</font><font> and periodically reviews each Fund’s liquidity risk.</font><font> Certain
aspects of the Liquidity Program have been implemented effective December 1, 2018, while the entire Program will take effect on June 1, 2019. There are exclusions from certain portions of the liquidity risk management program requirements for
“in-kind” ETFs, as defined in the Liquidity Rule.</font></div>
<div>Municipal Market Disruption Risk.<font>  The value of municipal securities may be affected by uncertainties in the municipal market related to legislation or litigation involving the taxation of municipal securities or the rights of municipal securities
holders in the event of a bankruptcy. Proposals to restrict or eliminate the U.S. federal income tax exemption for interest on municipal securities are introduced before the U.S. Congress from time to time. Proposals also may be introduced before
state legislatures that would affect the state tax treatment of a municipal fund’s distributions. If such proposals were enacted,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

 Table of Contents </a> </div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>the availability of municipal securities and the value of a Fund’s
holdings would be affected, and the Trustees would reevaluate the Fund’s investment objective and policies. Municipal bankruptcies are relatively rare, and certain provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code governing such bankruptcies are unclear
and remain untested. Further, the application of state law to municipal issuers could produce varying results among the states or among municipal securities issuers within a state. These legal uncertainties could affect the municipal securities
market generally, certain specific segments of the market, or the relative credit quality of particular securities. Any of these effects could have a significant impact on the prices of some or all of the municipal securities held by a Fund.</div>
<div>Operational Risk.<font>
 BFA and a Fund's other service providers may experience disruptions or operating errors such as processing errors or human errors, inadequate or failed internal or external processes, or systems or technology failures, that could negatively
impact the Funds. While service providers are required to have appropriate operational risk management policies and procedures, their methods of operational risk management may differ from a Fund’s in the setting of priorities, the personnel
and resources available or the effectiveness of relevant controls. BFA, through its monitoring and oversight of service providers, seeks to ensure that service providers take appropriate precautions to avoid and mitigate risks that could lead to
disruptions and operating errors. However, it is not possible for BFA or the other Fund service providers to identify all of the operational risks that may affect a Fund or to develop processes and controls to completely eliminate or mitigate their
occurrence or effects.</font></div> <div>Prepayment Risk.<font>  During periods of falling interest rates, issuers of certain debt obligations may repay principal prior to the security’s maturity, which may cause a Fund to have to reinvest in securities with lower yields
or higher risk of default, resulting in a decline in the Fund’s income or return potential. Also, if a security subject to prepayment had been purchased at a premium, the value of the premium would be lost in the event of
prepayment.</font></div> <div>Quasi-Sovereign Obligations Risk.<font>  The iShares Core International Aggregate Bond ETF and iShares J.P. Morgan USD Emerging Markets Bond ETF may invest in quasi-sovereign debt obligations. An investment in quasi-sovereign debt obligations involves
special risks generally not present in corporation debt obligations. Quasi-sovereign debt includes investments in securities issued or guaranteed by an entity affiliated with/or backed by a sovereign government. Generally, quasi-sovereign debt
obligations are issued by companies in which a government owns a majority of the issuer’s voting shares. They are often considered strategically important to the sovereign entity but do not legally carry sovereign status for purposes of debt
repayment. While certain quasi-sovereign debt issuers have received sovereign government support in the past, such past support is not a guarantee that it will continue in the future. In fact, in the past certain quasi-sovereign debt issuers have
pushed their creditors toward debt restructuring, rather than meeting their payment obligations. Quasi-sovereign debt obligations are typically less liquid and less standardized than sovereign debt obligations.</font></div>
<div>Repurchase Agreement Risk.<font>
 A repurchase agreement is an instrument under which the purchaser (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, a Fund) acquires a security and the seller agrees, at the time of the
sale, to repurchase the security at a mutually agreed upon time and price. Repurchase agreements may be construed to be collateralized loans by the purchaser to the seller secured by the securities transferred to the purchaser. If a repurchase
agreement is construed to be a collateralized loan, the underlying securities will not be considered to be owned by a Fund but only to constitute collateral for the seller’s obligation to pay the repurchase price. If the seller defaults on its
obligation under the agreement, a Fund may suffer delays and incur costs or lose money in exercising its rights under the agreement. If the seller fails to repurchase the security and the market value of the security declines, a Fund may lose
money.</font></div> <div>Risk of Derivatives.<font>  A derivative is a financial contract, the value of which depends on, or is derived from, the value of an underlying asset, such as a security, a commodity (such as gold or silver), a currency or an index (a
measure of value or rates, such as the S&amp;P 500 or the prime lending rate). Certain Funds may invest in variable rate demand notes and obligations, and tender option bonds, which may be considered derivatives. Compared to conventional securities,
derivatives can be more sensitive to changes in interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in market prices and thus a Fund's losses may be greater if it invests in derivatives than if it invests only in conventional securities. Derivatives are also
subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligations. Derivatives generally involve the incurrence of leverage. To address such leverage and to prevent a Fund from being
deemed to have issued senior securities as a result of an investment in derivatives, such Fund will segregate liquid assets equal to its obligations under the derivatives throughout the life of the investment.</font></div>
<div></div>
<div>When a derivative is used as a hedge against
a position that a Fund holds or is committed to purchase, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can</div> </div>

<div>reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains, and in
some cases, hedging can cause losses that are not offset by gains, and the Fund will recognize losses on both the investment and the hedge. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative and the underlying security, and
there can be no assurance that a Fund’s hedging transactions, which entail additional transaction costs, will be effective.</div>
<div>Risk of Futures and Options on Futures Transactions.<font>  There are several risks accompanying the utilization of futures contracts and options on futures contracts. A position in futures contracts and options on futures contracts may be closed only on the exchange on
which the contract was made (or a linked exchange). While each Fund plans to utilize futures contracts only if an active market exists for such contracts, there is no guarantee that a liquid market will exist for the contract at a specified time.
Furthermore, because, by definition, futures contracts project price levels in the future and not current levels of valuation, market circumstances may result in a discrepancy between the price of the bond index future and the movement in the
relevant Underlying Index. In the event of adverse price movements, a Fund would continue to be required to make daily cash payments to maintain its required margin. In such situations, if a Fund has insufficient cash, it may have to sell portfolio
securities to meet daily margin requirements at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. In addition, a Fund may be required to deliver the instruments underlying the futures contracts it has sold.</font></div>
<div></div>
<div>The risk of loss in trading futures
contracts or uncovered call options in some strategies (<font>e.g.</font>, selling uncovered bond index futures contracts) is potentially unlimited. Each Fund does not plan to use futures and options contracts in this way.
The risk of a futures position may still be large as traditionally measured due to the low margin deposits required. In many cases, a relatively small price movement in a futures contract may result in immediate and substantial loss or gain to the
investor relative to the size of a required margin deposit. Each Fund, however, intends to utilize futures and options contracts in a manner designed to limit their risk exposure to levels comparable to a direct investment in the types of bonds in
which it invests.</div> <div>Utilization of futures and
options on futures by a Fund involves the risk of imperfect or even negative correlation to its Underlying Index if the index underlying the futures contract differs from the Underlying Index. There is also the risk of loss by a Fund of margin
deposits in the event of bankruptcy of a broker with whom a Fund has an open position in the futures contract or option. The purchase of put or call options will be based upon predictions by BFA as to anticipated trends, which predictions could
prove to be incorrect.</div> <div>Because the futures market
generally imposes less burdensome margin requirements than the securities market, an increased amount of participation by speculators in the futures market could result in price fluctuations. Certain financial futures exchanges limit the amount of
fluctuation permitted in futures contract prices during a single trading day. The daily limit establishes the maximum amount by which the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day's settlement price at the end of a
trading session. Once the daily limit has been reached in a particular type of contract, no trades may be made on that day at a price beyond that limit. It is possible that futures contract prices could move to the daily limit for several
consecutive trading days with little or no trading, thereby preventing prompt liquidation of futures positions and subjecting each Fund to substantial losses. In the event of adverse price movements, each Fund would be required to make daily cash
payments of variation margin.</div> <div>Risk of Investing in
Non-U.S. Agency Debt Securities.<font>  Certain of the Funds invest in uncollateralized bonds issued by agencies, subdivisions or instrumentalities of foreign governments. Bonds issued by these foreign government
agencies, subdivisions or instrumentalities are generally backed only by the creditworthiness and reputation of the entities issuing the bonds and may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the foreign government. Moreover, a foreign
government that explicitly provides its full faith and credit to a particular entity may be, due to changed circumstances, unable or unwilling to actually provide that support. If a non-U.S. agency is unable to meet its obligations, the performance
of a Fund will be adversely impacted. A non-U.S. agency’s operations and financial condition are influenced by the foreign government’s economic and other policies. Changes to the financial condition or credit rating of a foreign
government may cause the value of debt issued by that particular foreign government’s agencies, subdivisions or instrumentalities to decline. During periods of economic uncertainty, the trading of non-U.S. agency bonds may be less liquid while
market prices may be more volatile than prices of U.S. agency bonds. Additional risks associated with non-U.S. agency investing include differences in accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards, adverse changes in investment or exchange
control regulations, political instability, which could affect U.S. investments in foreign countries and cause restrictions on the flow of international capital.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Risk of Investing in Non-U.S. Debt Securities.<font>  Certain of the Funds may invest in non-U.S. debt securities. An investment in a Fund involves risks associated with investing in a portfolio of debt securities traded on foreign exchanges and OTC in the respective
countries covered by a Fund. These risks typically include market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic and political developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in bond prices. Investing in a fund whose portfolio contains
securities of non-U.S. issuers involves certain risks and considerations not typically associated with investing in the securities of U.S. issuers. These risks include generally less liquid and less efficient securities markets; generally greater
price volatility; less publicly available information about issuers; the imposition of withholding or other taxes; the imposition of restrictions on the expatriation of funds or other assets of a Fund; higher transaction and custody costs; delays
and risks attendant in settlement procedures; difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations; lower liquidity and significantly smaller market capitalization of most non-U.S. securities markets; different accounting and disclosure standards;
lower levels of regulation of the securities markets; more substantial government interference with the economy; higher rates of inflation; greater social, economic, and political uncertainty; the risk of nationalization or expropriation of assets;
and different bankruptcy and insolvency regimes which may stay or prevent recovery in the event of an issuer’s default.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Swap Agreements.<font>
 The risk of loss with respect to swaps is generally limited to the net amount of payments that a Fund is contractually obligated to make. Swap agreements are subject to the risk that the swap counterparty will default on its obligations. If
such a default occurs, a Fund will have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the transaction. However, such remedies may be subject to bankruptcy and insolvency laws, which could affect such Fund’s rights as a creditor
(</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, a Fund may not receive the net amount of payments that it is contractually entitled to receive), which could result in a Fund losing the
benefits of any hedging position.</font></div> <div>A Fund is
required to post and collect variation margin (comprised of specified liquid securities subject to haircuts) in connection with trading of OTC swaps. Implementation of regulations requiring posting of initial margin is being phased in through 2020.
These requirements may raise the costs for a Fund’s investment in swaps.</div>
<div>Supranational Entities Risk.<font>
 Certain of the Funds may invest in obligations issued or guaranteed by supranational entities (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, the World Bank, European Investment Bank,
Inter-American Development Bank, and Asia Development Bank), which are often chartered to promote economic development. The government members, or “stockholders,” usually make initial capital contributions to the supranational entity
and, in many cases, are committed to make additional capital contributions if such entity is unable to repay its borrowings. There is no guarantee that one or more stockholders of the supranational entity will continue to make any necessary
additional capital contributions. If such contributions are not made, the entity may be unable to pay interest or repay principal on its debt securities, certain of the Funds may have limited legal recourse in the event of default, and certain of
the Funds may lose money on such investments.</font></div> <div>U.S.
Treasury Obligations Risk.<font>  Certain of the Funds invest in various types of U.S. Treasury securities. U.S. Treasury obligations may differ from other securities in their interest rates, maturities, times of
issuance and other characteristics. Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial condition or credit rating of the U.S. government may cause the value of U.S. Treasury obligations to decline. U.S. Treasury obligations typically offer lower
interest rates than other obligations. Neither the U.S. government nor any of its agencies or instrumentalities guarantees the market value of the securities it issues.</font></div> <div></div>
<div>The total public debt of the U.S. as a
percent of GDP has grown rapidly since the beginning of the recent financial downturn. Although high debt levels do not necessarily indicate or cause economic problems, they may create systemic risks if sound debt management practices are not
implemented. A high national debt level may increase market pressures to meet government funding needs, which may drive debt cost higher and cause a country to sell additional debt, thereby increasing refinancing risk. A high national debt also
raises concerns that a government will not be able to make principal or interest payments when they are due. In the worst case, unsustainable debt levels can cause a decline in the value of the dollar (which may lead to inflation), and can prevent
the U.S. government from implementing effective counter-cyclical fiscal policy in economic downturns.</div>
<div>On August 5, 2011, S&amp;P Global Ratings downgraded U.S.
Treasury securities from an AAA rating to AA+. A further downgrade of the ratings of U.S. government debt obligations, which are often used as a benchmark for other borrowing arrangements, could result in higher interest rates for individual and
corporate borrowers, cause disruptions in the international bond markets and generally have a substantial negative effect on the U.S. economy. A downgrade of U.S. Treasury securities from another ratings agency or a further downgrade beyond AA+
rating by S&amp;P Global Ratings may cause the value of a Fund's U.S. Treasury obligations to decline.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Valuation Risk.<font>  In
certain circumstances, a Fund’s securities may be valued using techniques other than market quotations. The value established for a security may be different from what would be produced through the use of another methodology or if the value
had been priced using market quotations. Securities that are valued using methods other than market quotations, including “fair valued” securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation in their value from one day to the next than would
be the case if market quotations were used. In addition, there is no assurance that a Fund could sell a security for the value established for it at any time, and it is possible that a Fund could incur a loss if a security is sold for less than its
established value.</font></div> <div></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Africa.<font>  Investments in securities of issuers in certain African countries involve heightened risks including, among others, expropriation and/or nationalization of assets, confiscatory taxation, political instability,
including authoritarian and/or military involvement in governmental decision-making, armed conflict, civil war, and social instability as a result of religious, ethnic and/or socio-economic unrest or widespread outbreaks of disease and, in certain
countries, genocidal warfare.</font></div> <div>Certain
countries in Africa generally have less developed capital markets than traditional emerging market countries, and, consequently, the risks of investing in foreign securities are magnified in such countries. Because securities markets of countries in
Africa are generally underdeveloped and are generally less correlated to global economic cycles than those markets located in more developed countries, securities markets in African countries are subject to greater risks associated with market
volatility, lower market capitalization, lower trading volume, illiquidity, inflation, greater price fluctuations and uncertainty regarding the existence of trading markets. Moreover, trading on African securities markets may be suspended
altogether.</div> <div>Market volatility may also be heightened by
the actions of a small number of investors. Brokerage firms in certain countries in Africa may be fewer in number and less established than brokerage firms in more developed markets. Since a Fund may need to effect securities transactions through
these brokerage firms, the Fund is subject to the risk that these brokerage firms will not be able to fulfill their obligations to the Fund (<font>i.e., </font>counterparty risk). This risk is magnified to the extent that
a Fund effects securities transactions through a single brokerage firm or a small number of brokerage firms.</div>
<div>Certain governments in African countries restrict or control
to varying degrees the ability of foreign investors to invest in securities of issuers located or operating in those countries. Moreover, certain countries in Africa require governmental approval or special licenses prior to investment by foreign
investors and may limit the amount of investment by foreign investors in a particular industry and/or issuer, and may limit such foreign investment to a certain class of securities of an issuer that may have less advantageous rights than the classes
available for purchase by domestic investors of the countries and/or impose additional taxes on foreign investors. A delay in obtaining a government approval or a license would delay investments in a particular country, and, as a result, a Fund may
not be able to invest in certain securities while approval is pending. The government of a particular country may also withdraw or decline to renew a license that enables a Fund to invest in such country. These factors make investing in issuers
located or operating in countries in Africa significantly riskier than investing in issuers located or operating in more developed countries, and any one of these factors could cause a decline in the value of a Fund’s investments. Issuers
located or operating in countries in Africa are generally not subject to the same rules and regulations as issuers located or operating in more developed countries. Therefore, there may be less financial and other information publicly available with
regard to issuers located or operating in countries in Africa and such issuers are generally not subject to the uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards applicable to issuers located or operating in more developed
countries.</div> <div>In addition, governments of certain countries
in Africa in which a Fund may invest may levy withholding or other taxes on income such as dividends, interest and realized capital gains. Although in certain countries in Africa a portion of these taxes are recoverable, the non-recovered portion of
foreign withholding taxes will reduce the income received from investments in such countries.</div>
<div>Investment in countries in Africa may be subject to a greater
degree of risk associated with governmental approval in connection with the repatriation of investment income, capital or the proceeds of sales of securities by foreign investors. In addition, there is the risk that if an African country’s
balance of payments declines, such African country may impose temporary restrictions on foreign capital remittances. Consequently, a Fund could be adversely affected by delays in, or a refusal to grant, required governmental approval for
repatriation of capital, as well as by the application to the Fund of any restrictions on investments. Additionally, investments in countries in Africa may require a Fund to adopt special procedures, seek local government approvals or take other
actions, each of which may involve additional costs to the Fund .</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Securities laws in many countries in Africa are relatively new
and unsettled and, consequently, there is a risk of rapid and unpredictable change in laws regarding foreign investment, securities regulation, title to securities and shareholder rights. Accordingly, foreign investors may be adversely affected by
new or amended laws and regulations. In addition, there may be no single centralized securities exchange on which securities are traded in certain countries in Africa and the systems of corporate governance to which issuers located in countries in
Africa are subject may be less advanced than those systems to which issuers located in more developed countries are subject, and, therefore, shareholders of issuers located in such countries may not receive many of the protections available to
shareholders of issuers located in more developed countries. Even in circumstances where adequate laws and shareholder rights exist, it may not be possible to obtain swift and equitable enforcement of the law. In addition, the enforcement of systems
of taxation at federal, regional and local levels in countries in Africa may be inconsistent and subject to sudden change.</div>
<div>Certain countries in Africa may be heavily dependent upon
international trade and, consequently, have been and may continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values and other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries
with which they trade. These countries also have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade. Certain countries in Africa depend to a significant extent upon exports of primary
commodities such as gold, silver, copper and diamonds. These countries therefore are vulnerable to changes in commodity prices, which may be affected by a variety of factors. In addition, certain issuers located in countries in Africa in which a
Fund invests may operate in, or have dealings with, countries subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations, and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. As a
result, an issuer may sustain damage to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer which operates in, or has dealings with, such countries. A Fund, as an investor in such issuers, will be indirectly subject to those risks.</div>
<div>The governments of certain countries in Africa may exercise
substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic conditions in such countries, which could have a negative impact on
private sector companies. There is also the possibility of diplomatic developments that could adversely affect investments in certain countries in Africa. Some countries in Africa may be affected by a greater degree of public corruption and crime,
including organized crime.</div> <div>Recent political instability
and protests in North Africa and the Middle East have caused significant disruptions to many industries. In addition, the outbreak of Ebola in Western Africa severely challenged health care industries in those countries and adversely impacted the
region’s economy due to quarantines and disruptions of trade, which has further increased instability in the region. This instability has demonstrated that political and social unrest can spread quickly through the region, and that
developments in one country can influence the political events in neighboring countries. Some protests have turned violent, and civil war and political reconstruction in certain countries such as Libya, Iraq and Syria pose a risk to investments in
the region. Continued political and social unrest in these regions, including the ongoing warfare and terrorist activities in the Middle East and Africa, may negatively affect the value of an investment in a Fund.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Asia.<font>
  Investments in securities of issuers in certain Asian countries involve risks not typically associated with investments in securities of issuers in other regions. Such heightened risks include, among others, expropriation and/or
nationalization of assets, confiscatory taxation, piracy of intellectual property, data and other security breaches (especially of data stored electronically), political instability, including authoritarian and/or military involvement in
governmental decision-making, armed conflict and social instability as a result of religious, ethnic and/or socio-economic unrest. Certain Asian economies have experienced rapid rates of economic growth and industrialization in recent years, and
there is no assurance that these rates of economic growth and industrialization will be maintained.</font></div> <div></div>
<div>Certain Asian countries have democracies
with relatively short histories, which may increase the risk of political instability. These countries have faced political and military unrest, and further unrest could present a risk to their local economies and securities markets. Indonesia and
the Philippines have each experienced violence and terrorism, which has negatively impacted their economies. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial military capabilities, and historical tensions between the two countries present the risk
of war. Escalated tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of hostilities between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on the entire Asian region. Certain Asian
countries have also developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. Political, religious, and border disputes persist in
India. India has recently experienced and may continue to experience civil unrest and hostilities</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>with certain of its neighboring countries. Increased political and social
unrest in these geographic areas could adversely affect the performance of investments in this region.</div>
<div>Certain governments in this region administer prices on
several basic goods, including fuel and electricity, within their respective countries. Certain governments may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector in their respective countries and may own or control many
companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic conditions in this region, which in turn could have a negative impact on private sector companies. There is also the possibility of diplomatic developments
adversely affecting investments in the region.</div>
<div>Corruption and the perceived lack of a rule of law in dealings
with international companies in certain Asian countries may discourage foreign investment and could negatively impact the long-term growth of certain economies in this region. In addition, certain countries in the region are experiencing high
unemployment and corruption, and have fragile banking sectors.</div>
<div>Some economies in this region are dependent on a range of
commodities, including oil, natural gas and coal. Accordingly, they are strongly affected by international commodity prices and particularly vulnerable to any weakening in global demand for these products. The market for securities in this region
may also be directly influenced by the flow of international capital, and by the economic and market conditions of neighboring countries. Adverse economic conditions or developments in neighboring countries may increase investors' perception of the
risk of investing in the region as a whole, which may adversely impact the market value of the securities issued by companies in the region.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Australasia.<font>  The economies of Australasia, which include Australia and New Zealand, are dependent on exports from the agricultural and mining sectors. This makes Australasian economies susceptible to fluctuations in the
commodity markets. Australasian economies are also increasingly dependent on their growing service industries. Australia and New Zealand are located in a part of the world that has historically been prone to natural disasters, such as drought and
flooding. Any such event in the future could have a significant adverse impact on the economies of Australia and New Zealand and affect the value of securities held by a relevant Fund. The economies of Australia and New Zealand are dependent on
trading with certain key trading partners, including Asia, Europe and the U.S. The Australia–U.S. Free Trade Agreement has significantly expanded the trading relationship between the U.S. and Australia. Economic events in the U.S., Asia, or in
other key trading countries can have a significant economic effect on the Australian economy. The economies of Australia and New Zealand are heavily dependent on the mining sector. Passage of new regulations limiting foreign ownership of companies
in the mining sector or imposition of new taxes on profits of mining companies may dissuade foreign investment, and as a result, have a negative impact on companies to which a Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Central and South America.<font>  The economies of certain Central and South American countries have experienced high interest rates, economic volatility, inflation, currency devaluations, government defaults, high unemployment rates and political
instability which can adversely affect issuers in these countries. In addition, commodities (such as oil, gas and minerals) represent a significant percentage of exports for the regions and many economies in these regions are particularly sensitive
to fluctuations in commodity prices. Adverse economic events in one country may have a significant adverse effect on other countries of these regions.</font></div>
<div>The governments of certain countries in Central and South
America may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic conditions in such countries, which could have a
negative impact on the securities in which the Fund invests. Diplomatic developments may also adversely affect investments in certain countries in Central and South America. Some countries in Central and South America may be affected by public
corruption and crime, including organized crime.</div> <div></div>
<div>Certain countries in Central and South
America may be heavily dependent upon international trade and, consequently, have been and may continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values and other protectionist measures
imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade. These countries also have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade. In addition, certain issuers located in countries
in Central and South America in which the Fund invests may be the subject of sanctions (for example, the U.S. has imposed sanctions on certain Venezuelan individuals, corporate entities and the Venezuelan government) or have dealings with countries
subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. An issuer may sustain damage to its reputation if it is identified as an
issuer that has dealings with such countries. The Fund may be adversely affected if it invests in such issuers.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries.<font>  Many countries with developed markets have recently experienced significant economic pressures. These countries generally tend to rely on the services sectors (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, the financial services sector) as the primary source of economic growth and may be susceptible to the risks of individual service sectors. For example,
companies in the financial services sector are subject to governmental regulation and, recently, government intervention, which may adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge and amount of capital they must maintain.
Recent dislocations in the financial sector and perceived or actual governmental influence over certain financial companies may lead to credit rating downgrades and, as a result, impact, among other things, revenue growth for such companies. If
financial companies experience a prolonged decline in revenue growth, certain developed countries that rely heavily on financial companies as an economic driver may experience a correlative slowdown. Recently, new concerns have emerged with respect
to the economic health of certain developed countries. These concerns primarily stem from heavy indebtedness of many developed countries and their perceived inability to continue to service high debt loads without simultaneously implementing
stringent austerity measures. Such concerns have led to tremendous downward pressure on the economies of these countries. As a result, it is possible that interest rates on debt of certain developed countries may rise to levels that make it
difficult for such countries to service such debt. Spending on health care and retirement pensions in most developed countries has risen dramatically over the last few years. Medical innovation, extended life expectancy and higher public
expectations are likely to continue the increase in health care and pension costs. Any increase in health care and pension costs will likely have a negative impact on the economic growth of many developed countries. Certain developed countries rely
on imports of certain key items, such as crude oil, natural gas, and other commodities. As a result, an increase in demand for, or price fluctuations of, certain commodities may negatively affect developed country economies. Developed market
countries generally are dependent on the economies of certain key trading partners. Changes in any one economy may cause an adverse impact on several developed countries. In addition, heavy regulation of, among others, labor and product markets may
have an adverse effect on certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause prolonged periods of recession. Such risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of a Fund’s investments.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Eastern Europe.<font>  Investing in the securities of issuers located or operating in Eastern Europe is highly speculative and involves risks not usually associated with investing in the more developed markets of Western Europe.
Political and economic reforms are too recent to establish a definite trend away from centrally planned economies and state-owned industries. In the past, some Eastern European governments have expropriated substantial amounts of private property,
and many claims of the property owners have never been fully settled.</font></div>
<div>Many Eastern European countries continue to move toward market
economies at different paces with different characteristics. Most Eastern European securities markets suffer from thin trading activity, dubious investor protections, and often a dearth of reliable corporate information. Information and transaction
costs, differential taxes, and sometimes political or transfer risk give a comparative advantage to the domestic investor rather than the foreign investor. In addition, these markets are particularly sensitive to social, political, economic, and
currency events in Russia and may suffer heavy losses as a result of their trading and investment links to the Russian economy and currency. Russia also may attempt to assert its influence in the region through economic or even military measures, as
it did with Georgia in the summer of 2008 and Ukraine beginning in 2014. Eastern European economies may also be particularly susceptible to changes in the international credit markets due to their reliance on bank related inflows of capital. The
global economic crisis has restricted international credit supplies, and several Eastern European economies have faced significant credit and economic crises. Although some Eastern European economies are expanding again, major challenges are still
present as a result of their continued dependence on the Western European zone for credit.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets.<font>  Certain of the Funds may invest in securities of issuers domiciled in emerging market countries.  Investments in emerging market countries may be subject to greater risks than investments in developed
countries. These risks include: (i) less social, political, and economic stability; (ii) greater illiquidity and price volatility due to smaller or limited local capital markets for such securities, or low or non-existent trading volumes; (iii)
custodians, clearinghouses, foreign exchanges and broker-dealers may be subject to less scrutiny and regulation by local authorities; (iv) local governments may decide to seize or confiscate securities held by foreign investors and/or local
governments may decide to suspend or limit an issuer's ability to make dividend or interest payments; (v) local governments may limit or entirely restrict repatriation of invested capital, profits, and dividends; (vi) capital gains may be subject to
local taxation, including on a retroactive basis; (vii) issuers facing restrictions on dollar or euro payments imposed by local governments may attempt to make dividend or interest payments to foreign investors in the local currency; (viii)
investors may experience difficulty in enforcing legal claims related to the securities and/or local judges may favor the interests of the issuer over those of foreign investors; (ix) bankruptcy judgments may only be permitted to be paid in the
local currency; (x) limited public</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>information regarding the issuer may result in greater difficulty in
determining market valuations of the securities; and (xi) lack of financial reporting on a regular basis, substandard disclosure and differences in accounting standards may make it difficult to ascertain the financial health of an issuer.</div>
<div>Emerging market securities markets are typically marked by a
high concentration of market capitalization and trading volume in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries, as well as a high concentration of ownership of such securities by a limited number of investors. In addition,
brokerage and other costs associated with transactions in emerging market securities can be higher, sometimes significantly, than similar costs incurred in securities markets in developed countries. Although some emerging markets have become more
established and tend to issue securities of higher credit quality, the markets for securities in other emerging market countries are in the earliest stages of their development, and these countries issue securities across the credit spectrum. Even
the markets for relatively widely traded securities in emerging market countries may not be able to absorb, without price disruptions, a significant increase in trading volume or trades of a size customarily undertaken by institutional investors in
the securities markets of developed countries. The limited size of many of these securities markets can cause prices to be erratic for reasons apart from factors that affect the soundness and competitiveness of the securities issuers. For example,
prices may be unduly influenced by traders who control large positions in these markets. Additionally, market making and arbitrage activities are generally less extensive in such markets, which may contribute to increased volatility and reduced
liquidity of such markets. The limited liquidity of emerging market country securities may also affect a Fund's ability to accurately value its portfolio securities or to acquire or dispose of securities at the price and time it wishes to do so or
in order to meet redemption requests.</div> <div>Many emerging
market countries suffer from uncertainty and corruption in their legal frameworks. Legislation may be difficult to interpret and laws may be too new to provide any precedential value. Laws regarding foreign investment and private property may be
weak or non-existent. Sudden changes in governments may result in policies which are less favorable to investors such as policies designed to expropriate or nationalize “sovereign” assets. Certain emerging market countries in the past
have expropriated large amounts of private property, in many cases with little or no compensation, and there can be no assurance that such expropriation will not occur in the future.</div>
<div>Investment in the securities markets of certain emerging
market countries is restricted or controlled to varying degrees. These restrictions may limit a Fund's investment in certain emerging market countries and may increase the expenses of the Fund. Certain emerging market countries require governmental
approval prior to investments by foreign persons or limit investment by foreign persons to only a specified percentage of an issuer's outstanding securities or a specific class of securities which may have less advantageous terms (including price)
than securities of the company available for purchase by nationals.</div>
<div>Many emerging market countries lack the social, political, and
economic stability characteristic of the U.S. Political instability among emerging market countries can be common and may be caused by an uneven distribution of wealth, social unrest, labor strikes, civil wars, and religious oppression. Economic
instability in emerging market countries may take the form of: (i) high interest rates; (ii) high levels of inflation, including hyperinflation; (iii) high levels of unemployment or underemployment; (iv) changes in government economic and tax
policies, including confiscatory taxation; and (v) imposition of trade barriers.</div>
<div>A Fund's income and, in some cases, capital gains from foreign
securities will be subject to applicable taxation in certain of the emerging market countries in which it invests, and treaties between the U.S. and such countries may not be available in some cases to reduce the otherwise applicable tax
rates.</div> <div>Emerging markets also have different clearance
and settlement procedures, and in certain of these emerging markets there have been times when settlements have been unable to keep pace with the volume of securities transactions, making it difficult to conduct such transactions.</div>
<div>In the past, certain governments in emerging market countries
have become overly reliant on the international capital markets and other forms of foreign credit to finance large public spending programs, which in the past have caused huge budget deficits. Often, interest payments have become too overwhelming
for a government to meet, representing a large percentage of total GDP. These foreign obligations have become the subject of political debate and served as fuel for political parties of the opposition, which pressure the government not to make
payments to foreign creditors, but instead to use these funds for, among other things, social programs. Either due to an inability to pay or submission to political pressure, foreign governments have been forced to seek a restructuring of their loan
and/or bond obligations, have declared a temporary suspension of interest payments or have defaulted. These events have adversely affected the values of securities issued by</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Risk of Investing in Europe.<font>  Investing in European countries may expose a Fund to the economic and political risks associated with Europe in general and the specific European countries in which it invests. The economies and markets of
European countries are often closely connected and interdependent, and events in one European country can have an adverse impact on other European countries. A Fund makes investments in securities of issuers that are domiciled in, or have
significant operations in, member states of the European Union (the “EU”). A number of countries within the EU are also members of the Economic and Monetary Union (the eurozone) and have adopted the euro as</font><font> their</font><font> currency.</font><font> Eurozone membership requires member states to comply with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates, debt
levels and fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every country in Europe. Changes in import or export tariffs, changes in governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro and other
currencies of certain EU countries which are not in the eurozone, the default or threat of default by an EU member state on its sovereign debt, and/or an economic recession in an EU member state may have a significant adverse effect on the economies
of other EU member states and their trading partners. Although certain European countries are not in the eurozone, many of these countries are obliged to meet the criteria for joining the eurozone. Consequently, these countries must comply with many
of the restrictions noted above. The European financial markets have experienced volatility and adverse trends in recent years due to concerns about economic downturns, rising government debt levels and the possible default of government debt in
several European countries, including, but not limited to, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine. In order to prevent further economic deterioration, certain countries, without prior warning, can institute
“capital controls.” Countries may use these controls to restrict volatile movements of capital entering and exiting their country. Such controls may negatively affect a Fund’s investments. A default or debt restructuring by any
European country would adversely impact holders of that country’s debt and sellers of credit default swaps linked to that country’s creditworthiness, which may be located in countries other than those listed above. In addition, the
credit ratings of certain European countries were downgraded in the past. These downgrades may result in further deterioration of investor confidence. These events have adversely affected the value and exchange rate of the euro and may continue to
significantly affect the economies of every country in Europe, including countries that do not use the euro and non-EU member states. Responses to the financial problems by European governments, central banks and others, including austerity measures
and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may result in social unrest and may limit future growth and economic recovery or have other unintended consequences. Further defaults or restructurings by governments and other entities of their debt
could have additional adverse effects on economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The impact of these actions, especially if they occur
in a disorderly fashion, is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely impact the value of a Fund’s investments in the region. In a referendum held on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”)
resolved to leave the EU (“Brexit”). The referendum may introduce significant uncertainties and instability in the financial markets as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the EU. The outcome of negotiations remains uncertain. U.K.
businesses are increasingly preparing for a disorderly Brexit, and the consequences for European and U.K. businesses could be severe. A Fund will face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and consequences that may follow Brexit, including
with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political institutions,
regulatory agencies and financial markets. Brexit could also lead to legal uncertainty and politically divergent national laws and regulations as a new relationship between the U.K. and EU is defined and the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace
or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit could adversely affect any of the companies to which a Fund has exposure and any other assets in which a Fund invests. The political, economic and legal consequences of Brexit are not yet known. In the
short term, financial markets may experience heightened volatility, particularly those in the U.K. and Europe, but possibly worldwide. The U.K. may be less stable than it has been in recent years, and investments in the U.K. may be difficult to
value, or subject to greater or more frequent rises and falls in value. In the longer term, there is likely to be a period of significant political, regulatory and commercial uncertainty as the U.K. seeks to negotiate its long-term exit from the
EU.</font></div> <div>Certain European countries have also
developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect European issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain and the
independence movement in Scotland, as well as governmental or other responses to such movements, may also create instability and uncertainty in the region. In addition, the national politics of countries in the EU have been unpredictable and subject
to influence by varying political groups and ideologies. The governments of EU countries may be subject to change and such countries may experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated or sudden</div> </div>

<div>political or social developments may result in sudden and significant
investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe also could impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely affect the value and liquidity
of a Fund's investments.</div> <div>Risk of Investing in
Frontier Markets.<font>  Investments in frontier market countries may be subject to greater risks than investments in more developed countries. Frontier market countries are subject to similar risks as those of
emerging market countries, but the risks are more pronounced in frontier market countries. These risks include: (i) less social, political, and economic stability; (ii) greater illiquidity and price volatility due to smaller or limited local capital
markets for such securities, or low or non-existent trading volumes; (iii) foreign exchanges and broker-dealers may be subject to less scrutiny and regulation by local authorities; (iv) local governments may decide to seize or confiscate securities
held by foreign investors and/or local governments may decide to suspend or limit an issuer’s ability to make dividend or interest payments; (v) local governments may limit or entirely restrict repatriation of invested capital, profits, and
dividends; (vi) capital gains may be subject to local taxation, including on a retroactive basis; (vii) issuers facing restrictions on U.S. dollar or euro payments imposed by local governments may attempt to make dividend or interest payments to
foreign investors in the local currency; (viii) investors may experience difficulty in enforcing legal claims related to the securities and/or local judges may favor the interests of the issuer over those of foreign investors; (ix) bankruptcy
judgments may only be permitted to be paid in the local currency; (x) limited public information regarding the issuer may result in greater difficulty in determining market valuations of the securities; and (xi) lax financial reporting on a regular
basis, substandard disclosure and differences in accounting standards may make it difficult to ascertain the financial health of an issuer.</font></div>
<div>Frontier market securities markets are typically marked by a
high concentration of market capitalization and trading volume in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries, as well as a high concentration of ownership of such securities by a limited number of investors. In addition,
brokerage and other costs associated with transactions in frontier securities markets can be higher, sometimes significantly, than similar costs incurred in securities markets in developed countries. The markets for securities in certain frontier
countries are in the earliest stages of their development, and these countries issue securities across the credit spectrum. Even the markets for relatively widely traded securities in frontier countries may not be able to absorb, without price
disruptions, a significant increase in trading volume or trades of a size customarily undertaken by institutional investors in the securities markets of developed countries. The limited size of many of these securities markets can cause prices to be
erratic for reasons apart from factors that affect the soundness and competitiveness of the securities issuers. For example, prices may be unduly influenced by traders who control large positions in these markets. Additionally, market making and
arbitrage activities are generally less extensive in such markets, which may contribute to increased volatility and reduced liquidity of such markets. The limited liquidity of frontier country securities may also affect a Fund’s ability to
accurately value its portfolio securities or to acquire or dispose of securities at the price and time it wishes to do so or in order to meet redemption requests.</div>
<div>Many frontier market countries suffer from uncertainty and
corruption in their legal frameworks. Legislation may be difficult to interpret and laws may be too new to provide any precedential value. Laws regarding foreign investment and private property may be weak or non-existent. Sudden changes in
governments may result in policies which are less favorable to investors such as policies designed to expropriate or nationalize “sovereign” assets. Certain frontier market countries in the past have expropriated large amounts of private
property, in many cases with little or no compensation, and there can be no assurance that such expropriation will not occur in the future.</div>
<div>Foreign investment in the securities markets of certain
frontier countries is restricted or controlled to varying degrees. These restrictions may limit a Fund’s investment in certain frontier countries and may increase the expenses of the Fund. Certain frontier countries require governmental
approval prior to investments by foreign persons or limit investment by foreign persons to only a specified percentage of an issuer’s outstanding securities or a specific class of securities which may have less advantageous terms (including
price) than securities of the company available for purchase by nationals.</div>
<div>Many frontier market countries lack the social, political, and
economic stability characteristic of the U.S. and other developed countries. Political instability among frontier market countries can be common and may be caused by an uneven distribution of wealth, social unrest, labor strikes, civil wars, and
religious oppression. Economic instability in frontier market countries may take the form of: (i) high interest rates; (ii) high levels of inflation, including hyperinflation; (iii) high levels of unemployment or underemployment; (iv) changes in
government economic and tax policies, including confiscatory taxation; and (v) imposition of trade barriers.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>A Fund’s income and, in some cases, capital gains from
foreign securities will be subject to applicable taxation in certain of the frontier market countries in which it invests, and treaties between the U.S. and such countries may not be available in some cases to reduce the otherwise applicable tax
rates.</div> <div>Frontier markets also have different clearance
and settlement procedures, and in certain of these frontier markets there have been times when settlements have been unable to keep pace with the volume of securities transactions, making it difficult to conduct such transactions.</div>
<div>In the past, governments within the frontier markets have
become overly reliant on the international capital markets and other forms of foreign credit to finance large public spending programs, which in the past have caused huge budget deficits. Often, interest payments have become too overwhelming for a
government to meet, representing a large percentage of total GDP. These foreign obligations have become the subject of political debate and served as fuel for political parties of the opposition, which pressure the government not to make payments to
foreign creditors, but instead to use these funds for, among other things, social programs. Either due to an inability to pay or submission to political pressure, foreign governments have been forced to seek a restructuring of their loan and/or bond
obligations, have declared a temporary suspension of interest payments or have defaulted. These events have adversely affected the values of securities issued by foreign governments and corporations domiciled in those countries and have negatively
affected not only their cost of borrowing, but their ability to borrow in the future as well.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Japan.<font>
 Japan may be subject to political, economic, nuclear, labor and other risks. Any of these risks, individually or in the aggregate, can impact an investment made in Japan.</font></div>
<div>Economic Risk<font>. The growth of
Japan’s economy has recently lagged that of its Asian neighbors and other major developed economies. Since 2000, Japan’s economic growth rate has generally remained low relative to other advanced economies, and it may remain low in the
future. The Japanese economy is heavily dependent on international trade and has been adversely affected by trade tariffs, other protectionist measures, competition from emerging economies and the economic conditions of its trading partners. Japan
is also heavily dependent on oil imports, and higher commodity prices could therefore have a negative impact on the Japanese economy.</font></div>
<div>Political Risk<font>. Historically,
Japan has had unpredictable national politics and may experience frequent political turnover. Future political developments may lead to changes in policy that might adversely affect a Fund’s investments. In addition, China has become an
important trading partner with Japan. Japan’s political relationship with China, however, has been strained. Should political tension increase, it could adversely affect the Japanese economy and destabilize the region as a whole.</font></div>
<div></div>
<div>Large Government and Corporate Debt Risk<font>. The Japanese economy faces several concerns, including a financial system with large levels of nonperforming loans, over-leveraged corporate balance sheets, extensive cross-ownership by major corporations, a changing
corporate governance structure, and large government deficits. These issues may cause a slowdown of the Japanese economy.</font></div>
<div>Currency Risk<font>. The Japanese
yen has fluctuated widely at times and any increase in its value may cause a decline in exports that could weaken the Japanese economy. Japan has, in the past, intervened in the currency markets to attempt to maintain or reduce the value of the yen.
Japanese intervention in the currency markets could cause the value of the yen to fluctuate sharply and unpredictably and could cause losses to investors.</font></div>
<div>Nuclear Energy Risk. <font>The
nuclear power plant catastrophe in Japan in March 2011 may have long-term effects on the Japanese economy and its nuclear energy industry, the extent of which are currently unknown.</font></div>
<div>Labor Risk<font>. Japan has an
aging workforce and has experienced a significant population decline in recent years. Japan’s labor market appears to be undergoing fundamental structural changes, as a labor market traditionally accustomed to lifetime employment adjusts to
meet the need for increased labor mobility, which may adversely affect Japan’s economic competitiveness.</font></div>
<div>Geographic Risk<font>. Natural
disasters, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, typhoons and tsunamis, could occur in Japan or surrounding areas and could negatively affect the Japanese economy, and, in turn, could negatively affect a Fund.</font></div> </div>

<div>Risk of Investing in the Middle East.<font>  Many Middle Eastern countries have little or no democratic tradition, and the political and legal systems in such countries may have an adverse impact on a Fund. Many economies in the Middle East are highly
reliant on income from the sale of oil or trade with countries involved in the sale of oil, and their economies are therefore vulnerable to changes in the market for oil and foreign currency values. As global demand for oil fluctuates, many Middle
Eastern economies may be significantly impacted.</font></div>
<div>In addition, many Middle Eastern governments have exercised
and continue to exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector. In certain cases, a Middle Eastern country’s government may own or control many companies, including some of the largest companies in the country.
Accordingly, governmental actions in the future could have a significant effect on economic conditions in Middle Eastern countries. This could affect private sector companies and a Fund, as well as the value of securities in a Fund's
portfolio.</div> <div>Certain Middle Eastern markets are in the
earliest stages of development. As a result, there may be a high concentration of market capitalization and trading volume in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries, as well as a high concentration of investors and
financial intermediaries. Brokers in Middle Eastern countries typically are fewer in number and less capitalized than brokers in the U.S.</div>
<div>The legal systems in certain Middle Eastern countries also may
have an adverse impact on a Fund. For example, the potential liability of a shareholder in a U.S. corporation with respect to acts of the corporation generally is limited to the amount of the shareholder’s investment. However, the notion of
limited liability is less clear in certain Middle Eastern countries. Each Fund therefore may be liable in certain Middle Eastern countries for the acts of a corporation in which it invests for an amount greater than its actual investment in that
corporation. Similarly, the rights of investors in Middle Eastern issuers may be more limited than those of shareholders of a U.S. corporation. It may be difficult or impossible to obtain or enforce a legal judgment in a Middle Eastern country. Some
Middle Eastern countries prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on investments in their capital markets, particularly their equity markets, by foreign entities such as a Fund. For example, certain countries may require governmental approval
prior to investment by foreign persons or limit the amount of investment by foreign persons in a particular issuer. Certain Middle Eastern countries may also limit investment by foreign persons to only a specific class of securities of an issuer
that may have less advantageous terms (including price) than securities of the issuer available for purchase by nationals of the relevant Middle Eastern country.</div>
<div>The manner in which foreign investors may invest in companies
in certain Middle Eastern countries, as well as limitations on those investments, may have an adverse impact on the operations of a Fund. For example, in certain of these countries, a Fund may be required to invest initially through a local broker
or other entity and then have the shares that were purchased re-registered in the name of a Fund. Re-registration in some instances may not be possible on a timely basis. This may result in a delay during which a Fund may be denied certain of its
rights as an investor, including rights as to dividends or to be made aware of certain corporate actions. There also may be instances where a Fund places a purchase order but is subsequently informed, at the time of re-registration, that the
permissible allocation of the investment to foreign investors has already been filled and, consequently, a Fund may not be able to invest in the relevant company.</div>
<div>Substantial limitations may exist in certain Middle Eastern
countries with respect to a Fund’s ability to repatriate investment income or capital gains. A Fund could be adversely affected by delays in, or a refusal to grant, any required governmental approval for repatriation of capital, as well as by
the application to a Fund of any restrictions on investment.</div>
<div>Certain Middle Eastern countries may be heavily dependent upon
international trade and, consequently, have been and may continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values and other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries
with which they trade. These countries also have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade. In addition, certain issuers located in Middle Eastern countries in which a Fund invests
may operate in, or have dealings with, countries subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations, and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer
may sustain damage to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer which operates in, or has dealings with, such countries. A Fund, as an investor in such issuers, will be indirectly subject to those risks.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Certain Middle Eastern countries have
strained relations with other Middle Eastern countries due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, international alliances, defense concerns or other reasons, which may adversely affect the economies of these Middle Eastern countries.
Certain Middle Eastern countries experience significant unemployment, as well as widespread underemployment. There has also been a recent increase in recruitment efforts and an aggressive push for</div> </div>

<div>territorial control by terrorist groups in the region, which has led to an
outbreak of warfare and hostilities. Warfare in Syria has spread to surrounding areas, including many portions of Iraq and Turkey. Such hostilities may continue into the future or may escalate at any time due to ethnic, racial, political, religious
or ideological tensions between groups in the region or foreign intervention or lack of intervention, among other factors.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in North America.<font>  A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations or an economic recession in any North American country can have a significant economic effect on the entire North American region and on some or all
of the North American countries in which a Fund invests.</font></div> <div></div>
<div>The U.S. is Canada's and Mexico's largest
trading and investment partner. The Canadian and Mexican economies are significantly affected by developments in the U.S. economy. Since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) in 1994 among Canada, the
U.S. and Mexico, total merchandise trade among the three countries has increased. However, political developments in the U.S., including renegotiation of NAFTA and imposition of tariffs by the U.S., may have implications for the trade arrangements
among the U.S., Mexico and Canada, which could negatively affect the value of securities held by a Fund. Policy and legislative changes in one country may have a significant effect on North American markets generally, as well as on the value of
certain securities held by a Fund.</div> <div>Risk of
Investing in Russia.<font>  Investing in the Russian securities market involves a high degree of risk and special considerations not typically associated with investing in the U.S. securities market, and should be
considered highly speculative. Risks include: the absence of developed legal structures governing private and foreign investments and private property; the possibility of the loss of all or a substantial portion of a Fund’s assets invested in
Russia as a result of expropriation; certain national policies which may restrict the Fund’s investment opportunities, including, without limitation, restrictions on investing in issuers or industries deemed sensitive to relevant national
interests; and potentially greater price volatility in, significantly smaller capitalization of, and relative illiquidity of, the Russian market. There can also be no assurance that a Fund’s investments in the Russian securities market would
not be expropriated, nationalized or otherwise confiscated. In the event of the settlement of any such claims or such expropriation, nationalization or other confiscation, a Fund could lose its entire investment. In addition, it may be difficult and
more costly to obtain and enforce a judgment in the Russian court system.</font></div>
<div>Russia may also be subject to a greater degree of economic,
political and social instability than is the case in other developed countries. Such instability may result from, among other things, the following: (i) an authoritarian government or military involvement in political and economic decision-making,
including changes in government through extra-constitutional means; (ii) popular unrest associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions; (iii) internal insurgencies; (iv) hostile relations with neighboring countries;
and (v) ethnic, religious and racial disaffection.</div> <div>The
Russian economy is heavily dependent upon the export of a range of commodities including most industrial metals, forestry products and oil and gas. Accordingly, it is strongly affected by international commodity prices and is particularly vulnerable
to any weakening in global demand for these products. Any acts of terrorism or armed conflicts in Russia or internationally could have an adverse effect on the financial and commodities markets and the global economy. As Russia produces and exports
large amounts of crude oil and gas, any acts of terrorism or armed conflict causing disruptions of Russian oil and gas exports could negatively affect the Russian economy and, thus, adversely affect the financial condition, results of operations or
prospects of related companies. Current and future economic sanctions may also adversely affect the Russian oil, banking, mining, metals, rail, pipeline and gas sectors, among other sectors.</div>
<div>The Russian government may exercise substantial influence over
many aspects of the private sector and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic conditions in Russia, which could have a negative impact on private sector companies. There is also
the possibility of diplomatic developments that could adversely affect investments in Russia. In recent years, the Russian government has begun to take bolder steps to re-assert its regional geopolitical influence (including military steps). Such
steps may increase tensions between Russia and its neighbors and Western countries and may negatively affect economic growth. </div> <div></div>
<div>Russia Sanctions.<font> The U.S. and the Economic and Monetary Union of the EU, along with the regulatory bodies of a number of countries including Japan, Australia, Norway, Switzerland and Canada (collectively, “Sanctioning
Bodies”), have imposed economic sanctions, which consist of prohibiting certain securities trades, prohibiting certain private transactions in the energy sector, asset freezes and prohibition of all business, against certain Russian
individuals and Russian corporate entities. The Sanctioning Bodies could also institute broader sanctions on Russia. These sanctions, or even the threat of further sanctions, may result in the decline of the value and liquidity of Russian
securities, a weakening of the ruble or other adverse</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>consequences to the Russian economy. These sanctions could also result in the
immediate freeze of Russian securities and/or funds invested in prohibited assets, impairing the ability of a Fund to buy, sell, receive or deliver those securities and/or assets. Additional sanctions against Russia have been, and may in the future
be, imposed by the U.S. or other countries. </div> <div></div>
<div>The sanctions against certain Russian
issuers include prohibitions on transacting in or dealing in issuances of debt or equity of such issuers. Compliance with each of these sanctions may impair the ability of a Fund to buy, sell, hold, receive or deliver the affected securities or
other securities of such issuers. If it becomes impracticable or unlawful for a Fund to hold securities subject to, or otherwise affected by, sanctions (collectively, “affected securities”), or if deemed appropriate by BFA, a Fund may
prohibit in-kind deposits of the affected securities in connection with creation transactions and instead require a cash deposit, which may also increase a Fund's transaction costs. A Fund may also be legally required to freeze assets in a blocked
account.</div> <div>Also, if an affected security is
included in a Fund's Underlying Index, a Fund may, where practicable, seek to eliminate its holdings of the affected security by employing or augmenting its representative sampling strategy to seek to track the investment results of its Underlying
Index. The use of (or increased use of) a representative sampling strategy may increase a Fund’s tracking error risk. If the affected securities constitute a significant percentage of the Underlying Index, a Fund may not be able to effectively
implement a representative sampling strategy, which may result in significant tracking error between a Fund’s performance and the performance of its Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Current or future sanctions may result in Russia taking
counter measures or retaliatory actions, which may further impair the value and liquidity of Russian securities. These retaliatory measures may include the immediate freeze of Russian assets held by a Fund. In the event of such a freeze of any Fund
assets, including depositary receipts, a Fund may need to liquidate non-restricted assets in order to satisfy any Fund redemption orders. The liquidation of Fund assets during this time may also result in a Fund receiving substantially lower prices
for its securities.</div> <div></div>
<div>These sanctions may also lead to changes in
a Fund’s Underlying Index. A Fund’s index provider may remove securities from its Underlying Index or implement caps on the securities of certain issuers that have been subject to recent economic sanctions. In such an event, it is
expected that a Fund will rebalance its portfolio to bring it in line with its Underlying Index as a result of any such changes, which may result in transaction costs and increased tracking error. These sanctions, the volatility that may result in
the trading markets for Russian securities and the possibility that Russia may impose investment or currency controls on investors may cause a Fund to invest in, or increase a Fund’s investments in, depositary receipts that represent the
securities of its Underlying Index. These investments may result in increased transaction costs and increased tracking error.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the U.S.<font>
 The Funds have significant exposure to U.S. issuers. A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations and/or an economic recession in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed on
U.S. exchanges. Policy and legislative changes in the U.S. are changing many aspects of financial and other regulation and may have a significant effect on the U.S. markets generally, as well as on the value of certain securities. In addition, a
continued rise in the U.S. public debt level or U.S. austerity measures may adversely affect U.S. economic growth and the securities to which a Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>The U.S. has developed increasingly strained relations with a
number of foreign countries. If these relations were to worsen, it could adversely affect U.S. issuers as well as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also experienced increased internal unrest and discord. If this trend
were to continue, it may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and many of the issuers in which a Fund invests.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in
Venezuela.<font>  Investments in Venezuela may subject a Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, expropriation and/or nationalization of assets and economic risk specific to Venezuela. Venezuela is
extremely well endowed with natural resources and its economy is heavily dependent on export of natural resources to key trading partners. According to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”), Venezuela boasts the
world’s largest oil reserves. According to an industry report, Venezuela also has the continent’s largest natural gas reserves at an estimated 152 trn cubic meters. Any act of terrorism, an armed conflict or a breakdown of a key trading
relationship that disrupts the production or export of natural resources will likely negatively affect the Venezuelan economy. The investment environment in Venezuela has been severely undermined by nationalist policies under the government of
President Hugo Chavez. The government continues to control key sectors of the economy, including upstream oil and gas production, and has sought to increase its role in key sectors, such as telecommunications and steel. Meanwhile, ambiguities in the
investment environment remain,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>such as continued high levels of bureaucracy and corruption, large
macroeconomic imbalances, and political and policy uncertainty. Friction continues between the governments of the United States and Venezuela. The U.S. has imposed economic sanctions, which consist of asset freezes and sectoral sanctions, on certain
Venezuelan individuals and Venezuelan corporate entities, and on the Venezuelan government. The U.S. could also institute broader sanctions on Venezuela. These sanctions, or even the threat of further sanctions, may result in the decline of the
value and liquidity of Venezuelan securities, a weakening of the bolivar or other adverse consequences to the Venezuelan economy. These sanctions impair the ability of a Fund to buy, sell, receive or deliver those securities and/or assets.
Additional sanctions against Venezuela may in the future be imposed by the U.S. or other countries. These factors, among others, can have a negative impact on a Fund’s investments.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Automotive Sub-Industry.<font>  The automotive sub-industry can be highly cyclical, and companies in the automotive sub-industry may suffer periodic losses. The automotive sub-industry is also highly competitive and there may be, at times,
excess capacity in the global and domestic automotive sub-industry. Over the last several decades, the U.S. automotive sub-industry has experienced periodic downturns; certain automotive companies required stimulus from the U.S. government, while
others formed strategic industry alliances in order to weather the substantially difficult market conditions. In general, the automotive sub-industry is susceptible to labor disputes, product defect litigation, patent expiration, increased pension
liabilities, rise in material or component prices and changing consumer tastes.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Basic Materials Industry.<font>  Issuers in the basic materials industry could be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, exchange rates, import controls and increased competition. Companies in the basic materials industry may be
subject to swift fluctuations in supply and demand. Fluctuations may be caused by events relating to political and economic developments, the environmental impact of basic materials operations, and the success of exploration projects. Production of
industrial materials often exceeds demand as a result of over-building or economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns. Issuers in the basic materials industry are at risk for environmental damage and product liability claims and may be
adversely affected by depletion of resources, delays in technical progress, labor relations, tax and government regulations related to changes to, among other things, energy and environmental policies.</font></div>
<div></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Capital Goods
Industry.<font>  Companies in the capital goods industry may be affected by fluctuations in the business cycle and by other factors affecting manufacturing demands. Companies in the capital goods industry depend
heavily on corporate spending. Companies in the capital goods industry may perform well during times of economic expansion, and as economic conditions worsen, the demand for capital goods may decrease due to weakening demand, worsening business cash
flows, tighter credit controls and deteriorating profitability. During times of economic volatility, corporate spending may fall and adversely affect the capital goods industry. This industry may also be affected by changes in interest rates,
corporate tax rates and other government policies. Many capital goods are sold internationally and such companies are subject to market conditions in other countries and regions.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Communication Services Sector.<font>  The communication services sector of a country’s economy is often subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with governmental regulations, delays or failure to receive required
regulatory approvals, or the enactment of new regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of communications companies. Government actions around the world, specifically in the area of pre-marketing clearance of products and prices,
can be arbitrary and unpredictable. Companies in the communication services sector may encounter distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition, particularly in developing new products and services
using new technology. Technological innovations may make the products and services of certain communications companies obsolete.</font></div>
<div>The domestic telecommunications market is characterized by
increasing competition and regulation by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission and various state regulatory authorities. Telecommunications providers are generally required to obtain franchises or licenses in order to provide services in a
given location. Licensing and franchise rights in the telecommunications sector are limited, which may provide an advantage to certain participants. Limited availability of such rights, high barriers to market entry and regulatory oversight, among
other factors, have led to consolidation of companies within the sector, which could lead to further regulation or other negative effects in the future.</div>
<div>Companies in the media and entertainment industries (<font>e.g.</font>, companies engaged in television or radio broadcasting, publishing, motion pictures, music by recording artists, casinos, and recreation and amusement businesses) can be significantly affected by several
factors, including competition, particularly in formulation products and services using new technologies, cyclicality of revenues and earnings, a potential decrease in the discretionary income of targeted individuals, changing consumer tastes and
interests, and the potential increase in state and federal government regulation. Companies in</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>the media and entertainment industries may become obsolete quickly.
Advertising spending can be an important revenue source for media and entertainment companies. During economic downturns advertising spending typically decreases and, as a result, media and entertainment companies tend to generate less
revenue.</div> <div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Cyclical
Industry.<font>  A Fund may invest in consumer cyclical companies, which rely heavily on business cycles and economic conditions. Consumer cyclical companies include automotive manufacturers, retail companies, and
housing-related companies. The consumer cyclical industry can be significantly affected by several factors, including, without limitation, the performance of domestic and international economies, exchange rates, changing consumer tastes and trends,
marketing campaigns, cyclical revenue generation, consumer confidence, commodity price volatility, labor relations, interest rates, import and export controls, intense competition, technological developments and government regulation.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Discretionary Sector.<font>  Companies engaged in the design, production or distribution of products or services for the consumer discretionary sector (including, without limitation, television and radio broadcasting, manufacturing,
publishing, recording and musical instruments, motion pictures, photography, amusement and theme parks, gaming casinos, sporting goods and sports arenas, camping and recreational equipment, toys and games, apparel, travel-related services,
automobiles, hotels and motels, and fast food and other restaurants) are subject to the risk that their products or services may become obsolete quickly. The success of these companies can depend heavily on disposable household income and consumer
spending. During periods of an expanding economy, the consumer discretionary sector may outperform the consumer staples sector, but may underperform when economic conditions worsen. Moreover, the consumer discretionary sector can be significantly
affected by several factors, including, without limitation, the performance of domestic and international economies, exchange rates, changing consumer preferences, demographics, marketing campaigns, cyclical revenue generation, consumer confidence,
commodity price volatility, labor relations, interest rates, import and export controls, intense competition, technological developments and government regulation.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Goods Industry.<font>  Companies in the consumer goods industry include companies involved in the design, production or distribution of goods for consumers, including food, household, home, personal and office products, clothing and
textiles. The success of the consumer goods industry is tied closely to the performance of the domestic and international economy, interest rates, exchange rates, competition, consumer confidence and consumer disposable income. The consumer goods
industry may be affected by trends, marketing campaigns and other factors affecting consumer demand. Governmental regulation affecting the use of various food additives may affect the profitability of certain companies in the consumer goods
industry. Moreover, international events may affect food and beverage companies that derive a substantial portion of their net income from foreign countries. In addition, tobacco companies may be adversely affected by new laws, regulations and
litigation. Many consumer goods may be marketed globally, and consumer goods companies may be affected by the demand and market conditions in other countries and regions. Companies in the consumer goods industry may be subject to severe competition,
which may also have an adverse impact on their profitability. Changes in demographics and consumer preferences may affect the success of consumer products.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Services Industry.<font>  The success of consumer product manufacturers and retailers (including food and drug retailers, general retailers, media, and travel and leisure) is tied closely to the performance of the domestic and
international economy, interest rates, exchange rates, competition and consumer confidence. The consumer services industry depends heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending. Companies in the consumer services industry may be
subject to severe competition, which may also have an adverse impact on their profitability. Changes in demographics and consumer preferences may affect the success of consumer service providers.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Staples Sector.<font>  Companies in the consumer staples sector may be adversely affected by changes in the global economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, and production spending. Companies in the
consumer staples sector may also be affected by changes in global economic, environmental and political events, economic conditions, the depletion of resources, and government regulation. For instance, government regulations may affect the
permissibility of using various food additives and production methods of companies that make food products, which could affect company profitability. In addition, tobacco companies may be adversely affected by the adoption of proposed legislation
and/or by litigation. Companies in the consumer staples sector also may be subject to risks pertaining to the supply of, demand for and prices of raw materials. The prices of raw materials fluctuate in response to a</font></div> </div>

<div>number of factors, including, without limitation, changes in government
agricultural support programs, exchange rates, import and export controls, changes in international agricultural and trading policies, and seasonal and weather conditions. Companies in the consumer staples sector may be subject to severe
competition, which may also have an adverse impact on their profitability.</div> <div></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Electric Utilities
Sector.<font>  The electric utility industry consists of companies that are engaged principally in the generation, transmission and sale of electric energy, although many also provide other energy-related services.
In the past, electric utility companies, in general, have been favorably affected by lower fuel and financing costs and the full or near completion of major construction programs. In addition, many of these companies have generated cash flows in
excess of current operating expenses and construction expenditures, permitting some degree of diversification into unregulated businesses. Some electric utilities have also taken advantage of the right to sell power outside of their traditional
geographic areas. Electric utility companies have historically been subject to the risks associated with increases in fuel and other operating costs, high interest costs on borrowings needed for capital construction programs, costs associated with
compliance with environmental and safety regulations and changes in the regulatory climate. As interest rates declined, many utilities refinanced high cost debt and in doing so improved their fixed charges coverage. Regulators, however, lowered
allowed rates of return as interest rates declined and thereby caused the benefits of the rate declines to be shared wholly or in part with customers. In a period of rising interest rates, the allowed rates of return may not keep pace with the
utilities’ increased costs. The construction and operation of nuclear power facilities are subject to strict scrutiny by, and evolving regulations of, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and state agencies which have comparable jurisdiction.
Strict scrutiny might result in higher operating costs and higher capital expenditures, with the risk that the regulators may disallow inclusion of these costs in rate authorizations or the risk that a company may not be permitted to operate or
complete construction of a facility. In addition, operators of nuclear power plants may be subject to significant costs for disposal of nuclear fuel and for decommissioning such plants.</font></div>
<div>The rating agencies look closely at the business profile of
utility companies. Ratings for companies are expected to be impacted to a greater extent in the future by the division of their asset base. Electric utility companies that focus more on the generation of electricity may be assigned less favorable
ratings as this business is expected to be competitive and the least regulated. On the other hand, companies that focus on transmission and distribution, which is expected to be the least competitive and the more regulated part of the business, may
see higher ratings given the greater predictability of cash flow.</div>
<div>A number of states are considering or have enacted
deregulation proposals. The introduction of competition into the industry as a result of such deregulation has at times resulted in lower revenue, lower credit ratings, increased default risk, and lower electric utility security prices. Such
increased competition may also cause long-term contracts, which electric utilities previously entered into to buy power, to become “stranded assets” which have no economic value. Any loss associated with such contracts must be absorbed
by ratepayers and investors. In addition, some electric utilities have acquired electric utilities overseas to diversify, enhance earnings and gain experience in operating in a deregulated environment. In some instances, such acquisitions have
involved significant borrowings, which have burdened the acquirer’s balance sheet. There is no assurance that current deregulation proposals will be adopted. However, deregulation in any form could significantly impact the electric utilities
industry.</div> <div>Risk of Investing in the Energy Sector.<font>  Companies in the energy sector are strongly affected by the levels and volatility of global energy prices, energy supply and demand, government regulations and policies, energy production and conservation efforts,
technological change, development of alternative energy sources, and other factors that they cannot control. These companies may also lack resources and have limited business lines. Energy companies may have relatively high levels of debt and may be
more likely to restructure their businesses if there are downturns in certain energy markets or in the global economy. If an energy company in a Fund's portfolio becomes distressed, a Fund could lose all or a substantial portion of its
investment.</font></div> <div>The energy sector is
cyclical and is highly dependent on commodity prices; prices and supplies of energy may fluctuate significantly over short and long periods of time due to, among other things, national and international political changes, Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) policies, changes in relationships among OPEC members and between OPEC and oil-importing nations, the regulatory environment, taxation policies, and the economy of the key energy-consuming countries.
Commodity prices have recently been subject to increased volatility and declines, which may negatively affect companies in which a Fund invests.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Companies in the energy sector may be adversely affected by
terrorism, natural disasters or other catastrophes. Companies in the energy sector are at risk of civil liability from accidents resulting in injury, loss of life or property, pollution or other environmental damage claims. Disruptions in the oil
industry or shifts in fuel consumption may significantly impact companies in this sector. Significant oil and gas deposits are located in emerging markets countries where corruption and security may raise significant risks, in addition to the other
risks of investing in emerging markets. Additionally, the Middle East, where many companies in the energy sector may operate, has historically and recently experienced widespread social unrest.</div>
<div>Companies in the energy sector may also be adversely affected
by changes in exchange rates, interest rates, economic conditions, tax treatment, government regulation and intervention, negative perception, efforts at energy conservation and world events in the regions in which the companies operate (<font>e.g.,</font> expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest, violence or labor
unrest). Because a significant portion of revenues of companies in this sector is derived from a relatively small number of customers that are largely composed of governmental entities and utilities, governmental budget constraints may have a
significant impact on the stock prices of companies in this sector. The energy sector is highly regulated. Entities operating in the energy sector are subject to significant regulation of nearly every aspect of their operations by federal, state and
local governmental agencies. Such regulation can change rapidly or over time in both scope and intensity. Stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be enacted in the future which would likely increase compliance costs and may
materially adversely affect the financial performance of companies in the energy sector.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Financials Sector.<font>  Companies in the financials sector include regional and money center banks, securities brokerage firms, asset management companies, savings banks and thrift institutions, specialty finance companies (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, credit card, mortgage providers), insurance and insurance brokerage firms, consumer finance firms, financial conglomerates and foreign banking and
financial companies.</font></div> <div>Most financial companies are
subject to extensive governmental regulation, which limits their activities and may affect their ability to earn a profit from a given line of business. Government regulation may change frequently and may have significant adverse consequences for
companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by the regulation. Direct governmental intervention in the operations of financial companies and financial markets may materially and adversely affect the companies in which a Fund
invests, including legislation in many countries that may increase government regulation, repatriation and other intervention. The impact of governmental intervention and legislative changes on any individual financial company or on the financials
sector as a whole cannot be predicted. The valuation of financial companies has been and continues to be subject to unprecedented volatility and may be influenced by unpredictable factors, including interest rate risk and sovereign debt default.
Certain financial businesses are subject to intense competitive pressures, including market share and price competition. Financial companies in foreign countries are subject to market specific and general regulatory and interest rate concerns. In
particular, government regulation in certain foreign countries may include taxes and controls on interest rates, credit availability, minimum capital requirements, bans on short sales, limits on prices and restrictions on currency transfers. In
addition, companies in the financials sector may be the targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or customer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</div>
<div>The profitability of banks, savings and loan associations and
financial companies is largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change; for instance, when interest rates go up, the value of securities issued by many types of companies in
the financials sector generally goes down. In other words, financial companies may be adversely affected in certain market cycles, including, without limitation, during periods of rising interest rates, which may restrict the availability and
increase the cost of capital, and during periods of declining economic conditions, which may cause, among other things, credit losses due to financial difficulties of borrowers.</div>
<div>In addition, general economic conditions are important to the
operations of these companies, and financial difficulties of borrowers may have an adverse effect on the profitability of financial companies. Financial companies can be highly dependent upon access to capital markets, and any impediments to such
access, such as adverse overall economic conditions or a negative perception in the capital markets of a financial company’s financial condition or prospects, could adversely affect its business. Deterioration of credit markets can have an
adverse impact on a broad range of financial markets, causing certain financial companies to incur large losses. In these conditions, companies in the financials sector may experience significant declines in the valuation of their assets, take
actions to raise capital and even cease operations. Some financial companies may also be required to accept or borrow significant amounts of capital from government sources</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>and may face future government-imposed restrictions on their businesses or
increased government intervention. In addition, there is no guarantee that governments will provide any such relief in the future. These actions may cause the securities of many companies in the financials sector to decline in value.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Healthcare Sector.<font>  Companies in the healthcare sector are often issuers whose profitability may be affected by extensive government regulation, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising or falling costs
of medical products and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, a limited number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market developments. Many healthcare companies are heavily
dependent on patent protection and the actual or perceived safety and efficiency of their products.</font></div>
<div>Patents have a limited duration, and, upon expiration, other
companies may market substantially similar “generic” products that are typically sold at a lower price than the patented product, which can cause the original developer of the product to lose market share and/or reduce the price charged
for the product, resulting in lower profits for the original developer. As a result, the expiration of patents may adversely affect the profitability of these companies.</div>
<div>In addition, because the products and services of many
companies in the healthcare sector affect the health and well-being of many individuals, these companies are especially susceptible to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims. Healthcare companies are subject to
competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may result in price discounting. Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The process of obtaining such approvals may be long and
costly, which can result in increased development costs, delayed cost recovery and loss of competitive advantage to the extent that rival companies have developed competing products or procedures, adversely affecting the company’s revenues and
profitability. In other words, delays in the regulatory approval process may diminish the opportunity for a company to profit from a new product or to bring a new product to market, which could have a material adverse effect on a company’s
business. Healthcare companies may also be strongly affected by scientific biotechnology or technological developments, and their products may quickly become obsolete. Also, many healthcare companies offer products and services that are subject to
governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies or laws. Changes in governmental policies or laws may span a wide range of topics, including cost control, national health insurance, incentives for
compensation in the provision of healthcare services, tax incentives and penalties related to healthcare insurance premiums, and promotion of prepaid healthcare plans. In addition, a number of legislative proposals concerning healthcare have been
considered by the U.S. Congress in recent years. It is unclear what proposals will ultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect they may have on companies in the healthcare sector.</div>
<div>Additionally, the expansion of facilities by
healthcare-related providers may be subject to “determinations of need” by certain government authorities. This process not only generally increases the time and costs involved in these expansions, but also makes expansion plans
uncertain, limiting the revenue and profitability growth potential of healthcare-related facilities operators and negatively affecting the prices of their securities. Moreover, in recent years, both local and national governmental budgets have come
under pressure to reduce spending and control healthcare costs, which could both adversely affect regulatory processes and public funding available for healthcare products, services and facilities.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Industrials Sector.<font>  The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by supply of and demand for both their specific products or services and for industrials sector products in general.
The products of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction. Government regulations, world events and economic conditions may affect the performance of companies in the
industrials sector. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. For example, commodity price declines and unit volume reductions resulting from an
over-supply of materials used in the industrials sector can adversely affect the sector. Furthermore, companies in the industrials sector may be subject to liability for environmental damage, product liability claims, depletion of resources, and
mandated expenditures for safety and pollution control.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Information Technology Sector.<font>  Information technology companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Like other technology companies, information technology
companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of information technology companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction,
unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. Technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technology, especially those of smaller, less-seasoned companies, tend to be more volatile than
the overall market. Companies in the information technology sector are heavily dependent on</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these
rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies in the information technology sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential
theft of proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses. These risks are heightened for information technology companies in foreign markets.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Insurance Industry.<font>  The insurance industry is subject to extensive government regulation in some countries and can be significantly affected by changes in interest rates, general economic conditions, price and marketing competition,
the imposition of premium rate caps or other changes in government regulation or tax law. Different segments of the insurance industry can be significantly affected by changes in mortality and morbidity rates, environmental clean-up costs and
catastrophic events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Materials Sector.<font>  Companies in the materials sector may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, exchange rates, import controls, increased competition, depletion of resources, technical progress, labor relations and
government regulations, and mandated expenditures for safety and pollution control, among other factors. Companies in the materials sector are also at risk of liability for environmental damage and product liability claims. Production of materials
may exceed demand as a result of market imbalances or economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns. These risks are heightened for companies in the materials sector located in foreign markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Metals and Mining Industry.<font>  Certain of the Funds may invest in securities that are issued by and/or have exposure to, companies primarily involved in the metals and mining industry. Investments in metals and mining industry companies may be
speculative and subject to greater price volatility than investments in other types of companies. The profitability of companies in the metals and mining industry is related to, among other things, worldwide metal prices, and extraction and
production costs. Worldwide metal prices may fluctuate substantially over short periods of time, so a Fund’s investment in metals and mining industry companies may be more volatile than other types of investments. In addition, metals and
mining companies may be significantly affected by changes in global demand for certain metals, economic developments, energy conservation, exchange rates, the success of exploration projects, interest rates, economic conditions, tax treatment,
government regulation and intervention, and world events in the regions that the companies to which a Fund has exposure operate (e.g., expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign
investments and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest, violence and labor unrest). Metals and mining companies may also be subject to the effects of competitive pressures in the metals and mining industry.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Oil and Gas Industry.<font>  Companies in the oil and gas industry are strongly affected by the levels and volatility of global energy prices, oil and gas supply and demand, government regulations and policies, oil and gas production and
conservation efforts and technological change. The oil and gas industry is cyclical and from time to time may experience a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or qualified personnel, or due to significant demand, such services may not be
available on commercially reasonable terms. Prices and supplies of oil and gas may fluctuate significantly over short and long periods of time due to national and international political changes, OPEC policies, changes in relationships among OPEC
members and between OPEC and oil-importing nations, the regulatory environment, taxation policies, and the economies of key energy-consuming countries. Disruptions in the oil sub-industry or shifts in energy consumption may significantly impact
companies in this industry. For instance, significant oil and gas deposits are located in emerging market countries where corruption and security may raise significant risks, in addition to the other risks of investing in emerging markets. In
addition, the Middle East, where many companies in the oil and gas industry may operate, has recently experienced widespread social unrest. Oil and gas companies operate in a highly competitive industry, with intense price competition. A significant
portion of their revenues may depend on a relatively small number of customers, including governmental entities and utilities.</font></div> <div></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Real Estate Industry.<font>  Companies in the real estate industry include companies that invest in real estate, such as real estate investment trusts (“REITs”), real estate holding and operating companies or real estate
development companies (collectively, “Real Estate Companies”). Investing in Real Estate Companies exposes investors to the risks of owning real estate directly, as well as to risks that relate specifically to the way in which Real Estate
Companies are organized and operated. The real estate industry is highly sensitive to general and local economic conditions and developments, and characterized by intense competition and periodic overbuilding. Investing in Real Estate Companies
involves various risks. Some risks that are specific to Real Estate Companies are discussed in greater detail below.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

 Table of Contents </a> </div> <div> <div type="Block">
<div>Interest Rate Risk.<font> Rising
interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could negatively impact a Real Estate Company’s ability to meet its payment obligations. Declining interest rates could result in increased prepayment on
loans and require redeployment of capital in less desirable investments.</font></div>
<div>Leverage Risk.<font> Real Estate
Companies may use leverage (and some may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk and could adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s operations and market value in periods of rising interest rates. Real Estate Companies are also
exposed to the risks normally associated with debt financing. Financial covenants related to a Real Estate Company’s leverage may affect the ability of the Real Estate Company to operate effectively. In addition, real property may be subject
to the quality of credit extended and defaults by borrowers and tenants. If the properties do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses, including, where applicable, debt service, ground lease payments, tenant improvements,
third-party leasing commissions and other capital expenditures, the income and ability of a Real Estate Company to make payments of any interest and principal on its debt securities will be adversely affected.</font></div>
<div></div>
<div>Loan Foreclosure Risk.<font> Real Estate Companies may foreclose on loans that the Real Estate Company originated and/or acquired. Foreclosure may generate negative publicity for the underlying property that affects its market value. In addition to
the length and expense</font><font> of such proceedings,</font><font> the validity of the terms of the applicable loan may not be recognized in foreclosure proceedings. Claims and defenses
asserted by borrowers or other lenders may interfere with the enforcement of rights by a Real Estate Company. Parallel proceedings, such as bankruptcy, may also delay resolution and limit the amount of recovery on a foreclosed loan by a Real Estate
Company even where the property underlying the loan is liquidated.</font></div>
<div>Property Risk.<font> Real Estate
Companies may be subject to risks relating to functional obsolescence or reduced desirability of properties; extended vacancies due to economic conditions and tenant bankruptcies; catastrophic events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist
acts; and casualty or condemnation losses. Real estate income and values also may be greatly affected by demographic trends, such as population shifts or changing tastes and values, or increasing vacancies or declining rents resulting from legal,
cultural, technological, global or local economic developments.</font></div>
<div>Distressed Investment Risk.<font>
Real Estate Companies may invest in distressed, defaulted or out-of-favor bank loans. Identification and implementation by a Real Estate Company of loan modification and restructure programs involves a high degree of uncertainty. Even successful
implementation may still require adverse compromises and may not prevent bankruptcy. Real Estate Companies may also invest in other debt instruments that may become non-performing, including the securities of companies with higher credit and market
risk due to financial or operational difficulties. Higher risk securities may be less liquid and more volatile than the securities of companies not in distress.</font></div> <div></div>
<div>Underlying Investment Risk.<font> Real Estate Companies make investments in a variety of debt and equity instruments with varying risk profiles. For instance, Real Estate Companies may invest in debt instruments secured by commercial property that have
higher risks of delinquency and foreclosure than loans on single family homes due to a variety of factors associated with commercial property, including the tie between income available to service debt and productive use of the property. Real Estate
Companies may also invest in debt instruments and preferred equity that are junior in an issuer’s capital structure and that involve privately negotiated structures. Subordinated debt investments, such as B-Notes and mezzanine loans, involve a
greater credit risk of default due to the need to service more senior debt of the issuer. Similarly, preferred equity investments involve a greater risk of loss than conventional debt financing due to their non-collateralized nature and subordinated
ranking. Investments in CMBS may also be junior in priority in the event of bankruptcy or similar proceedings. Investments in senior loans may be effectively subordinated if the senior loan is pledged as collateral. The ability of a holder of junior
claims to proceed against a defaulting issuer is circumscribed by the terms of the particular contractual arrangement, which vary considerably from transaction to transaction.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk.<font> Real Estate
Companies are dependent upon management skills and may have limited financial resources. Real Estate Companies are generally not diversified and may be subject to heavy cash flow dependency, default by borrowers and voluntary liquidation. In
addition, transactions between Real Estate Companies and their affiliates may be subject to conflicts of interest, which may adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s shareholders. A Real Estate Company may also have joint venture investments
in certain of its properties, and, consequently, its ability to control decisions relating to such properties may be limited.</font></div>
<div>Liquidity Risk.<font> Investing in
Real Estate Companies may involve risks similar to those associated with investing in small-capitalization companies. Real Estate Company securities, like the securities of small-capitalization companies, may be more volatile than, and perform
differently from, shares of large-capitalization companies. There may be less trading in Real Estate Company shares, which means that buy and sell transactions in those shares could have a magnified impact on share price,</font></div> </div>

<div>resulting in abrupt or erratic price fluctuations. In addition, real estate
is relatively illiquid, and, therefore, a Real Estate Company may have a limited ability to vary or liquidate properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions.</div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> Real
Estate Companies may own a limited number of properties and concentrate their investments in a particular geographic region or property type. Economic downturns affecting a particular region, industry or property type may lead to a high volume of
defaults within a short period.</font></div> <div>U.S. Tax Risk.<font> Certain U.S. Real Estate Companies are subject to special U.S. federal tax requirements. A REIT that fails to comply with such tax requirements may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation, which may affect the value
of the REIT and the characterization of the REIT’s distributions. The U.S. federal tax requirement that a REIT distribute substantially all of its net income to its shareholders may result in a REIT having insufficient capital for future
expenditures. A REIT that successfully maintains its qualification may still become subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes, including excise, penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage recording, and transfer taxes, both directly and indirectly
through its subsidiaries.</font></div> <div></div>
<div>Regulatory Risk.<font> Real estate income and values may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable domestic and foreign laws (including tax laws). Government actions, such as tax increases, zoning law changes or environmental
regulations, also may have a major impact on real estate income and values. In addition, quarterly compliance with regulations limiting the proportion of asset types held by a U.S. REIT may force certain Real Estate Companies to liquidate or
restructure otherwise attractive investments. Some countries may not recognize REITs or comparable structures as a viable form of real estate funds.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Retail Industry.<font>  The retail industry may be affected by changes in domestic and international economies, consumer confidence, disposable household income and spending, and consumer tastes and preferences. Companies in the retail
industry face intense competition, which may have an adverse effect on their profitability. The success of companies in the retail industry may be strongly affected by social trends, marketing campaigns and public perceptions. Companies in the
retail industry may be dependent on outside financing, which may be difficult to obtain. Many of these companies are dependent on third party suppliers and distribution systems. Retail companies may be unable to protect their intellectual property
rights or may be liable for infringing the intellectual property rights of others.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Technology Sector.<font>  Technology companies are characterized by periodic new product introductions, innovations and evolving industry standards, and, as a result, face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which
may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Companies in the technology sector are often smaller and less experienced companies and may be subject to greater risks than larger companies; these risks may be heightened for technology companies in
foreign markets. Technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of technology companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product
introduction, changes in consumer and business purchasing patterns, unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. In addition, a rising interest rate environment tends to negatively affect companies
in the technology sector because, in such an environment, those companies with high market valuations may appear less attractive to investors, which may cause sharp decreases in the companies’ market prices. Companies in the technology sector
are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. The technology sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in
commodity prices, which may be influenced or characterized by unpredictable factors. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies in the technology sector may be particular targets of hacking and
potential theft of proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Telecommunications Sector.<font>  The telecommunications sector of a country’s economy is often subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with governmental regulations, delays or failure to receive required
regulatory approvals, or the enactment of new regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of telecommunications companies. Government actions around the world, specifically in the area of pre-marketing clearance of products and
prices, can be arbitrary and unpredictable. Companies in the telecommunications sector may experience distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition, particularly in developing new products and
services using new technology. Technological innovations may make the products and services of certain telecommunications companies obsolete. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies in the
telecommunications sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</font></div> </div>

<div>Risk of Investing in the Transportation Infrastructure Industry.<font>  Issuers in the transportation infrastructure industry can be significantly affected by economic changes, fuel prices, labor relations, technology developments, exchange rates, industry competition, insurance costs
and deteriorating public infrastructure, such as bridges, roads, rails, ports and airports. Transportation companies in certain countries may also be subject to significant government regulation and oversight, which may adversely affect their
businesses. Other risk factors that may affect the transportation infrastructure industry include the risk of increases in fuel and other operating costs and the effects of regulatory changes or other government decisions. Companies in the
transportation infrastructure industry may be adversely affected by adverse weather, acts of terrorism or catastrophic events, such as air accidents, train crashes or tunnel fires. Companies in the transportation infrastructure industry may also be
subject to the risk of widespread disruption of technology systems and increasing equipment and operational costs.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Utilities Sector.<font>  The utilities sector may be adversely affected by changing commodity prices, government regulation stipulating rates charged by utilities, increased tariffs, changes in tax laws, interest rate fluctuations and
changes in the cost of providing specific utility services. The utilities industry is also subject to potential terrorist attacks, natural disasters and severe weather conditions, as well as regulatory and operational burdens associated with the
operation and maintenance of nuclear facilities. Government regulators monitor and control utility revenues and costs, and therefore may limit utility profits. In certain countries, regulatory authorities may also restrict a company’s access
to new markets, thereby diminishing the company’s long-term prospects.</font></div>
<div>There are substantial differences among the regulatory
practices and policies of various jurisdictions, and any regulatory agency may make major shifts in policy from time to time. There is no assurance that regulatory authorities will, in the future, grant rate increases. Additionally, existing and
possible future regulatory legislation may make it even more difficult for utilities to obtain adequate relief. Certain of the issuers of securities held in a Fund's portfolio may own or operate nuclear generating facilities. Governmental
authorities may from time to time review existing policies and impose additional requirements governing the licensing, construction and operation of nuclear power plants. Prolonged changes in climate conditions can also have a significant impact on
both the revenues of an electric and gas utility as well as the expenses of a utility, particularly a hydro-based electric utility.</div>
<div>The rates that traditional regulated utility companies may
charge their customers generally are subject to review and limitation by governmental regulatory commissions. Rate changes may occur only after a prolonged approval period or may not occur at all, which could adversely affect utility companies when
costs are rising. The value of regulated utility debt securities (and, to a lesser extent, equity securities) tends to have an inverse relationship to the movement of interest rates. Certain utility companies have experienced full or partial
deregulation in recent years. These utility companies are frequently more similar to industrial companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been permitted by regulators to diversify outside of their original geographic regions
and their traditional lines of business. As a result, some companies may be forced to defend their core business and may be less profitable. Deregulation may also permit a utility company to expand outside of its traditional lines of business and
engage in riskier ventures.</div> <div>Proxy Voting Policy</div>
<div></div>
<div>For all Funds, the Board has delegated the
voting of proxies for each Fund’s securities to BFA pursuant to the Funds' Proxy Voting Policy (the “iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policy”), and BlackRock, Inc. has adopted policies and procedures (the “BlackRock Proxy
Voting Policies”) governing proxy voting by accounts managed by BlackRock, Inc., including the Funds.</div>
<div>Under the BlackRock Proxy Voting Policies, BFA will vote
proxies related to Fund securities in the best interests of a Fund and its shareholders. From time to time, a vote may present a conflict between the interests of a Fund’s shareholders, on the one hand, and those of BFA, or any affiliated
person of a Fund or BFA, on the other. BFA maintains policies and procedures that are designed to prevent undue influence on BFA’s proxy voting activity that might stem from any relationship between the issuer of a proxy (or any dissident
shareholder) and BFA, BFA’s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund’s affiliates. Most conflicts are managed through a structural separation of BFA’s Corporate Governance Group from BFA’s employees with sales and client
responsibilities. In addition, BFA maintains procedures to ensure that all engagements with corporate issuers or dissident shareholders are managed consistently and without regard to BFA’s relationship with the issuer of the proxy or the
dissident shareholder. In certain instances, BFA may determine to engage an independent fiduciary to vote proxies as a further safeguard to avoid potential conflicts of interest or as otherwise required by applicable law.</div> </div>

<div>Portfolio Holdings Information</div>
<div>The Board has adopted a policy regarding the disclosure of the
Funds' portfolio holdings information that requires that such information be disclosed in a manner that: (i) is consistent with applicable legal requirements and in the best interests of each Fund’s respective shareholders; (ii) does not put
the interests of BFA, the Distributor or any affiliated person of BFA or the Distributor, above those of Fund shareholders; (iii) does not advantage any current or prospective Fund shareholders over any other current or prospective Fund
shareholders, except to the extent that certain Entities (as described below) may receive portfolio holdings information not available to other current or prospective Fund shareholders in connection with the dissemination of information necessary
for transactions in Creation Units, as discussed below, and certain information may be provided to personnel of BFA and its affiliates who manage funds that invest a significant percentage of their assets in shares of the Fund for the purpose of
facilitating risk management and hedging activities; and (iv) does not provide selective access to portfolio holdings information except pursuant to the procedures outlined below and to the extent appropriate confidentiality arrangements limiting
the use of such information are in effect. The “Entities” referred to in sub-section (iii) above are generally limited to National Securities Clearing Corporation (“NSCC”) members, subscribers to various fee-based
subscription services, large institutional investors (known as “Authorized Participants”) that have been authorized by the Distributor to purchase and redeem large blocks of shares pursuant to legal requirements and market makers and
other institutional market participants and entities that provide information or transactional services.</div>
<div>Each business day, each Fund's portfolio holdings information
is provided to the Distributor or other agent for dissemination through the facilities of the NSCC and/or other fee-based subscription services to NSCC members and/or subscribers to those other fee-based subscription services, including market
makers and Authorized Participants, and to entities that publish and/or analyze such information in connection with the process of purchasing or redeeming Creation Units or trading shares of the Funds in the secondary market or evaluating such
potential transactions. This information typically reflects each Fund’s anticipated holdings on the following business day.</div>

<div>Descriptions of the Funds’ respective Underlying Indexes
are provided below.</div> <div></div>
<div>With respect to certain underlying indexes
of the iShares funds, BFA or its affiliates have held discussions with the applicable index provider regarding their business interest in licensing an index to track a particular market segment and conveyed investment concepts and strategies that
could be considered for the index. The index provider designed and constituted the index using concepts conveyed by BFA or its affiliates. For certain of these indices, the relevant fund may be the first or sole user of the underlying index. In its
sole discretion, the index provider determines the composition of the securities and other instruments in such underlying index, the rebalance protocols of the underlying index, the weightings of the securities and other instruments in the
underlying index, and any updates to the methodology. From time to time, BFA or its affiliates may also provide input relating to possible methodology changes of such underlying index pursuant to the index provider’s consultation process or
pursuant to other communications with the index provider.</div>

<div>Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate ex USD 10% Issuer Capped
(Hedged) Index</div> <div></div>
<div><font>Number of
 Components: approximately 9,964</font></div> <div>Index
Description.<font> The Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate ex USD 10% Issuer Capped (Hedged) Index measures the performance of the global ex-U.S. dollar denominated, investment-grade debt from twenty-three different local
currency markets. The multi-currency benchmark includes investment-grade fixed-rate sovereign and government-related debt, corporate, and securitized bonds from both developed and emerging market issuers.</font></div>
<div>Index Methodology. <font>The
Underlying Index is a subset of a broader global universe of investment grade bonds. Bonds in the Underlying Index are selected from the universe of eligible bonds using defined rules. The bonds eligible for inclusion in the Underlying Index include
global bonds that are denominated in one of the following eligible currencies: Australian dollar, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chilean peso, Czech koruna, Danish krone, euro, Hong Kong dollar, Israel shekel, Japanese yen, Korean won,
Malaysian ringgit, Mexican peso, New Turkish lira, New Zealand dollar, Norwegian krone, Polish zloty, Russian ruble, South African rand, Singapore dollar, Swedish krona, Swiss franc or Thai baht. Securities must have an average rating that is
investment grade based on ratings by Fitch, Moody’s or S&amp;P Global Ratings; have a fixed rate coupon; have at least one year remaining until maturity and must be fully taxable issues. Debt that is publicly issued in the global and regional
markets is included in the Underlying Index. The securities in the Underlying Index must have the following minimum outstanding issue size based on the local currency market: 200 million for British pound sterling-denominated bonds; 300 million for
Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, euro, and Swiss franc-denominated bonds; 500 million for New Zealand dollar and Singapore dollar-denominated bonds; 2 billion for Danish krone, Hong Kong dollar, Israel shekel, Malaysian ringgit, New Turkish lira,
Norwegian krone, Polish zloty, and South African rand-denominated bonds; 2.5 billion for Swedish krona-denominated bonds; 10 billion for Czech koruna, Mexican peso, and Thai baht-denominated bonds; 20 billion for Russian ruble-denominated bonds; 35
billion for Japanese yen-denominated bonds; 100 billion for Chilean peso-denominated bonds; and 500 billion for Korean won-denominated bonds. The Underlying Index is market capitalization-weighted, and the currency risk of the securities in the
Underlying Index are hedged to the U.S. dollar on a monthly basis.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Certain types of securities, such as
USD-denominated bonds, contingent capital securities, inflation-linked bonds, floating-rate issues, fixed-rate perpetuals, retail bonds, structured notes, pass-through certificates, private placements (other than those offered pursuant to Rule 144A
or Regulation S promulgated under the 1933 Act), sinkable Russian OFZ bonds issued prior to 2009 and securities where reliable pricing is unavailable are excluded from the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Bloomberg Barclays indices use a “country of risk”
approach to determine country classifications. For government, government-related and corporate bond issuers that are operating, domiciled or concentrated within a single market, country classification is generally a straightforward exercise. For
corporate bonds or other issuers with geographically diverse operations, complex ownership structures, a presence in multiple locations or other risk exposures that span multiple markets, country classifications are more challenging. The primary
criteria for classifying country of risk are:</div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Where a bond’s
guarantee comes from if the issuer is backed by a government or parent corporate entity. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Where the largest source of
revenue, operations or cash flows is generated by the issuer. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Where an issuer is
headquartered or its centralized decision-making occurs. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Additional criteria may be
used in the evaluation of a bond’s country of risk, including, but not limited to: </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Where the issuer is
incorporated, legally domiciled and regulated. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Where an issuer’s
stock is listed and traded. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Where
existing issuers within the index that are similarly structured or organized are classified. </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>Component Selection Criteria.
<font>Eligible bonds are chosen by applying the eligibility rules listed above. The Underlying Index is a market value weighted index with no maximum number of bond issues per eligible issuer. To avoid an
over-concentration in any single issuer, the methodology caps single issuer exposure to no more than 10% of the index weight, calculated on the last business day of each month. The Underlying Index is updated monthly after the close of business on
the last business day of each month.</font></div> <div>Bloomberg

<div><font>Number of
 Components: approximately 2,408</font></div> <div>Index
Description.<font> The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. CMBS (ERISA Only) Index measures the performance of investment-grade commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), which are classes of securities (known as
“certificates”) that represent interests in “pools” of commercial mortgages. The Underlying Index includes only CMBS that are Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”) eligible under
the underwriter’s exemption, which will deem ERISA eligible the certificates with the first priority of principal repayment, as long as certain conditions are met, including the requirement that the certificates be rated in one of the three
highest rating categories by Fitch, Moody's or S&amp;P Global Ratings.</font></div>
<div>The Underlying Index includes investment-grade CMBS that are
ERISA eligible with $300 million or more of aggregate outstanding transaction size. In addition, the original aggregate transaction must be $500 million or more and the tranche size must be $25 million or more. CMBS certificates must have an
expected life of at least one year and must be either fixed-rate or subject to an interest rate cap equal to the weighted average coupon of the underlying asset pool. Excluded from the Underlying Index are non-ERISA eligible securities, agency
transactions and privately issued securities, including those which may be resold in accordance with Rule 144A of the 1933 Act. The securities in the Underlying Index are updated on the last calendar day of each month.</div>

<div></div> <div><font>Number of Components: approximately 2,038</font></div>
<div>Index Description.<font> The
Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Corporate Aaa - A Capped Index is a subset of the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Corporate Index that measures the performance of the Aaa – A rated range of the fixed-rate, U.S. dollar-denominated, taxable, corporate bond
market. The Underlying Index is market capitalization-weighted with a 3% cap on any one issuer and a </font><font>pro rata</font><font> distribution of any excess weight
across the remaining issuers in the Underlying Index.</font></div>
<div>The Underlying Index includes U.S. dollar-denominated
securities publicly-issued by U.S. and non-U.S. industrial, utility and financial corporate issuers, with maturities of one year or more, that have $500 million or more of outstanding face value. Each corporate bond must be registered with the SEC,
have been exempt from registration at issuance, or have been offered pursuant to Rule 144A with registration rights. In addition, only securities rated A3 by Moody’s or higher (or the equivalent on another rating agency’s scale) will be
included in the Underlying Index. When ratings from each of Fitch, Moody’s and S&amp;P Global Ratings are available, the median rating is used to determine eligibility. When ratings from only two of these agencies are available, that lower
rating is used to determine eligibility. When a rating from only one of these agencies is available, that rating is used to determine eligibility. The securities in the Underlying Index are updated on the last calendar day of each month.</div>

<div>Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Fixed Income Balanced
Risk Index</div> <div><font>Number
of Components: approximately 771</font></div> <div>Index Description.
<font>The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Fixed Income Balanced Risk Index, the Underlying Index, measures the performance of the corporate and mortgage portion of the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Universal Index (the “Parent
Index”) while targeting an equal allocation between interest rate and credit spread risk.</font></div>
<div>The Underlying Index uses a rules-based approach to calculate
an equal volatility-weighted allocation to each of five segments of the Parent Index: (1) investment-grade corporate bonds 1-5 year; (2) investment-grade corporate bonds 5-10 year; (3) high yield corporate bonds rated BB or higher; (4) high yield
corporate bonds rated below BB; and (5) U.S. agency MBS. Segments with lower credit spread volatility receive a higher weighting, and segments with higher credit spread volatility receive a lower weighting, with the result that the contribution of
each segment to overall credit spread volatility is approximately equal. Credit spread volatility for investment-grade corporate securities and MBS components are measured differently than the Fund’s high yield securities, but aim to capture
the volatility of the return attributable to the credit quality of the security.</div>
<div>To increase overall yield and credit spread exposure, the
Underlying Index incorporates a leverage factor of up to 25% that redeploys MBS exposure, via cash pending settlement from TBA mortgage transactions, toward other index constituent securities. The Underlying Index further adjusts interest rate risk
so that it equals credit spread risk, by adding either long positions in U.S. Treasury bonds or short positions in U.S. Treasury futures. The Underlying Index is rebalanced monthly.</div>

investment grade and caps issuers at 3%.</font></div> <div>Index
Methodology.<font> The Underlying Index is a subset of a broader high yield universe of below-investment grade bonds. Bonds in the Underlying Index are selected from the universe of eligible bonds using defined rules. The
bonds eligible for inclusion in the Underlying Index include U.S. dollar-denominated corporate bonds that: (i) are issued by companies domiciled in countries classified as developed markets by the index provider (based primarily on World Bank income

fixed-rate coupon; and (vi) have at least one year to maturity. In determining whether a bond has an average rating of investment grade or below-investment grade, ratings from Moody’s, S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch are considered.
Securities in the Underlying Index must be rated below-investment grade (“BBB-” by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch, or “Baa3” by Moody’s) using the middle rating of Moody’s, S&amp;P Global Ratings, or Fitch after
dropping the highest and lowest available ratings. When a rating from only two agencies is available, the lower (“more conservative”) rating is used. When a rating from only one agency is available, that rating is used to determine
eligibility in the Underlying Index. If an issue is unrated, the index provider may consider expected ratings and/or issuer-level ratings adopted by a ratings agency.</font></div>

<div><font>Number of
 Components: approximately 410</font></div> <div>Index
Description<font>. The J.P. Morgan EMBI<sup>®</sup> Global Core Index is a broad, diverse, market capitalization-weighted index
designed to measure the performance of U.S. dollar-denominated Brady bonds, Eurobonds, traded loans, and securities issued by sovereign and quasi-sovereign entities of emerging market countries. The methodology is designed to distribute the weights
of each country within the Underlying Index by limiting the weights of countries with higher debt outstanding and reallocating this excess to countries with lower debt outstanding.</font></div>
<div>Index Methodology<font>. To be
considered an emerging market, a country’s GNI per capita must be below the J.P. Morgan Index Income Ceiling (“IIC”) for three consecutive years to be eligible for inclusion. The IIC is defined as the GNI per capital level that is
adjusted every year by the growth rate of the World GNI per capita, Atlas method (current U.S. dollars), provided by the World Bank annually. Once the universe of emerging markets countries has been defined, the eligible securities from these
countries must be selected for inclusion in the Underlying Index.</font></div>
<div>Component Selection Criteria<font>.
Securities that satisfy all the following defined criteria will be eligible for inclusion in the Underlying Index: (i) can be fixed or floating-rate (ii) must be issued by sovereign and quasi-sovereign (defined as 100% owned or guaranteed by the
government) entities from index-eligible countries as noted above (iii) must be denominated in U.S. dollars; (iv) must have a current face amount outstanding of $1 billion or more; (v) must have at least 2.5 years until</font></div> </div>

<div>maturity to be eligible for inclusion and must have at least 2 years until
maturity to remain in the index; (vi) must be able to settle internationally through Euroclear or another institution domiciled outside the issuing country; and (vii) must be a security whose bid and offer prices are available on a daily and timely
basis — sourced from a third party valuation vendor. Convertible bonds, securities issued by municipalities or provinces, and local law securities are all excluded from the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Index Maintenance<font>. The
Underlying Index is a broad, diverse market capitalization-weighted index. The Underlying Index is priced every business day of the year. Business days are based on the US bond market calendar set by the Emerging Markets Trading Association (EMTA).
Underlying Index securities are priced using bid pricing each day. Security level pricing for the Underlying Index is sourced from a third party valuation vendor ensuring transparency and consistency. Daily indicative pricing for each security and
FX rate is closely scrutinized and are reconciled using market movements and other pricing sources as guidance. As necessary, an established alternative source will be used to maintain the integrity of the daily index calculation. On any given
calculation day, if the primary source is unable to provide a quote, the Index Group reserves the right to consider the use of an appropriate alternative source for the index inputs. If a permanent switch for the primary third party pricing source
is necessary, clients will be notified in advance prior to any official switch.</font></div>
<div>The weight of each security in the Underlying Index is
determined by first starting with the face amount outstanding of all eligible securities and aggregating such securities by country. The highest weighted countries are then constrained by capping the total weight within those countries. The result
establishes new country weights which are then used to calculate the new eligible face amounts per security within those countries. To calculate the final weights of each security in the Underlying Index, the current day’s price is multiplied
by each security’s adjusted face amount. The market capitalization for each security is then divided by the total market capitalization for all securities in the Underlying Index. The result represents the weight of the security expressed as a
percentage of the Underlying Index.</div> <div>The Underlying Index
is generally rebalanced on a monthly basis. A new security that meets the Underlying Index admission requirements is added to the Underlying Index on the first month-end business date after its issuance, provided its issue date falls before the 15th
of the month. A new security whose settlement date falls on or after the 15th of the month is added to the Underlying Index on the last business day of the next month. There are two exceptions to this rule. The first exception applies to new
securities that are released as part of a debt exchange program. For example, if a country exchanges a portion of its outstanding debt for a new issue after the 15th of the month, at the month-end rebalancing date immediately following this event
the amount of debt retired in this exchange would be removed from the Underlying Index. The new security would then be added to the Underlying Index. The second exception concerns Regulation S securities. A security that is issued solely in reliance
on Regulation S of the 1933 Act and not pursuant to Rule 144A will be ineligible for inclusion in the Underlying Index until the expiration of the relevant Regulation S restricted period. The date at which the restriction is lifted will effectively
be the new “issue” date, at which point the 15th of the month rule will apply. In extreme cases, an intra-month rebalancing can occur when more than 2% of the market capitalization of the EMBI Global Diversified<sup>TM</sup> index is exchanged or more than 3% of the face amount of the EMBI Global<sup>TM</sup> index is exchanged. If an announcement is made for a bond to be called, it is removed from the Underlying Index on the month-end prior to its call date on
the basis of having less than 24 months remaining until maturity. However, if an announcement is not made in time for the bond to be removed from the Underlying Index on the prior month-end, it will be removed the first month-end following the
announcement, unless the amount to be called triggers an intra-month rebalancing.</div>

<div>Index Maintenance.<font> Each
Underlying Index is calculated every weekday of the year except Christmas and New Year’s Day. Each Underlying Index uses Thomson Reuters bid-side pricing. Each Underlying</font><font> Index is calculated in its
respective local</font><font> currencies,</font><font> and WM/Reuters foreign</font><font> exchange rates taken at 4:00 p.m. London</font><font> time are</font><font> used in</font><font> the</font><font> end-of-day calculation of each Underlying Index to convert the local</font><font> currency prices into U.S. dollars.</font></div>
<div>Each Underlying Index is reconstituted annually, effective the
first business day of April, using January month-end figures, with country composition as well as addition and deletion thresholds set. Each Underlying Index is then rebalanced on a monthly basis, with the weighting of each country in the Underlying
Index being set by taking the total outstanding index market value of each country and dividing by the total outstanding index market value of all countries included in the Underlying Index. Weightings are then adjusted to ensure that no single
country has a weight greater than 23.00%, the sum of countries with weightings greater than 5.00% is less than or equal to 48.00% and all other issuers are capped at 4.70%. Additional adjustments may be made to minimize deviations from initial
market value across countries. The weighting of each eligible bond within a given country is calculated as the market value of that bond divided by the total market value of all eligible bonds within that country. The weighting of each eligible bond
in an Underlying Index is therefore the weighting of that bond within its country multiplied by the weighting of that country within the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Each Underlying Index is reviewed and rebalanced on a monthly
basis. Additions, deletions and other changes to each Underlying Index arising from the rebalancing are made provided the security’s reference information and pricing are available by designated pricing and data providers on the rebalancing
reference date. Changes to each Underlying Index are published on the announcement date and become effective on the rebalancing date. Information related to the rebalancing is obtained and disseminated after the close of business.</div>

<div>Notations Regarding each Fund's Fundamental Investment
Policies</div> <div>The following notations are not considered to
be part of each Fund’s fundamental investment policies and are subject to change without shareholder approval.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to
concentration set forth in (1) above, the Investment Company Act does not define what constitutes “concentration” in an industry. The SEC staff has taken the position that investment of 25% or more of a fund’s total assets in one
or more issuers conducting their principal activities in the same industry or group of industries constitutes concentration. It is possible that interpretations of concentration could change in the future. The policy in (1) above will be interpreted
to refer to concentration as that term may be interpreted from time to time. The policy also will be interpreted to permit investment without limit in the following: securities of the U.S. government and its agencies or instrumentalities; securities
of state, territory, possession or municipal governments and their authorities, agencies, instrumentalities or political subdivisions; and repurchase agreements collateralized by any such obligations. Accordingly, issuers of the foregoing securities
will not be considered to be members of any industry. There also will be no limit on investment in issuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or country. Finance companies will be considered to be in the industries of their parents if their
activities are primarily related to financing the activities of the parents. Each foreign government will be considered to be a member of a separate industry. With respect to each Fund's industry classifications, each Fund currently utilizes any one
or more of the industry sub-classifications used by one or more widely recognized market indexes or rating group indexes, and/or as defined by Fund management. The policy also will be interpreted to give broad authority to each Fund as to how to
classify issuers within or among industries.</div> <div>With
respect to the fundamental policy relating to borrowing money set forth in (2) above, the Investment Company Act permits each Fund to borrow money in amounts of up to one-third of the Fund’s total assets from banks for any purpose, and to
borrow up to 5% of the Fund’s total assets from banks or other lenders for temporary purposes. (The Fund’s total assets include the amounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks attendant to borrowing, the Investment Company Act requires
each Fund to maintain at all times an “asset coverage” of at least 300% of the amount of its borrowings. Asset coverage means the ratio that the value of each Fund’s total assets (including amounts borrowed), minus liabilities
other than borrowings, bears to the aggregate amount of all borrowings. Borrowing money to increase portfolio holdings is known as “leveraging.” Certain trading practices and investments, such as reverse repurchase agreements, may be
considered to be borrowings or involve leverage and thus are subject to the Investment Company Act restrictions. In accordance with SEC staff guidance and interpretations, when each Fund engages in such transactions, the Fund instead of maintaining
asset coverage of at least 300%, may segregate or earmark liquid assets, or enter into an offsetting position, in an amount at least equal to</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>the Fund’s exposure, on a mark-to-market basis, to the transaction (as
calculated pursuant to requirements of the SEC). The policy in (2) above will be interpreted to permit each Fund to engage in trading practices and investments that may be considered to be borrowing or to involve leverage to the extent permitted by
the Investment Company Act and to permit each Fund to segregate or earmark liquid assets or enter into offsetting positions in accordance with the Investment Company Act. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and
arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered to be borrowings under the policy. Practices and investments that may involve leverage but are not considered to be borrowings are not subject to the policy.</div>
<div></div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental policy
relating to underwriting set forth in (5) above, the Investment Company Act does not prohibit each Fund from engaging in the underwriting business or from underwriting the securities of other issuers; in fact, in the case of diversified funds, the
Investment Company Act permits the Fund to have underwriting commitments of up to 25% of its assets under certain circumstances. Those circumstances currently are that the amount of each Fund’s underwriting commitments, when added to the value
of the Fund’s investments in issuers where each Fund owns more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of those issuers, cannot exceed the 25% cap. A fund engaging in transactions involving the acquisition or disposition of portfolio
securities may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act. Although it is not believed that the application of the 1933 Act provisions described above would cause each Fund to be engaged in the business of underwriting, the policy in (5)
above will be interpreted not to prevent the Fund from engaging in transactions involving the acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities, regardless of whether the Fund may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act or is
otherwise engaged in the underwriting business to the extent permitted by applicable law.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to lending set
forth in (7) above, the Investment Company Act does not prohibit each Fund from making loans (including lending its securities); however, SEC staff interpretations currently prohibit funds from lending more than one-third of their total assets
(including lending its securities), except through the purchase of debt obligations or the use of repurchase agreements. In addition, collateral arrangements with respect to options, forward currency and futures transactions and other derivative
instruments (as applicable), as well as delays in the settlement of securities transactions, will not be considered loans.</div> <div></div> <div></div>

<div>iShares Core International Aggregate Bond ETF</div>
<div>The Fund has adopted a non-fundamental investment policy in
accordance with Rule 35d-1 under the Investment Company Act to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the value of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in the component securities and other
instruments of its Underlying Index. The Fund also has adopted a policy to provide its shareholders with at least 60 days' prior written notice of any change in such policy. If, subsequent to an investment, the 80% requirement is no longer met, the
Fund's future investments will be made in a manner that will bring the Fund into compliance with this policy.</div>
<div>All Funds</div>
<div>In addition to the investment restrictions adopted as
fundamental policies, set forth above, each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy not to invest in the securities of a company for the purpose of exercising management or control, or purchase or otherwise acquire any illiquid investment, except
as permitted under the 1940 Act, which currently limits each Fund’s holdings in illiquid investments to 15% of a Fund’s net assets. BFA monitors Fund holdings in illiquid investments pursuant to the Liquidity Program. Except with regard
to the fundamental policy relating to senior securities set forth in (3) above for all Funds, if any percentage restriction described above is complied with at the time of an investment, a later increase or decrease in percentage resulting from a
change in values of assets will not constitute a violation of such restriction.</div>
<div>Each Fund (except the iShares Core International Aggregate
Bond ETF) has adopted a non-fundamental investment policy in accordance with Rule 35d-1 under the 1940 Act to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the value of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes,
in component securities in each Fund's Underlying Index and (except for the iShares 5-10 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares 10+ Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF and iShares Broad USD High Yield Corporate Bond ETF) in TBA
transactions with respect to the percentage of the Underlying Index (if any) that consists of mortgage-pass through securities. Each Fund also has adopted a policy to provide its shareholders with at least 60 days’ prior written notice of any
change in such policy. If, subsequent to an investment, an 80% requirement is no longer met, a Fund’s future investments will be made in a manner that will bring the Fund into compliance with this policy.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental
policy such that, under normal market conditions, any borrowings by the Fund will not exceed 10% of the Fund’s net assets.</div>
<div>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy not to purchase
securities of other investment companies, except to the extent permitted by the Investment Company Act. As a matter of policy, however, each Fund will not purchase shares of any registered open-end investment company or registered unit investment
trust, in reliance on Section 12(d)(1)(F) or (G) (the “fund of funds” provisions) of the Investment Company Act, at any time each Fund has knowledge that its shares are purchased by another investment company investor in reliance on the
provisions of subparagraph (G) of Section 12(d)(1).</div>
<div>Unless otherwise indicated, all limitations under each Fund's
fundamental or non-fundamental investment policies apply only at the time that a transaction is undertaken. Any change in the percentage of each Fund's assets invested in certain securities or other instruments resulting from market fluctuations or
other changes in each Fund’s total assets will not require each Fund to dispose of an investment until BFA determines that it is practicable to sell or close out the investment without undue market or tax consequences.</div> </div>

<div>The method by which Creation Units are created and traded may
raise certain issues under applicable securities laws. Because new Creation Units are issued and sold by the Funds on an ongoing basis, at any point a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may occur. Broker-dealers and
other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters and subject them to the
prospectus delivery requirement and liability provisions of the 1933 Act.</div>
<div>For example, a broker-dealer firm or its client may be deemed
a statutory underwriter if it takes Creation Units after placing an order with the Distributor, breaks them down into constituent shares and sells such shares directly to customers or if it chooses to couple the creation of new shares with an active
selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand for shares. A determination of whether one is an underwriter for purposes of the 1933 Act must take into account all of the facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the
broker-dealer or its client in the particular case and the examples mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that could lead to a categorization as an underwriter.</div>
<div>Broker-dealer firms should also note that dealers who are not
“underwriters” but are effecting transactions in shares, whether or not participating in the distribution of shares, generally are required to deliver a prospectus. This is because the prospectus delivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of
the 1933 Act is not available in respect of such transactions as a result of Section 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that incur a prospectus delivery obligation with respect to shares of the Funds are reminded that, pursuant to Rule 153 under the 1933
Act, a prospectus delivery obligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the 1933 Act owed to an exchange member in connection with a sale on the Listing Exchange generally is satisfied by the fact that the prospectus is available at the Listing Exchange upon
request. The prospectus delivery mechanism provided in Rule 153 is available only with respect to transactions on an exchange.</div>

<div>Overall responsibility for oversight of the Funds rests with
the Board. The Board has engaged BFA to manage the Funds on a day-to-day basis. The Board is responsible for overseeing BFA and other service providers in the operations of the Funds in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, applicable
provisions of state and other laws and the Trust’s charter. The Board is currently composed of ten members, eight of whom are Independent Trustees. The Board currently conducts regular in person meetings four times a year. In addition, the
Board frequently holds special in person or telephonic meetings or informal conference calls to discuss specific matters that may arise or require action between regular meetings. The Independent Trustees meet regularly outside the presence of
management, in executive session or with other service providers to the Trust.</div>
<div>The Board has appointed an Independent Trustee to serve in the
role of Board Chair. The Board Chair’s role is to preside at all meetings of the Board and to act as a liaison with service providers, officers, attorneys, and other Trustees generally between meetings. The Board Chair may also perform such
other functions as may be delegated by the Board from time to time. The Board has established seven standing Committees: a Nominating and Governance Committee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c) Committee, a Securities Lending Committee, a Risk Committee,
an Equity Plus Committee and a Fixed Income Plus</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Committee to assist the Board in the oversight and direction of the business
and affairs of the Funds, and from time to time the Board may establish ad hoc committees or informal working groups to review and address the policies and practices of the Funds with respect to certain specified matters. The Chair of each standing
Committee is an Independent Trustee. The role of the Chair of each Committee is to preside at all meetings of the Committee and to act as a liaison with service providers, officers, attorneys and other Trustees between meetings. Each standing
Committee meets regularly to conduct the oversight functions delegated to the Committee by the Board and reports its finding to the Board. The Board and each standing Committee conduct annual assessments of their oversight function and structure.
The Board has determined that the Board’s leadership structure is appropriate because it allows the Board to exercise independent judgment over management and it allocates areas of responsibility among committees of Independent Trustees and
the full Board to enhance effective oversight.</div>
<div>Day-to-day risk management with respect to the Funds is the
responsibility of BFA or other service providers (depending on the nature of the risk), subject to the supervision of BFA. Each Fund is subject to a number of risks, including investment, compliance, operational, reputational, counterparty and
valuation risks, among others. While there are a number of risk management functions performed by BFA and other service providers, as applicable, it is not possible to identify and eliminate all of the risks applicable to the Funds. The Trustees
have an oversight role in this area, satisfying themselves that risk management processes and controls are in place and operating effectively. Risk oversight forms part of the Board’s general oversight of each Fund and is addressed as part of
various Board and committee activities. In some cases, risk management issues are specifically addressed in presentations and discussions. For example, BFA has an independent dedicated Risk and Quantitative Analysis Group (“RQA”) that
assists BFA in managing fiduciary and corporate risks, including investment, operational, counterparty credit and enterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet with the Board to discuss their analysis and methodologies, as well as specific risk
topics such as operational and counterparty risks relating to the Funds. The Board, directly or through a committee, also reviews reports from, among others, management and the independent registered public accounting firm for the Trust, as
appropriate, regarding risks faced by each Fund and management’s risk functions. The Board has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer who oversees the implementation and testing of the Trust's compliance program, including assessments by
independent third parties, and reports to the Board regarding compliance matters for the Trust and its principal service providers. In testing and maintaining the compliance program, the Chief Compliance Officer (and his or her delegates) assesses
key compliance risks affecting each Fund, and addresses them in periodic reports to the Board. In addition, the Audit Committee meets with both the Funds' independent registered public accounting firm and BFA’s internal audit group to review
risk controls in place that support each Fund as well as test results. Board oversight of risk is also performed as needed between meetings through communications between BFA and the Board. The Independent Trustees have engaged independent legal
counsel to assist them in performing their oversight responsibilities. From time to time, the Board may modify the manner in which it conducts risk oversight. The Board’s oversight role does not make it a guarantor of the Funds' investment
performance or other activities.</div> <div></div>
<div>Committees of the Board of Trustees.<font>  The members of the Audit Committee are Richard L. Fagnani (Chair), John E. Kerrigan and Madhav V. Rajan, each of whom is an Independent Trustee. The purposes of the Audit Committee are to assist the Board (i) in
its oversight of the Trust's accounting and financial reporting principles and policies and related controls and procedures maintained by or on behalf of the Trust; (ii) in its oversight of the Trust's financial statements and the independent audit
thereof; (iii) in selecting, evaluating and, where deemed appropriate, replacing the independent accountants (or nominating the independent accountants to be proposed for shareholder approval in any proxy statement); (iv) in evaluating the
independence of the independent accountants; (v) in complying with legal and regulatory requirements that relate to the Trust's accounting and financial reporting, internal controls, compliance controls and independent audits; and (vi) to assume
such other responsibilities as may be delegated by the Board. The Audit Committee met seven times during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018.</font></div>
<div>The members of the Nominating and Governance Committee are
John E. Kerrigan (Chair), Madhav V. Rajan and Drew E. Lawton, each of whom is an Independent Trustee. The Nominating and Governance Committee nominates individuals for Independent Trustee membership on the Board and recommends appointments to the
Advisory Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee functions include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) reviewing the qualifications of any person properly identified or nominated to serve as an Independent Trustee; (ii) recommending
to the Board and current Independent Trustees the nominee(s) for appointment as an Independent Trustee by the Board and current Independent Trustees and/or for election as Independent Trustees by shareholders to fill any vacancy for a position of
Independent Trustee(s) on the Board; (iii) recommending to the Board and current Independent Trustees the size and composition of the Board and Board committees and whether they comply with applicable laws and regulations; (iv) recommending a
current Independent Trustee to the Board and current Independent Trustees to serve as Board Chair; (v) periodic review of the</div> </div> <div type="Block">

met one time during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018.</div>
<div>Each Independent Trustee serves on the 15(c) Committee. The
Chair of the 15(c) Committee is Drew E. Lawton. The principal responsibilities of the 15(c) Committee are to support, oversee and organize on behalf of the Board the process for the annual review and renewal of the Trust's advisory and sub-advisory

information to the Board and the format in which information will be provided; and (ii) considering and discussing with BlackRock, Inc. such other matters and information as may be necessary and appropriate for the Board to evaluate the investment
advisory and sub-advisory agreements of the Trust. The 15(c) Committee met one time during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018.</div>
<div>The members of the Securities Lending Committee are John E.
Martinez (Chair), Jane D. Carlin and Drew E. Lawton, each of whom is an Independent Trustee. The principal responsibilities of the Securities Lending Committee are to support, oversee and organize on behalf of the Board the process for oversight of
the Trust's securities lending activities. These responsibilities include: (i) requesting that certain information be provided to the Committee for its review and consideration prior to such information being provided to the Board; (ii) considering
and discussing with BlackRock, Inc. such other matters and information as may be necessary and appropriate for the Board to oversee the Trust's securities lending activities and make required findings and approvals; and (iii) providing a
recommendation to the Board regarding the annual approval of the Trust's Securities Lending Guidelines and the required findings with respect to, and annual approval of, the Trust's agreement with the securities lending agent. The Securities Lending

investment adviser. Certain activities of BFA, BlackRock, Inc. and the other subsidiaries of BlackRock, Inc. (collectively referred to in this section as “BlackRock”) and PNC and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to in this section
as the “Entities”), and their respective directors, officers</font><font> and employees, with respect to the Funds and/or other accounts managed by BlackRock or Entities, may give rise to actual or perceived
conflicts of interest such as those described below.</font></div>
<div>BlackRock is one of the world's largest asset management
firms. PNC is a diversified financial services organization spanning the retail, business and corporate markets. BlackRock, PNC and their respective subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers and employees, including, in the case
of BlackRock, the business units or entities and personnel who may be involved in the investment activities and business operations of a Fund, are engaged worldwide in businesses, including managing equities, fixed-income securities, cash and
alternative investments, and banking and other financial services, and have interests other than that of managing the Funds. These are considerations of which investors in a Fund should be aware, and which may cause conflicts of interest that could
disadvantage a Fund and its shareholders. These businesses and interests include potential multiple advisory, transactional, financial and other relationships with, or interests in, companies and interests in securities or other instruments that may
be purchased or sold by a Fund.</div> <div>BlackRock and the
Entities have proprietary interests in, and may manage or advise with respect to, accounts or funds (including separate accounts and other funds and collective investment vehicles) that have investment objectives similar to those of a Fund and/or
that engage in transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and instruments as the Fund. BlackRock and Entities are also major participants in the global currency, equities, swap and fixed income markets, in each</div> </div>

<div>case, for the accounts of clients and, in
some cases, on a proprietary basis. As such, BlackRock and Entities are or may be actively engaged in transactions in the same securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests. Such activities could affect the prices and availability
of the securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests, which could have an adverse impact on a Fund's performance. Such transactions, particularly in respect of most proprietary accounts or client accounts, will be executed
independently of a Fund's transactions and thus at prices or rates that may be more or less favorable than those obtained by the Fund.</div>
<div>When BlackRock seeks to purchase or sell the same assets for
managed accounts, including a Fund, the assets actually purchased or sold may be allocated among the accounts on a basis determined in its good faith discretion to be equitable. In some cases, this system may adversely affect the size or price of
the assets purchased or sold for a Fund. In addition, transactions in investments by one or more other accounts managed by BlackRock or Entities may have the effect of diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies
of a Fund, particularly, but not limited to, with respect to small-capitalization, emerging market or less liquid strategies. This may occur with respect to BlackRock-advised accounts when investment decisions regarding a Fund are based on research
or other information that is also used to support decisions for other accounts. When BlackRock implements a portfolio decision or strategy on behalf of another account ahead of, or contemporaneously with, similar decisions or strategies for a Fund,
market impact, liquidity constraints, or other factors could result in the Fund receiving less favorable trading results and the costs of implementing such decisions or strategies could be increased or the Fund could otherwise be disadvantaged.
BlackRock may, in certain cases, elect to implement internal policies and procedures designed to limit such consequences, which may cause a Fund to be unable to engage in certain activities, including purchasing or disposing of securities, when it
might otherwise be desirable for it to do so.</div> <div>Conflicts
may also arise because portfolio decisions regarding a Fund may benefit other accounts managed by BlackRock. For example, the sale of a long position or establishment of a short position by a Fund may impair the price of the same security sold short
by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its other accounts or funds, and the purchase of a security or covering of a short position in a security by a Fund may increase the price of the same security held by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its
other accounts or funds. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, certain Funds may invest their assets in other funds advised by BlackRock, including funds that are managed by one or more of the same portfolio managers, which could
result in conflicts of interest relating to asset allocation, timing of Fund purchases and redemptions, and increased remuneration and profitability for BlackRock, and/or its personnel, including portfolio managers.</div>
<div>In certain circumstances, BlackRock, on behalf of the Funds,
may seek to buy from or sell securities to another fund or account advised by BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is not required to) effect purchases and sales between BlackRock clients (“cross trades”), including the Funds, if BlackRock
believes such transactions are appropriate based on each party's investment objectives and guidelines, subject to applicable law and regulation. There may be potential conflicts of interest or regulatory issues relating to these transactions which
could limit BlackRock’s decision to engage in these transactions for the Funds. BlackRock may have a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities to the parties in such transactions. On any occasion when a Fund
participates in a cross trade, BlackRock will comply with procedures adopted under applicable rules and SEC guidance.</div>
<div>BlackRock and the Entities and their respective clients may
pursue or enforce rights with respect to an issuer in which a Fund has invested, and those activities may have an adverse effect on the Fund. As a result, prices, availability, liquidity and terms of the Fund's investments may be negatively impacted
by the activities of BlackRock or the Entities or their respective clients, and transactions for the Fund may be impaired or effected at prices or terms that may be less favorable than would otherwise have been the case.</div>
<div>The results of a Fund’s investment activities may differ
significantly from the results achieved by BlackRock for its proprietary accounts or other accounts (including investment companies or collective investment vehicles) which it manages or advises. It is possible that one or more accounts managed or
advised by BlackRock and such other accounts will achieve investment results that are substantially more or less favorable than the results achieved by a Fund. Moreover, it is possible that a Fund will sustain losses during periods in which one or
more proprietary or other accounts managed or advised by BlackRock achieve significant profits. The opposite result is also possible.</div>
<div>From time to time, a Fund may be restricted from purchasing or
selling securities, or from engaging in other investment activities because of regulatory, legal or contractual requirements applicable to BlackRock or one or more Entities or other accounts managed or advised by BlackRock or an Entity for clients
worldwide, and/or the internal policies of BlackRock and</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>the Entities designed to comply with such
requirements. As a result, there may be periods, for example, when BlackRock will not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions in certain securities or instruments with respect to which BlackRock and/or one or more Entities are performing
services or when position limits have been reached. For example, the investment activities of BlackRock or one or more Entities for their proprietary accounts and accounts under their management may limit the investment opportunities for a Fund in
certain emerging and other markets in which limitations are imposed upon the amount of investment, in the aggregate or in individual issuers, by affiliated foreign investors.</div>
<div>In connection with its management of a Fund, BlackRock may
have access to certain fundamental analysis and proprietary technical models developed by BlackRock. BlackRock will not be under any obligation, however, to effect transactions on behalf of a Fund in accordance with such analysis and models. In
addition, BlackRock will not have any obligation to make available any information regarding their proprietary activities or strategies, or the activities or strategies used for other accounts managed by them, for the benefit of the management of a
Fund and it is not anticipated that BlackRock will have access to such information for the purpose of managing the Fund. The proprietary activities or portfolio strategies of BlackRock, or the activities or strategies used for accounts managed by
BlackRock or other client accounts could conflict with the transactions and strategies employed by BlackRock in managing a Fund.</div>
<div>The Funds may be included in investment models developed by
BlackRock for use by clients and financial advisors. To the extent clients invest in these investment models and increase the assets under management of the Funds, the investment management fee amounts paid by the Funds to BlackRock may also
increase. The price, availability and liquidity of a Fund may be impacted by purchases and redemptions of the Fund by model-driven investment portfolios.</div>
<div>In addition, certain principals and certain employees of a
Fund’s investment adviser are also principals or employees of other business units or entities within BlackRock. As a result, these principals and employees may have obligations to such other business units or entities or their clients and
such obligations to other business units or entities or their clients may be a consideration of which investors in a Fund should be aware.</div>
<div>BlackRock may enter into transactions and invest in
securities, instruments and currencies on behalf of a Fund in which clients of BlackRock or an Entity, or, to the extent permitted by the SEC and applicable law, BlackRock or an Entity, serves as the counterparty, principal or issuer. In such cases,
such party's interests in the transaction will be adverse to the interests of the Fund, and such party may have no incentive to assure that the Fund obtains the best possible prices or terms in connection with the transactions. In addition, the
purchase, holding and sale of such investments by a Fund may enhance the profitability of BlackRock or an Entity.</div>
<div>BlackRock or one or more Entities may also create, write or
issue derivatives for their clients, the underlying securities, currencies or instruments in which a Fund may invest or which may be based on the performance of the Fund. BlackRock has entered into an arrangement with Markit Indices Limited, the
index provider for underlying fixed-income indexes used by certain iShares funds, related to derivative fixed-income products that are based on such iShares funds. BlackRock will receive certain payments for licensing intellectual property belonging
to BlackRock and for facilitating the provision of data in connection with such derivative products, which may include payments based on the trading volumes of, or revenues generated by, the derivative products. Other funds and accounts managed by
BlackRock may from time to time transact in such derivative products, which could contribute to the viability of such derivative products by making them more appealing to funds and accounts managed by third parties, and in turn lead to increased
payments to BlackRock. Trading activity in such derivative products could also potentially lead to increased purchase activity with respect to these iShares funds and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</div>
<div>A Fund may, subject to applicable law, purchase investments
that are the subject of an underwriting or other distribution by BlackRock or one or more Entities and may also enter into transactions with other clients of BlackRock or an Entity where such other clients have interests adverse to those of the
Fund.</div> <div>At times, these activities may cause business
units or entities within BlackRock or an Entity to give advice to clients that may cause these clients to take actions adverse to the interests of a Fund. To the extent such transactions are permitted, a Fund will deal with BlackRock and/or Entities
on an arm’s-length basis.</div> <div>To the extent authorized
by applicable law, BlackRock or one or more Entities may act as broker, dealer, agent, lender or adviser or in other commercial capacities for a Fund. It is anticipated that the commissions, mark-ups, mark-downs, financial advisory fees,
underwriting and placement fees, sales fees, financing and commitment fees, brokerage fees, other fees, compensation or profits, rates, terms and conditions charged by BlackRock or an Entity will be in its view commercially</div> </div>

<div>reasonable, although BlackRock and each
Entity, including its sales personnel, will have an interest in obtaining fees and other amounts that are favorable to BlackRock or the Entity and such sales personnel, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. Index based funds also may use an
index provider that is affiliated with another service provider of the Fund or BlackRock that acts as a broker, dealer, agent, lender or in other commercial capacities for a Fund or BlackRock.</div>
<div>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock and the Entities (and
their personnel and other distributors) will be entitled to retain fees and other amounts that they receive in connection with their service to the Funds as broker, dealer, agent, lender, adviser or in other commercial capacities. No accounting to
the Funds or their shareholders will be required, and no fees or other compensation payable by the Funds or their shareholders will be reduced by reason of receipt by BlackRock or an Entity of any such fees or other amounts.</div>
<div>When BlackRock or an Entity acts as broker, dealer, agent,
adviser or in other commercial capacities in relation to the Funds, BlackRock or the Entity may take commercial steps in its own interests, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. A Fund will be required to establish business relationships
with its counterparties based on the Fund's own credit standing. BlackRock will not have any obligation to allow its credit to be used in connection with a Fund's establishment of its business relationships, nor is it expected that the Fund's
counterparties will rely on the credit of BlackRock in evaluating the Fund's creditworthiness.</div>
<div>BTC, an affiliate of BFA pursuant to SEC exemptive relief,
acts as securities lending agent to, and receives a share of securities lending revenues from, the Funds. BlackRock will also receive compensation for managing the reinvestment of the cash collateral from securities lending. There are potential
conflicts of interests in managing a securities lending program, including but not limited to: (i) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to increase or decrease the amount of securities on loan or to lend particular securities
in order to generate additional risk-adjusted revenue for BlackRock and its affiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to allocate loans to clients that would provide more revenue to BlackRock. As described
further below, BlackRock seeks to mitigate this conflict by providing its securities lending clients with equal lending opportunities over time in order to approximate pro-rata allocation. </div>
<div>As part of its securities lending program, BlackRock
indemnifies certain clients and/or funds against a shortfall in collateral in the event of borrower default. BlackRock’s RQA calculates, on a regular basis, BlackRock’s potential dollar exposure to the risk of collateral shortfall upon
counterparty default (“shortfall risk”) under the securities lending program for both indemnified and non-indemnified clients. On a periodic basis, RQA also determines the maximum amount of potential indemnified shortfall risk arising
from securities lending activities (“indemnification exposure limit”) and the maximum amount of counterparty-specific credit exposure (“credit limits”) BlackRock is willing to assume as well as the program’s operational
complexity. RQA oversees the risk model that calculates projected shortfall values using loan-level factors such as loan and collateral type and market value as well as specific borrower counterparty credit characteristics. When necessary, RQA may
further adjust other securities lending program attributes by restricting eligible collateral or reducing counterparty credit limits. As a result, the management of the indemnification exposure limit may affect the amount of securities lending
activity BlackRock may conduct at any given point in time and impact indemnified and non-indemnified clients by reducing the volume of lending opportunities for certain loans (including by asset type, collateral type and/or revenue profile).</div>
<div>BlackRock uses a predetermined systematic process in
order to approximate pro-rata allocation over time. In order to allocate a loan to a portfolio: (i) BlackRock as a whole must have sufficient lending capacity pursuant to the various program limits (<font>i.e.,</font>
indemnification exposure limit and counterparty credit limits); (ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset at the time a loan opportunity arrives; and (iii) the lending portfolio must also have enough inventory, either on its own or when
aggregated with other portfolios into one single market delivery, to satisfy the loan request. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to provide equal lending opportunities for all portfolios, independent of whether BlackRock indemnifies the portfolio. Equal
opportunities for lending portfolios does not guarantee equal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-term outcomes for individual clients may vary due to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on different securities, and the overall limits imposed by
the firm.</div> <div></div>
<div>Purchases and sales of securities and other
assets for a Fund may be bunched or aggregated with orders for other BlackRock client accounts, including with accounts that pay different transaction costs solely due to the fact that they have different research payment arrangements. BlackRock,
however, is not required to bunch or aggregate orders if portfolio management decisions for different accounts are made separately, or if they determine that bunching or aggregating is not practicable or required, or in cases involving client
direction.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Prevailing trading activity frequently may make impossible the
receipt of the same price or execution on the entire volume of securities purchased or sold. When this occurs, the various prices may be averaged, and the Funds will be charged or credited with the average price. Thus, the effect of the aggregation
may operate on some occasions to the disadvantage of the Funds. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Funds will not be charged the same commission or commission equivalent rates in connection with a bunched or aggregated order.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock may
select brokers (including, without limitation, certain Entities) that furnish BlackRock, the Funds, other BlackRock client accounts or personnel, directly or through correspondent relationships, with research or other appropriate services which
provide, in BlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to BlackRock in the investment decision-making process (including with respect to futures, fixed-price offerings and OTC transactions). Such research or other services may include, to the extent
permitted by law, research reports on companies, industries and securities; economic and financial data; financial publications; proxy analysis; trade industry seminars; computer data bases; research-oriented software and other services and
products. Research or other services obtained in this manner may be used in servicing any or all of the Funds and other BlackRock client accounts, including in connection with BlackRock client accounts other than those that pay commissions to the
broker relating to the research or other service arrangements. Such products and services may disproportionately benefit other BlackRock client accounts relative to the Funds based on the amount of brokerage commissions paid by the Funds and such
other BlackRock client accounts. For example, research or other services that are paid for through one client's commissions may not be used in managing that client's account. In addition, other BlackRock client accounts may receive the benefit,
including disproportionate benefits, of economies of scale or price discounts in connection with products and services that may be provided to the Funds and to such other BlackRock client accounts. To the extent that BlackRock uses soft dollars, it
will not have to pay for those products and services itself.</div>
<div>BlackRock does not currently enter into arrangements to use
the Funds' assets for, or participate in, soft dollars, although BlackRock may receive research that is bundled with the trade execution, clearing, and/or settlement services provided by a particular broker-dealer. To the extent that BlackRock
receives research on this basis, many of the same conflicts related to traditional soft dollars may exist. For example, the research effectively will be paid by client commissions that also will be used to pay for the execution, clearing, and
settlement services provided by the broker-dealer and will not be paid by BlackRock. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may endeavor to execute trades through brokers who, pursuant to such arrangements, provide research or other
services in order to ensure the continued receipt of research or other services BlackRock believes are useful in its investment decision-making process. BlackRock may from time to time choose not to engage in the above described arrangements to
varying degrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may also enter into commission sharing arrangements under which BlackRock may execute transactions through a broker-dealer, including, where permitted, an Entity, and request that the
broker-dealer allocate a portion of the commissions or commission credits to another firm that provides research to BlackRock. To the extent that BlackRock engages in commission sharing arrangements, many of the same conflicts related to traditional
soft dollars may exist.</div> <div>BlackRock may utilize certain
electronic crossing networks (“ECNs”) (including, without limitation, ECNs in which BlackRock or an Entity has an investment or other interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law) in executing client securities transactions
for certain types of securities. These ECNs may charge fees for their services, including access fees and transaction fees. The transaction fees, which are similar to commissions or markups/markdowns, will generally be charged to clients and, like
commissions and markups/markdowns, would generally be included in the cost of the securities purchased. Access fees may be paid by BlackRock even though incurred in connection with executing transactions on behalf of clients, including the Funds. In
certain circumstances, ECNs may offer volume discounts that will reduce the access fees typically paid by BlackRock. BlackRock will only utilize ECNs consistent with its obligation to seek to obtain best execution in client transactions.</div>
<div>BlackRock has adopted policies and procedures designed to
prevent conflicts of interest from influencing proxy voting decisions that it makes on behalf of advisory clients, including the Funds, and to help ensure that such decisions are made in accordance with BlackRock's fiduciary obligations to its
clients. Nevertheless, notwithstanding such proxy voting policies and procedures, actual proxy voting decisions of BlackRock may have the effect of favoring the interests of other clients or businesses of other divisions or units of BlackRock and/or
an Entity, provided that BlackRock believes such voting decisions to be in accordance with its fiduciary obligations. For a more detailed discussion of these policies and procedures, see the <font>Proxy Voting
Policy</font> section of this SAI.</div> <div>It is also possible

<div>contribute to economies of scale that tend
to reduce the Fund's expense ratio. BlackRock and the Entities reserve the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to sell into the market or redeem in Creation Units through an Authorized Participant at any time some or all of the shares
of a Fund acquired for their own accounts. A large sale or redemption of shares of a Fund by BlackRock or an Entity could significantly reduce the asset size of the Fund, which might have an adverse effect on the Fund's liquidity, investment
flexibility, portfolio diversification, expense ratio or ability to comply with the listing requirements for the Fund. BlackRock seeks to consider the effect of redemptions on a Fund and other shareholders in deciding whether to redeem its shares
but is not obligated to do so and may elect not to do so.</div>
<div>It is possible that a Fund may invest in securities of, or
engage in transactions with, companies with which an Entity has developed or is trying to develop investment banking relationships as well as securities of entities in which BlackRock or an Entity has significant debt or equity investments or other
interests or in which an Entity makes a market. A Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which BlackRock provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of such
issuances. A Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in transactions with, companies to which an Entity provides or may in the future provide research coverage. Such investments or transactions could cause conflicts between the interests of
a Fund and the interests of BlackRock, other clients of BlackRock or an Entity. In making investment decisions for a Fund, BlackRock is not permitted to obtain or use material non-public information acquired by any unit of BlackRock in the course of
these activities. In addition, from time to time, the activities of BlackRock or an Entity may limit a Fund's flexibility in purchases and sales of securities. When an Entity is engaged in an underwriting or other distribution of securities of an
entity, BlackRock may be prohibited from purchasing or recommending the purchase of certain securities of that entity for a Fund. As indicated below, BlackRock or an Entity may engage in transactions with companies in which BlackRock-advised funds
or other clients of BlackRock or of an Entity have an investment.</div>
<div>BlackRock and Chubb Limited (“Chubb”), a public
company whose securities are held by BlackRock-advised funds and other accounts, partially funded the creation of a re-insurance company (“Re Co”) pursuant to which each has approximately a 9.9% ownership interest and each has
representation on the board of directors. Certain employees and executives of BlackRock have a less than ½ of 1% ownership interest in Re Co. BlackRock manages the investment portfolio of Re Co, which is held in a wholly-owned subsidiary. Re Co
participates as a reinsurer with reinsurance contracts underwritten by subsidiaries of Chubb. An independent director of certain BlackRock-advised funds also serves as an independent director of Chubb and has no interest or involvement in the Re Co
transaction.</div> <div></div>
<div>BlackRock and the Entities, their personnel
and other financial service providers may have interests in promoting sales of the Funds. With respect to BlackRock and the Entities and their personnel, the remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of the Funds or other
products may be greater than remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of certain funds or other products that might be provided or offered. BlackRock and the Entities and their sales personnel may directly or indirectly
receive a portion of the fees and commissions charged to the Funds or their shareholders. BlackRock and its advisory or other personnel may also benefit from increased amounts of assets under management. Fees and commissions may also be higher than
for other products or services, and the remuneration and profitability to BlackRock or the Entities and such personnel resulting from transactions on behalf of or management of the Funds may be greater than the remuneration and profitability
resulting from other funds or products.</div> <div>Third
parties, including service providers to BlackRock or a Fund, may sponsor events (including, but not limited to, marketing and promotional activities and presentations, educational training programs and conferences) for registered representatives,
other professionals and individual investors. There is a potential conflict of interest as such sponsorships may defray the costs of such activities to BlackRock, and may provide an incentive to BlackRock to retain such third parties to provide
services to a Fund.</div> <div></div>
<div>BlackRock may provide valuation assistance
to certain clients with respect to certain securities or other investments and the valuation recommendations made for such clients' accounts may differ from the valuations for the same securities or investments assigned by a Fund's pricing vendors,
especially if such valuations are based on broker-dealer quotes or other data sources unavailable to the Fund's pricing vendors. While BlackRock will generally communicate its valuation information or determinations to a Fund's pricing vendors
and/or fund accountants, there may be instances where the Fund's pricing vendors or fund accountants assign a different valuation to a security or other investment than the valuation for such security or investment determined or recommended by
BlackRock.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>As disclosed in more detail in the <font>Determination of Net Asset Value</font> section of each Fund’s Prospectus and this SAI, when market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BlackRock to be unreliable, a Fund’s investments are
valued at fair value by BlackRock in accordance with procedures adopted by the Board. When determining “fair value price,” BlackRock seeks to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of
that asset or liability in an arm’s-length transaction. The price generally may not be determined based on what a Fund might reasonably expect to receive for selling an asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability
to maturity. While fair value determinations will be based upon all available factors that BlackRock deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be based on analytical values determined by BlackRock using proprietary or third-party
valuation models, fair value represents only a good faith approximation of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could have
been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used in determining a Fund’s net asset value. As a result, a Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at net asset value, at a time when a holding or holdings are valued
by BlackRock (pursuant to Board-adopted procedures) at fair value, may have the effect of diluting or increasing the economic interest of existing shareholders and may affect the amount of revenue received by BlackRock with respect to services for
which it receives an asset-based fee.</div> <div>To the
extent permitted by applicable law, a Fund may invest all or some of its short-term cash investments in any money market fund or similarly-managed private fund advised or managed by BlackRock. In connection with any such investments, a Fund, to the
extent permitted by the 1940 Act, may pay its share of expenses of a money market fund or other similarly-managed private fund in which it invests, which may result in a Fund bearing some additional expenses.</div>
<div></div>
<div>BlackRock and its directors, officers and
employees, may buy and sell securities or other investments for their own accounts and may have conflicts of interest with respect to investments made on behalf of a Fund. As a result of differing trading and investment strategies or constraints,
positions may be taken by directors, officers and employees that are the same, different from or made at different times than positions taken for the Fund. To lessen the possibility that a Fund will be adversely affected by this personal trading,
each Fund, BFA and BlackRock have each adopted a code of ethics in compliance with Section 17(j) of the 1940 Act that restricts securities trading in the personal accounts of investment professionals and others who normally come into possession of
information regarding a Fund's portfolio transactions. Each code of ethics is available by contacting BlackRock or by accessing the EDGAR Database on the SEC's Internet site at http://www.sec.gov, and copies may be obtained, after paying a
duplicating fee, by e-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov.</div>
<div>BlackRock will not purchase securities or other property from,
or sell securities or other property to, a Fund, except that a Fund may in accordance with rules or guidance adopted under the 1940 Act engage in transactions with accounts that are affiliated with a Fund as a result of common officers, directors,
or investment advisers or pursuant to exemptive orders granted to the Funds and/or BlackRock by the SEC. These transactions would be effected in circumstances in which BlackRock determined that it would be appropriate for a Fund to purchase and
another client of BlackRock to sell, or a Fund to sell and another client of BlackRock to purchase, the same security or instrument on the same day. From time to time, the activities of a Fund may be restricted because of regulatory requirements
applicable to BlackRock and/or BlackRock's internal policies designed to comply with, limit the applicability of, or otherwise relate to such requirements. A client not advised by BlackRock would not be subject to some of those considerations. There
may be periods when BlackRock may not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions, or may otherwise restrict or limit their advice in certain securities or instruments issued by or related to companies for which BlackRock or an Entity is
performing investment banking, market making, advisory or other services or has proprietary positions. For example, when BlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or risk management services for a company, BlackRock may be prohibited from or limited
in purchasing or selling securities of that company on behalf of a Fund, particularly where such services result in BlackRock obtaining material non-public information about the company (<font>e.g.</font>, in connection
with participation in a creditors’ committee). Similar situations could arise if personnel of BlackRock serve as directors of companies the securities of which a Fund wishes to purchase or sell. However, if permitted by applicable law, and
where consistent with BlackRock’s policies and procedures (including the necessary implementation of appropriate information barriers), the Funds may purchase securities or instruments that are issued by such companies, are the subject of an
underwriting, distribution or advisory assignment by an Entity, or are the subject of an advisory or risk management assignment by BlackRock, or where personnel of BlackRock are directors or officers of the issuer.</div>
<div>The investment activities of BlackRock for their proprietary
accounts and for client accounts may also limit the investment strategies and rights of the Funds. For example, in certain circumstances where the Funds invest in securities issued by companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in
certain emerging or international markets, or are subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or invest in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits</div> </div>

<div>on the aggregate amount invested by
BlackRock for their proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Funds) that may not be exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if exceeded, may cause BlackRock, the Funds or other client
accounts to suffer disadvantages or business restrictions.</div>
<div>If certain aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either
through the actions of BlackRock or a Fund or as a result of third-party transactions, the ability of BlackRock, on behalf of clients (including the Funds), to purchase or dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business
transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. As a result, BlackRock, on behalf of its clients (including the Funds), may limit purchases, sell existing investments, or otherwise restrict, forgo or limit the exercise of rights
(including transferring, outsourcing or limiting voting rights or forgoing the right to receive dividends) when BlackRock, in its sole discretion, deems it appropriate in light of potential regulatory or other restrictions on ownership or other
consequences resulting from reaching investment thresholds.</div>
<div>In those circumstances where ownership thresholds or
limitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks to allocate limited investment opportunities equitably among clients (including the Funds), taking into consideration benchmark weight and investment strategy. BlackRock has adopted certain controls
designed to prevent the occurrence of a breach of any applicable ownership threshold or limits, including, for example, when ownership in certain securities nears an applicable threshold, BlackRock may remove such securities from the list of Deposit
Securities to be delivered to the Fund in connection with purchases of Creation Units of such Fund and may limit purchases in such securities to the issuer's weighting in the applicable benchmark used by BlackRock to manage such Fund. If client
(including Fund) holdings of an issuer exceed an applicable threshold and BlackRock is unable to obtain relief to enable the continued holding of such investments, it may be necessary to sell down these positions to meet the applicable limitations.
In these cases, benchmark overweight positions will be sold prior to benchmark positions being reduced to meet applicable limitations.</div>
<div>In addition to the foregoing, other ownership thresholds may
trigger reporting requirements to governmental and regulatory authorities, and such reports may entail the disclosure of the identity of a client or BlackRock’s intended strategy with respect to such security or asset.</div>
<div></div>
<div>BlackRock may not serve as an Authorized
Participant in the creation and redemption of iShares ETFs.</div>
<div>BlackRock may maintain securities indices. To the extent
permitted by applicable laws, the Funds may seek to license and use such indices as part of their investment strategy. Index based funds that seek to track the performance of securities indices also may use the name of the index or index provider in
the fund name. Index providers, including BlackRock (to the extent permitted by applicable law), may be paid licensing fees for use of their index or index name. BlackRock may benefit from the Funds using BlackRock indices by creating increasing
acceptance in the marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is not obligated to license its indices to any Fund and the Funds are under no obligation to use BlackRock indices. Any Fund that enters into a license for a BlackRock index cannot be assured
that the terms of any index licensing agreement with BlackRock will be as favorable as those terms offered to other licensees.</div>
<div>The custody arrangement described in “Investment
Advisory, Administrative and Distribution Services” may lead to potential conflicts of interest with BlackRock where BlackRock has agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse ordinary operating expenses in order to cap expenses of the Funds (or
where BlackRock charges a unitary management fee). This is because the custody arrangements with certain Funds' custodian may have the effect of reducing custody fees when the Funds leave cash balances uninvested. This could be viewed as having the
potential to provide BlackRock an incentive to keep high positive cash balances for Funds in order to offset fund custody fees that BlackRock might otherwise reimburse or pay. However, BlackRock’s portfolio managers do not intentionally keep
uninvested balances high, but rather make investment decisions that they anticipate will be beneficial to fund performance. For funds without a unitary management fee, when a fund’s actual operating expense ratio exceeds a stated cap, a
reduction in custody fees reduces the amount of waivers and/or reimbursements BlackRock would be required to make to the fund.</div>
<div>BlackRock may enter into contractual arrangements with
third-party service providers to a Fund (<font>e.g.</font>, custodians, administrators and index providers) pursuant to which BlackRock receives fee discounts or concessions in recognition of BlackRock’s overall

<div>provision of services to accounts managed by
BlackRock and funds managed and sponsored by BlackRock, including the Funds, that engage the service provider (typically the custodian). A Fund’s service provider remunerates BlackRock for the use of the systems. A Fund service
provider’s payments to BlackRock for the use of these systems may enhance the profitability of BlackRock.</div>
<div>BlackRock has entered into an arrangement with
Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (“ICE”) to be one of ICE’s development partners in connection with ICE’s intention to launch a new open-architecture, centralized industry platform to facilitate creation and redemption orders
for ETFs (the “ICE Platform”). As a development partner, BlackRock has licensed certain of its intellectual property to ICE. Once the ICE Platform is launched, BlackRock intends to use the ICE Platform to facilitate creations and
redemptions in the Funds and certain other services provided by the ICE Platform. BlackRock may have an incentive to promote the broad adoption of the ICE Platform by the ETF marketplace because BlackRock will earn a fee, based on the total revenues
earned by the ICE Platform, for licensing BlackRock’s intellectual property to ICE and for BlackRock’s role as development partner. ICE Data Services, the underlying index provider for certain BFA managed funds, is a wholly owned
subsidiary of ICE.</div> <div>BlackRock’s receipt of fees
from a service provider in connection with the use of systems provided by BlackRock may create an incentive for BlackRock to recommend that a Fund enter into or renew an arrangement with the service provider.</div>
<div>A Fund from time to time may purchase in the secondary market
(i) certain mortgage pass-through securities packaged and master serviced by PNC Mortgage Securities Corp. (“PNC Mortgage”) or Midland Loan Services, Inc. (“Midland”), or (ii) mortgage-related securities containing loans or
mortgages originated by PNC Bank, National Association (“PNC Bank”) or its affiliates. It is possible that under some circumstances, PNC Mortgage, Midland or other affiliates could have interests that are in conflict with the holders of
these mortgage-backed securities, and such holders could have rights against PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates. For example, if PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates engaged in negligence or willful misconduct in carrying out its duties
as a master servicer, then any holder of the mortgage-backed security could seek recourse against PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates, as applicable. Also, as a master servicer, PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates may make certain
representations and warranties regarding the quality of the mortgages and properties underlying a mortgage-backed security. If one or more of those representations or warranties is false, then the holders of the mortgage backed securities could
trigger an obligation of PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates, as applicable, to repurchase the mortgages from the issuing trust. Finally, PNC Mortgage, Midland or their affiliates may own securities that are subordinate to the senior
mortgage-backed securities owned by a Fund.</div> <div>Present and
future activities of BlackRock (including BFA) and the Entities and their respective directors, officers and employees, in addition to those described in this section, may give rise to additional conflicts of interest.</div>
<div>Legal Proceedings.<font>  On
June 16, 2016, investors (the “Plaintiffs”) in certain iShares funds (iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF, iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF, iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF, iShares Russell Mid-Cap Growth ETF, iShares Russell Mid-Cap ETF,
iShares Russell Mid-Cap Value ETF, iShares Select Dividend ETF, iShares Morningstar Mid-Cap ETF, iShares Morningstar Large-Cap ETF, iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF and iShares U.S. Aerospace &amp; Defense ETF) filed a putative class
action lawsuit against the Trust, BlackRock, Inc. and certain of its advisory affiliates, and certain directors/trustees and officers of the Trust (collectively, “Defendants”) in California State Court. The lawsuit alleges the Defendants
violated federal securities laws by failing to adequately disclose in the prospectuses issued by the funds noted above the risks of using stop-loss orders in the event of a “flash crash,” such as the one that occurred on May 6, 2010. On
September 18, 2017, the court issued a Statement of Decision holding that the Plaintiffs lack standing to assert their claims. On October 11, 2017, the court entered final judgment dismissing all of Plaintiffs’ claims with prejudice.
Plaintiffs have appealed the court’s decision.</font></div>

Mid-Cap Growth ETF, iShares Russell Mid-Cap Value ETF, iShares S&amp;P Mid-Cap 400 Growth ETF, iShares Short-Term Corporate Bond ETF and iShares TIPS Bond ETF. The management fee for the iShares TIPS Bond ETF equals the ratio of the Fund’s net
assets over the aggregate net assets of the above iShares funds multiplied by the amount calculated as follows: 0.2000% per annum of the aggregate net assets less than or equal to $121 billion, plus 0.1900% per annum of the aggregate net assets over

<div>Investment Sub-Adviser.<font>
 Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement between BFA and the Trust entered into on behalf of the Funds, BFA may from time to time, in its sole discretion, to the extent permitted by applicable law, appoint one or more sub-advisers,
including, without limitation, affiliates of BFA, to perform investment advisory services with respect to the Funds. In addition, BFA may delegate certain of its investment advisory functions under the Investment Advisory Agreement to one or more of
its affiliates to the extent permitted by applicable law. BFA may terminate any or all sub-advisers or such delegation arrangements in its sole discretion at any time to the extent permitted by applicable law.</font></div>
<div>BFA has entered into an investment sub-advisory agreement (the
“Sub-Advisory Agreement” and together with the Investment Advisory Agreement, the “Advisory Agreements”) with the Sub-Adviser with respect to the iShares 1-3 Year International Treasury Bond ETF, iShares Core International
Aggregate Bond ETF and iShares International Treasury Bond ETF. The Sub-Adviser is an investment adviser located in the U.K. The Sub-Adviser is an affiliate of BFA and is a registered investment adviser and a commodity pool operator organized in
1999.</div> <div></div> <div></div>
<div>Under the Sub-Advisory Agreement, subject to the supervision
and oversight of the Board and BFA, the Sub-Adviser is primarily responsible for execution of securities transactions outside the U.S. and Canada and may, from time to time, participate in the management of specified assets in each of the iShares
1-3 Year International Treasury Bond ETF's, iShares Core International Aggregate Bond ETF's and iShares International Treasury Bond ETF's portfolio.</div>
<div>Pursuant to the Sub-Advisory Agreement, BFA pays the
Sub-Adviser for services it provides either: (i) a fee equal to a percentage of the management fee paid to BFA under the Investment Advisory Agreement, or (ii) an amount based on the cost of the services provided. If the Sub-Adviser provides
services relating to both portfolio management and trading, it is entitled to receive, from BFA, an amount equal to 20% of BFA’s management fee, and if the Sub-Adviser provides services related solely to trading, then it is entitled to
receive, from BFA, an amount equal to 110% of the actual pre-tax costs incurred by the Sub-Adviser. The Sub-Adviser may be responsible for the day-to-day management of the iShares 1-3 Year International Treasury Bond ETF, iShares Core International
Aggregate Bond ETF and iShares International Treasury Bond ETF or portions of the Funds.</div>

<div>Each of the portfolios or accounts for which the Portfolio
Managers are primarily responsible for the day-to-day management seeks to track the rate of return, risk profile and other characteristics of independent third-party indexes by either replicating the same combination of securities and other
financial instruments that compose those indexes or through a representative sampling of the securities and other financial instruments that compose those indexes based on objective criteria and data. Pursuant to BFA policy, investment opportunities
are allocated equitably among the Funds and other portfolios and accounts. For example, under certain circumstances, an investment opportunity may be restricted due to limited supply in the market, legal constraints or other factors, in which event
the investment opportunity will be allocated equitably among those portfolios and accounts, including the Funds, seeking such investment opportunity. As a consequence, from time to time the Funds may receive a smaller allocation of an investment
opportunity than they would have if the Portfolio Managers and BFA and its affiliates did not manage other portfolios or accounts.</div>
<div>Like the Funds, the other portfolios or accounts for which the
Portfolio Managers are primarily responsible for the day-to-day portfolio management generally pay an asset-based fee to BFA or its affiliates, as applicable, for its advisory services. One or more of those other portfolios or accounts, however, may
pay BFA or its affiliates a performance-based fee in lieu of, or in addition to, an asset-based fee for its advisory services. A portfolio or account with a performance-based fee would pay BFA or its affiliates a portion of that portfolio's or
account's gains, or would pay BFA or its affiliates more for its services than would otherwise be the case if BFA or its affiliates meets or exceeds specified performance targets. Performance-based fee arrangements could present an incentive for BFA
or its affiliates to devote greater resources, and allocate more investment opportunities, to the portfolios or accounts that have those fee arrangements, relative to other portfolios or accounts, in order to earn larger fees. Although BFA and its
affiliates have an obligation to allocate resources and opportunities equitably among portfolios and accounts and intends to do so, shareholders of the Funds should be aware that, as with any group of portfolios and accounts managed by an investment
adviser and/or its affiliates pursuant to varying fee arrangements,</div> </div> <div type="Block">

Manager Compensation Overview</div> <div>BlackRock, Inc.'s
financial arrangements with its portfolio managers, its competitive compensation and its career path emphasis at all levels reflect the value senior management places on key resources. Compensation may include a variety of components and may vary
from year to year based on a number of factors. The principal components of compensation include a base salary, a performance-based discretionary bonus, participation in various benefits programs and one or more of the incentive compensation
programs established by BlackRock, Inc.</div> <div>Base compensation.<font> Generally, portfolio managers receive base compensation based on their position with the firm.</font></div>
<div>Discretionary Incentive Compensation.<font> Discretionary incentive compensation is a function of several components: the performance of BlackRock, Inc., the performance of the portfolio manager's group within BlackRock, Inc. and the individual's performance and
contribution to the overall performance of these portfolios and BlackRock, Inc.</font></div>
<div>Distribution of Discretionary Incentive Compensation.<font> Discretionary incentive compensation is distributed to portfolio managers in a combination of cash and BlackRock, Inc. restricted stock units which vest ratably over a number of years. The BlackRock, Inc. restricted
stock units, if properly vested, will be settled in BlackRock, Inc. common stock. Typically, the cash bonus, when combined with base salary, represents more than 60% of total compensation for the portfolio managers. Paying</font></div> </div>

<div>a portion of annual bonuses in stock puts compensation earned by a portfolio
manager for a given year “at risk” based on BlackRock, Inc.'s ability to sustain and improve its performance over future periods.</div>
<div>Long-Term Incentive Plan Awards — <font>From time to time, long-term incentive equity awards are granted to certain key employees to aid in retention, align their interests with long-term shareholder interests and motivate performance. Equity awards are
generally granted in the form of BlackRock, Inc. restricted stock units that, once vested, settle in BlackRock, Inc. common stock.</font></div>
<div>Other Compensation Benefits.<font>
In addition to base compensation and discretionary incentive compensation, portfolio managers may be eligible to receive or participate in one or more of the following:</font></div> <div></div>
<div>Incentive Savings Plans<font> — BlackRock, Inc. has created a variety of incentive savings plans in which BlackRock, Inc. employees are eligible to participate, including a 401(k) plan, the BlackRock Retirement Savings Plan (“RSP”),
and the BlackRock Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). The employer contribution components of the RSP include a company match equal to 50% of the first 8% of eligible pay contributed to the plan capped at $5,000 per year, and a
company retirement contribution equal to 3-5% of eligible compensation up to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) limit ($275,000 for 2018). The RSP offers a range of investment options, including registered investment companies
and collective investment funds managed by the firm. BlackRock, Inc. contributions follow the investment direction set by participants for their own contributions or, absent participant investment direction, are invested into an index target date
fund that corresponds to, or is closest to, the year in which the participant attains age 65. The ESPP allows for investment in BlackRock, Inc. common stock at a 5% discount on the fair market value of the stock on the purchase date. Annual
participation in the ESPP is limited to the purchase of 1,000 shares of common stock or a dollar value of $25,000 based on its fair market value on the Purchase Date. James Mauro, Scott Radell and Sid Swaminathan are each eligible to participate in
these plans.</font></div> <div>As of October 31, 2018, the

<div>Distributor is a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”), and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”). The Distributor is also licensed as a broker-dealer in all 50 U.S. states, as well as in Puerto Rico, the U.S.
Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia.</div> <div>The
Distribution Agreement for each Fund provides that it may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, on at least 60 days' prior written notice to the other party following (i) the vote of a majority of the Independent Trustees,
or (ii) the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the relevant Fund. The Distribution Agreement will terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).</div>
<div>The Distributor may also enter into agreements with securities
dealers (“Soliciting Dealers”) who will solicit purchases of Creation Units of Fund shares. Such Soliciting Dealers may also be Authorized Participants (as described below), DTC participants and/or investor services organizations.</div>
<div>BFA or its affiliates may, from time to time and from its own
resources, pay, defray or absorb costs relating to distribution, including payments out of its own resources to the Distributor, or to otherwise promote the sale of shares.</div>
<div>Securities Lending.<font>  To
the extent that a Fund engages in securities lending, each Fund conducts its securities lending pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, and BTC acts as securities lending agent for the Funds, subject to the overall supervision of BFA, pursuant to a
written agreement (the “Securities Lending Agency Agreement”).</font></div> <div></div>
<div>Each Fund retains a portion of the
securities lending income and remits the remaining portion to BTC as compensation for its services as securities lending agent. Securities lending income is generally equal to the total of income earned from the reinvestment of cash collateral (and
excludes collateral investment fees as defined below), and any fees or other payments to and from borrowers of securities. As securities lending agent, BTC bears all operational costs directly related to securities lending. Each Fund is responsible
for fees in connection with the investment of cash collateral received for securities on loan in a money market fund managed by BFA (the “collateral investment fees”); however, BTC has agreed to reduce the amount of securities lending
income it receives in order to effectively limit the collateral investment fees the Fund bears to an annual rate of 0.04%. Such money market fund shares will not be subject to a sales load, redemption fee, distribution fee or service fee.</div>
<div>Pursuant to the Securities Lending Agency Agreement:</div>
<div>Through December 31, 2018, (i) fixed-income funds, such as the
Funds, retained 80% of securities lending income (which excludes collateral investment fees) and (ii) this amount could never be less than 70% of the sum of securities lending income plus collateral investment fees. Effective January 1, 2019, (i)
fixed-income funds, such as the Funds, retain 82% of securities lending income (which excludes collateral investment fees) and (ii) this amount can never be less than 70% of the sum of securities lending income plus collateral investment fees.</div>
<div>Under the securities lending program, the Funds are
categorized into one of several specific asset classes. The determination of a Fund’s asset class category (fixed-income, domestic equity, international equity or fund-of-funds), each of which may be subject to a different fee arrangement, is
based on a methodology agreed to by the Trust and BTC.</div> <div></div>
<div>In addition, commencing the business day
following the date that the aggregate securities lending income (which includes, for this purpose, collateral investment fees) earned across the Exchange-Traded Fund Complex (as defined under
“Management<font></font>—<font></font>Trustees and Officers”) in a calendar year exceeds a specified threshold, each applicable fixed-income fund, pursuant to the securities lending
agreement, will receive for the remainder of that calendar year securities lending income as follows:</div>
<div>(i) 85% of securities lending income (which excludes
collateral investment fees) and (ii) this amount can never be less than 70% of the sum of securities lending income plus collateral investment fees.</div> <div></div>
<div>The services provided to the Funds by BTC in
the most recent fiscal year ended October 31, 2018 primarily included the following:</div>
<div>(1) selecting borrowers from an approved
list of borrowers and executing a securities lending agreement as agent on behalf of the Funds with each such borrower; </div>
<div>(2) negotiating the terms of securities
loans, including the amount of fees;</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>(3) directing the delivery of loaned

Affiliates.<font>  BFA and/or its affiliates (“BFA Entities”) may pay certain broker-dealers, registered investment advisers, banks and other financial intermediaries (“Intermediaries”) for
certain activities related to the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products in general. BFA Entities make these payments from their own assets and not from the assets of the Funds. Although a portion of BFA Entities’ revenue comes
directly or indirectly in part from fees paid by the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products, these payments do not increase the price paid by investors for the purchase of shares of, or the cost of owning, the Funds, other iShares
funds or exchange-traded products. BFA Entities make payments for Intermediaries’ participation in activities that are designed to make registered representatives, other professionals and individual investors more knowledgeable about
exchange-traded products, including the Funds and other iShares funds, or for other activities, such as participation in marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and
reporting systems (“Education Costs”). BFA Entities also make payments to Intermediaries for certain printing, publishing and mailing costs or materials relating to the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products
(“Publishing Costs”). In addition, BFA Entities make payments to Intermediaries that make shares of the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products available to their clients, develop new products that feature iShares or
otherwise promote the Funds, other iShares funds and exchange-traded products. BFA Entities may also reimburse expenses or make payments from their own assets to Intermediaries or other persons in consideration of services or other activities that
the BFA Entities believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products. Payments of the type described above are sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing
payments.</font></div> <div>Payments to an Intermediary may be
significant to the Intermediary, and amounts that Intermediaries pay to your salesperson or other investment professional may also be significant for your salesperson or other investment professional. Because an Intermediary may make decisions about
which investment options it will recommend or make available to its clients or what services to provide for various products based on payments it receives or is eligible to receive, such payments may create conflicts of interest between the
Intermediary and its clients and these financial incentives may cause the Intermediary to recommend the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products over other investments. The same conflicts of interest and financial incentives exist with
respect to your salesperson or other investment professional if he or she receives similar payments from his or her Intermediary firm.</div>
<div>In addition to the payments described above, BFA Entities have
developed proprietary tools, calculators and related interactive or digital content that is made available through the www.BlackRock.com website at no additional cost to Intermediaries. BlackRock may configure these tools and calculators and
localizes the content for Intermediaries as part of its customary digital marketing support and promotion of the Funds, other iShares funds, exchange-traded products and BlackRock mutual funds.</div> </div>

<div>As of March 1, 2013, BFA Entities have contractual
arrangements to make payments (in addition to payments for Education Costs or Publishing Costs) to one Intermediary, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC (“FBS”). Effective June 4, 2016, this relationship was expanded to include National
Financial Services, LLC (“NFS”), an affiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this special, long-term and significant arrangement (the “Marketing Program”), FBS, NFS and certain of their affiliates (collectively “Fidelity”)
have agreed, among other things, to actively promote iShares funds to customers, investment professionals and other intermediaries and in advertising campaigns as the preferred exchange-traded product, to offer certain iShares funds in certain
Fidelity platforms and investment programs, in some cases at a waived or reduced commission rate or ticket charge, and to provide marketing data to BFA Entities. BFA Entities have agreed to facilitate the Marketing Program by, among other things,
making certain payments to FBS and NFS for marketing and implementing certain brokerage and investment programs. Upon termination of the arrangement, the BFA Entities will make additional payments to FBS and/or NFS based upon a number of criteria,
including the overall success of the Marketing Program and the level of services provided by FBS and NFS during the wind-down period.</div> <div></div>
<div>In addition, BFA Entities may enter into
other contractual arrangements with Intermediaries and certain other third parties that the BFA Entities believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in iShares funds. Such agreements may include payments by BFA Entities to such
Intermediaries and third parties for data collection and provision, technology support, platform enhancement, or co-marketing and cross-promotional efforts. Payments made pursuant to such arrangements may vary in any year and may be different for
different Intermediaries and third parties. In certain cases, the payments described in the preceding sentence may be subject to certain minimum payment levels. Such payments will not be asset- or revenue-based. As of the date of this SAI, the
Intermediaries and other third parties receiving such contractual payments include: Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Inc., Commonwealth Equity Services, Inc., Dorsey Wright and Associates, LLC, E*Trade Securities LLC, FDx Advisors, Inc., Ladenburg Thalmann
Advisor Network LLC, LPL Financial LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC, Orion Advisors Services, LLC, Pershing LLC, Raymond James Financial Services, Inc., TD Ameritrade, Inc. and UBS
Financial Services Inc. Any additions, modifications, or deletions to Intermediaries and other third parties listed above that have occurred since the date of this SAI are not included in the list.</div>
<div>Further, BFA Entities make Education Costs and Publishing
Costs payments to other Intermediaries that are not listed above. BFA Entities may determine to make such payments based on any number of metrics. For example, BFA Entities may make payments at year-end or other intervals in a fixed amount, an
amount based upon an Intermediary’s services at defined levels or an amount based on the Intermediary’s net sales of one or more iShares funds in a year or other period, any of which arrangements may include an agreed-upon minimum or
maximum payment, or any combination of the foregoing. As of the date of this SAI, BFA anticipates that the payments paid by BFA Entities in connection with the Funds, iShares funds and exchange-traded products in general will be immaterial to BFA
Entities in the aggregate for the next year. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such payments or financial incentives his or her Intermediary firm may
receive. Any payments made, or financial incentives offered, by the BFA Entities to an Intermediary may create the incentive for the Intermediary to encourage customers to buy shares of the Funds, other iShares funds or other exchange-traded
products.</font></div> <div>The Funds may participate in certain
market maker incentive programs of a national securities exchange in which an affiliate of the Funds would pay a fee to the exchange used for the purpose of incentivizing one or more market makers in the securities of a Fund to enhance the liquidity
and quality of the secondary market of securities of a Fund. The fee would then be credited by the exchange to one or more market makers that meet or exceed liquidity and market quality standards with respect to the securities of a Fund. Each market
maker incentive program is subject to approval from the SEC. Any such fee payments made to an exchange will be made by an affiliate of a Fund solely for the benefit of a Fund and will not be paid from any Fund assets. Other funds managed by BFA may
also participate in such programs.</div> <div>Determination of Net
Asset Value</div> <div>Valuation of Shares. <font>The NAV for each Fund is generally calculated as of the close of business on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) (normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each business day the NYSE is open. Valuation of
securities held by a Fund is as follows:</font></div> <div>Equity

<div>“Exchange”) are valued using information obtained via independent
pricing services, generally at the closing price on the Exchange on which the security is primarily traded, or if an Exchange closing price is not available, the last traded price on that Exchange prior to the time as of which a Fund’s assets
or liabilities are valued. However, under certain circumstances, other means of determining current market value may be used. If an equity security is traded on more than one Exchange, the current market value of the security where it is primarily
traded generally will be used. In the event that there are no sales involving an equity security held by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values such security, the prior day’s price will be used, unless, in accordance with valuation procedures
approved by the Board (the “Valuation Procedures”), BlackRock determines in good faith that such prior day’s price no longer reflects the fair value of the security, in which case such asset would be treated as a Fair Value Asset
(as defined below).</div> <div></div>
<div>Fixed-Income Investments. <font>Fixed-income securities for which market quotations are readily available are generally valued using such securities’ current market value. A Fund values fixed-income portfolio securities using the last available
bid prices or current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated prices) supplied by a Fund’s approved independent third-party pricing services, each in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. The pricing services
may use matrix pricing or valuation models that utilize certain inputs and assumptions to derive values, including transaction data (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, recent
representative bids and offers), credit quality information, perceived market movements, news, and other relevant information and by other methods, which may include consideration of: yields or prices of securities of comparable quality, coupon,
maturity and type; indications as to values from dealers; general market conditions; and/or other factors and assumptions. Pricing services generally value fixed-income securities assuming orderly transactions of an institutional round lot size, but
a Fund may hold or transact in such securities in smaller, odd lot sizes. Odd lots may trade at lower prices than institutional round lots. The amortized cost method of valuation may be used with respect to debt obligations with sixty days or less
remaining to maturity unless BlackRock determines in good faith that such method does not represent fair value. Loan participation notes are generally valued at the mean of the last available bid prices from one or more brokers or dealers as
obtained from independent third-party pricing services. Certain fixed-income investments, including asset-backed and mortgage-related securities, may be valued based on valuation models that consider the estimated cash flows of each tranche of the
entity, establish a benchmark yield and develop an estimated tranche-specific spread to the benchmark yield based on the unique attributes of the tranche.</font></div>
<div>Options, Futures, Swaps and Other Derivatives. <font>Exchange-traded equity options for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the mean of the last bid and ask prices as quoted on the Exchange or the board of trade on which such options are traded. In
the event that there is no mean price available for an exchange traded equity option held by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values such option, the last bid (long positions) or ask (short positions) price, if available, will be used as the value of
such option. If no such bid or ask price is available on a day on which a Fund values such option, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BlackRock determines in good faith that such prior day’s price no longer reflects the fair
value of the option, in which case such option will be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below). OTC derivatives are valued using the last available bid prices or current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated
prices) supplied by a Fund’s approved independent third-party pricing services, each in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. OTC derivatives may be valued using a mathematical model which may incorporate a number of market data factors.
Financial futures contracts and options thereon, which are traded on exchanges, are valued at their settle price as of the close of such exchanges. Swap agreements and other derivatives are generally valued daily based upon quotations from market
makers or by a pricing service in accordance with the Valuation Procedures.</font></div>
<div>Underlying Funds. <font>Shares of
underlying ETFs will be valued at their most recent closing price on an Exchange. Shares of underlying money market funds will be valued at their NAV.</font></div>
<div>General Valuation Information.
<font>The price a Fund could receive upon the sale of any particular portfolio investment may differ from a Fund’s valuation of the investment, particularly for securities that trade in thin or volatile markets or
that are valued using a fair valuation methodology or a price provided by an independent pricing service. As a result, the price received upon the sale of an investment may be less than the value ascribed by a Fund, and a Fund could realize a
greater than expected loss or lesser than expected gain upon the sale of the investment. A Fund’s ability to value its investment may also be impacted by technological issues and/or errors by pricing services or other third-party service
providers.</font></div> <div>All cash, receivables and current
payables are carried on a Fund’s books at their face value.</div>
<div>Prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services,
broker-dealers or market makers to value a Fund’s securities and other assets and liabilities are based on information available at the time a Fund values its assets and liabilities. In the</div> </div>

<div>event that a pricing service quotation is revised or updated subsequent to
the day on which a Fund valued such security or other asset or liability, the revised pricing service quotation generally will be applied prospectively. Such determination will be made considering pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding the
revision.</div> <div>In the event that application of the methods
of valuation discussed above result in a price for a security which is deemed not to be representative of the fair market value of such security, the security will be valued by, under the direction of or in accordance with a method approved by the
Board as reflecting fair value. All other assets and liabilities (including securities for which market quotations are not readily available) held by a Fund (including restricted securities) are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by
the Board or by BlackRock (its delegate) pursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any assets and liabilities that are denominated in a foreign currency are converted into U.S. dollars using prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by
one or more data service providers.</div> <div>Certain of the
securities acquired by a Fund may be traded on foreign exchanges or OTC markets on days on which a Fund’s NAV is not calculated. In such cases, the NAV of a Fund’s shares may be significantly affected on days when Authorized Participants
can neither purchase nor redeem shares of a Fund.</div>
<div>Generally, trading in non-U.S. securities, U.S. government
securities, money market instruments and certain fixed-income securities is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of business on the NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of a Fund are
determined as of such times.</div> <div>Use of fair value prices
and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate a Fund’s NAV and the prices used in the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between a Fund’s performance
and the performance of the Underlying Index.</div> <div>Fair Value.<font> When market quotations are not readily available or are believed in good faith by BlackRock to be unreliable, a Fund’s investments are valued at fair value (“Fair Value Assets”). Fair Value Assets are
valued by BlackRock in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. BlackRock may reasonably conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if, among other things, a security or other asset or liability does not have a price
source due to its complete lack of trading, if BlackRock believes in good faith that a market quotation from a broker-dealer or other source is unreliable (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, where it varies significantly from a recent trade, or no longer reflects the fair value of the security or other asset or liability subsequent to the most recent market quotation), or where the security or other asset
or liability is only thinly traded or due to the occurrence of a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation. For this purpose, a “significant event” is deemed to occur if BlackRock determines, in its reasonable
business judgment, that an event has occurred after the close of trading for an asset or liability but prior to or at the time of pricing a Fund’s assets or liabilities, and that the event is likely to cause a material change to the closing
market price of the assets or liabilities held by a Fund. Non-U.S. securities whose values are affected by volatility that occurs in the markets or in related or highly correlated assets
(</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, American Depositary Receipts, Global Depositary Receipts or ETFs that invest in components of the Underlying Index) on a trading day after the
close of non-U.S. securities markets may be fair valued. On any day the NYSE is open and a foreign market or the primary exchange on which a foreign asset or liability is traded is closed, such asset or liability will be valued using the prior
day’s price, provided that BlackRock is not aware of any significant event or other information that would cause such price to no longer reflect the fair value of the asset or liability, in which case such asset or liability would be treated
as a Fair Value Asset.</font></div> <div>BlackRock, with input from
the BlackRock Investment Strategy Group, will submit its recommendations regarding the valuation and/or valuation methodologies for Fair Value Assets to BlackRock’s Valuation Committee. The BlackRock Valuation Committee may accept, modify or
reject any recommendations. In addition, a Fund’s accounting agent periodically endeavors to confirm the prices it receives from all third-party pricing services, index providers and broker-dealers, and, with the assistance of BlackRock, to
regularly evaluate the values assigned to the securities and other assets and liabilities of a Fund. The pricing of all Fair Value Assets is subsequently reported to and, where appropriate, ratified by the Board.</div>
<div>When determining the price for a Fair Value Asset, the
BlackRock Valuation Committee (or BlackRock’s Pricing Group) will seek to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect to receive upon the current sale of that asset or liability in an arm’s-length transaction on the date on
which the assets or liabilities are being valued, and does not seek to determine the price that a Fund might expect to receive for selling the asset, or the cost of extinguishing a liability, at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to
maturity. Fair value determinations will be based upon all available factors that the BlackRock Valuation Committee (or BlackRock’s Pricing Group) deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be based on analytical values
determined by BlackRock using proprietary or third-party valuation models.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value
of an asset or liability. When determining the fair value of an asset, one or more of a variety of fair valuation methodologies may be used (depending on certain factors, including the asset type). For example, the asset may be priced on the basis
of the original cost of the investment or, alternatively, using proprietary or third-party models (including models that rely upon direct portfolio management pricing inputs and which reflect the significance attributed to the various factors and
assumptions being considered). Prices of actual, executed or historical transactions in the relevant asset and/or liability (or related or comparable assets and/or liabilities) or, where appropriate, an appraisal by a third-party experienced in the
valuation of similar assets and/or liabilities, may also be used as a basis for establishing the fair value of an asset or liability. The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in retrospect, be the price at which those assets or
liabilities could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a holding or holdings are valued
at fair value, may have the effect of diluting or increasing the economic interest of existing shareholders.</div>
<div>Each Fund’s annual audited financial statements, which
are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”), follow the requirements for valuation set forth in Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards
Codification Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC 820”), which defines and establishes a framework for measuring fair value under US GAAP and expands financial statement disclosure requirements relating
to fair value measurements. Generally, ASC 820 and other accounting rules applicable to funds and various assets in which they invest are evolving. Such changes may adversely affect a Fund. For example, the evolution of rules governing the
determination of the fair market value of assets or liabilities to the extent such rules become more stringent would tend to increase the cost and/or reduce the availability of third-party determinations of fair market value. This may in turn
increase the costs associated with selling assets or affect their liquidity due to a Fund’s inability to obtain a third-party determination of fair market value.</div>
<div>Brokerage Transactions</div>
<div>Subject to policies established by the Board, BFA is primarily
responsible for the execution of a Fund’s portfolio transactions and the allocation of brokerage. BFA does not execute transactions through any particular broker or dealer, but seeks to obtain the best net results for the Funds, taking into
account such factors as price (including the applicable brokerage commission or dealer spread), size of order, difficulty of execution, operational facilities of the firm and the firm’s risk and skill in positioning blocks of securities. While
BFA generally seeks reasonable trade execution costs, a Fund does not necessarily pay the lowest spread or commission available, and payment of the lowest commission or spread is not necessarily consistent with obtaining the best price and execution
in particular transactions. Subject to applicable legal requirements, BFA may select a broker based partly upon brokerage or research services provided to BFA and its clients, including a Fund. In return for such services, BFA may cause a Fund to
pay a higher commission than other brokers would charge if BFA determines in good faith that the commission is reasonable in relation to the services provided.</div>
<div>In selecting brokers or dealers to execute portfolio
transactions, BFA seeks to obtain the best price and most favorable execution for a Fund and may take into account a variety of factors including: (i) the size, nature and character of the security or instrument being traded and the markets in which
it is purchased or sold; (ii) the desired timing of the transaction; (iii) BFA’s knowledge of the expected commission rates and spreads currently available; (iv) the activity existing and expected in the market for the particular security or
instrument, including any anticipated execution difficulties; (v) the full range of brokerage services provided; (vi) the broker’s or dealer’s capital; (vii) the quality of research and research services provided; (viii) the
reasonableness of the commission, dealer spread or its equivalent for the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA’s knowledge of any actual or apparent operational problems of a broker or dealer. Brokers may also be selected because of their
ability to handle special or difficult executions, such as may be involved in large block trades, less liquid securities, or other circumstances.</div>
<div>Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act (“Section 28(e)”)
permits a U.S. investment adviser, under certain circumstances, to cause an account to pay a broker or dealer a commission for effecting a transaction in securities that exceeds the amount another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting
the same transaction in recognition of the value of brokerage and research services provided by that broker or dealer. This includes commissions paid on riskless principal transactions in securities under certain conditions.</div> </div>

<div>From time to time, a Fund may purchase new issues of
securities in a fixed price offering. In these situations, the broker may be a member of the selling group that will, in addition to selling securities, provide BFA with research services. FINRA has adopted rules expressly permitting these types of
arrangements under certain circumstances. Generally, the broker will provide research “credits” in these situations at a rate that is higher than that available for typical secondary market transactions. These arrangements may not fall
within the safe harbor of Section 28(e).</div> <div>Certain of the
Funds anticipate that brokerage transactions involving foreign equity securities generally will be conducted primarily on the principal stock exchanges of the applicable country. Foreign equity securities may be held by the Funds in the form of
depositary receipts, or other securities convertible into foreign equity securities. Depositary receipts may be listed on stock exchanges, or traded in OTC markets in the U.S. or Europe, as the case may be. American Depositary Receipts, like other
securities traded in the U.S., will be subject to negotiated commission rates.</div>
<div>OTC issues, including most fixed-income securities such as
corporate debt and U.S. Government securities, are normally traded on a “net” basis without a stated commission, through dealers acting for their own account and not as brokers. The Funds will primarily engage in transactions with these
dealers or deal directly with the issuer unless a better price or execution could be obtained by using a broker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect to both foreign and domestic securities will generally include a “spread,” which is the
difference between the prices at which the dealer is willing to purchase and sell the specific security at the time, and includes the dealer’s normal profit.</div> <div></div>
<div>Under the 1940 Act, persons affiliated with
a Fund and persons who are affiliated with such affiliated persons are prohibited from dealing with the Fund as principal in the purchase and sale of securities unless a permissive order allowing such transactions is obtained from the SEC. Since
transactions in the OTC market usually involve transactions with the dealers acting as principal for their own accounts, the Funds will not deal with affiliated persons and affiliated persons of such affiliated persons in connection with such
transactions. The Funds will not purchase securities during the existence of any underwriting or selling group relating to such securities of which BFA, BRIL or any affiliated person (as defined in the 1940 Act) thereof is a member except pursuant
to procedures adopted by the Board in accordance with Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 Act.</div>
<div>Purchases of money market instruments by the Funds are made
from dealers, underwriters and issuers. The Funds do not currently expect to incur any brokerage commission expense on such transactions because money market instruments are generally traded on a “net” basis with dealers acting as
principal for their own accounts without a stated commission. The price of the security, however, usually includes a profit to the dealer.</div>
<div>BFA may, from time to time, effect trades on behalf of and for
the account of the Funds with brokers or dealers that are affiliated with BFA, in conformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under these provisions, any commissions paid to affiliated brokers or dealers must be
reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by other brokers or dealers in comparable transactions.</div>
<div>Securities purchased in underwritten offerings include a fixed
amount of compensation to the underwriter, generally referred to as the underwriter’s concession or discount. When securities are purchased or sold directly from or to an issuer, no commissions or discounts are paid.</div>
<div>Investment decisions for the Funds and for other investment
accounts managed by BFA and the other Affiliates are made independently of each other in light of differing conditions. A variety of factors will be considered in making investment allocations. These factors include: (i) investment objectives or
strategies for particular accounts, including sector, industry, country or region and capitalization weightings; (ii) tax considerations of an account; (iii) risk or investment concentration parameters for an account; (iv) supply or demand for a
security at a given price level; (v) size of available investment; (vi) cash availability and liquidity requirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory restrictions; (viii) minimum investment size of an account; (ix) relative size of account; and (x)
such other factors as may be approved by BlackRock’s general counsel. Moreover, investments may not be allocated to one client account over another based on any of the following considerations: (i) to favor one client account at the expense of
another; (ii) to generate higher fees paid by one client account over another or to produce greater performance compensation to BlackRock; (iii) to develop or enhance a relationship with a client or prospective client; (iv) to compensate a client
for past services or benefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce future services or benefits to be rendered to BlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize investment performance among different client accounts. BFA and the other Affiliates may deal,
trade and invest for their own respective accounts in the types of securities in which the Funds may invest.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Initial public offerings (“IPOs”) of securities
may be over-subscribed and subsequently trade at a premium in the secondary market. When BFA is given an opportunity to invest in such an initial offering or “new” or “hot” issue, the supply of securities available for client
accounts is often less than the amount of securities the accounts would otherwise take. In order to allocate these investments fairly and equitably among client accounts over time, each portfolio manager or a member of his or her respective
investment team will indicate to BFA’s trading desk their level of interest in a particular offering with respect to eligible clients’ accounts for which that team is responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities will be identified as
eligible for particular client accounts that are managed by portfolio teams who have indicated interest in the offering based on market capitalization of the issuer of the security and the investment mandate of the client account and in the case of
international equity securities, the country where the offering is taking place and the investment mandate of the client account. Generally, shares received during the IPO will be allocated among participating client accounts within each investment
mandate on a <font>pro rata</font> basis. This <font>pro rata</font> allocation may result in a Fund receiving less of a particular security than if pro-rating had not occurred. All allocations
of securities will be subject, where relevant, to share minimums established for accounts and compliance constraints. In situations where supply is too limited to be allocated among all accounts for which the investment is eligible, portfolio
managers may rotate such investment opportunities among one or more accounts so long as the rotation system provides for fair access for all client accounts over time. Other allocation methodologies that are considered by BFA to be fair and
equitable to clients may be used as well.</div> <div>Because
different accounts may have differing investment objectives and policies, BFA may buy and sell the same securities at the same time for different clients based on the particular investment objective, guidelines and strategies of those accounts. For
example, BFA may decide that it may be entirely appropriate for a growth fund to sell a security at the same time a value fund is buying that security. To the extent that transactions on behalf of more than one client of BFA or the other Affiliates
during the same period may increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, there may be an adverse effect on price. For example, sales of a security by BlackRock on behalf of one or more of its clients may
decrease the market price of such security, adversely impacting other BlackRock clients that still hold the security. If purchases or sales of securities arise for consideration at or about the same time that would involve the Funds or other clients
or funds for which BFA or another Affiliate act as investment manager, transactions in such securities will be made, insofar as feasible, for the respective funds and clients in a manner deemed equitable to all.</div>
<div>In certain instances, BFA may find it efficient for purposes
of seeking to obtain best execution, to aggregate or “bunch” certain contemporaneous purchases or sale orders of its advisory accounts and advisory accounts of affiliates. In general, all contemporaneous trades for client accounts under
management by the same portfolio manager or investment team will be bunched in a single order if the trader believes the bunched trade would provide each client with an opportunity to achieve a more favorable execution at a potentially lower
execution cost. The costs associated with a bunched order will be shared <font>pro rata</font> among the clients in the bunched order. Generally, if an order for a particular portfolio manager or management team is filled
at several different prices through multiple trades, all accounts participating in the order will receive the average price (except in the case of certain international markets where average pricing is not permitted). While in some cases this
practice could have a detrimental effect upon the price or value of the security as far as the Funds are concerned, in other cases it could be beneficial to the Funds. Transactions effected by BFA or the other Affiliates on behalf of more than one
of its clients during the same period may increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, causing an adverse effect on price. The trader will give the bunched order to the broker-dealer that the trader has
identified as being able to provide the best execution of the order. Orders for purchase or sale of securities will be placed within a reasonable amount of time of the order receipt and bunched orders will be kept bunched only long enough to execute
the order.</div> <div>The table below sets forth the brokerage
commissions paid by each Fund for the fiscal years noted. Any differences in brokerage commissions paid by a Fund from year to year are principally due to increases or decreases in that Fund’s assets over those periods or the
magnitude of changes to the components of a Fund's Underlying Index:</div> <div>

<div>The Funds' purchase and sale orders for securities may be
combined with those of other investment companies, clients or accounts that BlackRock manages or advises. If purchases or sales of portfolio securities of the Funds and one or more other accounts managed or advised by BlackRock are considered at or
about the same time, transactions in such securities are allocated among the Funds and the other accounts in a manner deemed equitable to all by BlackRock. In some cases, this procedure could have a detrimental effect on the price or volume of the
security as far as the Funds are concerned. However, in other cases, it is possible that the ability to participate in volume transactions and to negotiate lower transaction costs will be beneficial to the Funds. BlackRock may deal, trade and invest
for its own account in the types of securities in which the Funds may invest. BlackRock may, from time to time, effect trades on behalf of and for the account of the Funds with brokers or dealers that are affiliated with BFA, in conformity with the
1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under these provisions, any commissions paid to affiliated brokers or dealers must be reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by other brokers or dealers in comparable transactions. The Funds
will not deal with affiliates in principal transactions unless permitted by applicable SEC rules or regulations, or by SEC exemptive order.</div> <div></div>
<div>Portfolio turnover may vary from year to
year, as well as within a year. Certain Funds may use TBA transactions, which are expected to cause a higher portfolio turnover rate because TBA positions are rolled every month. High turnover rates may result in comparatively greater brokerage
expenses. While each Fund's portfolio turnover rates are generally expected to be low, the portfolio turnover rate for that portion of the iShares Core 1-5 Year USD Bond ETF's, iShares Edge U.S. Fixed Income Balanced Risk ETF's and iShares GNMA Bond
ETF's assets invested through TBA transactions, if any, is expected to be substantially higher. Higher turnover rates would likely result in comparatively greater transaction costs.</div>
<div>The tables below set forth the portfolio turnover rates of
each Fund for the fiscal years noted:</div> <div>

<div>Additional Information Concerning the Trust</div>
<div></div>
<div>Shares.<font>
 The Trust currently consists of more than 270 separate investment series or portfolios called funds. The Trust issues shares of beneficial interests in the funds with no par value. The Board may designate additional iShares funds.</font></div>
<div>Each share issued by a fund has a <font>pro rata</font> interest in the assets of that fund. Shares have no preemptive, exchange, subscription or conversion rights and are freely transferable. Each share is entitled to participate equally in dividends and
distributions declared by the Board with respect to the relevant fund, and in the net distributable assets of such fund on liquidation.</div>
<div>Each share has one vote with respect to matters upon which the
shareholder is entitled to vote. In any matter submitted to shareholders for a vote, each fund shall hold a separate vote, provided that shareholders of all affected funds will vote together when: (i) required by the 1940 Act, or (ii) the Trustees
determine that the matter affects the interests of more than one fund.</div>
<div>Under Delaware law, the Trust is not required to hold an
annual meeting of shareholders unless required to do so under the 1940 Act. The policy of the Trust is not to hold an annual meeting of shareholders unless required to do so under the 1940 Act. All shares (regardless of the fund) have noncumulative
voting rights in the election of members of the Board. Under Delaware law, Trustees of the Trust may be removed by vote of the shareholders.</div>
<div>Following the creation of the initial Creation Unit(s) of
shares of a fund and immediately prior to the commencement of trading in such fund’s shares, a holder of shares may be a “control person” of the fund, as defined in Rule 0-1 under the 1940 Act. A fund cannot predict the length of
time for which one or more shareholders may remain a control person of the fund.</div>
<div>Shareholders may make inquiries by writing to iShares Trust,
c/o BlackRock Investments, LLC, 1 University Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</div>
<div>Absent an applicable exemption or other relief from the SEC or
its staff, beneficial owners of more than 5% of the shares of a fund may be subject to the reporting provisions of Section 13 of the 1934 Act and the SEC’s rules promulgated thereunder. In addition, absent an applicable exemption or other
relief from the SEC or its staff, officers and trustees of a fund and beneficial owners of 10% of the shares of a fund (“Insiders”) may be subject to the insider reporting, short-swing profit and short sale provisions of Section 16 of
the 1934 Act and the SEC’s rules promulgated thereunder. Beneficial owners and Insiders should consult with their own legal counsel concerning their obligations under Sections 13 and 16 of the 1934 Act and existing guidance provided by the SEC
staff.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>In accordance with the Trust's current
Agreement and Declaration of Trust (the “Declaration of Trust”), the Board may, without shareholder approval (unless such shareholder approval is required by the Declaration of Trust or applicable law, including the 1940 Act), authorize
certain funds to merge, reorganize, consolidate, sell all or substantially all of their assets, or take other similar actions with, to or into another fund.  The Trust or a fund may be terminated by a majority vote of the Board, subject to the
affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders of the Trust or such fund entitled to vote on termination; however, in certain circumstances described in the Declaration of Trust, only a majority vote of the Board is required. Although the shares
are not automatically redeemable upon the occurrence of any specific event, the Declaration of Trust provides that the Board will have the unrestricted power to alter the number of shares in a Creation Unit. Therefore, in the event of a termination
of the Trust or a fund, the Board, in its sole discretion, could determine to permit the shares to be redeemable in aggregations smaller than Creation Units or to be individually redeemable. In such circumstance, the Trust or a fund may make
redemptions in-kind, for cash or for a combination of cash or securities. Further, in the event of a termination of the Trust or a fund, the Trust or a fund might elect to pay cash redemptions to all shareholders, with an in-kind election for
shareholders owning in excess of a certain stated minimum amount.</div>
<div>DTC as Securities Depository for Shares of the Funds.<font>  Shares of each Fund are represented by securities registered in the name of DTC or its nominee and deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC.</font></div>
<div>DTC was created in 1973 to enable electronic movement of
securities between its participants (“DTC Participants”), and NSCC was established in 1976 to provide a single settlement system for securities clearing and to serve as CCP for securities trades among DTC Participants. In 1999, DTC and
NSCC were consolidated within The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”) and became wholly-owned subsidiaries of DTCC. The common stock of DTCC is owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and FINRA, through subsidiaries,
hold preferred shares in DTCC that provide them with the right to elect one member each to the DTCC board of directors. Access to the DTC system is available to entities, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies, that clear through or
maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”).</div>
<div>Beneficial ownership of shares is limited to DTC Participants,
Indirect Participants and persons holding interests through DTC Participants and Indirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in shares (owners of such beneficial interests are referred to herein as “Beneficial Owners”) is
shown on, and the transfer of ownership is effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on the records of DTC Participants (with respect to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners that are not DTC
Participants). Beneficial Owners will receive from or through the DTC Participant a written confirmation relating to their purchase of shares. The laws of some jurisdictions may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of
such securities in definitive form. Such laws may impair the ability of certain investors to acquire beneficial interests in shares of the Fund.</div>
<div>Conveyance of all notices, statements and other communications
to Beneficial Owners is effected as follows. Pursuant to the Depositary Agreement between the Trust and DTC, DTC is required to make available to the Trust upon request and for a fee to be charged to the Trust a listing of the shares of each Fund
held by each DTC Participant. The Trust shall inquire of each such DTC Participant as to the number of Beneficial Owners holding shares, directly or indirectly, through such DTC Participant. The Trust shall provide each such DTC Participant with
copies of such notice, statement or other communication, in such form, number and at such place as such DTC Participant may reasonably request, in order that such notice, statement or communication may be transmitted by such DTC Participant,
directly or indirectly, to such Beneficial Owners. In addition, the Trust shall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair and reasonable amount as reimbursement for the expenses attendant to such transmittal, all subject to applicable statutory and
regulatory requirements.</div> <div>Share distributions shall be
made to DTC or its nominee, Cede &amp; Co., as the registered holder of all shares of the Trust. DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any such distributions, shall credit immediately DTC Participants’ accounts with payments in amounts
proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in shares of each Fund as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. Payments by DTC Participants to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners of shares held through such DTC Participants
will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in a “street name,” and will be the responsibility of such DTC
Participants.</div> <div>The Trust has no responsibility or
liability for any aspect of the records relating to or notices to Beneficial Owners, or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in such shares, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial
ownership interests, or for any other aspect of the relationship between DTC and the DTC Participants or the relationship between such DTC Participants and the Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners owning</div> </div>

<div>through such DTC Participants. DTC may decide to discontinue providing its
service with respect to shares of the Trust at any time by giving reasonable notice to the Trust and discharging its responsibilities with respect thereto under applicable law. Under such circumstances, the Trust shall take action to find a
replacement for DTC to perform its functions at a comparable cost.</div>
<div>Distribution of Shares.<font>
 In connection with each Fund's launch, each Fund was seeded through the sale of one or more Creation Units by each Fund to one or more initial investors. Initial investors participating in the seeding may be Authorized Participants, a lead
market maker or other third party investor or an affiliate of each Fund or each Fund’s adviser. Each such initial investor may sell some or all of the shares underlying the Creation Unit(s) held by them pursuant to the registration statement
for each Fund (each, a “Selling Shareholder”), which shares have been registered to permit the resale from time to time after purchase. Each Fund will not receive any of the proceeds from the resale by the Selling Shareholders of these
shares.</font></div> <div>Selling Shareholders may sell shares
owned by them directly or through broker-dealers, in accordance with applicable law, on any national securities exchange on which the shares may be listed or quoted at the time of sale, through trading systems, in the OTC market or in transactions
other than on these exchanges or systems at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale, at varying prices determined at the time of sale, or at negotiated prices. These sales may be effected through brokerage transactions,
privately negotiated trades, block sales, entry into options or other derivatives transactions or through any other means authorized by applicable law. Selling Shareholders may redeem the shares held in Creation Unit size by them through an
Authorized Participant.</div> <div>Any Selling Shareholder and any
broker-dealer or agents participating in the distribution of shares may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the 1933 Act, in connection with such sales.</div>
<div>Any Selling Shareholder and any other person participating in
such distribution will be subject to applicable provisions of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.</div>
<div>Creation and Redemption of Creation Units</div>
<div></div>
<div>General.<font>
 The Trust issues and sells shares of each Fund only in Creation Units on a continuous basis through the Distributor or its agent, without a sales load, at a price based on each Fund's NAV next determined after receipt, on any Business Day
(as defined below), of an order received by the Distributor or its agent in proper form. On days when the applicable Listing Exchange or the bond markets close earlier than normal, a Fund may require orders to be placed earlier in the day. The
following table sets forth the number of shares of a Fund that constitute a Creation Unit for such Fund and the approximate value of such Creation Unit as of November 30, 2018:</font></div> <div>

Trust reserves the right to increase or decrease the number of a Fund’s shares that constitute a Creation Unit. The Board reserves the right to declare a split or a consolidation in the number of shares outstanding of any Fund, and to make a
corresponding change in the number of shares constituting a Creation Unit, in the event that the per share price in the secondary market rises (or declines) to an amount that falls outside the range deemed desirable by the Board.</div>
<div>A “Business Day” with respect to each Fund is any
day on which the Listing Exchange on which the Fund is listed for trading is open for business. As of the date of this SAI, each Listing Exchange observes the following holidays, as observed: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents'
Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.</div>
<div>Fund Deposit.<font>  The
consideration for purchase of Creation Units of a Fund (except for the iShares Core International Aggregate Bond ETF and iShares GNMA Bond ETF (each, a “Cash Fund” and collectively, the “Cash Funds”), which are generally
offered in Creation Units solely for cash), generally consists of Deposit Securities and the Cash Component computed as described below. Together, the Deposit Securities and the Cash Component constitute the “Fund Deposit,” which, when
combined with the Fund's portfolio securities, is designed to generate performance that has a collective investment profile similar to that of the Underlying Index. The Fund Deposit represents the minimum initial and subsequent investment amount for
a Creation Unit of any Fund.</font></div> <div>The “Cash
Component” is an amount equal to the difference between the NAV of the shares (per Creation Unit) and the “Deposit Amount,” which is an amount equal to the market value of the Deposit Securities, and serves to compensate for any
differences between the NAV per Creation Unit and the Deposit Amount. Payment of any stamp duty or other similar fees and expenses payable upon transfer of beneficial ownership of the Deposit Securities are the sole responsibility of the Authorized
Participant purchasing the Creation Unit.</div> <div></div>
<div>Each Cash Fund's current policy is to accept
cash in substitution for the Deposit Securities it might otherwise accept as in-kind consideration for the purchase of Creation Units. A Cash Fund may, at times, elect to receive Deposit Securities (<font>i.e.</font>, the
in-kind deposit of a designated portfolio of securities) and a Cash Component as consideration for the purchase of Creation Units. If a Cash Fund elects to accept Deposit Securities, a purchaser's delivery of the Deposit Securities together with the
Cash Component will constitute the “Fund Deposit,” which will represent the consideration for a Creation Unit of the Fund. The iShares Core 1-5 Year USD Bond ETF and iShares Edge U.S. Fixed Income Balanced Risk ETF generally offer
Creation Units partially for cash, but may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units solely for cash or solely in-kind. Please see the <font>Cash Purchase Method</font> section below and the following discussion
summarizing the Deposit Security method for further information on purchasing Creation Units of the Funds.</div>
<div>To facilitate efficient management of the Funds and to enable
each Fund to track its respective Underlying Index, for the iShares 0-5 Year High Yield Corporate Bond ETF, iShares 0-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares 5-10 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares 10+ Year Investment

exemptive orders granted to the Funds by the SEC, creation baskets will correspond generally to the price and yield performance of each Fund's Underlying Index.</div>
<div>BFA makes available through the NSCC on each Business Day
prior to the opening of business on the Listing Exchange, the list of names and the required number or par value of each Deposit Security and the amount of the Cash Component to be included in the current Fund Deposit (based on information as of the
end of the previous Business Day for each Fund). Such Fund Deposit is applicable, subject to any adjustments as described below, to purchases of Creation Units of shares of a given Fund until such time as the next-announced Fund Deposit is made
available.</div> <div>The identity and number or par value of the
Deposit Securities change pursuant to changes in the composition of a Fund's portfolio and as rebalancing adjustments and corporate action events are reflected from time to time by BFA with a view to the investment objective of the Fund. The
composition of the Deposit Securities may also change in response to adjustments to the weighting or composition of the component securities constituting the relevant Underlying Index.</div> <div></div>
<div>The Trust may require the substitution of an
amount of cash (<font>i.e.</font>, a “cash in lieu” amount) to replace any Deposit Security of the iShares Core 1-5 Year USD Bond ETF, iShares Edge U.S. Fixed Income Balanced Risk ETF or iShares GNMA Bond ETF
that is a TBA transaction or an interest in a mortgage pass-through security. The amount of cash contributed will be equivalent to the price of the TBA transaction or mortgage pass-through security interest listed as a Deposit Security. A
transaction fee may be charged on the cash amount contributed in lieu of the TBA transaction or mortgage pass-through security.</div>
<div>The Funds reserve the right to permit or require the
substitution of a “cash in lieu” amount to be added to the Cash Component to replace any Deposit Security that may not be available in sufficient quantity for delivery or that may not be eligible for transfer through DTC or the clearing
process (as discussed below) or that the Authorized Participant is not able to trade due to a trading restriction. The Funds also reserve the right to permit or require a “cash in lieu” amount in certain circumstances, including
circumstances in which the delivery of the Deposit Security by the Authorized Participant would be restricted under applicable securities or other local laws or in certain other situations. As noted above, Creation Units of the Cash Funds currently
are available only for cash purchases.</div> <div></div>
<div>Cash Purchase Method.<font>  Although the Trust does not generally permit partial or full cash purchases of Creation Units of its funds, when partial or full cash purchases of Creation Units are available or specified (Creation Units of the
Cash Funds are generally offered solely for cash and Creation Units of the iShares Core 1-5 Year USD Bond ETF and iShares Edge U.S. Fixed Income Balanced Risk ETF are generally offered partially for cash), they will be effected in essentially the
same manner as in-kind purchases thereof. In the case of a partial or full cash purchase, the Authorized Participant must pay the cash equivalent of the Deposit Securities it would otherwise be required to provide through an in-kind purchase, plus
the same Cash Component required to be paid by an in-kind purchaser.</font></div>
<div>Procedures for Creation of Creation Units.<font>  To be eligible to place orders with the Distributor and to create a Creation Unit of the Funds, an entity must be: (i) a “Participating Party,”</font><font> </font><font>i.e</font><font>., a broker-dealer or other participant in the clearing process through the Continuous Net Settlement System of the NSCC (the “Clearing Process”),
a clearing agency that is registered with the SEC, or (ii) a DTC Participant, and must have executed an agreement with the Distributor, with respect to creations and redemptions of Creation Units (“Authorized Participant Agreement”)
(discussed below). A Participating Party or DTC Participant who has executed an Authorized Participant Agreement is referred to as an “Authorized Participant.” All shares of the Funds, however created, will be entered on the records of
DTC in the name of Cede &amp; Co. for the account of a DTC Participant.</font></div>
<div>Role of the Authorized Participant.<font>  Creation Units may be purchased only by or through a DTC Participant that has entered into an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Distributor. Such Authorized Participant will agree, pursuant to the terms of
such Authorized Participant Agreement and on behalf of itself or any investor on whose behalf it will act, to certain conditions, including that such Authorized Participant will make available in advance of each purchase of shares an amount of cash
sufficient to pay the Cash Component, once the net asset value of a Creation Unit is next determined after receipt of the purchase order in proper form, together with the transaction fees described below. An Authorized Participant, acting on behalf
of an investor, may require the investor to enter into an agreement with such Authorized Participant with respect to certain matters, including payment of the Cash Component. Investors who are not Authorized Participants must make appropriate
arrangements with an Authorized Participant. Investors should be aware that their particular broker may not be a DTC Participant or may not have executed an Authorized Participant Agreement and that orders to purchase Creation Units may have to be
placed by the investor's broker through an Authorized Participant. As a result, purchase orders placed through an Authorized Participant may result in additional charges to such investor. The Trust does not expect to enter into</font></div> </div>

<div>an Authorized Participant Agreement with more than a small number of DTC
Participants. A list of current Authorized Participants may be obtained from the Distributor. The Distributor has adopted guidelines regarding Authorized Participants’ transactions in Creation Units that are made available to all Authorized
Participants. These guidelines set forth the processes and standards for Authorized Participants to transact with the Distributor and its agents in connection with creation and redemption transactions. In addition, the Distributor may be appointed
as the proxy of the Authorized Participant and may be granted a power of attorney under its Authorized Participant Agreement.</div>
<div>Placement of Creation Orders.<font>
 Fund Deposits must be delivered through the Federal Reserve System (for cash and U.S. government securities), through DTC (for corporate and municipal securities) or through a central depository account, such as with Euroclear or DTC,
maintained by State Street or a sub-custodian (a “Central Depository Account”). Any portion of a Fund Deposit that may not be delivered through the Federal Reserve System or DTC must be delivered through a Central Depository Account. The
Fund Deposit transfers made through DTC must be ordered by the DTC Participant in a timely fashion so as to ensure the delivery of the requisite number of Deposit Securities through DTC to the account of the Funds generally before 3:00 p.m., Eastern
time on the Settlement Date. Fund Deposit transfers made through the Federal Reserve System must be deposited by the participant institution in a timely fashion so as to ensure the delivery of the requisite number or amount of Deposit Securities or
cash through the Federal Reserve System to the account of the Funds generally before 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. Fund Deposit transfers made through a Central Depository Account must be completed pursuant to the requirements
established by the custodian or sub-custodian for such Central Depository Account generally before 2:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. The “Settlement Date” for all funds is generally the first, second or third Business Day,
as applicable, after the Transmittal Date. All questions as to the number of Deposit Securities to be delivered, and the validity, form and eligibility (including time of receipt) for the deposit of any tendered securities, will be determined by the
Trust, whose determination shall be final and binding. The amount of cash equal to the Cash Component must be transferred directly to State Street through the Federal Reserve Bank wire transfer system in a timely manner so as to be received by State
Street generally before 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. If the Cash Component and the Deposit Securities are not received by 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date, the creation order may be canceled. Upon written notice to
the Distributor, such canceled order may be resubmitted the following Business Day using the Fund Deposit as newly constituted to reflect the then current NAV of the Funds. The delivery of Creation Units so created generally will occur no later than
the first, second or third Business Day, as applicable, following the day on which the purchase order is deemed received by the Distributor, provided that the relevant Fund Deposit has been received by the Funds prior to such time.</font></div>
<div>Purchase Orders.<font>   To
initiate an order for a Creation Unit, an Authorized Participant must submit to the Distributor or its agent an irrevocable order to purchase shares of a Fund, in proper form, generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day to
receive that day’s NAV. The Distributor or its agent will notify BFA and the custodian of such order. The custodian will then provide such information to any appropriate sub-custodian. Procedures and requirements governing the delivery of the
Fund Deposit are set forth in the procedures handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time to time. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements for a creation request to be made through an
Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current Authorized Participants upon request. Those placing orders to purchase Creation Units through an Authorized Participant should allow sufficient time to permit proper
submission of the purchase order to the Distributor or its agent by the Cutoff Time (as defined below) on such Business Day.</font></div>
<div>The Authorized Participant must also make available on or
before the contractual settlement date, by means satisfactory to the Funds, immediately available or same day funds estimated by the Funds to be sufficient to pay the Cash Component next determined after acceptance of the purchase order, together
with the applicable purchase transaction fees. Those placing orders should ascertain the applicable deadline for cash transfers by contacting the operations department of the broker or depositary institution effectuating the transfer of the Cash
Component. This deadline is likely to be significantly earlier than the Cutoff Time of the Funds. Investors should be aware that an Authorized Participant may require orders for purchases of shares placed with it to be in the particular form
required by the individual Authorized Participant.</div> <div>The
Authorized Participant is responsible for any and all expenses and costs incurred by a Fund, including any applicable cash amounts, in connection with any purchase order.</div>
<div>Timing of Submission of Purchase Orders.<font>  An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable order to purchase shares of a Fund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day in order to receive that day's NAV. Creation Orders must be
transmitted by an Authorized Participant in the form required by the Funds to the Distributor or its agent pursuant to</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Economic or
market disruptions or changes, or telephone or other communication failure, may impede the ability to reach the Distributor or its agent or an Authorized Participant. Orders to create shares of a Fund that are submitted on the Business Day
immediately preceding a holiday or a day (other than a weekend) when the equity markets in the relevant non-U.S. market are closed may not be accepted. Each Fund's deadline specified above for the submission of purchase orders is referred to as that
Fund's “Cutoff Time.” The Distributor or its agent, in their discretion, may permit the submission of such orders and requests by or through an Authorized Participant at any time (including on days on which the Listing Exchange is not
open for business) via communication through the facilities of the Distributor's or its agent's proprietary website maintained for this purpose. Purchase orders and redemption requests, if accepted by the Trust, will be processed based on the NAV
next determined after such acceptance in accordance with a Fund's Cutoff Times as provided in the Authorized Participant Agreement and disclosed in this SAI.</div>
<div>Acceptance of Orders for Creation Units.<font>   Subject to the conditions that (i) an irrevocable purchase order has been submitted by the Authorized Participant (either on its own or another investor's behalf) and (ii) arrangements satisfactory to the Funds
are in place for payment of the Cash Component and any other cash amounts which may be due, the Funds will accept the order, subject to each Fund's right (and the right of the Distributor and BFA) to reject any order until acceptance, as set forth
below.</font></div> <div>Once a Fund has accepted an order, upon
the next determination of the net asset value of the shares, the Fund will confirm the issuance of a Creation Unit, against receipt of payment, at such net asset value. The Distributor or its agent will then transmit a confirmation of acceptance to
the Authorized Participant that placed the order.</div> <div>Each
Fund reserves the absolute right to reject or revoke a creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor or its agent if (i) the order is not in proper form; (ii) the investor(s), upon obtaining the shares ordered, would own 80% or more of the
currently outstanding shares of the Fund; (iii) the Deposit Securities delivered do not conform to the identity and number of shares specified, as described above; (iv) acceptance of the Deposit Securities would have certain adverse tax consequences
to the Fund; (v) acceptance of the Fund Deposit would, in the opinion of counsel, be unlawful; (vi) acceptance of the Fund Deposit would, in the discretion of the Fund or BFA, have an adverse effect on the Fund or the rights of beneficial owners; or
(vii) circumstances outside the control of the Fund, the Distributor or its agent and BFA make it impracticable to process purchase orders. The Distributor or its agent shall notify a prospective purchaser of a Creation Unit and/or the Authorized
Participant acting on behalf of such purchaser of its rejection of such order. The Funds, State Street, the sub-custodian and the Distributor or its agent are under no duty, however, to give notification of any defects or irregularities in the
delivery of Fund Deposits nor shall any of them incur any liability for failure to give such notification.</div>
<div>Issuance of a Creation Unit.<font>
  Except as provided herein, a Creation Unit will not be issued until the transfer of good title to the applicable Fund of the Deposit Securities and the payment of the Cash Component have been completed. When the sub-custodian has confirmed to
the custodian that the securities included in the Fund Deposit (or the cash value thereof) have been delivered to the account of the relevant sub-custodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor or its agent and BFA shall be notified of such delivery
and the applicable Fund will issue and cause the delivery of the Creation Unit. Creation Units are generally issued on a “T+2 basis”
(</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, two Business Days after trade date). However, for the iShares 0-5 Year TIPS Bond ETF and iShares TIPS Bond ETF, Creation Units are generally
issued on a “T+1 basis” (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, one Business Day after trade date). For the iShares 1-3 Year International Treasury Bond ETF, iShares Core
International Aggregate Bond ETF and iShares International Treasury Bond ETF, Creation Units are generally issued on a “T+3 basis” (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>,
three Business Days after trade date). Each Fund reserves the right to settle Creation Unit transactions on a basis other than T+1, T+2 or T+3, including a shorter settlement period, if necessary or appropriate under the circumstances and compliant
with applicable law.</font></div> <div></div>
<div>To the extent contemplated by an Authorized
Participant Agreement with the Distributor, each Fund will issue Creation Units to such Authorized Participant, notwithstanding the fact that the corresponding Fund Deposits have not been received in part or in whole, in reliance on the undertaking
of the Authorized Participant to deliver the missing Deposit Securities as soon as possible, which undertaking shall be secured by such Authorized Participant's delivery and maintenance of collateral having a value at least equal to 105% and up to
122%, which percentage BFA may change at any time, in its sole discretion, of the value of the missing Deposit Securities in accordance with the Funds' then-effective procedures. The Trust may use such cash deposit at any time to buy Deposit
Securities for the Funds. The only collateral that is acceptable to the Funds is cash in U.S. dollars. Such cash collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the contractual settlement date. The cash
collateral posted by the Authorized Participant may be invested at the risk of the Authorized Participant, and income, if any, on invested cash collateral will be paid to that Authorized Participant. Information concerning the Funds' current
procedures for collateralization of missing Deposit Securities is available from the Distributor</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>or its agent. The Authorized Participant Agreement will permit the Funds to
buy the missing Deposit Securities at any time and will subject the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the cost to the Funds of purchasing such securities and the cash collateral including, without limitation, liability
for related brokerage, borrowings and other charges.</div> <div>In
certain cases, Authorized Participants may create and redeem Creation Units on the same trade date and in these instances, the Funds reserve the right to settle these transactions on a net basis or require a representation from the Authorized
Participants that the creation and redemption transactions are for separate beneficial owners. All questions as to the number of shares of each security in the Deposit Securities and the validity, form, eligibility and acceptance for deposit of any
securities to be delivered shall be determined by each Fund and the Fund's determination shall be final and binding.</div>
<div>Costs Associated with Creation Transactions.<font>   A standard creation transaction fee is imposed to offset the transfer and other transaction costs associated with the issuance of Creation Units. The standard creation transaction fee is charged to the Authorized
Participant on the day such Authorized Participant creates a Creation Unit, and is the same, regardless of the number of Creation Units purchased by the Authorized Participant on the applicable Business Day. If a purchase consists solely or
partially of cash, the Authorized Participant may also be required to cover (up to the maximum amount shown below) certain brokerage, tax, foreign exchange, execution, price movement and other costs and expenses related to the execution of trades
resulting from such transaction (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Authorized Participants will also bear the costs of transferring the Deposit Securities to the Funds. Certain fees/costs
associated with creation transactions may be waived in certain circumstances. Investors who use the services of a broker or other financial intermediary to acquire Fund shares may be charged a fee for such services.</font></div>

<div>Redemption of Creation Units.<font>
 Shares of a Fund may be redeemed by Authorized Participants only in Creation Units at their NAV next determined after receipt of a redemption request in proper form by the Distributor or its agent and only on a Business Day. The Funds will not
redeem shares in amounts less than Creation Units. There can be no assurance, however,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>that there will be sufficient liquidity in the secondary market at any time
to permit assembly of a Creation Unit. Investors should expect to incur brokerage and other costs in connection with assembling a sufficient number of shares to constitute a Creation Unit that could be redeemed by an Authorized Participant.
Beneficial owners also may sell shares in the secondary market.</div> <div></div>
<div>The Cash Funds generally redeem Creation
Units solely for cash. However, each Cash Fund reserves the right to distribute securities in-kind as payment for Creation Units being redeemed. The iShares Core 1-5 Year USD Bond ETF and iShares Edge U.S. Fixed Income Balanced Risk ETF generally
redeem Creation Units partially for cash. All other Funds discussed in this SAI generally redeem Creation Units for Fund Securities. Please see the <font>Cash Redemption Method</font> section below and the following
discussion summarizing the in-kind method for further information on redeeming Creation Units of the Funds.</div>
<div>BFA makes available through the NSCC, prior to the opening of
business on the Listing Exchange on each Business Day, the designated portfolio of securities (including any portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) that will be applicable (subject to possible amendment or correction) to
redemption requests received in proper form (as defined below) on that day (“Fund Securities”), and an amount of cash (the “Cash Amount,” as described below). Such Fund Securities and the corresponding Cash Amount (each
subject to possible amendment or correction) are applicable, in order to effect redemptions of Creation Units of a Fund until such time as the next announced composition of the Fund Securities and Cash Amount is made available. Fund Securities
received on redemption may not be identical to Deposit Securities that are applicable to creations of Creation Units. Procedures and requirements governing redemption transactions are set forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants and may
change from time to time.</div> <div>Unless cash redemptions are
available or specified for a Fund, the redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit generally consist of Fund Securities, plus the Cash Amount, which is an amount equal to the difference between the net asset value of the shares being redeemed, as next
determined after the receipt of a redemption request in proper form, and the value of Fund Securities, less a redemption transaction fee (as described below).</div> <div></div>
<div>The Trust may, in its sole discretion,
substitute a “cash in lieu” amount to replace any Fund Security. The Trust also reserves the right to permit or require a “cash in lieu” amount in certain circumstances, including circumstances in which: (i) the delivery of a
Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would be restricted under applicable securities or other local laws; or (ii) the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in the disposition of the Fund Security by the
Authorized Participant due to restrictions under applicable securities or other local laws, or in certain other situations. The amount of cash paid out in such cases will be equivalent to the value of the substituted security listed as a Fund
Security. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trust may, in its sole discretion, substitute a “cash in lieu” amount to replace any Fund Security of the iShares Core 1-5 Year USD Bond ETF or iShares GNMA Bond ETF that is a TBA transaction
or mortgage pass-through security. In such cases, a transaction fee may be charged on the cash amount paid in lieu of the TBA transaction or mortgage pass-through security. In the event that the Fund Securities have a value greater than the NAV of
the shares, a compensating cash payment equal to the difference is required to be made by or through an Authorized Participant by the redeeming shareholder. Each Fund generally redeems Creation Units for Fund Securities (except for the Cash Funds,
which generally redeem Creation Units for cash and except for the iShares Core 1-5 Year USD Bond ETF and iShares Edge U.S. Fixed Income Balanced Risk ETF, which generally redeem Creation Units partially for cash), but each Fund reserves the right to
utilize a cash option for redemption of Creation Units. Each Fund may, in its sole discretion, provide such redeeming Authorized Participant a portfolio of securities that differs from the exact composition of the Fund Securities, but does not
differ in NAV.</div> <div>Cash Redemption Method.<font>   Although the Trust does not generally permit partial or full cash redemptions of Creation Units of its funds or the Funds, including the Cash Funds, that are normally redeemed on a cash basis only, when partial
or full cash redemptions of Creation Units are available or specified for a Fund (</font><font>e.g.,</font><font> Creation Units of the Cash Funds are generally redeemed
solely for cash and Creation Units for iShares Core 1-5 Year USD Bond ETF and iShares Edge U.S. Fixed Income Balanced Risk ETF are generally redeemed partially for cash), they will be effected in essentially the same manner as in-kind redemptions
thereof. In the case of partial or full cash redemption, the Authorized Participant receives the cash equivalent of the Fund Securities it would otherwise receive through an in-kind redemption, plus the same Cash Amount to be paid to an in-kind
redeemer.</font></div> <div>Costs Associated with Redemption
Transactions.<font>  A standard redemption transaction fee is imposed to offset transfer and other transaction costs that may be incurred by the relevant Fund. The standard redemption transaction fee is charged to
the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant redeems a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Placement of Redemption
Orders.<font>  Redemption requests for Creation Units of the Funds must be submitted to the Distributor or its agent by or through an Authorized Participant. An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable
request to redeem shares of a Fund generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day in order to receive that day's NAV. On days when the Listing Exchange closes earlier than normal, a Fund may require orders to redeem Creation Units to
be placed earlier that day. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements for a redemption request to be made through an Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current
Authorized Participants upon request.</font></div> <div>The
Authorized Participant must transmit the request for redemption in the form required by the Funds to the Distributor or its agent in accordance with procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Investors should be aware that their
particular broker may not have executed an Authorized Participant Agreement and that, therefore, requests to redeem Creation Units may have to be placed by the investor's broker through an Authorized Participant who has executed an Authorized
Participant Agreement. At any time, only a limited number of broker-dealers will have an Authorized Participant Agreement in effect. Investors making a redemption request should be aware that such request must be in the form specified by such
Authorized Participant. Investors making a request to redeem Creation Units should allow sufficient time to permit proper submission of the request by an Authorized Participant and transfer of the shares to the Funds' transfer agent; such</div>

<div>investors should allow for the additional time that may be required to effect
redemptions through their banks, brokers or other financial intermediaries if such intermediaries are not Authorized Participants.</div>
<div>A redemption request is considered to be in “proper
form” if: (i) an Authorized Participant has transferred or caused to be transferred to the Funds' transfer agent the Creation Unit redeemed through the book-entry system of DTC so as to be effective by the Listing Exchange closing time on any
Business Day on which the redemption request is submitted; (ii) a request in form satisfactory to the applicable Fund is received by the Distributor or its agent from the Authorized Participant on behalf of itself or another redeeming investor
within the time periods specified above; and (iii) all other procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement are properly followed.</div>
<div>Upon receiving a redemption request, the Distributor or its
agent shall notify the applicable Fund and the Fund's transfer agent of such redemption request. The tender of an investor's shares for redemption and the distribution of the securities and/or cash included in the redemption payment made in respect
of Creation Units redeemed will be made through DTC and the relevant Authorized Participant to the Beneficial Owner thereof as recorded on the book-entry system of DTC or the DTC Participant through which such investor holds, as the case may be, or
by such other means specified by the Authorized Participant submitting the redemption request.</div>
<div>A redeeming Authorized Participant, whether on its own account
or acting on behalf of a Beneficial Owner, must maintain appropriate security arrangements with a qualified broker-dealer, bank or other custody providers in each jurisdiction in which any of the portfolio securities are customarily traded, to which
account such portfolio securities will be delivered.</div>
<div>Deliveries of redemption proceeds by a Fund are generally made
within two Business Days (<font>i.e.</font>, “T+2”). However, for the iShares 0-5 Year TIPS Bond ETF and iShares TIPS Bond ETF, deliveries of redemption proceeds are generally made within one Business Day (<font>i.e.</font>, “T+1”). For the iShares 1-3 Year International Treasury Bond ETF, iShares Core International Aggregate Bond ETF and iShares International Treasury Bond ETF, deliveries of redemption proceeds are
generally made within three Business Days (<font>i.e.</font>, “T+3”)</div>
<div>Each Fund reserves the right to settle redemption transactions
on a basis other than T+1, T+2 or T+3 but by T+7, if necessary or appropriate under the circumstances and compliant with applicable law. Delayed settlement may occur due to a number of different reasons, including, without limitation, settlement
cycles for the underlying securities, unscheduled market closings, an effort to link distribution to dividend record dates and ex-dates and newly announced holidays. For example, the redemption settlement process may be extended beyond T+1, T+2 or
T+3 because of the occurrence of a holiday in a non-U.S. market or in the U.S. bond market that is not a holiday observed in the U.S. equity market.</div> <div></div>
<div>To the extent contemplated by an Authorized
Participant's agreement with the Distributor or its agent, in the event an Authorized Participant has submitted a redemption request in proper form but is unable to transfer all or part of the Creation Unit to be redeemed to a Fund, at or prior to
10:00 a.m., Eastern time on the Listing Exchange business day after the date of submission of such redemption request, the Distributor or its agent will accept the redemption request in reliance on the undertaking by the Authorized Participant to
deliver the missing shares as soon as possible. Such undertaking shall be secured by the Authorized Participant's delivery and maintenance of collateral consisting of cash, in U.S. dollars in immediately available funds, having a value at least
equal to 105% and up to 122%, which percentage BFA may change at any time, in its sole discretion, of the value of the missing shares. Such cash collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the day
after the date of submission of such redemption request and shall be held by State Street and marked-to-market daily. The fees of State Street and any sub-custodians in respect of the delivery, maintenance and redelivery of the cash collateral shall
be payable by the Authorized Participant. The cash collateral posted by the Authorized Participant may be invested at the risk of the Authorized Participant, and income, if any, on invested cash collateral will be paid to that Authorized
Participant. The Authorized Participant Agreement permits the Funds to acquire shares of the Funds at any time and subjects the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the aggregate of the cost to the Funds of purchasing such
shares, plus the value of the Cash Amount, and the value of the cash collateral together with liability for related brokerage and other charges.</div>
<div>Because the portfolio securities of a Fund may trade on
exchange(s) on days that the Listing Exchange is closed or are otherwise not Business Days for such Fund, shareholders may not be able to redeem their shares of such Fund, or purchase or sell shares of such Fund on the Listing Exchange on days when
the NAV of such a Fund could be significantly affected by events in the relevant non-U.S. markets.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Taxes</div>
<div>The following is a summary of certain material U.S. federal
income tax considerations regarding the purchase, ownership and disposition of shares of a Fund. This summary does not address all of the potential U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be applicable to a Fund or to all categories of
investors, some of which may be subject to special tax rules. Current and prospective shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the specific federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences of investing in a Fund.
The summary is based on the laws and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof in effect on the date of this SAI, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.</div>
<div>Tax reform legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act makes significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax rules for individuals and corporations, generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.
Most of the changes applicable to individuals are temporary and, without further legislation, will not apply after 2025. The application of certain provisions of the Tax Act is uncertain, and the changes in the act may have indirect effects on a
Fund, its investments and its shareholders that cannot be predicted. In addition, legislative, regulatory or administrative changes could be enacted or promulgated at any time, either prospectively or with retroactive effect. Prospective investors
should consult their tax advisors regarding the implications of the Tax Act on their investment in a Fund.</div>
<div>Regulated Investment Company Qualifications.<font>  Each Fund intends to continue to qualify for and to elect treatment as a separate RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify for treatment as a RIC, each Fund must annually distribute at least
90% of its investment company taxable income (which includes dividends, interest and net short-term capital gains) and meet several other requirements. Among such other requirements are the following: (i) at least 90% of each Fund’s annual
gross income must be derived from dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities or non-U.S. currencies, other income (including, but not limited to, gains from
options, futures or forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies, and net income derived from interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, partnerships that are traded on an established securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than a partnership that derives at least 90% of
its income from interest, dividends, capital gains and other traditionally permitted RIC income); and (ii) at the close of each quarter of each Fund’s taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the market value of each Fund’s total assets must be
represented by cash and cash items, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs and other securities, with such other securities limited for purposes of this calculation in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater than 5% of the
value of the Fund’s assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (b) not more than 25% of the value of the Fund’s total assets may be invested in the securities of any one issuer, of two or
more issuers of which 20% or more of the voting stock is held by the Fund and that are engaged in the same or similar trades or businesses or related trades or businesses (other than the securities of other RICs) or the securities of one or more
qualified publicly-traded partnerships.</font></div> <div>A Fund
may be able to cure a failure to derive at least 90% of its income from the sources specified above or a failure to diversify its holdings in the manner described above by paying a tax and/or by disposing of certain assets. If, in any taxable year,
a Fund fails one of these tests and does not timely cure the failure, that Fund will be taxed in the same manner as an ordinary corporation and distributions to its shareholders will not be deductible by that Fund in computing its taxable
income.</div> <div>Although in general the passive loss rules of
the Internal Revenue Code do not apply to RICs, such rules do apply to a RIC with respect to items attributable to an interest in a qualified publicly-traded partnership. A Fund’s investments in partnerships, including in qualified
publicly-traded partnerships, may result in the Fund being subject to state, local, or non-U.S. income, franchise or withholding tax liabilities.</div>
<div>Taxation of RICs.<font>  As a
RIC, a Fund will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of its taxable investment income and capital gains that it distributes to its shareholders, provided that it satisfies a minimum distribution requirement. To satisfy the
minimum distribution requirement, a Fund must distribute to its shareholders at least the sum of (i) 90% of its “investment company taxable income” (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, income other than its net realized long-term capital gain over its net realized short-term capital loss), plus or minus certain adjustments, and (ii) 90% of its net tax-exempt income for the taxable year.

<div>Fund will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates on any taxable
income or gains that it does not distribute to its shareholders. If a Fund fails to qualify for any taxable year as a RIC or fails to meet the distribution requirement, all of its taxable income will be subject to tax at regular corporate income tax
rates without any deduction for distributions to shareholders, and such distributions generally will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends to the extent of the Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits. In such event,
distributions to individuals should be eligible to be treated as qualified dividend income and distributions to corporate shareholders generally should be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. Although each Fund intends to distribute
substantially all of its net investment income and its capital gains for each taxable year, each Fund will be subject to U.S. federal income taxation to the extent any such income or gains are not distributed. Moreover, if a Fund fails to qualify as
a RIC in any year, it must pay out its earnings and profits accumulated in that year in order to qualify again as a RIC. If a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, the Fund may be required to recognize any net
built-in gains with respect to certain of its assets (<font>i.e.</font>, the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if the
Fund had been liquidated) if it qualifies as a RIC in a subsequent year.</div>
<div>Net Capital Loss
Carryforwards.<font>  Net capital loss carryforwards may be applied against any net realized capital gains in each succeeding year, until they have been reduced to zero or until their respective expiration
dates, whichever occurs first. Capital loss carryforwards from taxable years beginning after 2010 are not subject to expiration, and short-term and long-term capital loss carryforwards from such taxable years may only be applied against net realized
short-term and long-term capital gains, respectively.</font></div>
<div>In the event that a Fund were to experience an ownership
change as defined under the Internal Revenue Code, the loss carryforwards and other favorable tax attributes of a Fund, if any, may be subject to limitation.</div> <div></div>

<div>Must be utilized prior to losses subject to
expiration.</div> <div>Excise Tax.<font>
 A Fund will be subject to a 4% excise tax on certain undistributed income if it does not distribute to its shareholders in each calendar year at least 98% of its ordinary income for the calendar year plus at least 98.2% of its capital gain net
income for the 12 months ended October 31 of such year. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by a Fund that is subject to corporate income tax will be considered to have been distributed by year-end. In
addition, the minimum amounts that must be distributed in any year to avoid the excise tax will be increased or decreased to reflect any underdistribution or overdistribution, as the case may be, from the previous year. Each Fund intends to declare
and distribute dividends and distributions in the amounts and at the times necessary to avoid the application of this 4% excise tax.</font></div>
<div>Taxation of U.S. Shareholders.<font>
 Dividends and other distributions by a Fund are generally treated under the Internal Revenue Code as received by the shareholders at the time the dividend or distribution is made. However, any dividend or capital gain distribution declared by
a Fund in October, November or December of any calendar year and payable to shareholders of record on a specified date in such a month shall be deemed to have been received by each shareholder on December 31 of such calendar year and to have been
paid by the Fund not later than such December 31, provided such dividend is actually paid by the Fund during January of the following calendar year.</font></div>
<div>Each Fund intends to distribute annually to its shareholders
substantially all of its net tax-exempt income, investment company taxable income and any net realized long-term capital gains in excess of net realized short-term capital losses (including any capital loss carryovers). However, if a Fund retains
for investment an amount equal to all or a portion of its net long-term capital gains in excess of its net short-term capital losses (including any capital loss carryovers), it will be subject to a corporate tax (at a flat rate of 21%) on the amount
retained. In that event, the Fund will report such retained amounts as undistributed capital gains in a notice to its shareholders who (a) will be required to include in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as long-term capital gains, their
proportionate shares of the undistributed amount, (b) will be entitled to credit their proportionate shares of the tax paid by the Fund on the undistributed amount against their U.S. federal income tax liabilities, if any, and to claim refunds to
the extent their credits exceed their liabilities, if any, and (c) will be entitled to increase their tax basis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in their shares by an amount equal to the excess of the amount in clause (a) over the amount in
clause (b). Organizations or persons not subject to U.S. federal income tax on such capital gains will be entitled to a refund of their <font>pro rata</font> share of such taxes paid by the Fund upon filing appropriate
returns or claims for refund with the IRS.</div> <div></div>
<div>Distributions of net realized long-term
capital gains, if any, that a Fund reports as capital gain dividends are taxable as long-term capital gains, whether paid in cash or in shares and regardless of how long a shareholder has held shares of the Fund. All other dividends of a Fund
(including dividends from short-term capital gains) from its current and accumulated earnings and profits (“regular dividends”) are generally subject to tax as ordinary income. Long-term capital gains are eligible for taxation at a
maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts.</div>
<div>If an individual receives a regular dividend qualifying for
the long-term capital gain rates and such dividend constitutes an “extraordinary dividend,” and the individual subsequently recognizes a loss on the sale or exchange of stock in respect of which the extraordinary dividend was paid, then
the loss will be long-term capital loss to the extent of such extraordinary dividend. An “extraordinary dividend” on common stock for this purpose is generally a dividend (i) in an amount greater than or equal to 10% of the
taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates within an 85-day period, or (ii) in an amount greater than 20% of the taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share of stock,
aggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates within a 365-day period.</div>
<div>Distributions in excess of a Fund’s current and
accumulated earnings and profits will, as to each shareholder, be treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of a shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund, and as a capital gain thereafter (if the shareholder holds shares of the
Fund as capital assets). Distributions in excess of a Fund’s minimum distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute</div> </div>

<div>nontaxable returns of capital. A Fund's capital loss carryovers, if any,
carried from taxable years beginning before 2011 do not reduce current earnings and profits, even if such carryforwards offset current year realized gains. Shareholders receiving dividends or distributions in the form of additional shares should be
treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as receiving a distribution in an amount equal to the amount of money that the shareholders receiving cash dividends or distributions will receive and should have a cost basis in the shares received equal
to such amount. No deduction would be allowed to an investor for interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry shares of the Fund to the extent the interest deduction would relate to exempt-interest dividends received.</div>
<div>A 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on
net investment income, including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, and net gain from investments, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing jointly), and of estates and trusts.</div>
<div>Investors considering buying shares just prior to a dividend
or capital gain distribution should be aware that, although the price of shares purchased at that time may reflect the amount of the forthcoming distribution, such dividend or distribution may nevertheless be taxable to them. If a Fund is the holder
of record of any security on the record date for any dividends payable with respect to such security, such dividends will be included in the Fund’s gross income not as of the date received but as of the later of (i) the date such security
became ex-dividend with respect to such dividends (<font>i.e</font>., the date on which a buyer of the security would not be entitled to receive the declared, but unpaid, dividends); or (ii) the date the Fund acquired such
security. Accordingly, in order to satisfy its income distribution requirements, a Fund may be required to pay dividends based on anticipated earnings, and shareholders may receive dividends in an earlier year than would otherwise be the case.</div>
<div>In certain situations, a Fund may, for a taxable year, defer
all or a portion of its net capital loss (or if there is no net capital loss, then any net long-term or short-term capital loss) realized after October and its late-year ordinary loss (defined as the sum of the excess of post-October foreign
currency and passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) losses over post-October foreign currency and PFIC gains, plus the excess of post-December ordinary losses over post-December ordinary income) until the next taxable year in
computing its investment company taxable income and net capital gain, which will defer the recognition of such realized losses. Such deferrals and other rules regarding gains and losses realized after October (or December) may affect the tax
character of shareholder distributions. </div> <div>The iShares
Convertible Bond ETF, as a holder of convertible bonds, may at times be allocated phantom taxable income from bond issuers, potentially retroactively or otherwise without notice, which could cause the fund to be subject to past due income or excise
taxes and interest charges thereon.</div> <div>Sales of Shares.<font>  Upon the sale or exchange of shares of a Fund, a shareholder will realize a taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and the shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund. A
redemption of shares by a Fund will be treated as a sale for this purpose. Such gain or loss will be treated as capital gain or loss if the shares are capital assets in the shareholder’s hands and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the
shares are held for more than one year and short-term capital gain or loss if the shares are held for one year or less. Any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed to the extent the shares disposed of are replaced, including
replacement through the reinvesting of dividends or capital gains distributions, or by an option, or contract to acquire substantially identical shares, within a 61-day period beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after the disposition of the
shares. In such a case, the basis of the shares acquired will be increased to reflect the disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a shareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by the shareholder for six months or less will be treated for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any distributions or deemed distributions of long-term capital gains received by the shareholder with respect to such share. The Medicare contribution tax described above will apply to
the sale of Fund shares.</font></div> <div>If a shareholder incurs
a sales charge in acquiring shares of a Fund, disposes of those shares within 90 days and then, on or before January 31 of the following calendar year, acquires shares in a mutual fund for which the otherwise applicable sales charge is reduced by
reason of a reinvestment right (<font>e.g.</font>, an exchange privilege), the original sales charge will not be taken into account in computing gain/loss on the original shares to the extent the subsequent sales charge is
reduced. Instead, the disregarded portion of the original sales charge will be added to the tax basis of the newly acquired shares. Furthermore, the same rule also applies to a disposition of the newly acquired shares made within 90 days of the
second acquisition. This provision prevents a shareholder from immediately deducting the sales charge by shifting his or her investment within a family of mutual funds.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Backup Withholding.<font>  In
certain cases, a Fund will be required to withhold at a 24% rate and remit to the U.S. Treasury such amounts withheld from any distributions paid to a shareholder who: (i) has failed to provide a correct taxpayer identification number; (ii) is
subject to backup withholding by the IRS; (iii) has failed to certify to a Fund that such shareholder is not subject to backup withholding; or (iv) has not certified that such shareholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien). Backup
withholding is not an additional tax and any amount withheld may be credited against a shareholder's U.S. federal income tax liability.</font></div>
<div>Sections 351 and 362.<font>
 The Trust, on behalf of each Fund, has the right to reject an order for a purchase of shares of the Fund if the purchaser (or group of purchasers) would, upon obtaining the shares so ordered, own 80% or more of the outstanding shares of a
given Fund and if, pursuant to Sections 351 and 362 of the Internal Revenue Code, that Fund would have a basis in the securities different from the market value of such securities on the date of deposit. If a Fund’s basis in such securities on
the date of deposit was less than market value on such date, the Fund, upon disposition of the securities, would recognize more taxable gain or less taxable loss than if its basis in the securities had been equal to market value. It is not
anticipated that the Trust will exercise the right of rejection except in a case where the Trust determines that accepting the order could result in material adverse tax consequences to a Fund or its shareholders. The Trust also has the right to
require information necessary to determine beneficial share ownership for purposes of the 80% determination.</font></div>
<div>Taxation of Certain Derivatives.<font>  A Fund’s transactions in zero coupon securities, non-U.S. currencies, forward contracts, options and futures contracts (including options and futures contracts on non-U.S. currencies), to the extent
permitted, will be subject to special provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (including provisions relating to “hedging transactions” and “straddles”) that, among other consequences, may affect the character of gains and
losses realized by the Fund (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, may affect whether gains or losses are ordinary or capital), accelerate recognition of income to the Fund and
defer Fund losses. These rules could therefore affect the character, amount and timing of distributions to shareholders. These provisions also (a) will require the Fund to mark-to-market certain types of the positions in its portfolio (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, treat them as if they were closed out at the end of each year) and (b) may cause the Fund to recognize income without receiving cash with which to pay
dividends or make distributions in amounts necessary to satisfy the distribution requirements for avoiding income and excise taxes. Each Fund will monitor its transactions, will make the appropriate tax elections and will make the appropriate
entries in its books and records when it acquires any zero coupon security, non-U.S. currency, forward contract, option, futures contract or hedged investment in order to mitigate the effect of these rules and prevent disqualification of the Fund as
a RIC. </font></div> <div>A Fund’s investments in so-called
“section 1256 contracts,” such as regulated futures contracts, most non-U.S. currency forward contracts traded in the interbank market and options on most security indexes, are subject to special tax rules. All section 1256 contracts
held by the Fund at the end of its taxable year are required to be marked to their market value, and any unrealized gain or loss on those positions will be included in the Fund’s income as if each position had been sold for its fair market
value at the end of the taxable year. The resulting gain or loss will be combined with any gain or loss realized by the Fund from positions in section 1256 contracts closed during the taxable year. Provided such positions were held as capital assets
and were not part of a “hedging transaction” nor part of a “straddle,” 60% of the resulting net gain or loss will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss, and 40% of such net gain or loss will be treated as short-term
capital gain or loss, regardless of the period of time the positions were actually held by the Fund. </div>
<div>As a result of entering into swap contracts, a Fund may make
or receive periodic net payments. A Fund may also make or receive a payment when a swap is terminated prior to maturity through an assignment of the swap or other closing transaction. Periodic net payments will generally constitute ordinary income
or deductions, while termination of a swap will generally result in capital gain or loss (which will be a long-term capital gain or loss if the Fund has been a party to the swap for more than one year). The cost of any payments made by the Fund on a
swap transaction will be netted <font>pro rata</font> against both tax exempt and taxable gross income. With respect to certain types of swaps, a Fund may be required to currently recognize income or loss with respect to
future payments on such swaps or may elect under certain circumstances to mark such swaps to market annually for tax purposes as ordinary income or loss.</div>
<div>Market Discount.<font>  Any
market discount recognized on a bond is taxable as ordinary income. A market discount bond is a bond acquired in the secondary market at a price below redemption value or adjusted issue price if issued with original issue discount
(“OID”). To the extent a Fund does not include the market discount in income as it accrues, gain on the Fund’s disposition of such an obligation will be treated as ordinary income rather than capital gain to the extent of the
accrued market discount.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Non-U.S. Investments.<font>
 Income (including, in some cases, capital gains) received by certain of the Funds from investments in non-U.S. securities may be subject to withholding and other taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax conventions between certain countries
and the U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes in some cases. If more than 50% of a Fund’s total assets at the close of its taxable year consists of securities of non-U.S. corporations, the Fund may elect for U.S. income tax purposes to treat
non-U.S. income taxes paid by it as paid by its shareholders. A Fund may qualify for and make this election in some, but not necessarily all, of its taxable years. If a Fund were to make an election, shareholders of the Fund would be required to
take into account an amount equal to their pro rata portions of such non-U.S. taxes in computing their taxable income and then treat an amount equal to those non-U.S. taxes as a U.S. federal income tax deduction or as a foreign tax credit against
their U.S. federal income taxes. Shortly after any year for which it makes such an election, a Fund will report to its shareholders the amount per share of such non-U.S. income tax that must be included in each shareholder’s gross income and
the amount which will be available for the deduction or credit. No deduction for non-U.S. taxes may be claimed by a shareholder who does not itemize deductions. Certain limitations will be imposed on the extent to which the credit (but not the
deduction) for non-U.S. taxes may be claimed. </font></div>
<div>Under Section 988 of the Internal Revenue Code, gains or
losses attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the time a Fund accrues income or receivables or expenses or other liabilities denominated in a non-U.S. currency and the time a Fund actually collects such income or pays such
liabilities are generally treated as ordinary income or ordinary loss. In general, gains (and losses) realized on debt instruments will be treated as Section 988 gain (or loss) to the extent attributable to changes in exchange rates between the U.S.
dollar and the currencies in which the instruments are denominated. Similarly, gain or losses on non-U.S. currency, non-U.S. currency forward contracts, certain non-U.S. currency options or futures contracts and the disposition of debt securities
denominated in non-U.S. currency, to the extent attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the acquisition and disposition dates, are also treated as ordinary income or loss unless the Fund were to elect otherwise.</div>
<div>Original Issue Discount.<font>
 OID on tax-exempt bonds is recognized over the term of the bond and is tax-exempt to the holder of the bond. Special U.S. federal income tax rules apply to inflation-indexed bonds. Generally, all stated interest on such bonds is taken into
income by a Fund under its regular method of accounting for interest income. The amount of a positive inflation adjustment, which results in an increase in the inflation-adjusted principal amount of the bond, is treated as original issue discount.
The OID is included in a Fund’s gross income ratably during the period ending with the maturity of the bond, under the general OID inclusion rules. The amount of a Fund’s OID in a taxable year with respect to a bond will increase a
Fund’s taxable income for such year without a corresponding receipt of cash, until the bond matures. As a result, a Fund may need to use other sources of cash to satisfy its distributions for such year. The amount of negative inflation
adjustment, which results in a decrease in the inflation-adjusted principal amount of the bond, reduces the amount of interest (including stated, interest, OID, and market discount, if any) otherwise includible in a Fund’s income with respect
to the bond for the taxable year.</font></div> <div>Reporting.<font>  If a shareholder recognizes a loss with respect to a Fund’s shares of $2 million or more for an individual shareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate shareholder, the shareholder must file with the
IRS a disclosure statement on IRS Form 8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases exempted from this reporting requirement, but under current guidance, shareholders of a RIC are not exempted. The fact that a loss is
reportable under these regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer’s treatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light
of their individual circumstances.</font></div> <div>Taxation of
Non-U.S. Shareholders.<font>  Dividends paid by a Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are generally subject to withholding tax at a 30% rate or a reduced rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty to the extent
derived from investment income and short-term capital gains. Dividends paid by a Fund from net tax-exempt income or long-term capital gains are generally not subject to such withholding tax. In order to obtain a reduced rate of withholding, a
non-U.S. shareholder will be required to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying its entitlement to benefits under a treaty. The withholding tax does not apply to regular dividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who provides an
IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that the dividends are effectively connected with the non-U.S. shareholder’s conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. Instead, the effectively connected dividends will be subject to regular U.S. income tax as
if the non-U.S. shareholder were a U.S. shareholder. A non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively connected dividends may also be subject to additional “branch profits tax” imposed at a rate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S.
shareholder who fails to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable form may be subject to backup withholding at the appropriate rate.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Properly-reported dividends are generally exempt from U.S.
federal withholding tax where they (i) are paid in respect of a Fund’s “qualified net interest income” (generally, a Fund’s U.S. source interest income, other than certain contingent interest and interest from obligations of
a corporation or partnership in which a Fund is at least a 10% shareholder or partner, reduced by expenses that are allocable to such income); or (ii) are paid in respect of a Fund’s “qualified short-term capital gains” (generally,
the excess of a Fund’s net short-term capital gain over a Fund’s long-term capital loss for such taxable year). However, depending on its circumstances, a Fund may report all, some or none of its potentially eligible dividends as such
qualified net interest income or as qualified short-term capital gains and/or treat such dividends, in whole or in part, as ineligible for this exemption from withholding. In order to qualify for this exemption from withholding, a non-U.S.
shareholder will need to comply with applicable certification requirements relating to its non-U.S. status (including, in general, furnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or substitute Form). In the case of shares held through an
intermediary, the intermediary may withhold even if a Fund reports the payment as qualified net interest income or qualified short-term capital gain. Non-U.S. shareholders should contact their intermediaries with respect to the application of these
rules to their accounts.</div> <div></div>
<div>Distributions to certain foreign
shareholders by a Fund at least 50% of the assets of which are “U.S. real property interests” (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury regulations) at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the
distributions, to the extent the distributions are attributable to gains from sales or exchanges of U.S. real property interests (including shares in certain “U.S. real property holding corporations” such as certain REITs, although
exceptions may apply if any class of stock of such a corporation is regularly traded on an established securities market and the Fund has held no more than 5% of such class of stock at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the
distributions), generally must be treated by such foreign shareholders as income effectively connected to a trade or business within the U.S., which is generally subject to tax at the graduated rates applicable to U.S. shareholders, except for
distributions to foreign shareholders that held no more than 5% of any class of stock of the Fund at any time during the previous one-year period ending on the date of the distributions. Such distributions may be subject to U.S. withholding tax and
may require a foreign shareholder to file a U.S. federal income tax return. In addition, sales or redemptions of shares held by certain foreign shareholders in such a Fund generally will be subject to U.S. withholding tax and generally will require
the foreign shareholder to file a U.S. federal income tax return, although exceptions may apply if more than 50% of the value of the Fund’s shares are held by U.S. shareholders or the foreign shareholder selling or redeeming the shares has
held no more than 5% of any class of stock of the Fund at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the sale or redemption.</div>
<div>Provided that more than 50% of the value of a Fund’s
stock is held by U.S. shareholders, redemptions and other distributions made in the form of U.S. real property interests (including shares in certain “U.S. real property holding corporations”, although exceptions may apply if any class
of stock of such a corporation is regularly traded on an established securities market and the Fund has held no more than 5% of such class of stock at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the distribution) generally will cause
the Fund to recognize a portion of any unrecognized gain in the U.S. real property interests equal to the product of (i) the excess of fair market value of such U.S. real property interests over the Fund’s adjusted bases in such interests and
(ii) the greatest foreign ownership percentage of the Fund during the five-year period ending on the date of distribution.</div>
<div>Shareholders that are nonresident aliens or foreign entities
are urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning the particular tax consequences to them of an investment in a Fund.</div>
<div>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on
U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items paid to: (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the IRS information regarding their direct and indirect U.S.
account holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will need to: (i) enter into agreements with the
IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information including the names, addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders; comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S.
accounts; report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained; agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required
information; and determine certain other information as to their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with similar account
holder information. Other foreign entities will need to provide the name, address and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership, unless certain exceptions apply.</div>

<div>Regulation Under the Alternative Investment Fund Managers
Directive.<font>  The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”) imposes detailed and prescriptive obligations on fund managers established in the EU (“EU Operative Provisions”).
These do not currently apply to managers established outside of the EU, such as BFA. Rather, non-EU managers are only required to comply with certain disclosure, reporting and transparency obligations of AIFMD (“AIFMD Disclosure
Provisions”) if such managers market a fund to EU investors.</font></div>
<div>Where the AIFMD Disclosure Provisions relate to EU Operative
Provisions that do not apply to BFA, no meaningful disclosure can be made. These EU Operative Provisions include prescriptive rules on: measuring and capping leverage in line with known European standards; the treatment of investors; the use of
“depositaries”; and coverage for professional liability risks.</div>
<div>AIFMD imposes certain conditions on the marketing of funds,
such as the Funds, to EU investors. AIFMD requires that an ‘alternative investment fund manager’ (“AIFM”) be identified to meet such conditions where such marketing is sought. For these purposes BFA, as the legal entity
responsible for performing the portfolio and risk management of the Funds, shall be the AIFM.</div>
<div>AIFMD requires disclosure on an ongoing basis of certain
information relating to the use of special arrangements, leverage, rights of reuse of collateral, guarantees granted under leverage arrangements and the use of gates, side pockets and similar liquidity management tools. Given that the Funds do not
use any special arrangements or allow for collateral reuse, it is not intended that such disclosures will need to be made by the Funds. Each Fund will, however, to the extent relevant and appropriate, disclose in its annual report information on the
Fund's leverage, risk profile and risk management systems</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>December 29, 2017</div>
<div>The Boards of Trustees/Directors (“Directors”) of
open-end funds advised by BlackRock Fund Advisors or BlackRock Advisors, LLC (“BlackRock”) (the “Funds”), have the responsibility for the oversight of voting proxies relating to portfolio securities of the Funds, and have
determined that it is in the best interests of the Funds and their shareholders to delegate that responsibility to BlackRock as part of BlackRock’s authority to manage, acquire and dispose of account assets, all as contemplated by the
Funds’ respective investment management agreements.</div>
<div>BlackRock has adopted guidelines and procedures (together and
as from time to time amended, the “BlackRock Proxy Voting Guidelines”) governing proxy voting by accounts managed by BlackRock.</div> <div></div>
<div>BlackRock will cast votes on behalf of each
of the Funds on specific proxy issues in respect of securities held by each such Fund (or may refrain from voting) in accordance with the BlackRock Proxy Voting Guidelines.</div>
<div>BlackRock will report on an annual basis to the Directors on
(1) all proxy votes that BlackRock has made on behalf of the Funds in the preceding year together with a representation that all votes were in accordance with the BlackRock Proxy Voting Guidelines<sup>1</sup>, and (2) any changes to the BlackRock Proxy Voting Guidelines that have not previously been reported.</div>

<div>INTRODUCTION TO BLACKROCK</div>
<div></div>
<div>BlackRock is one of the world’s
leading asset management firms. We manage assets on behalf of institutional and individual clients worldwide, across equity, fixed income, liquidity, real estate, alternatives, and multi-asset strategies. Our client base includes pension plans,
endowments, foundations, charities, official institutions, insurers and other financial institutions, as well as individuals around the world.</div>
<div>PHILOSOPHY ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE</div>
<div></div>
<div>BlackRock’s Investment Stewardship
program is focused on protecting and enhancing the economic value of the companies in which it invests on behalf of clients. We do this through engagement with boards and management of investee companies and, for those clients who have given us
authority, through voting at shareholder meetings.</div>
<div>We believe that there are certain fundamental rights attached
to share ownership. Companies and their boards should be accountable to shareholders and structured with appropriate checks and balances to ensure that they operate in shareholders’ interests. Effective voting rights are central to the rights
of ownership and there should be one vote for one share. Shareholders should have the right to elect, remove and nominate directors, approve the appointment of the auditor and to amend the corporate charter or by-laws. Shareholders should be able to
vote on matters that are material to the protection of their investment including but not limited to changes to the purpose of the business, dilution levels and pre-emptive rights, the distribution of income and the capital structure. In order to
exercise these rights effectively, we believe shareholders have the right to sufficient and timely information to be able to take an informed view of the proposals, and of the performance of the company and management.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Our focus is on the board of directors, as
the agent of shareholders, which should set the company’s strategic aims within a framework of prudent and effective controls, which enables risk to be assessed and managed. The board should provide direction and leadership to management and
oversee management’s performance. Our starting position is to be supportive of boards in their oversight efforts on our behalf and we would generally expect to support the items of business they put to a vote at shareholder meetings. Votes
cast against or withheld from resolutions proposed by the board are a signal that we are concerned that the directors or management have either not acted in the interests of shareholders or have not responded adequately to shareholder concerns
regarding strategy or performance.</div> <div>These
principles set out our approach to engaging with companies, provide guidance on our position on corporate governance and outline how our views might be reflected in our voting decisions. Corporate governance practices vary internationally and our
expectations in relation to individual companies are based on the legal and regulatory framework of each market. However, as noted above, we do believe that there are some overarching principles of corporate governance that apply globally. We assess
voting matters on a case-by-case basis and in light of each company’s unique circumstances. We are interested to understand from the company’s reporting its approach to corporate governance, particularly where it is different from the
usual market practice, and how it benefits shareholders.</div> <div></div>
<div>BlackRock also believes that shareholders
have responsibilities in relation to monitoring and providing feedback to companies, sometimes known as stewardship. These ownership responsibilities include, in our view, engaging with management or board members on corporate governance matters,
voting proxies in the best long-term economic interests of shareholders and engaging with regulatory bodies to ensure a sound policy framework consistent with promoting long-term shareholder value creation. Institutional shareholders also have
responsibilities to their clients to have appropriate resources and oversight structures. Our own approach is set out in the section below titled “BlackRock’s oversight of its investment stewardship activities”.</div>
<div>CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, ENGAGEMENT AND VOTING</div>
<div></div>
<div>We recognize that accepted standards of
corporate governance differ between markets but we believe that there are sufficient common threads globally to identify an overarching set of principles. The primary objective of our investment stewardship activities is the protection and
enhancement of the value of our clients’ investments in public corporations. Thus, these principles focus on practices and structures that we consider to be supportive of long-term value creation. We discuss below the principles under six key
themes. In our regional and market-specific voting guidelines we explain how these principles inform our voting decisions in relation to specific resolutions that may appear on the agenda of a shareholder meeting in the relevant market.</div>
<div>The six key themes are:</div> </div>

minimum, we would expect companies to observe the accepted corporate governance standard in their domestic market or to explain why doing so is not in the interests of shareholders. Where company reporting and disclosure is inadequate or the
approach taken is inconsistent with our view of what is in the best interests of shareholders, we will engage with the company and/or use our vote to encourage a change in practice. In making voting decisions, we take into account research from
proxy advisors, other internal and external research, information published by the company or provided through engagement and the views of our equity portfolio managers.</div>
<div>BlackRock views engagement as an important activity;
engagement provides BlackRock with the opportunity to improve our understanding of investee companies and their governance structures, so that our voting decisions may be better informed. Engagement also allows us to share our philosophy and
approach to investment and corporate governance with companies to enhance their understanding of our objectives. There are a range of approaches we may take in engaging companies depending on the nature of the issue under consideration, the company
and the market.</div> <div>Boards and directors</div>
<div>The performance of the board is critical to the economic
success of the company and to the protection of shareholders’ interests. Board members serve as agents of shareholders in overseeing the strategic direction and operation of the company. For this reason, BlackRock focuses on directors in many
of its engagements and sees the election of directors as one of its most important responsibilities in the proxy voting context.</div>
<div>We expect the board of directors to promote and protect
shareholder interests by:</div> <div>

<div>There should be clear definitions of the role of the board,
the committees of the board and senior management such that the responsibilities of each are well understood and accepted. Companies should report publicly the approach taken to governance (including in relation to board structure) and why this
approach is in the interest of shareholders. We will engage with the appropriate directors where we have concerns about the performance of the board or the company, the broad strategy of the company or the performance of individual board members.
Concerns about directors may include their role on the board of a different company where that board has performed poorly and failed to protect shareholder interests.</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that directors should stand for re-election
on a regular basis. We assess directors nominated for election or re-election in the context of the composition of the board as a whole. There should be detailed disclosure of the relevant credentials of the individual directors in order that
shareholders can assess the caliber of an individual nominee. We expect there to be a sufficient number of independent directors on the board to ensure the protection of the interests of all shareholders. Common impediments to independence may
include but are not limited to:</div> <div>

<div>BlackRock believes that the operation of the
board is enhanced when there is a clearly independent, senior non-executive director to lead it or, where the chairman is also the CEO or is otherwise not independent, an independent lead director. The role of this director is to enhance the
effectiveness of the independent members of the board through shaping the agenda, ensuring adequate information is provided to the board and encouraging independent participation in board deliberations. The lead independent board director should be
available to shareholders if they have concerns that they wish to discuss.</div>
<div>To ensure that the board remains effective, regular reviews of
board performance should be carried out and assessments made of gaps in skills or experience amongst the members. BlackRock believes it is beneficial for new directors to be brought onto the board periodically to refresh the group’s thinking
and to ensure both continuity and adequate succession planning. In identifying potential candidates, boards should take into consideration the diversity of experience and expertise of the current directors and how that might be augmented by incoming
directors. We believe that directors are in the best position to assess the optimal size for the board, but we would be concerned if a board seemed too small to have an appropriate balance of directors or too large to be effective.</div>
<div></div>
<div>There are matters for which the board has
responsibility that may involve a conflict of interest for executives or for affiliated directors. BlackRock believes that shareholders’ interests are best served when the board forms committees of fully independent directors to deal with such
matters. In many markets, these committees of the board specialize in audit, director nominations and compensation matters. An ad hoc committee might also be formed to decide on a special transaction, particularly one with a related party.</div>
<div>Auditors and audit-related issues</div>
<div>BlackRock recognizes the critical importance of financial
statements which should provide a complete and accurate picture of a company’s financial condition. We will hold the members of the audit committee or equivalent responsible for overseeing the management of the audit function. We take
particular note of cases involving significant financial restatements or ad hoc notifications of material financial weakness.</div>
<div>The integrity of financial statements depends on the auditor
being free of any impediments to being an effective check on management. To that end, we believe it is important that auditors are, and are seen to be, independent. Where the audit firm provides services to the company in addition to the audit, the
fees earned should be disclosed and explained. Audit committees should also have in place a procedure for assuring annually the independence of the auditor.</div>
<div>Capital structure, mergers, asset sales and other special
transactions</div> <div></div>
<div>The capital structure of a company is
critical to its owners, the shareholders, as it impacts the value of their investment and the priority of their interest in the company relative to that of other equity or debt investors. Pre-emptive rights are a key protection for shareholders
against the dilution of their interests.</div> <div>In assessing
mergers, asset sales or other special transactions, BlackRock’s primary consideration is the long-term economic interests of shareholders. Boards proposing a transaction need to clearly explain the economic and strategic rationale behind it.
We will review a proposed transaction to determine the degree to which it enhances long-term shareholder value. We would prefer that proposed transactions have the unanimous support of the board and have been negotiated at arm’s length. We may
seek reassurance from the board that executives’ and/or board members’ financial interests in a given transaction have not adversely affected their ability to place shareholders’ interests before their own. Where the transaction
involves related parties, we would expect the recommendation to support it to come from the independent directors and would prefer non-conflicted shareholders to vote separately on the proposal.</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that shareholders have a right to dispose
of company shares in the open market without unnecessary restriction. In our view, corporate mechanisms designed to limit shareholders’ ability to sell their shares are contrary to basic property rights. Such mechanisms can serve to protect
and entrench interests other than those of the shareholders. We believe that shareholders are broadly capable of making decisions in their own best interests. We would expect any so-called ‘shareholder rights plans’ being proposed by a
board to be subject to shareholder approval on introduction and periodically thereafter for continuation.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Remuneration and benefits</div>
<div>BlackRock expects a company’s board of directors to put
in place a compensation structure that incentivizes and rewards executives appropriately and is aligned with shareholder interests, particularly long-term shareholder returns. We would expect the compensation committee to take into account the
specific circumstances of the company and the key individuals the board is trying to incentivize. We encourage companies to ensure that their compensation packages incorporate appropriate and challenging performance conditions consistent with
corporate strategy and market practice. We use third party research, in addition to our own analysis, to evaluate existing and proposed compensation structures. We hold members of the compensation committee or equivalent accountable for poor
compensation practices or structures.</div> <div></div>
<div>BlackRock believes that there should be a
clear link between variable pay and company performance as reflected in returns to shareholders. We are not supportive of one-off or special bonuses unrelated to company or individual performance. We support incentive plans that foster the
sustainable achievement of results. The vesting timeframes associated with incentive plans should facilitate a focus on long-term value creation. We believe consideration should be given to building clawback provisions into incentive plans such that
executives would be required to repay rewards where they were not justified by actual performance. Compensation committees should guard against contractual arrangements that would entitle executives to material compensation for early termination of
their contract. Finally, pension contributions should be reasonable in light of market practice.</div>
<div>Non-executive directors should be compensated in a manner that
does not risk compromising their independence or aligning their interests too closely with those of the management, whom they are charged with overseeing.</div>
<div>Environmental and social issues</div>
<div>Our fiduciary duty to clients is to protect and enhance their
economic interest in the companies in which we invest on their behalf. It is within this context that we undertake our investment stewardship activities. We believe that well-managed companies will deal effectively with the environmental and social
(“E&amp;S”) aspects of their businesses.</div>
<div>BlackRock expects companies to identify and report on the
material, business-specific E&amp;S risks and opportunities and to explain how these are managed. This explanation should make clear how the approach taken by the company best serves the interests of shareholders and protects and enhances the
long-term economic value of the company. The key performance indicators in relation to E&amp;S matters should also be disclosed and performance against them discussed, along with any peer group benchmarking and verification processes in place. This
helps shareholders assess how well management is dealing with the E&amp;S aspects of the business. Any global standards adopted should also be disclosed and discussed in this context.</div>
<div>We may vote against the election of directors where we have
concerns that a company might not be dealing with E&amp;S issues appropriately. Sometimes we may reflect such concerns by supporting a shareholder proposal on the issue, where there seems to be either a significant potential threat or realized harm
to shareholders’ interests caused by poor management of E&amp;S matters. In deciding our course of action, we will assess whether the company has already taken sufficient steps to address the concern and whether there is a clear and material
economic disadvantage to the company if the issue is not addressed.</div>
<div>More commonly, given that E&amp;S matters are often not voting
issues, we will engage directly with the board or management. The trigger for engagement on a particular E&amp;S concern is our assessment that there is potential for material economic ramifications for shareholders.</div>
<div>We do not see it as our role to make social or political
judgments on behalf of clients. We expect investee companies to comply, at a minimum, with the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they operate. They should explain how they manage situations where such laws or regulations are
contradictory or ambiguous.</div> <div>General corporate
governance matters</div> <div></div>
<div>BlackRock believes that shareholders have a
right to timely and detailed information on the financial performance and viability of the companies in which they invest. In addition, companies should also publish information on the governance structures in place and the rights of shareholders to
influence these. The reporting and disclosure provided by companies helps shareholders assess whether the economic interests of shareholders have been protected and the quality of the board’s oversight of management. BlackRock Investment

<div>BLACKROCK’S OVERSIGHT OF ITS
INVESTMENT STEWARDSHIP ACTIVITIES</div> <div>Oversight</div>
<div></div>
<div>BlackRock holds itself to a very high
standard in its investment stewardship activities, including in relation to executing proxy votes. This function is executed by a team of dedicated BlackRock employees without sales responsibilities (“Investment Stewardship Group”), and
which is considered an investment function. BlackRock maintains three regional advisory committees (“Stewardship Advisory Committees”) for (a) the Americas; (b) Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and (c)
Asia-Pacific, generally consisting of senior BlackRock investment professionals and/or senior employees with practical boardroom experience. The regional Stewardship Advisory Committees review and advise on amendments to the proxy voting guidelines
covering markets within each respective region (“Guidelines”). The Investment Stewardship Global Oversight Committee (“Global Committee”), which is a risk-focused committee, is generally composed of senior representatives of
the active and index equity investment businesses, the Deputy General Counsel, the senior executive to whom the Investment Stewardship Group reports, the Global Head of Investment Stewardship (“Global Head”), and other senior
representatives of relevant functions, as appropriate. The Global Head, a dedicated BlackRock employee without sales responsibilities, has primary oversight of the activities of the Investment Stewardship Group, including voting in accordance with
the Guidelines, which requires the application of professional judgment and consideration of each company’s unique circumstances. The Global Committee reviews and approves amendments to these Global Corporate Governance &amp; Engagement
Principles. The Global Committee also reviews and approves amendments to the Guidelines, as proposed by the regional Stewardship Advisory Committees. The Global Committee also receives and reviews periodic reports regarding the votes cast by the
Investment Stewardship Group and regular updates on material process issues, procedural changes and other matters of concern to the Global Committee. The Global Committee reviews these reports in an oversight capacity and as informed by
BlackRock’s corporate governance engagement program and Guidelines, which set forth each Stewardship Advisory Committees’ views with respect to certain corporate governance and other issues that typically arise in the proxy voting
context. In addition, the Investment Stewardship Group carries out engagement with companies (including in conjunction with portfolio managers in discussions of significant governance issues), monitors and executes proxy votes, and conducts vote
operations (including maintaining records of votes cast) in a manner consistent with the relevant Guidelines. The Investment Stewardship Group also conducts research on corporate governance issues and participates in industry discussions to keep
abreast of important developments in the corporate governance field. The Investment Stewardship Group may utilize vendors for certain of the foregoing activities and performs oversight of those vendors. The Investment Stewardship Group may raise
complicated or particularly controversial matters for internal discussion with the appropriate investors (generally, those with relevant knowledge or experience) and/or refer such matters to the appropriate regional Stewardship Advisory Committees
for their review, discussion and guidance prior to making a voting decision. BlackRock’s Equity Policy Oversight Committee is informed of certain aspects of the work of the Global Committee and the Investment Stewardship Group.</div>
<div>Vote execution</div> <div></div>
<div>BlackRock carefully considers proxies
submitted to funds and other fiduciary accounts (“Funds”) for which it has voting authority. BlackRock votes (or refrains from voting) proxies for each Fund for which it has voting authority based on BlackRock’s evaluation of the
best long-term economic interests of shareholders, in the exercise of its independent business judgment, and without regard to the relationship of the issuer of the proxy (or any shareholder proponent or dissident shareholder) to the Fund, the
Fund’s affiliates (if any), BlackRock or BlackRock’s affiliates, or BlackRock employees (see “Conflicts management policies and procedures”, below).</div>
<div>When exercising voting rights, BlackRock will normally vote on
specific proxy issues in accordance with its Guidelines for the relevant market. The Guidelines are reviewed regularly and are amended consistent with changes in the local market practice, as developments in corporate governance occur, or as
otherwise deemed advisable by BlackRock’s Stewardship Advisory Committees. The Investment Stewardship Group may, in the exercise of their professional judgment, conclude that the Guidelines do not cover the specific matter upon which a proxy
vote is required or that an exception to the Guidelines would be in the best long-term economic interests of BlackRock’s clients.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>In the uncommon circumstance of there being
a vote with respect to fixed income securities or the securities of privately held issuers, the decision generally will be made by a Fund's portfolio managers and/or the Investment Stewardship Group based on their assessment of the particular
transactions or other matters at issue.</div> <div>In certain
markets, proxy voting involves logistical issues which can affect BlackRock’s ability to vote such proxies, as well as the desirability of voting such proxies. These issues include but are not limited to: (i) untimely notice of shareholder
meetings; (ii) restrictions on a foreigner’s ability to exercise votes; (iii) requirements to vote proxies in person; (iv) “share- blocking” (requirements that investors who exercise their voting rights surrender the right to
dispose of their holdings for some specified period in proximity to the shareholder meeting); (v) potential difficulties in translating the proxy; (vi) regulatory constraints; and (vii) requirements to provide local agents with unrestricted powers
of attorney to facilitate voting instructions. We are not supportive of impediments to the exercise of voting rights such as shareblocking or overly burdensome administrative requirements.</div>
<div>As a consequence, BlackRock votes proxies only on a
“best-efforts” basis. In addition, the Investment Stewardship Group may determine that it is generally in the best interests of BlackRock’s clients not to vote proxies if the costs (including but not limited to opportunity costs
associated with shareblocking constraints) associated with exercising a vote are expected to outweigh the benefit the client would derive by voting on the issuer’s proposal.</div>
<div>While it is expected that BlackRock, as a fiduciary, will
generally seek to vote proxies over which BlackRock exercises voting authority in a uniform manner for all BlackRock clients, the Investment Stewardship Group, in conjunction with the portfolio manager of an account, may determine that the specific
circumstances of such an account require that such account’s proxies be voted differently due to such account’s investment objectives or other factors that differentiate it from other accounts. In addition, portfolio managers may from
time to time reach differing but equally valid views on how best to maximize economic value in respect of a particular investment. Accordingly, portfolio managers retain full discretion to vote the shares in the Funds they manage based on their
analysis of the economic impact of a particular ballot item.</div>
<div>Conflicts management policies and procedures</div>
<div>The Investment Stewardship Group maintains the following
policies and procedures that seek to prevent undue influence on BlackRock’s proxy voting activity. Such influence might stem from any relationship between the issuer of a proxy (or any shareholder proponent or dissident shareholder) and
BlackRock, BlackRock’s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund’s affiliates, or BlackRock employees. The following are examples of sources of perceived or potential conflicts of interest:</div> <div>

(iii) The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., (iv) any public company of which a BlackRock, Inc. board member serves as a senior executive, and (v) companies when legal or regulatory requirements compel BlackRock to use an independent fiduciary. In
selecting an independent fiduciary, we assess several characteristics, including but not limited to: independence, an ability to analyze proxy issues and vote in the best economic interest of our clients, reputation for reliability and integrity,
and operational capacity to accurately deliver the assigned votes in a timely manner. We may engage more than one independent fiduciary, in part in order to mitigate potential or perceived conflicts of interest at an independent fiduciary. The
Global Committee appoints and reviews the performance of the independent fiduciar(ies), generally on an annual basis. </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>With regard to the relationship between securities lending and
proxy voting, BlackRock’s approach is driven by our clients’ economic interests. The evaluation of the economic desirability of recalling loans involves balancing the revenue producing value of loans against the likely economic value of
casting votes. Based on our evaluation of this relationship, we believe that, generally, the likely economic value of casting most votes is less than the securities lending income, either because the votes will not have significant economic
consequences or because the outcome of the vote would not be affected by BlackRock recalling loaned securities in order to ensure they are voted. Periodically, BlackRock analyzes the process and benefits of voting proxies for securities on loan, and
will consider whether any modification of its proxy voting policies or procedures is necessary in light of future conditions. In addition, BlackRock may in its discretion determine that the value of voting outweighs the cost of recalling shares, and
thus recall shares to vote in that instance.</div>
<div>Voting guidelines</div> <div></div>
<div>The issue-specific Guidelines
published for each region/country in which we vote are intended to summarize BlackRock’s general philosophy and approach to issues that may commonly arise in the proxy voting context in each market where we invest. These Guidelines are not
intended to be exhaustive. The Investment Stewardship Group applies the Guidelines on a case-by-case basis, in the context of the individual circumstances of each company and the specific issue under review. As such, these Guidelines do not provide
a guide to how the Investment Stewardship Group will vote in every instance. Rather, they share our view about corporate governance issues generally, and provide insight into how BlackRock typically approaches issues that commonly arise on corporate
ballots.</div> <div>Reporting</div>
<div></div>
<div>We report our proxy voting activity directly
to clients and publicly as required. In addition, we publish on the BlackRock website more detailed reports of our stewardship activities, including engagement with companies and with other relevant parties.</div> </div>

<div>Appendix B – Description of Fixed-Income Ratings</div>
<div>A rating is generally assigned to a fixed-income security at
the time of issuance by a credit rating agency designated as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (“NRSRO”) by the SEC. While NRSROs may from time to time revise such ratings, they undertake no obligation to do so, and
the ratings given to securities at issuance do not necessarily represent ratings which would be given to these securities on a particular subsequent date.</div> <div></div>
<div>NRSROs may rate specific investments (<font>e.g.</font>, bonds), issuers (<font>e.g.</font>, corporations, governments and financial institutions) and/or programs (<font>e.g.</font>, commercial paper programs).
However, certain types of investments generally are not rated by NRSROs, such as certain government/sovereign obligations, US agency securities, commercial paper, time deposits at financial institutions, and derivative instruments such as credit
default swaps. For these types of investments, as well as US Treasury securities (some of which are not rated), where a NRSRO has not rated the specific investment but has rated the investment’s issuer, program, financial institution or
underlying reference asset, BFA may consider the investment to have the same NRSRO rating as its issuer, program, financial institution or underlying reference asset, as applicable. In the case of municipal securities, where one NRSRO provides
multiple ratings for the same security (<font>e.g.</font>, “underlying,” “insured” and/or “enhanced” ratings), BFA may consider the security to have the highest of the multiple
ratings.</div> <div>New issue securities (regardless of type)
rarely are rated by a NRSRO at the time of their initial offering. Preliminary prospectuses or term sheets for new issue securities often include an expected rating for the security (as determined by the underwriter and/or issuer) or a NRSRO rating
for the issuer of the security. If applicable, when deciding whether to purchase a new issue security that has not yet been rated by a NRSRO, BFA may attribute an expected rating to the security based on: (i) the expected rating of the security set
forth in the preliminary prospectus or term sheet for the security; (ii) the NRSRO’s rating for the issuer of the security set forth in the preliminary prospectus or term sheet for the security; or (iii) with respect to asset-backed
securities, the rating of a prior issuance having a similar structure or the same sponsor.</div>
<div>Where the investment objective of a Fund is to track the
performance of an index that includes credit ratings eligibility criteria as part of its index methodology, a Fund may purchase any security within the index, such security having been determined by the index provider as meeting its credit ratings
eligibility criteria. The credit ratings practices of an index provider may differ from BlackRock’s practices, as described above. Further, a Fund may invest, directly or indirectly, in securities that are not rated by a rating agency or
securities with a credit rating that differs from the credit rating specified in its index methodology in various circumstances, including where a security is downgraded but not yet removed from an index, following the removal of a security from an
index prior to its sale by the Fund or as a result of a corporate action or restructuring affecting an issuer of a security held by a Fund.</div>
<div>Fixed-income securities which are unrated expose the investor
to risks with respect to capacity to pay interest or repay principal which are similar to the risks of lower-rated speculative bonds. Evaluation of these securities is dependent on the investment adviser’s judgment, analysis and experience in
the evaluation of such securities.</div> <div>Investors should note
that the assignment of a rating to a security by an NRSRO may not reflect the effect of recent developments on the issuer’s ability to make interest and principal payments or on the likelihood of default.</div>
<div>Securities deemed to be high yield are rated below Baa3 by
Moody’s and below BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch.</div>
<div>The descriptions below relate to general long-term and
short-term obligations of an issuer.</div> <div>Moody’s
Ratings</div> <div>Long-Term Obligations</div>
<div>Aaa:<font> Obligations rated Aaa are
judged to be of the highest quality, subject to the lowest level of credit risk.</font></div>
<div>Aa:<font> Obligations rated Aa are
judged to be of high quality and are subject to very low credit risk.</font></div>
<div>A:<font> Obligations rated A are
judged to be upper-medium grade and are subject to low credit risk.</font></div>
<div>Baa:<font> Obligations rated Baa are

<div>Ba:<font> Obligations rated Ba are
judged to be speculative and are subject to substantial credit risk.</font></div>
<div>B:<font> Obligations rated B are
considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk.</font></div>
<div>Caa:<font> Obligations rated Caa are
judged to be speculative, of poor standing and are subject to very high credit risk.</font></div>
<div>Ca:<font> Obligations rated Ca are
highly speculative and are likely in, or very near, default, with some prospect of recovery of principal and interest.</font></div>
<div>C:<font> Obligations rated C are the
lowest rated and are typically in default, with little prospect for recovery of principal or interest.</font></div>
<div>Note:<font> Moody's appends
numerical modifiers 1, 2 and 3 in each generic rating classification from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the
modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the lower end of that generic rating category.</font></div>
<div>Absence of Rating:<font> Where no
rating has been assigned or where a rating has been withdrawn, it may be for reasons unrelated to the creditworthiness of the issue.</font></div>
<div>Should no rating be assigned, the reason may be one of the
following:</div> <div>1. An application was not received or
accepted.</div> <div>2. The issue or issuer belongs to a group of
securities or entities that are not rated as a matter of policy.</div>
<div>3. There is a lack of essential data pertaining to the issue
or issuer.</div> <div>4. The issue was privately placed, in which
case the rating is not published in Moody’s publications.</div>
<div>Withdrawal may occur if new and material circumstances arise,
the effects of which preclude satisfactory analysis; if there is no longer available reasonable up-to-date data to permit a judgment to be formed; if a bond is called for redemption; or for other reasons.</div>
<div>Short-Term Obligations</div>
<div>Moody’s short-term debt ratings are opinions of the
ability of issuers to honor short-term financial obligations, generally with an original maturity not exceeding thirteen months.</div>
<div>Moody's employs the following designations to indicate the
relative repayment ability of rated issuers:</div> <div>P-1: <font>Issuers (or supporting institutions) rated Prime-1 have a superior ability to repay short-term debt obligations.</font></div>
<div>P-2: <font>Issuers (or supporting
institutions) rated Prime-2 have a strong ability to repay short-term debt obligations.</font></div>
<div>P-3: <font>Issuers (or supporting
institutions) rated Prime-3 have an acceptable ability to repay short-term obligations.</font></div>
<div>NP: <font>Issuers (or supporting
institutions) rated Not Prime do not fall within any of the Prime rating categories.</font></div>
<div>US Municipal Short-Term Debt Obligations</div>
<div>There are three rating categories for short-term municipal
obligations that are considered investment grade and are designated as Municipal Investment Grade (MIG). In addition, those short-term obligations that are of speculative quality are designated SG, or speculative grade. MIG ratings expire at the
maturity of the obligation.</div> <div>MIG 1:<font> This designation denotes superior credit quality. Excellent protection is afforded by established cash flows, highly reliable liquidity support, or demonstrated broad-based access to the market for
refinancing.</font></div> <div>MIG 2:<font> This designation denotes strong credit quality. Margins of protection are ample, although not as large as in the preceding group.</font></div>
<div>MIG 3:<font> This designation
denotes acceptable credit quality. Liquidity and cash-flow protection may be narrow, and market access for refinancing is likely to be less well-established.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>S&amp;P Global Ratings</div>
<div>Long-Term Obligations</div>
<div>AAA:<font> An obligation rated AAA
has the highest rating assigned by S&amp;P Global Ratings. The obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong.</font></div>
<div>AA:<font> An obligation rated AA
differs from the highest-rated obligations only to a small degree. The obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment is very strong.</font></div>
<div>A:<font> An obligation rated A is
somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher-rated categories. However, the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is still
strong.</font></div> <div>BBB:<font> An
obligation rated BBB exhibits adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation.</font></div> <div>BB; B; CCC; CC; and C:<font> Obligations rated BB, B, CCC, CC, and C are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics. BB indicates the least degree of speculation and C the highest. While such obligations will likely have some
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.</font></div>
<div>BB:<font> An obligation rated BB is
less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions which could lead to the obligor’s inadequate capacity to meet its
financial commitment on the obligation.</font></div> <div>B:<font> An obligation rated B is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated BB, but the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Adverse business, financial, or economic
conditions will likely impair the obligor’s capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.</font></div>
<div>CCC:<font> An obligation rated CCC
is currently vulnerable to nonpayment, and is dependent upon favorable business, financial, and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. In the event of adverse business, financial, or economic
conditions, the obligor is not likely to have the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.</font></div>
<div>CC:<font> An obligation rated CC is
currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment. The CC rating is used when a default has not yet occurred, but S&amp;P Global Ratings expects default to be a virtual certainty, regardless of the anticipated time to default.</font></div>
<div>C:<font> An obligation rated C is
currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment, and the obligation is expected to have lower relative seniority or lower ultimate recovery compared to obligations that are rated higher.</font></div>
<div>D:<font> An obligation rated D is in
default or in breach of an imputed promise. For non-hybrid capital instruments, the D rating category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due, unless S&amp;P Global Ratings believes that such payments will be made within
five business days in the absence of a stated grace period or within the earlier of the stated grace period or 30 calendar days. The D rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of similar action and where
default on an obligation is a virtual certainty, for example due to automatic stay provisions. An obligation's rating is lowered to D if it is subject to a distressed exchange offer.</font></div>
<div>NR:<font> NR indicates no rating has
been requested, or that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that S&amp;P Global Ratings does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy.</font></div>
<div>Note:<font> The ratings from AA to
CCC may be modified by the addition of a plus (+) or minus (-) sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories.</font></div>

<div>A-1: <font>A short-term obligation
rated A-1 is rated in the highest category by S&amp;P Global Ratings. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is strong. Within this category, certain obligations are designated with a plus sign (+). This indicates
that the obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on these obligations is extremely strong.</font></div>
<div>A-2: <font>A short-term obligation
rated A-2 is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher rating categories. However, the obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is
satisfactory.</font></div> <div>A-3: <font>A short-term obligation rated A-3 exhibits adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its

<div>Municipal Short-Term Obligations</div>
<div>An S&amp;P U.S. municipal note rating reflects S&amp;P Global
Ratings opinion about the liquidity factors and market access risks unique to the notes. Notes due in three years or less will likely receive a note rating. Notes with an original maturity of more than three years will most likely receive a
long-term debt rating.</div> <div>SP-1:<font> Strong capacity to pay principal and interest. An issue determined to possess a very strong capacity to pay debt service is given a plus (+) designation.</font></div>
<div>SP-2:<font> Satisfactory capacity to
pay principal and interest, with some vulnerability to adverse financial and economic changes over the term of the notes.</font></div>
<div>SP-3:<font> Speculative capacity to
pay principal and interest.</font></div> <div>Fitch Ratings</div>
<div>Long-Term Obligations</div>
<div>AAA:<font> Highest credit quality.
AAA ratings denote the lowest expectation of credit risk. They are assigned only in cases of exceptionally strong capacity for payment of financial commitments. This capacity is highly unlikely to be adversely affected by foreseeable
events.</font></div> <div>AA:<font> Very
high credit quality. AA ratings denote expectations of very low credit risk. They indicate very strong capacity for payment of financial commitments. This capacity is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events.</font></div>
<div>A:<font> High credit quality. A
ratings denote expectations of low credit risk. The capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered strong. This capacity may, nevertheless, be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic conditions than is the case for higher
ratings.</font></div> <div>BBB:<font>
Good credit quality. BBB ratings indicate that expectations of credit risk are currently low. The capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered adequate but adverse business or economic conditions are more likely to impair this
capacity.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>BB:<font> Speculative. BB ratings
indicate an elevated vulnerability to credit risk, particularly in the event of adverse changes in business or economic conditions over time; however, business or financial alternatives may be available to allow financial commitments to be
met.</font></div> <div>B:<font> Highly

or “-” may be appended to a rating to denote relative status within major rating categories. Such suffixes are not added to the AAA obligation rating category, or to corporate finance obligation ratings in the categories below CCC.</div>
<div>The subscript 'emr' is appended to a rating to denote embedded
market risk which is beyond the scope of the rating. The designation is intended to make clear that the rating solely addresses the counterparty risk of the issuing bank. It is not meant to indicate any limitation in the analysis of the counterparty
risk, which in all other respects follows published Fitch criteria for analyzing the issuing financial institution. Fitch does not rate these instruments where the principal is to any degree subject to market risk.</div>
<div>Short-Term Obligations (Corporate and Public Finance)</div>
<div>A short-term issuer or obligation rating is based in all cases
on the short-term vulnerability to default of the rated entity or security stream and relates to the capacity to meet financial obligations in accordance with the documentation governing the relevant obligation. Short-Term Ratings are assigned to
obligations whose initial maturity is viewed as “short-term” based on market convention. Typically, this means up to 13 months for corporate, sovereign, and structured obligations, and up to 36 months for obligations in U.S. public
finance markets.</div> <div>F1:<font>
Highest short-term credit quality. Indicates the strongest intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments; may have an added “+” to denote any exceptionally strong credit feature.</font></div>
<div>F2:<font> Good short-term credit
quality. Good intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments.</font></div>
<div>F3:<font> Fair short-term credit
quality. The intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments is adequate.</font></div>
<div>B:<font> Speculative short-term
credit quality. Minimal capacity for timely payment of financial commitments, plus heightened vulnerability to near term adverse changes in financial and economic conditions.</font></div>
<div>C:<font> High short-term default
risk. Default is a real possibility.</font></div> <div>RD:<font> Restricted default. Indicates an entity that has defaulted on one or more of its financial commitments, although it continues to meet other financial obligations. Typically applicable to entity ratings
only.</font></div> <div>D:<font> Default.
Indicates a broad-based default event for an entity, or the default of a short-term obligation.</font></div> <div></div>
