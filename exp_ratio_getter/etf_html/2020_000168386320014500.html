<div>Investment Objective</div>
<div>The iShares US Small Cap Value
Factor ETF (the “Fund”) seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of U.S. small-capitalization stocks with prominent value characteristics.</div>
<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the
fees and expenses that you will incur if you buy, hold and sell shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”)
(the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides that BFA will pay all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition
and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions, including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses. BFA, the
investment adviser to the Fund, has contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fee so that the Fund’s total annual fund operating expenses after the fee waiver will not exceed 0.20% through March
31, 2023. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to March 31, 2023 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA.</div>
<div>You may pay other fees, such as
brokerage commissions and other fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the tables and examples below.</div>

<div>Example. <font>This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of owning shares of the Fund with the cost of investing in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the
time periods indicated and then sell all of your shares at the end of those periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund’s operating expenses remain the
same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions, your costs would be:</font></div>

<div>
<div>
<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher
transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s
performance.</font></div>
<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the
investment results of the Russell 2000 Focused Value Select Index (the “Underlying Index”), which is an objective, rules-based, equal-weighted equity index provided by FTSE Russell (the “Index
Provider” or “Russell”). The Underlying Index measures the performance of small-capitalization U.S. companies with prominent value factor characteristics, as determined by the Index Provider. The
Underlying Index is a subset of the Russell 2000<sup>®</sup> Index (the “Parent Index”), which measures the performance of the small-capitalization segment of the U.S.
equity market, as defined by the Index Provider.</div>
<div>The construction of the Underlying
Index begins with the Parent Index and</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>excludes companies that are ranked in the least
liquid 20% (<font>i.e.</font> approximately 400 constituents) based on the 60-day average dollar value traded. The list of eligible constituents is then narrowed to exclude the top 20% of Parent Index
constituents with the highest risk based on a 12-month trailing realized volatility. The list is further narrowed to exclude the top 20% of Parent Index constituents with the highest leverage, which is measured by
comparing a company’s total debt to its total assets. Following these three initial screens, the remaining companies are evaluated to exclude companies with a negative sentiment score, which is calculated using
the number of upgrades for earnings per share and the number of downgrades for earnings per share for a company's current and next fiscal year. A company with more downgrades for earnings per share than upgrades will
have a negative sentiment score, and thus will be excluded from the Underlying Index. The remaining companies are then ranked based on a weighted composite score of three value factor metrics; price-to-book,
price-to-earnings and price-to-cash flow from operations (the “Composite Score”). The top 250 ranked stocks are selected and equally weighted to form a baseline or target composition (the “Target
Index”). The Underlying Index</div>

<div>
</div>
<hr/>
<div></div>
<p> 
</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>will be reviewed monthly and rebalanced to the
Target Index if either of the following conditions are met: (i) the Underlying Index’s Composite Score is less than 90% of the Target Index's Composite Score; or (ii) the Underlying Index has fewer than 200
securities. If no rebalance is triggered, the component securities of the Underlying Index and their weights will remain unchanged. The Underlying Index may contain fewer than 250 stocks and may not rebalance for a
period of time.</div>
<div>As of August 31, 2020, a significant
portion of the Underlying Index is represented by securities of companies in the financials and industrials industries or sectors. The components of the Underlying Index are likely to change over time. As of August
31, 2020, the Underlying Index was comprised of 248 components.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or
indexing approach to try to achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive
positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance
that the Fund will substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax
performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling
indexing strategy to manage the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>that collectively has an investment profile similar
to that of an applicable underlying index. The securities selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings),
fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying
Index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at
least 80% of its assets in the component securities and other instruments of the Underlying Index and may invest up to 20% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents,
including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates (“BlackRock Cash Funds”), as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund
track the Underlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities
representing up to one-third of the value of the Fund's total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by
Russell, which is part of the London Stock Exchange Group and is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and
publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Industry Concentration Policy.<font> The Fund will concentrate its investments (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, hold 25% or more of its total</font></div>

<div>assets) in a particular industry or group of
industries to approximately the same extent that the Underlying Index is concentrated. For purposes of this limitation, securities of the U.S. government (including its agencies and instrumentalities) and repurchase
agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities are not considered to be issued by members of any industry.</div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could
lose all or part of your investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may
adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share (“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the
significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> Securities and other assets in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial
market or other asset classes.</font></div>
<div>Assets Under Management (AUM)
Risk<font>.</font><font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this prospectus (the “Prospectus”)), a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may
invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a specific period of time to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</font><font> </font><font>can be no assurance that any such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund</font></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>would be maintained at such levels, which could
negatively impact the Fund.</div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration
Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage
in creation and/or redemption transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with
respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or
delisting.</font></div>
<div>Calculation Methodology Risk. <font>The Underlying Index relies on various sources of information to assess the criteria of issuers included in the Underlying Index, including information that may be based
on assumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund nor BFA can offer assurances that the Underlying Index’s calculation methodology or sources of information will provide an accurate assessment of included
issuers.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole,
to the extent that the Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of</font></div>

<div></div>
<p> 
</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>industries, sector, market segment or asset
class.</div>
<div>Cybersecurity Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, the Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized
Participants or the issuers of securities in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the
Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems.
Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems of the Fund’s Index Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the
Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>Equity Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their values may be more volatile than those of other asset classes. The Underlying Index is comprised of common
stocks, which generally subject their holders to more risks than preferred stocks and debt securities because common stockholders’ claims are subordinated to those of holders of preferred stocks and debt
securities upon the bankruptcy of the issuer.</font></div>
<div>Financials Sector Risk<font>.</font><font> Performance of companies in the financials sector may be adversely impacted by many factors, including, among others, changes in government regulations, economic
conditions, and interest rates, credit rating downgrades, and decreased liquidity in credit markets. The extent to</font></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>which the Fund may invest in a company that engages
in securities-related activities or banking is limited by applicable law. The impact of changes in capital requirements and recent or future regulation of any individual financial company, or of the financials sector
as a whole, cannot be predicted. In recent years, cyberattacks and technology malfunctions and failures have become increasingly frequent in this sector and have caused significant losses to companies in this sector,
which may negatively impact the Fund.</div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its
investment objective. Market disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index.
Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a
period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders. Unusual market conditions may cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance, which could cause the Underlying
Index to vary from its normal or expected composition.</font></div>
<div>Industrials Sector Risk.<font> Companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by changes in the supply of and demand for products and services, product obsolescence, claims for
environmental damage or product liability and changes in general</font></div>

<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>economic conditions, among other factors.</div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk. <font>An outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus has resulted in travel restrictions, disruption of healthcare systems, prolonged
quarantines, cancellations, supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings downgrades, defaults and other significant economic impacts. Certain markets have experienced temporary closures, extreme
volatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity and increased trading costs. These events will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and could impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities or
cause elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. Other infectious illness outbreaks in the future may result in similar impacts.</font></div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. Changes in the financial condition or credit rating of an
issuer of those securities may cause the value of the securities to decline.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Local, regional or global
events such as war, acts of terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its</font></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>investments and could result in increased premiums
or discounts to the Fund’s NAV.</div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high
volatility and disruptions in the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the
Fund’s service providers, counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and
procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the U.S<font>.</font><font> Certain changes in the U.S. economy, such as when the U.S. economy weakens or when its financial markets decline, may have an adverse effect on the securities to which
the Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to
return</font></div>
</div>
<div>
</div>

<div>
<div>
<div>the securities in a timely manner or at all. The
Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger
adverse tax consequences for the Fund.</div>
<div>Small-Capitalization Companies
Risk<font>.</font><font> Compared to mid- and large-capitalization companies, small-capitalization companies may be less stable and more susceptible to adverse developments. In addition, the
securities of small-capitalization companies may be more volatile and less liquid than those of mid- and large-capitalization companies.</font></div>
<div>Small Fund Risk. <font>When the Fund’s size is small, the Fund may experience low trading volume and wide bid/ask spreads. In addition, the Fund may face the risk of being delisted if the
Fund does not meet certain conditions of the listing exchange. Any resulting liquidation of the Fund could cause the Fund to incur elevated transaction costs for the Fund and negative tax consequences for its
shareholders.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of
differences between the securities and other instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences, transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s
holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of dividends or interest,</font></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>the requirements to maintain pass-through tax
treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with
various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees
and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not.</div>
<div>Value Securities Risk<font>.</font><font> Securities issued by companies that may be perceived as undervalued, particularly securities of a company that appear to trade at a significant discount to the
company’s intrinsic value, may fail to appreciate for long periods of time and may never realize their full potential value. Value securities have generally performed better than non-value securities during
periods of economic recovery (although there is no assurance that they will continue to do so). At other times, value securities may not perform as well as growth securities or the stock market in general, and may be
out of favor with investors for varying periods of time.</font></div>
<div>Performance Information</div>
<div>As of the date of the Prospectus,
the Fund has been in operation for less than one full calendar year and therefore does not report its performance information.</div>

<div>Management</div>
<div>Investment Adviser.<font> BlackRock Fund Advisors.</font></div>
<div>Portfolio Managers.<font> Rachel Aguirre, Jennifer Hsui, Alan Mason, Greg Savage and Amy Whitelaw (the “Portfolio Managers”) are primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund. Each
Portfolio Manager supervises a portfolio management team. Ms. Aguirre, Ms. Hsui, Mr. Mason, Mr. Savage and Ms. Whitelaw have been Portfolio Managers of the Fund since inception (2020).</font></div>
<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an exchange-traded fund
(commonly referred to as an “ETF”). Individual shares of the Fund may only be bought and sold in the secondary market through a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV,
shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). An investor may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase shares
of the Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for shares of the Fund (ask) when buying or selling shares in the secondary market (the “bid-ask spread”).<br/>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make
distributions that may be taxable to you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an individual retirement account (“IRA”),
in which case, your distributions generally will be taxed when withdrawn.</div>
<div>Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other
Financial Intermediaries</div>
<div>If you purchase shares of the Fund
through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), BFA or other related companies may pay the intermediary for marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences,
the development of technology platforms and reporting systems or other services related to the sale or promotion of the Fund. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other
intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.<br/>
