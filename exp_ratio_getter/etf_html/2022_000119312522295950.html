Fund seeks to track the investment results of the MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target Index (the “Underlying Index”), which has been developed by MSCI Inc. (the “Index Provider” or “MSCI”). The Underlying Index is designed to address two dimensions of carbon exposure – carbon emissions and potential carbon emissions from fossil fuel reserves. By overweighting companies with low carbon emissions relative to enterprise value including cash (EVIC) and those with low potential carbon emissions from fossil fuel reserves relative to market capitalization, the Underlying Index aims to reflect a lower carbon exposure than that of the broad market. Carbon emissions and potential carbon emissions from fossil fuel reserves are measured based on an issuer’s reported data from annual reports, corporate social responsibility reports, the Carbon Disclosure Project, oil and gas industry bodies, and other relevant third-party sources. If an issuer does not report carbon emissions or potential carbon emissions from fossil fuel reserves, the data are estimated by MSCI using a proprietary model.</div> </ix:continuation> </ix:continuation> <ix:continuation continuedat="t_6_ddd79127_7679_8aba_d53b_4422d022650b_11"> <ix:continuation continuedat="t_7_e3a304c4_471d_37e7_25b4_d76ab4230e55_11"> <div>The Underlying Index is designed to achieve a target level of tracking relative to the MSCI ACWI Index (the “Parent Index”) while minimizing carbon exposure.

The Parent Index serves as the universe of eligible securities for the Underlying Index. The Index Provider begins with the Parent Index and excludes securities of companies involved with controversial weapons, companies involved in very severe ESG controversies and companies involved in the business of thermal coal mining and extraction of oil sands, based on percentage of revenue thresholds for certain categories (e.g. 1% or 5%) and categorical exclusions for others (e.g. controversial weapons) (in each case as determined by the Index Provider). Remaining securities included in the Parent Index are assigned a “carbon exposure” measured in terms of the issuer’s greenhouse gas emissions (relative to the issuer’s EVIC) and potential carbon emissions from fossil fuel reserves held by the issuer (per dollar of such issuer’s market capitalization, as measured during the semi-annual index review). Greenhouse gas emissions of the issuer includes direct greenhouse gas emissions by the issuer, indirect greenhouse gas emissions associated with the issuer’s purchase of energy, and indirect emissions occurring in the value chain of the issuer (in each case, as determined by the Index Provider). The Underlying Index is then constructed using a process that aims to achieve replicability and investability, subject to the following objective and constraints: (i) minimize carbon exposure subject to a tracking error constraint of 50 basis points relative to the Parent Index; (ii) the maximum weight of an Underlying Index constituent may not be greater than 20 times its weight in the Parent Index; (iii) country weights in the Underlying Index may not deviate more than 2% from the country weights in the Parent Index; and (iv) sector weights in the Underlying Index may not deviate more than 2% from the sector weights in the Parent Index, with the exception of the energy sector, where there is no weight constraint applied.

The Underlying Index is designed to address two dimensions of carbon exposure – carbon emissions and potential carbon emissions from fossil fuel reserves. By overweighting companies with low carbon emissions relative to enterprise value including cash (EVIC) and those with low potential carbon emissions from fossil fuel reserves relative to market capitalization, the Underlying Index aims to reflect a lower carbon exposure than that of the broad market.

The aim of the construction methodology is for the Underlying Index to demonstrate the following characteristics across markets by re‑weighting constituents relative to the underlying free float- adjusted market capitalization-weighted parent index: (1) lower carbon exposure in terms of carbon emissions and fossil fuel reserves, (2) low tracking error relative to the parent index, and (3) low active sector, country and regional biases relative to the parent index. The carbon exposure of an issuer is measured in terms of its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and its potential carbon emissions from fossil fuel reserves. Greenhouse gas emissions of the issuer includes direct greenhouse gas emissions by the issuer, indirect greenhouse gas emissions associated with the issuer’s purchase of</div> <div></div> <hr/> <div>energy, and indirect emissions occurring in the value chain of the issuer (in each case, as determined by the Index Provider). The Underlying Index uses MSCI ESG Carbon Metrics data provided by MSCI ESG Research Inc. MSCI normalizes for size by dividing the annual carbon emissions of the company by EVIC of the company, and by dividing the potential carbon emissions from fossil fuel reserves of the company by its market capitalization. At each semi-annual index review, the Underlying Index is rebalanced using an optimization process that aims to achieve replicability and investability, subject to the following optimization objectives and constraints:</div> <div> </div>
