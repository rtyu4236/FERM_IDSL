                            TRADING AND SETTLEMENT

   SPDRs are listed for trading under the market symbol SPY on the SGX-ST where
they may be bought and sold in the secondary market at any time during the
trading day. Market prices for SPDRs traded on the SGX-ST are available on the
SGX-ST website (http://esite.sgx.com/scripts/amexprice.asp). SPDRs may also be
purchased by Authorized Participants directly from the Trust in the US by
placing orders through the US Distributor in a minimum unit, called a "Creation
Unit," of 50,000 SPDRs or multiples thereof. Creation Units may also be
redeemed through a tender to the Trustee in the US. All Creation Unit purchases
and redemptions are done "in kind" only in the US, that is, through the
delivery or receipt of a specified portfolio of securities. For additional
details, please consult pages 27 to 30 and 33 to 36 in the US Prospectus
attached hereto.

   As with other securities, investors will pay negotiated brokerage
commissions and typical Singapore clearing fees and applicable taxes. In
addition, cash dividends to be distributed to investors in Singapore will be
net of expenses incurred by CDP (defined below), and where such expenses exceed
the amount of the dividends, the investors will not receive any distributions.
Brokerage commissions may be subject to Goods and Services Tax ("GST") of 3%.
There will be a Singapore clearing fee, which is currently at the rate of 0.05%
of the transacted value (up to a maximum of SGD200 per transaction or its
equivalent in foreign currencies). Clearing fees may be subject to GST in
Singapore of 3%. SPDRs are traded in US dollars ($) on the SGX-ST in 10 unit
round lots. The primary trading market for SPDRs is in the US, where SPDRs are
listed on The American Stock Exchange LLC ("American Stock Exchange"). The term
"market day" as used in this Statement means a business day in which
transactions in SPDRs can be executed and settled. Trading of SPDRs on the
SGX-ST may be halted if the Trust fails to comply with continuing listing
requirements and advertising guidelines of the SGX-ST.

   With respect to holders of SPDRs in Singapore, the trading and settlement
process, the system through which they receive distributions or the manner in
which information may be made available, among other aspects, may differ from
the information set forth in the US Prospectus. Holders of SPDRs in Singapore
should read this Statement carefully and all enquiries in relation hereto
should be directed to their local brokers.

1. General

   SPDRs are issued by the Trust in the form of certificateless securities
which are eligible "book-entry-only" securities of The Depository Trust Company
("DTC"). As "book-entry-only" securities, SPDRs are represented as global
securities on the DTC system and are registered in the name of Cede &amp; Co. as
nominee for DTC and deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC.

                                      S-6

<page>

   The Central Depository (Pte) Limited ("CDP") has entered into linking
agreements with the National Securities Clearing Corporation ("NSCC"), by which
CDP has access to DTC's depository and custodial services for subdepositing US
securities. CDP, through such linking agreements, has an account sponsored by
NSCC which is known as Sponsored Account No. 5700 ("Sponsored Account"), and is
recognized by NSCC as a record owner for the SPDRs credited to the Sponsored
Account. CDP through the linking agreements may receive SPDRs from or deliver
SPDRs to accounts maintained by member participants in DTC ("DTC Participants").

   Settlement of dealings through the CDP system may be effected only by
Depository Agents of CDP or holders of SPDRs who have their own direct
securities accounts with CDP. Investors may open a direct securities account
with CDP or a securities sub-account with any Depository Agent to hold their
SPDRs in CDP. The term "Depository Agent" shall have the same meaning ascribed
to it in section 130A of the Companies Act, Chapter 50 of Singapore.

   Through the delivery mechanisms discussed below, it is possible for
investors to purchase SPDRs in Singapore and sell them in the US and vice
versa. Although both CDP and DTC, within their own respective market
settlements, provide for Delivery Versus Payment and Free-of-Payment transfers
of securities, all of the linked transfers between the two depositories are
effected only on a Free-of-Payment basis (i.e., there is no related cash
movement to parallel the securities movement. Any related cash transfers may
only be effected outside DTC and CDP directly between the buyer and seller
through their own arrangements). Investors should be aware that Singapore time
is generally 12 hours ahead of Eastern Day Light Savings time (13 hours Eastern
Standard time) in New York, and that the American Stock Exchange and the SGX-ST
are not open at the same time. Because of this time difference between the
Singapore and US markets, trading in SPDRs between the two markets cannot
simultaneously occur.

   All dealings in, and transactions of, SPDRs in Singapore must be effected
for settlement through the computerised book-entry (scripless) settlement
system in the CDP. Investors should ensure that SPDRs sold on SGX-ST are
available for settlement in their CDP account no later than the third market
day following the transaction date.

   Investors' holdings of SPDRs in their CDP account will be credited or
debited for settlement on the third market day following the transaction date.
A transaction will fail if SPDRs are not in an investor's CDP account for
settlement on such day, and will be subject to the buy-in cycle on the fourth
market day following the transaction date.

   In the absence of unforeseen circumstances, the delivery of SPDRs into and
out of CDP will take a minimum of one market day after the duly completed

                                      S-7

<page>

documentation has been submitted to CDP for processing, assuming that the
investor has given proper instructions to his or her DTC Participant.
Instructions and forms received by CDP after 10 a.m. Singapore time on a given
market day will be treated as being received on the next market day and, as
such, will be processed on the next market day.

2. Delivery of SPDRs to CDP for Trading on the SGX-ST

   Investors who hold SPDRs in DTC's system in the US and wish to trade them on
the SGX-ST can direct delivery of the SPDRs to CDP; this book-entry transfer to
CDP's Sponsored Account at DTC may be effected only on a Free-of-Payment basis,
and is subject to special procedures that will help to identify the relevant
CDP Depository Agent. Investors may deliver their SPDRs by informing their
Singapore broker or Depository Agent to submit delivery instructions to CDP,
together with the applicable CDP delivery fee and GST, no later than 10 a.m.
Singapore time on the specified delivery date. Investors must concurrently
instruct their DTC Participant to deliver such SPDRs into the Sponsored Account
on the delivery date. Upon notification that its Sponsored Account has been
credited, CDP will accordingly credit SPDRs to the investor's account.

   Investors should ensure that their SPDRs are delivered into their securities
account with CDP in time for settlement. In the event an investor cannot
deliver the SPDRs for settlement pursuant to the trade, the SGX-ST may buy-in
against him or her.

3. Delivery of SPDRs out of CDP for Trading on the American Stock Exchange

   (a) Investors who hold SPDRs with CDP and wish to trade on the American
Stock Exchange must arrange to deliver the SPDRs into their accounts with their
DTC Participant for settlement of any such trade, which will occur on the third
market day following the transaction date. For such delivery, investors must
submit a duly completed CDP delivery form together with the applicable CDP
delivery fee and GST through their Singapore broker or Depository Agent, no
later than 10 a.m. Singapore time on the third market day following the
specified delivery date in the US. Investors must concurrently instruct their
DTC Participant to expect receipt of the relevant number of SPDRs from the
Sponsored Account. Upon receipt of the duly completed CDP delivery form, CDP
will debit the investor's securities account for the relevant number of SPDRs
and then instruct DTC to deliver the SPDRs to the DTC Participant account as
specified by the investor.

   (b) An investor who buys SPDRs on the SGX-ST and sells on the American Stock
Exchange on the same day must instruct CDP to deliver the SPDRs to his or her
DTC Participant account no later than 10 a.m. Singapore time on the US
settlement date PROVIDED that the investor is a sub-account holder of CDP's
Depository Agent

                                      S-8

<page>

and the purchase on the SGX-ST is tagged as a Delivery Versus Payment ("DVP")
settlement. The Depository Agent of the investor must send an instruction to
deliver the relevant number of SPDRs from its sub-account to the CDP via CDP's
Delivery Versus Payment Foreign Broker ("DVP-FB") Computer System no later than
10 a.m. Singapore time on the US settlement date. Upon affirming the delivery
instruction, CDP will instruct DTC to deliver the SPDRs from the Sponsored
Account to the DTC Participant account as specified by the investor.

                           EXCHANGE RATES AND RISKS

   The SPDRs traded on the SGX-ST are denominated and traded in US dollars.
SPDRs may only be created or redeemed in US dollars in the manner set out in
the US Prospectus. Similarly, the distributions which may be made by the
Trustee are in US dollars. To the extent a Singapore investor wishes to convert
such US dollar holdings or distributions to Singapore dollars, fluctuations in
the exchange rate between the Singapore dollar and the US dollar may affect the
value of the proceeds from a currency conversion.

   Trust Agreement;

      (iv) the Trustee is not obligated to appear in, prosecute or defend any
   action if it is of the opinion that it may involve it in expense or

   necessary to protect the Trust and the rights and interest of all beneficial
   owners;

Prospectus and in this Statement.

7. Meetings of Holders of SPDRs; Voting; Distribution of Annual Reports

   The Trust is not required by law to convene meetings of beneficial owners of

dated May 18, 2001 ("CDP Depository Agreement"), pursuant to which CDP has
agreed to act as the depository for SPDRs in Singapore. CDP's duties under the
CDP Depository Agreement include, among other things: (i) acting as a bare
trustee on behalf of individuals who hold securities accounts with CDP and
Depository Agents authorized to maintain sub-accounts with CDP in respect of
SPDRs, (ii) distributing to CDP account holders and Depository Agents any
applicable payments or cash distributions in respect of SPDRs, and (iii)

Distribution Agent" in Singapore, whose duties include: (i) collecting and
collating any consents or votes of, and (ii) distributing notices, statements,
reports, prospectuses, consent instructions, consent forms and other written
communications to, the holders of SPDRs in Singapore.

   The Trustee shall provide ADP with sufficient copies of each investor
communication, in such form, number and at such place or places as ADP may
reasonably request, in order that such communication may be transmitted,
directly or indirectly, to investors. Promptly after the end of each fiscal
year, the Trustee will furnish to ADP for distribution to each person who was a
holder of SPDRs in Singapore at the end of such fiscal year, an annual report
of the Trust. In addition, the Trust shall reimburse CDP and ADP for the costs
of providing the Trustee with the foregoing information and for their fees and
expenses for such transmission.

8. Declaration

this Statement later than 12 months, or such other period as may be prescribed

(1) the Sponsor, (2) the Trust and (3) ALPS Mutual Funds Services, Inc., now
ALPS Distributors, Inc. ("ALPS"), the US Distributor, pursuant to which the
Trust and the Sponsor retained ALPS to:

      (i) act as the exclusive distributor for the creation and distribution of
   SPDRs in aggregations of 50,000 SPDRs;

      (ii) hold itself available to receive and process orders for Creation
   Units of SPDRs; and

      (iii) to enter into arrangements with dealers.

   It is the duty of the Trust and the Sponsor to create the aggregations of
50,000 SPDRs and to request DTC to record on its books the ownership of such
SPDRs in such amounts as ALPS has requested, as promptly as practicable after
receipt by the Trustee of the requisite portfolio of securities and any
applicable cash component from the creator of the Creation Units or other
entities having a Participant Agreement with the Trustee. Participant
Agreements must be entered into between the Trustee and all other persons who
are creating Creation Units.

10. Borrowing powers

   There are no borrowing powers conveyed in the Trust Agreement.

11. Sponsor and Trustee

    Sponsor

   PDR Services LLC was originally organized as a corporation under Delaware US
law, and was subsequently converted into a limited liability company in
Delaware on April 6, 1998. It is wholly owned by the American Stock Exchange,
and was formed in Delaware to act as sponsor for American Stock Exchange's
exchange traded funds and other unit investment trusts. The Sponsor will remain
the Sponsor of the Trust until it is removed, it resigns or the Trust Agreement
is terminated. Although the Sponsor is entitled to, it receives no remuneration
for the services it renders as Sponsor.

    Trustee

   State Street Bank and Trust Company is a bank and trust company organized
under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, US in 1961, the
culmination of a series of mergers among 13 predecessors, the oldest of which,
Union Bank, was

                                     S-13

<page>

founded in 1792. The Trustee is a wholly owned subsidiary of State Street
Corporation, a financial holding company. The Trustee will remain the Trustee
of the Trust until it is removed, it resigns or the Trust Agreement is
terminated. The remuneration received by the Trustee in its capacity as Trustee
of the Trust is described in the US Prospectus and reflected in the financial
statements contained therein. Absent gross negligence, bad faith, wilful
misconduct or wilful malfeasance on its part or reckless disregard of its
duties and obligations under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall be
indemnified from the Trust and held harmless against any loss, liability or
expense incurred arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of the Trust and any actions taken in accordance with the
provisions of the Trust Agreement.

12. Exercise of Voting Rights on Underlying Securities

   The Trustee (rather than the beneficial owners of SPDRs) has the right to
vote all of the voting stocks in the Trust, as Trustee. It must vote the voting
stocks of each issuer in the same proportionate relationship as all other
shares of each such issuer are voted to the extent permissible and, if not
permitted, abstain from voting. There are no restrictions on the Trustee's
right to vote securities or SPDRs when such securities or SPDRs are owned by
the Trustee in its individual capacity.

13. Adjustments to Securities Held by the Trust

   The Trust's portfolio securities are not managed and the Trustee adjusts
such securities from time to time to maintain the correspondence between the
composition and weightings of the securities held by the Trust and the S&amp;P 500
Index.

14. Distributions to Beneficial Owners

   The Trustee receives all dividends and other cash distributed with respect
to the underlying securities in the Trust (including monies realized by the
Trustee from the sale of options, warrants or other similar rights received on
such securities), and distributes them (less fees, expenses and any applicable
taxes) through DTC and the DTC Participants to the beneficial owners of the
SPDRs. A description of the distribution process is contained on pages 54 to 56
of the US prospectus. These distribution arrangements will be the same for
holders of SPDRs in Singapore, who will receive their entitlements through CDP.
Cash dividends distributed to investors in Singapore will be net of expenses
incurred by CDP. Where such expenses exceed the amount of the dividend,
investors will not receive any dividend.

15. Consents

   PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, as the auditor of the Trust, has given and has
not withdrawn its written consent to the issue of this Statement with the
inclusion herein of, and reference to, as the case may be, (i) its name and

16. Important Tax Information

A. CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS

   The following is a general description of the material US federal income tax
consequences of the ownership and disposition of SPDRs applicable to a holder
of SPDRs who, for purposes of US taxation and any applicable tax treaty or
convention, has not been and will not be a US citizen or resident, a
corporation organized in the US, or an estate or trust which is taxable by the
US on all of its income regardless of source ("non-resident holder").

   This description is for general information purposes only and is based on
the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Code"), Treasury regulations
promulgated thereunder, and judicial and administrative interpretations
thereof, all as in effect on the date hereof and all of which are subject to
change. The tax treatment of a non-resident holder may vary depending upon his
or her particular situation. Certain non-resident holders may be subject to
special rules not discussed below. The discussion below does not address the
effect of any state, local or foreign tax law on a non-resident holder, and
does not address non-resident holders engaged in business in the US. Purchasers
of SPDRs are advised to consult their own tax advisors with respect to an
investment in the SPDRs.

  Tax Consequences of Trust Units Ownership

    Ordinary Income Dividends

   Dividends paid by the Trust from its investment company taxable income
(which includes dividends, interest and the excess of net short-term capital
gains over net long-term capital losses) to non-resident holders will generally
be subject to US withholding tax at a rate of thirty percent (30%). The amount
will be withheld by the dividend paying agent from all dividend distributions.
If a non-resident holder does not provide the appropriate IRS Form W-8, US tax
may be withheld at the higher rate of thirty-one percent (31%) (see "Backup
Withholding Rules" below).

                                     S-15

<page>

   In certain circumstances, the thirty percent (30%) withholding tax rate may
be reduced pursuant to an income tax treaty. Treaty benefits are generally
available only to persons that are qualified residents of a country with which
the US has a treaty, and who provide a US Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") Form
W-8BEN certifying entitlement to such benefits. There is currently no income
tax treaty between the US and Singapore.

    Treatment of Capital Gain Distributions and Sales Proceeds

   Capital gain distributions (distributions from the excess of net long-term
capital gains over net short-term capital losses) to non-resident holders and
proceeds from the sale of Trust Units by a non-resident holder will generally
not be subject to US withholding tax.

  Backup Withholding Rules

   "Backup withholding" is required on the payment of certain amounts to US
persons, in order to enforce collection of income taxes owed by such persons.
In general, non-US persons are exempt from US "backup withholding." In order to
establish such exemption, however, a non-resident holder generally must supply
appropriate documentation (generally, an IRS Form W-8BEN) to the paying agent
(or its agent) or to the financial institution through which the non-resident
holder holds SPDRs. Payments that cannot be reliably associated with
documentation are generally presumed to be made to a US payee who is not an
exempt recipient, in which case thirty-one percent (31%) backup withholding
will apply to all payments.

   As an exception to this general rule, a payee is presumed to be foreign if
certain indicia of foreign status exist. Additionally, a payment that would be
subject to withholding tax if made to a foreign person and which is exempt from
backup withholding as a payment to a non-US account is presumed to be made to a
foreign payee. Accordingly, ordinary dividends paid to a non-US account would
generally be subject to withholding tax at the rate of thirty percent (30%).

   Payments to foreign intermediaries are subject to a special set of
presumptions summarized below. Foreign intermediaries generally include foreign
financial institutions, foreign clearing organizations, foreign branches or
offices of a US financial institution or US clearing organization, and certain
foreign corporations.

   If the foreign intermediary has not provided a valid intermediary
withholding certificate, it is generally treated as an undocumented owner of
the payment. A determination must then be made, based on factors set forth in
the tax regulations, whether to treat the payee as an individual, trust,
estate, corporation, or partnership. If the payee is presumed to be an
individual, trust, estate, or partnership, it is presumed to be a US person who
is not an exempt recipient and the thirty-one percent (31%)

                                     S-16

<page>

backup withholding rules would apply to all payments. If the payee is presumed
to be a corporation, then it is also presumed to be a US person. However, if
the amount paid consists of an amount that is subject to withholding, such as
dividends, the corporate payee is presumed to be a foreign payee if there are
indicia of foreign status, in which case withholding tax at the thirty percent
(30%) rate is imposed.

   If the foreign intermediary (other than a qualified intermediary that has
assumed primary withholding responsibility) has provided a valid intermediary
withholding certificate, but the intermediary's withholding certificate is
unreliable either because the withholding agent or payor has not been given
sufficient information to determine the proper amount of withholding or because
some or all of the underlying certificates that are required to be attached are
lacking or are unreliable, the payment is presumed to be made to a foreign
payee for whom the foreign intermediary collects the payment. Therefore, a
dividend is subject to withholding tax at the thirty percent (30%) rate.

   The amount of any "backup withholding" (in contrast to the thirty percent
(30%) withholding tax imposed on ordinary dividends) from a payment to a
non-resident holder will be allowed as a credit against the non-resident
holder's US federal income tax liability and may entitle such non-resident
holder to a refund from the IRS to the extent such "backup withholding" is not
needed to satisfy the thirty percent (30%) withholding tax liability that may
have otherwise been imposed on such payment, provided that the required
information is furnished to the IRS.

  US Estate Tax

   The estate of a non-resident individual holder of SPDRs may be subject to
US estate tax on the value of such SPDRs, which are considered US situs
property for such purposes. An estate tax credit is currently available for the
estates of non-residents, the effect of which is to exempt up to $60,000 of US
situs property. US estate tax is imposed at graduated rates, the highest of
which is currently fifty-five percent (55%). If the holder is a qualified
resident of a country with which the US maintains an estate tax treaty, the
SPDRs may be exempt from estate tax. There is currently no estate tax treaty
between the US and Singapore.

   The estate of a non-resident individual holder of Trust Units that is
subject to US estate tax must generally file an IRS Form 706-NA ("United States
Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return--Estate of non-resident
not a citizen of the US") within nine months of the non-resident individual
holder's date of death. Subject to certain exceptions, if the estate of the
non-resident alien takes a tax return position that any estate tax treaty of
the US overrules or modifies any provision of the Code and thereby effects (or
potentially effects) a reduction of estate tax, the estate must disclose such
position on a statement attached to such return in the form required by US
Treasury regulations. The requirement of attaching a statement to the estate
tax return is generally satisfied by attaching an IRS Form 8833 ("Treaty-Based
Return

                                     S-17

<page>

Position Disclosure under Section 6114 or 7701(b)") to such return. If a tax
return would not otherwise be required to be filed, a tax return must
nevertheless be filed for purposes of making the required disclosures discussed
above.

   The US estate tax is a lien against a non-resident decedent's assets for ten
years unless the tax is paid in full or otherwise provided for in accordance
with US Treasury regulations. Upon payment in full (or provision for such
payment) of the US estate tax liability, a transfer certificate will be issued
permitting the non-resident decedent's assets to be transferred without
liability.

   The tax discussion set forth above is included for general information only.
Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors concerning the US
and foreign tax consequences to them of an investment in SPDRs.

B. CERTAIN SINGAPORE TAX CONSIDERATIONS

   The following is a general description of material Singapore income tax,
capital gains tax, stamp duty and estate duty consequences of the ownership and
disposal of SPDRs. The discussion below is not intended to constitute a
complete analysis of all tax consequences relating to ownership and disposal of
SPDRs by a person who, for purposes of taxation in Singapore, is regarded a
Singapore resident taxpayer or otherwise. Prospective investors of SPDRs should
consult their own tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of their
particular situations. This description is based on laws, regulations and
interpretations now in effect and available as of the date of this Statement.
The laws, regulations and interpretations, however, may change at any time, and
any change could be retroactive. These laws and regulations are also subject to
various interpretations and the relevant tax authorities or the courts could
later disagree with the explanations or conclusions set out below.

  General

   Singapore resident taxpayers, such as individuals who are residing in
Singapore and companies which are controlled or managed in Singapore, are
subject to Singapore income tax on income accruing in or derived from Singapore
or received in Singapore from outside Singapore.

   A corporate taxpayer is regarded as a tax resident in Singapore if the
company's business is controlled and managed in Singapore (for example, if the
board of directors meets and conducts the company's business in Singapore). An
individual is regarded as resident in Singapore if the individual is physically
present in Singapore or exercises an employment in Singapore (other than as a
director of a company) for 183 days or more in a calendar year, or if the
individual resides in Singapore.

   The corporate tax rate in Singapore is 24.5% for the year of assessment
2002. In addition, 75% of the first SGD10,000 and 50% of the next SGD90,000 of
a company's chargeable income (excluding Singapore dividends) are exempted from
tax.

                                     S-18

<page>

   All tax residents in Singapore will be affected by tax rebates and
exemptions granted by the Singapore government from time to time in line with
its current financial and fiscal policies.

  Ordinary Income Dividends

   Dividends paid by the Trust on SPDRs received by a Singapore resident
individual in Singapore will be liable to tax in Singapore. The rate of tax
will vary according to the individual's circumstances but is subject to a
maximum rate of 26% for the year of assessment 2002.

   Dividends on SPDRs received by a Singapore resident company in Singapore
will be liable to tax in Singapore at the corporate income tax rate, unless an
exemption or concessionary rates are applicable to them.

  Gains on Disposal of the SPDRs

   Singapore does not impose tax on capital gains. However, gains or profits
from any trade, business, profession or vocation will be subject to Singapore
income tax. Any profits from the disposal of SPDRs are not taxable in Singapore
unless the seller is regarded as having derived gains of an income nature, in
which case, such profits would be taxable.

  Stamp Duty

   Stamp duty is not applicable to electronic transfers of the SPDRs through
the CDP system.

  Estate Duty

   Singapore estate duty is imposed on the value of most movable and immovable
property situated in Singapore owned by individuals who are not domiciled in
Singapore, subject to specific exemption limits. Singapore estate duty is
imposed on the value of most immovable property situated in Singapore and on
most movable property, wherever it may be, owned by individuals who are
domiciled in Singapore, subject to specific exemption limits. SPDRs are
considered to be movable property situated outside Singapore.

   SPDRs held by an individual who is domiciled in Singapore are subject to
Singapore estate duty upon such individual's death. Singapore estate duty is
payable to the extent that the value of the SPDRs aggregated with any other
assets subject to Singapore estate duty exceeds SGD600,000. Unless other
exemptions apply to the other assets, for example, the separate exemption limit
for residential properties, any excess beyond SGD600,000 will be taxed at 5% on
the first SGD12,000,000 of the individual's Singapore chargeable assets and
thereafter at 10%. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors
regarding the Singapore estate duty consequences of their ownership of SPDRs.

  * The Trust Agreement became effective, the initial deposit was made and the
    Trust commenced operation on January 22, 1993.
 ** Ordinary operating expenses of the Trust currently are being accrued at an
    annual rate of 0.1200%. Last year's operating expenses were 0.1383%, but
    the excess over 0.1200% was waived by the Trustee and, after earnings
    credits of .0078 were applied, the net expenses of the Trust were 0.1122%.
    Future accruals will depend primarily on the level of the Trust's net
    assets and the level of Trust expenses. The Trustee has agreed to waive a
    portion of its fee until March 9, 2003, but may thereafter discontinue this
    voluntary waiver policy. The Sponsor has undertaken that the ordinary
    operating expenses of the Trust will not exceed an amount that is 0.1845%
    of the daily NAV of the Trust, but this amount may be changed. Therefore,
    there is no guarantee that the Trust's ordinary operating expenses will not
    exceed the current 0.1200% or 0.1845% of the Trust's daily NAV.

                                  Highlights

 .  SPDRs are Ownership Interests in the SPDR Trust

   SPDR Trust, Series 1 ("Trust") is a unit investment trust that issues
securities called "Standard &amp; Poor's Depositary Receipts" or "SPDRs." The Trust
is organized under New York law and is governed by a trust agreement between
State Street Bank and Trust Company ("Trustee") and PDR Services LLC
("Sponsor"), dated and executed as of January 22, 1993 ("Trust Agreement").
SPDRs represent an undivided ownership interest in a portfolio of all of the
common stocks of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index(R) ("S&amp;P
500 Index").

 .  SPDRs Should Closely Track the Value of the Stocks Included in the S&amp;P 500
   Index

   SPDRs intend to provide investment results that, before expenses, generally
correspond to the price and yield performance of the S&amp;P 500 Index. Current
information regarding the value of the S&amp;P 500 Index is available from market
information services. Standard &amp; Poor's, a division of The McGraw-Hill
Companies, Inc. ("S&amp;P") obtains information for inclusion in, or for use in the
calculation of, the S&amp;P 500 Index from sources S&amp;P considers reliable. None of
S&amp;P, the Sponsor, the Trust or the Exchange accepts responsibility for or
guarantees the accuracy and/or completeness of the S&amp;P 500 Index or any data
included in the S&amp;P 500 Index.
   The Trust holds the Portfolio and cash and is not actively "managed" by
traditional methods, which typically involve effecting changes in the Portfolio
on the basis of judgments made relating to economic, financial and market
considerations. To maintain the correspondence between the composition and
weightings of stocks held by the Trust ("Portfolio Securities" or,
collectively, "Portfolio") and component stocks of the S&amp;P 500 Index ("Index
Securities"), the Trustee adjusts the Portfolio from time to time to conform to
periodic changes in the identity and/or relative weightings of Index
Securities. The Trustee aggregates certain of these adjustments and makes
changes to the Portfolio at least monthly or more frequently in the case of
significant changes to the S&amp;P 500 Index. Any change in the identity or
weighting of an Index Security will result in a corresponding adjustment to the
prescribed Portfolio Deposit effective on any day that the New York Stock
Exchange is open for business ("Business Day") following the day on which the
change to the S&amp;P 500 Index takes effect after the close of the market.

   The value of SPDRs fluctuates in relation to changes in the value of the
Portfolio. The market price of each individual SPDR may not be identical to the
net asset value ("NAV") of such SPDR but, historically, these two valuations
have been very close.

                                      3

 .  SPDRs Trade on the American Stock Exchange

   SPDRs are listed for trading on the American Stock Exchange ("Exchange"),
and are bought and sold in the secondary market like ordinary shares of stock
at any time during the trading day. SPDRs are traded on the Exchange in 100
SPDR round lots, but can be traded in odd lots of as little as one SPDR. The
Exchange may halt trading of SPDRs under certain circumstances.

 .  Brokerage Commissions on SPDRs

   Secondary market purchases and sales of SPDRs are subject to ordinary
brokerage commissions and charges.

 .  The Trust Issues and Redeems SPDRs in "Creation Units"

   The Trust issues and redeems SPDRs only in specified large lots of 50,000
SPDRs or multiples thereof referred to as "Creation Units." Creation Units are
issued by the Trust to anyone who, after placing a creation order with ALPS
Distributors, Inc. ("Distributor"), deposits with the Trustee a specified
portfolio of Index Securities and a cash payment generally equal to dividends
(net of expenses) accumulated up to the time of deposit.

   Fractional Creation Units may be created or redeemed only in limited
circumstances.* Creation Units are redeemable in kind only and are not
redeemable for cash. Upon receipt of one or more Creation Units, the Trust
delivers to the redeeming holder a portfolio of Index Securities (based on NAV
of the Trust), together with a cash payment. Each redemption has to be
accompanied by a Cash Redemption Payment that on any given Business Day is an
amount identical to the Cash Component of a Portfolio Deposit.

   If the Trustee determines that one or more Index Securities are likely to be
unavailable, or available in insufficient quantity, for delivery upon creation
of Creation Units, the Trustee may permit the cash equivalent value of one or
more of these Index Securities to be included in the Portfolio Deposit as a
part of the Cash Component in lieu thereof. If a creator is restricted by
regulation or otherwise from investing or engaging in a transaction in one or
more Index Securities, the Trustee may permit the cash equivalent value of such
Index Securities to be included in the Portfolio Deposit based on the market
value of such Index Securities as of the Evaluation Time on the date such
creation order is deemed received by the Distributor as part of the Cash
Component in lieu of the inclusion of such Index Securities in the stock
portion of the
--------
* See the discussion of termination of the Trust in this Summary and "Dividend
  Reinvestment Service," however, for a description of the circumstances in
  which SPDRs may be redeemed or created by the Trustee in less than a Creation
  Unit size aggregation of 50,000 SPDRs.

                                      4

Portfolio Deposit. If the Trustee determines that one or more Index Securities
are likely to be unavailable or available in insufficient quantity for delivery
by the Trust upon the redemption of Creation Units, the Trustee may deliver the
cash equivalent value of one or more of these Index Securities, based on their
market value as of the Evaluation Time on the date the redemption order is
deemed received by the Trustee, as part of the Cash Redemption Payment in lieu
thereof.

 .  Creation Orders Must be Placed with the Distributor

   All orders to create Creation Units must be placed with the Distributor. To
be eligible to place these orders, an entity or person must be (a) a
"Participating Party," or (b) a DTC Participant, and in each case must have
executed an agreement with the Distributor and the Trustee ("Participant
Agreement"). The term "Participating Party" means a broker-dealer or other
participant in the SPDR Clearing Process, through the Continuous Net Settlement
("CNS") System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation ("NSCC"), a
clearing agency registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").
Payment for orders is made by deposits with the Trustee of a portfolio of
securities, substantially similar in composition and weighting to Index
Securities, and a cash payment in an amount equal to the Dividend Equivalent
Payment, plus or minus the Balancing Amount. "Dividend Equivalent Payment" is
an amount equal, on a per Creation Unit basis, to the dividends on the
Portfolio (with ex-dividend dates within the accumulation period), net of
expenses and accrued liabilities for such period (including, without
limitation, (i) taxes or other governmental charges against the Trust not
previously deducted, if any, and (ii) accrued fees of the Trustee and other
expenses of the Trust (including legal and auditing expenses) and other
expenses not previously deducted), calculated as if all of the Portfolio
Securities had been held for the entire accumulation period for such
distribution. The Dividend Equivalent Payment and the Balancing Amount
collectively are referred to as "Cash Component" and the deposit of a portfolio
of securities and the Cash Component collectively are referred to as a
"Portfolio Deposit." Persons placing creation orders with the Distributor must
deposit Portfolio Deposits either (i) through the CNS clearing process of NSCC,
as such processes have been enhanced to effect creations and redemptions of
Creation Units, such processes referred to herein as the "SPDR Clearing
Process," or (ii) with the Trustee outside the SPDR Clearing Process (i.e.
through the facilities of DTC).

   The Distributor acts as underwriter of SPDRs on an agency basis. The
Distributor maintains records of the orders placed with it and the
confirmations of acceptance and furnishes to those placing such orders
confirmations of acceptance of the orders. The Distributor also is responsible
for delivering a prospectus to persons creating SPDRs. The Distributor also
maintains a record of the delivery instructions in response to orders and may
provide certain other administrative services, such as those related to

                                      5

<page>

state securities law compliance. The Distributor is a corporation organized
under the laws of the State of Colorado and is located at 370 17th Street,
Suite 3100, Denver, CO 80202. The Distributor is a registered broker-dealer and
a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. PDR Services
LLC, as Sponsor of the Trust, pays the Distributor for its services a flat
annual fee. The Sponsor will not seek reimbursement for such payment from the
Trust without obtaining prior exemptive relief from the SEC.

 .  Expenses of the Trust

   The expenses of the Trust are accrued daily and reflected in the NAV of the
Trust. After reflecting waivers but before reflecting credits, the Trust
currently is accruing ordinary operating expenses at an annual rate of 0.1200%.

   Future expense accruals will depend primarily on the level of the Trust's
net assets and the level of expenses.

--------
* Until March 9, 2003, the Trustee has agreed to waive a portion of its fee to
  the extent operating expenses exceed 0.1200%. Thereafter, the Trustee may
  discontinue this voluntary waiver policy. Therefore, there is no guarantee
  that the Trust's ordinary operating expenses will not exceed 0.1200% of the
  Trust's daily NAV. Trust expenses were further reduced by a Trustee's
  earnings credit of 0.0078% of the Portfolio's daily NAV as a result of
  uninvested cash balances in the Trust.

                                      6

 .  A Transaction Fee is Payable for Each Creation and for Each Redemption of
   Creation Units

   A transaction fee payable to the Trustee in connection with each creation
and redemption of Creation Units made through the SPDR Clearing Process
("Transaction Fee") is non-refundable, regardless of the NAV of the Trust. This
Transaction Fee is $3,000 per Participating Party per day, regardless of the
number of Creation Units created or redeemed on such day. The $3,000 charge is
subject to a limit not to exceed 10/100 of one percent (10 basis points) of the
value of one Creation Unit at the time of creation ("10 Basis Point Limit").

   For creations and redemptions outside the SPDR Clearing Process, an
additional amount not to exceed three (3) times the Transaction Fee applicable
for one Creation Unit is charged per Creation Unit per day. Under the current
schedule, therefore, the total fee charged in connection with creation or
redemption outside the SPDR Clearing Process would be $3,000 (the Transaction
Fee for the creation or redemption of one Creation Unit) plus an additional
amount up to $9,000 (3 times $3,000), for a total not to exceed $12,000.
Creators and redeemers restricted from engaging in transactions in one or more
Index Securities may pay the Trustee the Transaction Fee and may pay an
additional amount per Creation Unit not to exceed three (3) times the
Transaction Fee applicable for one Creation Unit.

 .  SPDRs are Held in Book Entry Form Only

   The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") or its nominee is the record or
registered owner of all outstanding SPDRs. Beneficial ownership of SPDRs is
shown on the records of the DTC or its participants. Individual certificates
are not issued for SPDRs. See "The Trust--Depository; Book-Entry-Only System."

 .  SPDRs Make Periodic Dividend Payments

   SPDR holders receive on the last Business Day of April, July, October and
January an amount corresponding to the amount of any cash dividends declared on
the Portfolio Securities during the applicable period, net of fees and expenses
associated with operation of the Trust, and taxes, if applicable. Because of
such fees and expenses, the dividend yield for SPDRs is ordinarily less than
that of the S&amp;P 500 Index. Investors should consult their tax advisors
regarding tax consequences associated with Trust dividends, as well as those
associated with SPDR sales or redemptions.

   Quarterly distributions based on the amount of dividends payable with
respect to Portfolio Securities and other income received by the Trust, net of
fees and expenses, and taxes, if applicable, are made via DTC and its
participants to Beneficial Owners

                                      7

<page>

on each Dividend Payment Date. Any capital gain income recognized by the Trust
in any taxable year that is not previously treated as distributed during the
year ordinarily is to be distributed at least annually in January of the
following taxable year. The Trust may make additional distributions shortly
after the end of the year in order to satisfy certain distribution requirements
imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Code"). Although all
distributions are currently made quarterly, the Trustee may vary the
periodicity with which distributions are made. Those Beneficial Owners
interested in reinvesting their quarterly distributions may participate through
DTC Participants in the DTC Dividend Reinvestment Service ("Service") available
through certain brokers. See "The Trust--Depository; Book-Entry-Only System."

 .  The Trust Intends to Qualify as a Regulated Investment Company

   For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001, the Trust believes that it
qualified for tax treatment as a "regulated investment company" under
Subchapter M of the Code. The Trust intends to continue to so qualify and to
distribute annually its entire investment company taxable income and net
capital gain. Distributions that are taxable as ordinary income to Beneficial
Owners generally are expected to constitute dividend income for federal income
tax purposes and to be eligible for the dividends-received deduction available
to many corporations to the extent of qualifying dividend income received by
the Trust. The Trust's regular quarterly distributions are based on the
dividend performance of the Portfolio during such quarterly distribution period
rather than the actual taxable income of the Trust. As a result, a portion of
the distributions of the Trust may be treated as a return of capital or a
capital gain dividend for federal income tax purposes or the Trust may be
required to make additional distributions to maintain its status as a regulated
investment company or to avoid imposition of income or excise taxes on
undistributed income.

 .  Termination of the Trust

   The Trust has a specified lifetime term. The Trust is scheduled to terminate
on the first to occur of (a) January 22, 2118 or (b) the date 20 years after
the death of the last survivor of eleven persons named in the Trust Agreement,
the oldest of whom was born in 1990 and the youngest of whom was born in 1993.
Upon termination, the Trust may be liquidated and pro rata share of the assets
of the Trust, net of certain fees and expenses, distributed to holders of SPDRs.

 .  Purchases of SPDRs by Registered Investment Companies

   Purchases of SPDRs by registered investment companies are subject to
restrictions set forth in Section 12(d)(1) of the Investment Company Act of
1940.

                                 Risk Factors

   Investors can lose money by investing in SPDRs. Investors should carefully
consider the risk factors described below together with all of the other
information included in this Prospectus before deciding to invest in SPDRs.

Investment in the Trust involves the risks inherent in an investment in any
equity security. An investment in the Trust is subject to the risks of any
investment in a broadly based portfolio of common stocks, including the risk
that the general level of stock prices may decline, thereby adversely affecting
the value of such investment. The value of Portfolio Securities may fluctuate
in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the issuers of
Portfolio Securities (particularly those that are heavily weighted in the S&amp;P
500 Index), the value of common stocks generally and other factors. The
identity and weighting of Index Securities and the Portfolio Securities also
change from time to time.

   The financial condition of the issuers may become impaired or the general
condition of the stock market may deteriorate (either of which may cause a
decrease in the value of the Portfolio and thus in the value of SPDRs). Common
stocks are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations and to volatile
increases and decreases in value as market confidence in and perceptions of
their issuers change. These investor perceptions are based on various and
unpredictable factors including expectations regarding government, economic,
monetary and fiscal policies, inflation and interest rates, economic expansion
or contraction, and global or regional political, economic and banking crises.

   Holders of common stocks of any given issuer incur more risk than holders of
preferred stocks and debt obligations of the issuer because the rights of
common stockholders, as owners of the issuer, generally are inferior to the
rights of creditors of, or holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks
issued by, such issuer. Further, unlike debt securities that typically have a
stated principal amount payable at maturity, or preferred stocks that typically
have a liquidation preference and may have stated optional or mandatory
redemption provisions, common stocks have neither a fixed principal amount nor
a maturity. Common stock values are subject to market fluctuations as long as
the common stock remains outstanding. The value of the Portfolio may be
expected to fluctuate over the entire life of the Trust.

   There can be no assurance that the issuers of Portfolio Securities will pay
dividends. Distributions generally depend upon the declaration of dividends by
the issuers of Portfolio Securities and the declaration of such dividends
generally depends upon various factors, including the financial condition of
the issuers and general economic conditions.

                                      9

<page>

The Trust is not actively managed. The Trust is not actively "managed" by
traditional methods, and therefore the adverse financial condition of an issuer
will not result in the elimination of its stocks from the Portfolio unless the
stocks of such issuer are removed from the S&amp;P 500 Index.

A liquid trading market for certain Portfolio Securities may not exist.
Although most of Portfolio Securities are listed on a national securities
exchange, the principal trading market for some may be in the over-the-counter
market. The existence of a liquid trading market for certain Portfolio
Securities may depend on whether dealers will make a market in such stocks.
There can be no assurance that a market will be made for any of Portfolio
Securities, that any market will be maintained or that any such market will be
or remain liquid. The price at which Portfolio Securities may be sold and the
value of the Portfolio will be adversely affected if trading markets for
Portfolio Securities are limited or absent.

The Trust may not always be able exactly to replicate the performance of the
S&amp;P 500 Index. The Trust is not able to replicate exactly the performance of
the S&amp;P 500 Index because the total return generated by the Portfolio is
reduced by Trust expenses and transaction costs incurred in adjusting the
actual balance of the Portfolio. It is also possible that, for a short period,
the Trust may not fully replicate the performance of the S&amp;P 500 Index due to
the temporary unavailability of certain Index Securities in the secondary
market or due to other extraordinary circumstances.

Investment in the Trust may have adverse tax consequences. Investors in the
Trust should also be aware that there are tax consequences associated with the
ownership of SPDRs resulting from the distribution of Trust dividends and sales
of SPDRs as well as under certain circumstances the sales of stocks held by the
Trust in connection with redemptions.

NAV may not always correspond to market price. The NAV of SPDRs in Creation
Unit size aggregations and, proportionately, the NAV per SPDR, changes as
fluctuations occur in the market value of Portfolio Securities. Investors
should be aware that the aggregate public trading market price of 50,000 SPDRs
may be different from the NAV of a Creation Unit (i.e., 50,000 SPDRs may trade
at a premium over, or at a discount to, the NAV of a Creation Unit) and
similarly the public trading market price per SPDR may be different from the
NAV of a Creation Unit on a per SPDR basis. This price difference may be due,
in large part, to the fact that supply and demand forces at work in the
secondary trading market for SPDRs is closely related to, but not identical to,
the same forces influencing the prices of Index Securities trading individually
or in the aggregate at any point in time. Investors also should note that the
size of the Trust in terms of total assets held may change substantially over
time and from time to time as Creation Units are created and redeemed.

                                      10

<page>

The Exchange may halt trading in SPDRs. SPDRs are listed for trading on the
Exchange under the market symbol SPY. Trading in SPDRs may be halted due to
market conditions or, in light of Exchange rules and procedures, for reasons
that, in the view of the Exchange, make trading in SPDRs inadvisable. In
addition, trading is subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market
volatility pursuant to Exchange "circuit breaker" rules that require trading to
be halted for a specified period based on a specified market decline. There can
be no assurance that the requirements of the Exchange necessary to maintain the
listing of SPDRs will continue to be met or will remain unchanged. The Trust
will be terminated if SPDRs are delisted from the Exchange.

SPDRs are subject to market risks. SPDRs are subject to the risks other than
those inherent in an investment in equity securities, discussed above, in that
the selection of the stocks included in the Portfolio, the expenses associated
with the Trust, or other factors distinguishing an ownership interest in a
trust from the direct ownership of a portfolio of stocks may affect trading in
SPDRs.

The regular settlement period for Creation Units may be reduced. Except as
otherwise specifically noted, the time frames for delivery of stocks, cash, or
SPDRs in connection with creation and redemption activity within the SPDR
Clearing Process are based on NSCC's current "regular way" settlement period of
three (3) days during which NSCC is open for business (each such day an "NSCC
Business Day"). NSCC may, in the future, reduce such "regular way" settlement
period, in which case there may be a corresponding reduction in settlement
periods applicable to SPDR creations and redemptions.

Clearing and settlement of Creation Units may be delayed or fail. The Trustee
delivers a portfolio of stocks for each Creation Unit delivered for redemption
substantially identical in weighting and composition to the stock portion of a
Portfolio Deposit as in effect on the date the request for redemption is deemed
received by the Trustee. If redemption is processed through the SPDR Clearing
Process, the stocks that are not delivered are covered by NSCC's guarantee of
the completion of such delivery. Any stocks not received on settlement date are
marked-to-market until delivery is completed. The Trust, to the extent it has
not already done so, remains obligated to deliver the stocks to NSCC, and the
market risk of any increase in the value of the stocks until delivery is made
by the Trust to NSCC could adversely affect the NAV of the Trust. Investors
should note that the stocks to be delivered to a redeemer submitting a
redemption request outside of the SPDR Clearing Process that are not delivered
to such redeemer are not covered by NSCC's guarantee of completion of delivery.

SPDR Trust Series 1
Report of Independent Accountants

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the Trustee and Unitholders of
SPDR Trust Series 1

   In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,
including the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations
and of changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of SPDR Trust Series 1 (the
"Trust") at September 30, 2001, and the results of its operations, the changes
in its net assets and the financial highlights for the periods indicated, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter
referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the Trust's
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial
statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits, which included confirmation of securities at September 30, 2001 by
correspondence with the custodian, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

SPDR Trust Series 1
Notes to Financial Statements
September 30, 2001
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Note 1--Organization

   SPDR Trust Series 1 (the "Trust") is a unit investment trust created under
the laws of the State of New York and registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940. The Trust was created to provide investors with the opportunity to
purchase a security representing a proportionate undivided interest in a
portfolio of securities consisting of substantially all of the common stocks,
in substantially the same weighting, which comprise the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
Composite Price Index (the "S&amp;P Index"). Each unit of fractional undivided
interest in the Trust is referred to as a Standard &amp; Poor's Depositary Receipt
("SPDR"). The Trust commenced operations on January 22, 1993 upon the initial
issuance of 150,000 SPDRs (equivalent to three "Creation Units"--see Note 4) in
exchange for a portfolio of securities assembled to reflect the intended
portfolio composition of the Trust. Effective September 30, 1997, the fiscal
year end of the Trust changed from December 31 to September 30.

Note 2--Significant Accounting Policies

   The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
these estimates. The following is a summary of significant accounting policies
followed by the Trust.

Security Valuation

   Portfolio securities are valued based on the closing sale price on the
exchange which is deemed to be the principal market for the security. If no
closing sale price is available, then the security is valued at the previous
closing sale price on the exchange which is deemed to be the principal market
for the security. If there is no closing sale price available, valuation will
be determined by the Trustee in good faith based on available information.

Investment Transactions

   Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from the sale or disposition of securities are recorded on the
identified cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Distributions to Unitholders

   The Trust declares and distributes dividends from net investment income to
its unitholders quarterly. The Trust will distribute net realized capital
gains, if any, at least annually.

Federal Income Tax

   The Trust has qualified and intends to qualify as a "regulated investment
company" under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
By so qualifying and electing, the Trust will not be subject to federal income
taxes to the extent it distributes its taxable income, including any net
realized capital gains, for each fiscal year. In addition, by distributing
during each calendar year substantially all of its net investment income and
capital gains, if any, the Trust will not be subject to federal excise tax.
Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income
tax regulations which may differ from generally accepted accounting principles.
These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for income
equalization, in-kind transactions and losses deferred due to wash sales. Net

transaction fees received by the Trustee, less the expenses incurred in
processing orders for creation and redemption of SPDRs and (b) the amounts
earned by the Trustee with respect to the cash held by the Trustee for the

Amount reduced the Trustee's fee by $2,307,886. The Adjustment Amount included
a deficiency of net transaction fees from processing orders of ($100,866) and a
Trustee earnings credit of $2,408,752.

(the "Trustee") agreed to reimburse the Trust for, or assume, the ordinary
operating expenses of the Trust, before the Trustee earnings credit, which
exceeded 12.00/100 of 1% per annum of the daily net asset value of the Trust.
The amount of such reimbursement by the Trustee for the year ended September
30, 2001 was $2,674,063.

annually a sub-license fee to the S&amp;P equal to the greater of: (i) 0.03% of the
Trust's daily average net assets of the Trust plus a volume based fee ranging
from $0.03 to $0.04 per round lot trade of the average daily trading volume, or
(ii) $125,000, the minimum annual fee.

   Except for under the Trust's dividend reinvestment plan, SPDRs are issued
and redeemed by the Trust only in Creation Unit size aggregations of 50,000
SPDRs. Such transactions are only permitted on an in-kind basis, with a
separate cash payment which is equivalent to the undistributed net investment
income per SPDR (income equalization) and a balancing cash component to equate
the transaction to the net asset value per unit of the Trust on the transaction
date. A transaction fee of $3,000 is charged in connection with each creation
or redemption of Creation Units through the SPDR Clearing Process per
Participating party per day, regardless of the number of Creation Units created
or redeemed. Transaction fees are received by the Trustee and used to offset
the expense of processing orders.

                                   THE TRUST

   The Trust, an exchange traded fund or "ETF", is a registered investment
company which both (a) continuously issues and redeems "in-kind" its shares,
known as SPDRs, only in large lot sizes called Creation Units at their
once-daily NAV and (b) lists SPDRs individually for trading on the American
Stock Exchange at prices established throughout the trading day, like any other
listed equity security trading in the secondary market on the Exchange.

Creation of Creation Units

   Portfolio Deposits may be made through the SPDR Clearing Process or outside
the SPDR Clearing Process only by a person who executed a Participant Agreement
with the Distributor and the Trustee. The Distributor shall reject any order
that is not submitted in proper form. A creation order is deemed received by
the Distributor on the date on which it is placed ("Transmittal Date") if (a)
such order is received by the Distributor not later than the Closing Time on
such Transmittal Date and (b) all other procedures set forth in the Participant
Agreement are properly followed. The Transaction Fee is charged at the time of
creation of a Creation Unit, and an additional amount not to exceed three (3)
times the Transaction Fee applicable for one Creation Unit is charged for
creations outside the SPDR Clearing Process, in part due to the increased
expense associated with settlement.

   The Trustee, at the direction of the Sponsor, may increase*, reduce or waive
the Transaction Fee (and/or the additional amounts charged in connection with
creations and/or redemptions outside the SPDR Clearing Process) for certain
lot-size creations and/or redemptions of Creation Units. The Sponsor has the
right to vary the lot-size of Creation Units subject to such an increase, a
reduction or waiver. The existence of any such variation shall be disclosed in
the then current SPDR Prospectus.

   The Trustee makes available to NSCC** before the commencement of trading on
each Business Day a list of the names and required number of shares of each
Index Security in the current Portfolio Deposit as well as the amount of the
Dividend Equivalent Payment for the previous Business Day. The identity and
weightings of the Index Securities to be delivered as part of a Portfolio
Deposit are determined daily,
--------
*  Such increase is subject to the 10 Basis Point Limit.
** As of December 31, 2001, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation
   ("DTCC") owned 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of
   NSCC. Also, as of such date, the National Association of Securities Dealers,
   Inc., the parent Company of the Exchange, owned 4.3941% of the issued and
   outstanding shares of common stock of DTCC ("DTCC Shares"), the Exchange
   owned 4.3941% of DTCC Shares, the American Stock Exchange Clearing
   Corporation LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Exchange, owned .00189% of
   DTCC Shares and the Trustee owned 5.3248% of DTCC Shares.

                                      27

reflect the relative weighting of the current S&amp;P 500 Index and, together with
the Cash Component, have a value equal to the NAV of the Trust on a per
Creation Unit basis at the close of business on the day of the creation
request. The identity of each Index Security required for a Portfolio Deposit,
as in effect on September 30, 2001, is set forth in the above Schedule of
Investments. The Sponsor makes available (a) on each Business Day, the Dividend
Equivalent Payment effective through and including the

previous Business Day, per outstanding SPDR, and (b) every 15 seconds
throughout the day at the Exchange a number representing, on a per SPDR basis,
the sum of the Dividend Equivalent Payment effective through and including the
previous Business Day, plus the current value of the stock portion of a
Portfolio Deposit as in effect on such day (which value occasionally includes a
cash in lieu amount to compensate for the omission of a particular Index
Security from such Portfolio Deposit). This information is calculated based
upon the best information available to the Sponsor and may be calculated by
other persons designated to do so by the Sponsor. The inability of the Sponsor
to provide such information will not in itself result in a halt to the trading
of SPDRs on the Exchange.

   Upon receipt of one or more Portfolio Deposits, following placement with the
Distributor of an order to create SPDRs, the Trustee (a) delivers one or more
Creation Units to DTC, (b) removes the SPDR position from its account at DTC
and allocates it to the account of the DTC Participant acting on behalf of the
investor creating Creation Unit(s), (c) increases the aggregate value of the
Portfolio, and (d) decreases the fractional undivided interest in the Trust
represented by each SPDR.

   Under certain circumstances, (a) a portion of the stock portion of a
Portfolio Deposit may consist of contracts to purchase certain Index Securities
or (b) a portion of the Cash Component may consist of cash in an amount
required to enable the Trustee to purchase such Index Securities. If there is a
failure to deliver Index Securities that are the subject of such contracts to
purchase, the Trustee will acquire such Index Securities in a timely manner. To
the extent the price of any such Index Security increases or decreases between
the time of creation and the time of its purchase and delivery, SPDRs will
represent fewer or more shares of such Index Security. Therefore, price
fluctuations during the period from the time the cash is received by the
Trustee to the time the requisite Index Securities are purchased and delivered
will affect the value of all SPDRs.

Procedures for Creation of Creation Units

   All creation orders must be placed in Creation Units and must be received by
the Distributor by no later than the closing time of the regular trading
session on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. ("Closing Time") (ordinarily 4:00
p.m. New York time) in each case on the date such order is placed in order for
creation to be effected based on the NAV of the Trust as determined on such
date. Orders must be transmitted by

                                      28

<page>

telephone or other transmission method acceptable to the Distributor and the
Trustee, pursuant to procedures set forth in the Participant Agreement and
described in this prospectus. Severe economic or market disruptions or changes,
or telephone or other communication failure, may impede the ability to reach
the Distributor, the Trustee, a Participating Party or a DTC Participant.

   SPDRs may be created in advance of receipt by the Trustee of all or a
portion of the Portfolio Deposit. In these circumstances, the initial deposit
has a value greater than the NAV of the SPDRs on the date the order is placed
provided in proper form, because in addition to available Index Securities,
cash collateral must be deposited with the Trustee in an amount equal to the
sum of (a) the Cash Component, plus (b) 115% of the market value of the
undelivered Index Securities ("Additional Cash Deposit"). The Trustee holds
such Additional Cash Deposit as collateral in an account separate and apart
from the Trust. The order is deemed received on the Business Day on which the
order is placed if the order is placed in proper form before the Closing Time,
on such date and federal funds in the appropriate amount are deposited with the
Trustee by 11:00 a.m., New York time, the next Business Day. If the order is
not placed in proper form by the Closing Time or federal funds in the
appropriate amount are not received by 11:00 a.m. the next Business Day, the
order may be deemed to be rejected and the investor shall be liable to the
Trust for any losses, resulting therefrom. An additional amount of cash must be
deposited with the Trustee, pending delivery of the missing Index Securities to
the extent necessary to maintain the Additional Cash Deposit with the Trustee
in an amount at least equal to 115% of the daily mark-to-market value of the
missing Index Securities. If missing Index Securities are not received by 1:00
p.m., New York time, on the third Business Day following the day on which the
purchase order is deemed received and if a mark-to-market payment is not made
within one Business Day following notification by the Distributor that such a
payment is required, the Trustee may use the Additional Cash Deposit to
purchase the missing Index Securities. The Trustee will return any unused
portion of the Additional Cash Deposit once all of the missing Index Securities
have been properly received or purchased by the Trustee and deposited into the
Trust. In addition, a transaction fee of $4,000 is charged in all cases. The
delivery of Creation Units so created will occur no later than the third
Business Day following the day on which the purchase order is deemed received.
The Participant Agreement for any Participating Party intending to follow these
procedures will contain terms and conditions permitting the Trustee to buy the
missing portion(s) of the Portfolio Deposit at any time and will subject the
Participating Party to liability for any shortfall between the cost to the
Trust of purchasing such stocks and the value of such collateral. The
Participating Party is liable to the Trust for the costs incurred by the Trust
in connection with any such purchases. The Trust will have no liability for any
such shortfall.

   All questions as to the number of shares of each Index Security, the amount
of the Cash Component and the validity, form, eligibility (including time of
receipt) and

                                      29

<page>

acceptance for deposit of any Index Securities to be delivered are determined
by the Trustee. The Trustee may reject a creation order if (a) the depositor or
group of depositors, upon obtaining the SPDRs ordered, would own 80% or more of
the current outstanding SPDRs, (b) the Portfolio Deposit is not in proper form;
(c) acceptance of the Portfolio Deposit would have certain adverse tax
consequences; (d) the acceptance of the Portfolio Deposit would, in the opinion
of counsel, be unlawful; (e) the acceptance of the Portfolio Deposit would
otherwise have an adverse effect on the Trust or the rights of Beneficial
Owners; or (f) circumstances outside the control of the Trustee make it for all
practical purposes impossible to process creations of SPDRs. The Trustee and
the Sponsor are under no duty to give notification of any defects or
irregularities in the delivery of Portfolio Deposits or any component thereof
and neither of them shall incur any liability for the failure to give any such
notification.

Placement of Creation Orders Using SPDR Clearing Process

   Creation Units created through the SPDR Clearing Process must be delivered
through a Participating Party that has executed a Participant Agreement. The
Participant Agreement authorizes the Trustee to transmit to the Participating
Party such trade instructions as are necessary to effect the creation order.
Pursuant to the trade instructions from the Trustee to NSCC, the Participating
Party agrees to transfer the requisite Index Securities (or contracts to
purchase such Index Securities that are expected to be delivered through the
SPDR Clearing Process in a "regular way" manner by the third NSCC Business Day)
and the Cash Component to the Trustee, together with such additional
information as may be required by the Trustee.

Placement of Creation Orders Outside SPDR Clearing Process

   Creation Units created outside the SPDR Clearing Process must be delivered
through a DTC Participant that has executed a Participant Agreement and has
stated in its order that it is not using the SPDR Clearing Process and that
creation will instead be effected through a transfer of stocks and cash. The
requisite number of Index Securities must be delivered through DTC to the
account of the Trustee by no later than 11:00 a.m. of the next Business Day
immediately following the Transmittal Date. The Trustee, through the Federal
Reserve Bank wire transfer system, must receive the Cash Component no later
than 2:00 p.m. on the next Business Day immediately following the Transmittal
Date. If the Trustee does not receive both the requisite Index Securities and
the Cash Component in a timely fashion, the order will be cancelled. Upon
written notice to the Distributor, the cancelled order may be resubmitted the
following Business Day using a Portfolio Deposit as newly constituted to
reflect the current NAV of the Trust. The delivery of SPDRs so created will
occur no later than the third (3rd) Business Day following the day on which the
creation order is deemed received by the Distributor.

                                      30

Securities Depository; Book-Entry-Only System

   DTC acts as securities depository for SPDRs. SPDRs are represented by a
single global security, registered in the name of Cede &amp; Co., as nominee for
DTC and deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC.

   DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State
of New York, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a "clearing corporation"
within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a "clearing
agency" registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. DTC holds securities of its participants ("DTC
Participants") and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities
transactions among the DTC Participants through electronic book-entry changes
in their accounts, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of
securities certificates. DTC Participants include securities brokers and
dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other
organizations, some of whom (and/or their representatives) own DTC.* Access to
DTC system also is available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and
trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a
DTC Participant, either directly or indirectly ("Indirect Participants").

   Upon the settlement date of any creation, transfer or redemption of SPDRs,
DTC credits or debits, on its book-entry registration and transfer system, the
amount of SPDRs so created, transferred or redeemed to the accounts of the
appropriate DTC Participants. The accounts to be credited and charged are
designated by the Trustee to NSCC, in the case of a creation or redemption
through the SPDR Clearing Process, or by the Trustee and the DTC Participant,
in the case of a creation or redemption outside of the SPDR Clearing Process.
Beneficial ownership of SPDRs is limited to DTC Participants, Indirect
Participants and persons holding interests through DTC Participants and
Indirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in SPDRs (owners of
such beneficial interests are referred to herein as "Beneficial Owners") is
shown on, and the transfer of ownership is effected only through, records
maintained by DTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on the records of DTC
Participants (with respect to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners that
are not DTC Participants). Beneficial Owners are expected to receive from or
through the DTC Participant a written confirmation relating to their purchase
of SPDRs. The laws of some jurisdictions may require that certain purchasers of
securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. Such
laws may impair the ability of certain investors to acquire beneficial
interests in SPDRs.

   As long as Cede &amp; Co., as nominee of DTC, is the registered owner of SPDRs,
references to the registered or record owner of SPDRs shall mean Cede &amp; Co. and
--------
* As of December 31, 2001, DTCC owned 100% of the issued and outstanding shares
  of the common stock of DTC.

                                      31

<page>

shall not mean the Beneficial Owners of SPDRs. Beneficial Owners of SPDRs are
not entitled to have SPDRs registered in their names, will not receive or be
entitled to receive physical delivery of certificates in definitive form and
will not be considered the record or registered holders thereof under the Trust
Agreement. Accordingly, each Beneficial Owner must rely on the procedures of
DTC, the DTC Participant and any Indirect Participant through which such
Beneficial Owner holds its interests, to exercise any rights under the Trust
Agreement.

   The Trustee recognizes DTC or its nominee as the owner of all SPDRs for all
purposes except as expressly set forth in the Trust Agreement. Pursuant to the
agreement between the Trustee and DTC ("Depository Agreement"), DTC is required
to make available to the Trustee upon request and for a fee to be charged to
the Trust a listing of the SPDR holdings of each DTC Participant. The Trustee
inquires of each such DTC Participant as to the number of Beneficial Owners
holding SPDRs, directly or indirectly, through the DTC Participant. The Trustee
provides each such DTC Participant with copies of such notice, statement or
other communication, in the form, number and at the place as the DTC
Participant may reasonably request, in order that the notice, statement or
communication may be transmitted by the DTC Participant, directly or
indirectly, to the Beneficial Owners. In addition, the Trust pays to each such
DTC Participant a fair and reasonable amount as reimbursement for the expense
attendant to such transmittal, all subject to applicable statutory and
regulatory requirements.

   Distributions are made to DTC or its nominee, Cede &amp; Co. DTC or Cede &amp; Co.,
upon receipt of any payment of distributions in respect of SPDRs, is required
immediately to credit DTC Participants' accounts with payments in amounts
proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in SPDRs, as shown on
the records of DTC or its nominee. Payments by DTC Participants to Indirect
Participants and Beneficial Owners of SPDRs held through such DTC Participants
will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now
the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or
registered in a "street name," and will be the responsibility of such DTC
Participants. Neither the Trustee nor the Sponsor has or will have any
responsibility or liability for any aspects of the records relating to or
notices to Beneficial Owners, or payments made on account of beneficial
ownership interests in SPDRs, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any
records relating to such beneficial ownership interests or for any other aspect
of the relationship between DTC and the DTC Participants or the relationship
between such DTC Participants and the Indirect Participants and Beneficial
Owners owning through such DTC Participants.

   DTC may discontinue providing its service with respect to SPDRs at any time
by giving notice to the Trustee and the Sponsor and discharging its
responsibilities with respect thereto under applicable law. Under such
circumstances, the Trustee and the

                                      32

<page>

Sponsor shall take action either to find a replacement for DTC to perform its
functions at a comparable cost or, if such a replacement is unavailable, to
terminate the Trust.

                              REDEMPTION OF SPDRS

   SPDRs are redeemable only in Creation Units. Creation Units are redeemable
in kind only and are not redeemable for cash except as described under
"Summary--Highlights--Termination of the Trust."

Procedures for Redemption of Creation Units

   Redemption orders must be placed with a Participating Party (for redemptions
through the SPDR Clearing Process) or DTC Participant (for redemptions outside
the SPDR Clearing Process), as applicable, in the form required by such
Participating Party or DTC Participant. A particular broker may not have
executed a Participant Agreement, and redemption orders may have to be placed
by the broker through a Participating Party or a DTC Participant who has
executed a Participant Agreement. At any given time, there may be only a
limited number of broker-dealers that have executed a Participant Agreement.
Redeemers should afford sufficient time to permit (a) proper submission of the
order by a Participating Party or DTC Participant to the Trustee and (b) the
receipt of the SPDRs to be redeemed and any Excess Cash Amounts by the Trustee
in a timely manner. Orders for redemption effected outside the SPDR Clearing
Process are likely to require transmittal by the DTC Participant earlier on the
Transmittal Date than orders effected using the SPDR Clearing Process. These
deadlines vary by institution. Persons redeeming outside the SPDR Clearing
Process are required to transfer SPDRs through DTC and the Excess Cash amounts,
if any, through the Federal Reserve Bank wire transfer system in a timely
manner.

   Requests for redemption may be made on any Business Day to the Trustee and
not to the Distributor. In the case of redemptions made through the SPDR
Clearing Process, the Transaction Fee is deducted from the amount delivered to
the redeemer. In the case of redemptions outside the SPDR Clearing Process, the
Transaction Fee plus an additional amount not to exceed three (3) times the
Transaction Fee applicable for one Creation Unit per Creation Unit redeemed,
and such amount is deducted from the amount delivered to the redeemer.

   The Trustee transfers to the redeeming Beneficial Owner via DTC and the
relevant DTC Participant(s) a portfolio of stocks for each Creation Unit
delivered, generally identical in weighting and composition to the stock
portion of a Portfolio Deposit as in effect (a) on the date a request for
redemption is deemed received by the Trustee or (b) in the case of the
termination of the Trust, on the date that notice of the

                                      33

<page>

termination of the Trust is given. The Trustee also transfers via the relevant
DTC Participant(s) to the redeeming Beneficial Owner a "Cash Redemption
Payment," which on any given Business Day is an amount identical to the amount
of the Cash Component and is equal to a proportional amount of the following:
dividends on the Portfolio Securities for the period through the date of
redemption, net of expenses and liabilities for such period including, without
limitation, (i) taxes or other governmental charges against the Trust not
previously deducted if any, and (ii) accrued fees of the Trustee and other
expenses of the Trust, as if the Portfolio Securities had been held for the
entire accumulation period for such distribution, plus or minus the Balancing
Amount. The redeeming Beneficial Owner must deliver to the Trustee any amount
by which the amount payable to the Trust by such Beneficial Owner exceeds the
amount of the Cash Redemption Payment ("Excess Cash Amounts"). For redemptions
through the SPDR Clearing Process, the Trustee effects a transfer of the Cash
Redemption Payment and stocks to the redeeming Beneficial Owner by the third
(3rd) NSCC Business Day following the date on which request for redemption is
deemed received. For redemptions outside the SPDR Clearing Process, the Trustee
transfers the Cash Redemption Payment and the stocks to the redeeming
Beneficial Owner by the third (3rd) Business Day following the date on which
the request for redemption is deemed received. The Trustee will cancel all
SPDRs delivered upon redemption.

   If the Trustee determines that an Index Security is likely to be unavailable
or available in insufficient quantity for delivery by the Trust upon
redemption, the Trustee may elect to deliver the cash equivalent value of any
such Index Securities, based on its market value as of the Evaluation Time on
the date such redemption is deemed received by the Trustee as a part of the
Cash Redemption Payment in lieu thereof.

   If a redeemer is restricted by regulation or otherwise from investing or
engaging in a transaction in one or more Index Securities, the Trustee may
elect to deliver the cash equivalent value based on the market value of any
such Index Securities as of the Evaluation Time on the date of the redemption
as a part of the Cash Redemption Payment in lieu thereof. In such case, the
investor will pay the Trustee the standard Transaction Fee, and may pay an
additional amount equal to the actual amounts incurred in connection with such
transaction(s) but in any case not to exceed three (3) times the Transaction
Fee applicable for one Creation Unit.

   The Trustee upon the request of a redeeming investor, may elect to redeem
Creation Units in whole or in part by providing such redeemer, with a portfolio
of stocks differing in exact composition from Index Securities but not
differing in NAV from the then-current Portfolio Deposit. Such a redemption is
likely to be made only if it were determined that it would be appropriate in
order to maintain the Trust's correspondence to the composition and weighting
of the S&amp;P 500 Index.

                                      34

   The Trustee may sell Portfolio Securities to obtain sufficient cash proceeds
to deliver to the redeeming Beneficial Owner. To the extent cash proceeds are
received by the Trustee in excess of the required amount, such cash proceeds
shall be held by the Trustee and applied in accordance with the guidelines
applicable to Misweighting.

   All redemption orders must be transmitted to the Trustee by telephone or
other transmission method acceptable to the Trustee so as to be received by the
Trustee not later than the Closing Time on the Transmittal Date, pursuant to
procedures set forth in the Participant Agreement. Severe economic or market
disruption or changes, or telephone or other communication failure, may impede
the ability to reach the Trustee, a Participating Party, or a DTC Participant.

   The calculation of the value of the stocks and the Cash Redemption Payment
to be delivered to the redeeming Beneficial Owner is made by the Trustee
according to the procedures set forth under "Valuation" and is computed as of
the Evaluation Time on the Business Day on which a redemption order is deemed
received by the Trustee. Therefore, if a redemption order in proper form is
submitted to the Trustee by a DTC Participant not later than the Closing Time
on the Transmittal Date, and the requisite SPDRs are delivered to the Trustee
prior to DTC Cut-Off Time on such Transmittal Date, then the value of the
stocks and the Cash Redemption Payment to be delivered to the Beneficial Owner
is determined by the Trustee as of the Evaluation Time on such Transmittal
Date. If, however, a redemption order is submitted not later than the Closing
Time on a Transmittal Date but either (a) the requisite SPDRs are not delivered
by DTC Cut-Off Time on the next Business Day immediately following such
Transmittal Date or (b) the redemption order is not submitted in proper form,
then the redemption order is not deemed received as of such Transmittal Date.
In such case, the value of the stocks and the Cash Redemption Payment to be
delivered to the Beneficial Owner is computed as of the Evaluation Time on the
Business Day that such order is deemed received by the Trustee, i.e., the
Business Day on which the SPDRs are delivered through DTC to the Trustee by DTC
Cut-Off Time on such Business Day pursuant to a properly submitted redemption
order.

   The Trustee may suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the date of
payment of the NAV for more than five (5) Business Days following the date on
which the request for redemption is deemed received by the Trustee (a) for any
period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, (b) for any period
during which an emergency exists as a result of which disposal or evaluation of
the Securities is not reasonably practicable, (c) or for such other period as
the SEC may by order permit for the protection of Beneficial Owners. Neither
the Sponsor nor the Trustee is liable to any person or in any way for any loss
or damages that may result from any such suspension or postponement.

Placement of Redemption Orders Using SPDR Clearing Process

   A redemption order made through the SPDR Clearing Process is deemed received
on the Transmittal Date if (a) such order is received by the Trustee not later
than the Closing Time on such Transmittal Date and (b) all other procedures set
forth in the Participant Agreement are properly followed. The order is effected
based on the NAV of the Trust as determined as of the Evaluation Time on the
Transmittal Date. A redemption order made through the SPDR Clearing Process and
received by the Trustee after the Closing Time will be deemed received on the
next Business Day immediately following the Transmittal Date. The Participant
Agreement authorizes the Trustee to transmit to NSCC on behalf of the
Participating Party such trade instructions as are necessary to effect the
Participating Party's redemption order. Pursuant to such trade instructions
from the Trustee to NSCC, the Trustee transfers the requisite stocks (or
contracts to purchase such stocks which are expected to be delivered in a
"regular way" manner) by the third (3rd) NSCC Business Day following the date
on which the request for redemption is deemed received, and the Cash Redemption
Payment.

Placement of Redemption Orders Outside SPDR Clearing Process

   A DTC Participant who wishes to place an order for redemption of SPDRs to be
effected outside the SPDR Clearing Process need not be a Participating Party,
but its order must state that the DTC Participant is not using the SPDR
Clearing Process and that redemption will instead be effected through transfer
of SPDRs directly through DTC. An order is deemed received by the Trustee on
the Transmittal Date if (a) such order is received by the Trustee not later
than the Closing Time on such Transmittal Date, (b) such order is preceded or
accompanied by the requisite number of SPDRs specified in such order, which
delivery must be made through DTC to the Trustee no later than 11:00 a.m. on
the next Business Day immediately following such Transmittal Date ("DTC Cut-Off
Time") and (iii) all other procedures set forth in the Participant Agreement
are properly followed. Any Excess Cash Amounts owed by the Beneficial Owner
must be delivered no later than 2:00 p.m. on the next Business Day immediately
following the Transmittal Date.

   The Trustee initiates procedures to transfer the requisite stocks (or
contracts to purchase such stocks that are expected to be delivered within
three Business Days and the Cash Redemption Payment to the redeeming Beneficial
Owner by the third Business Day following the Transmittal Date.

                                 THE PORTFOLIO

   Because the objective of the Trust is to provide investment results that,
before expenses, generally correspond to the price and yield performance of the
S&amp;P 500

                                      36

<page>

Index, the Portfolio at any time will consist of as many of Index Securities as
is practicable. It is anticipated that cash or cash items (other than dividends
held for distribution) normally would not be a substantial part of the Trust's
net assets. Although the Trust may at any time fail to own certain of Index
Securities, the Trust will be substantially invested in Index Securities and
the Sponsor believes that such investment should result in a close
correspondence between the investment performance of the S&amp;P 500 Index and that
derived from ownership of SPDRs.

Portfolio Securities Conform to the S&amp;P 500 Index

   The S&amp;P 500 Index is a capitalization-weighted index of 500 securities
calculated under the auspices of the S&amp;P Committee of S&amp;P. At any moment in
time, the value of the S&amp;P 500 Index equals the aggregate market value of the
total shares outstanding in each of the component 500 Index Securities,
evaluated at their respective last sale prices on the NYSE, AMEX or NASDAQ,
divided by a scaling factor ("divisor") which yields a resulting index value in
the reported magnitude.

   Periodically (typically, several times per quarter), S&amp;P may determine that
total shares outstanding have changed in one or more component Index Securities
due to secondary offerings, repurchases, conversions or other corporate
actions. Additionally, the S&amp;P Committee may periodically (ordinarily, several
times per quarter) replace one or more component securities in the S&amp;P Index
due to mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, or other market conditions, or if
the issuers of such component securities fail to meet the criteria for
inclusion in the S&amp;P 500 Index. In 2001, there were 34 company changes to the
S&amp;P 500 Index. Ordinarily, whenever there is a change in shares outstanding or
a change in a component security of the S&amp;P 500 Index, S&amp;P adjusts the divisor
to ensure that there is no discontinuity in the value of the S&amp;P 500 Index.

   The Trust is not managed and therefore the adverse financial condition of an
issuer does not require the sale of stocks from the Portfolio. The Trustee on a
non-discretionary basis adjusts the composition of the Portfolio to conform to
changes in the composition and/or weighting structure of Index Securities. To
the extent that the method of determining the S&amp;P 500 Index is changed by S&amp;P
in a manner that would affect the adjustments provided for herein, the Trustee
and the Sponsor have the right to amend the Trust Agreement, without the
consent of DTC or Beneficial Owners, to conform the adjustments to such changes
and to maintain the objective of tracking the S&amp;P 500 Index.

   The Trustee aggregates certain of these adjustments and makes conforming
changes to the Portfolio at least monthly. The Trustee directs its stock
transactions only to brokers or dealers, which may include affiliates of the
Trustee, from whom it expects to obtain the most favorable prices or execution
of orders. Adjustments are

                                      37

<page>

made more frequently in the case of significant changes to the S&amp;P 500 Index.
Specifically, the Trustee is required to adjust the composition of the
Portfolio whenever there is a change in the identity of any Index Security
(i.e., a substitution of one security for another) within three (3) Business
Days before or after the day on which the change is scheduled to take effect.
If the transaction costs incurred by the Trust in adjusting the Portfolio would
exceed the expected variation between the composition of the Portfolio and the
S&amp;P 500 Index ("Misweighting"), it may not be efficient identically to
replicate the share composition of the S&amp;P 500 Index. Minor Misweighting
generally is permitted within the guidelines set forth below. The Trustee is
required to adjust the composition of the Portfolio at any time that the
weighting of any stock in the Portfolio varies in excess of one hundred and
fifty percent (150%) of a specified percentage, which percentage varies from
8/100 of 1% to 2/100 of 1%, depending on the NAV of the Trust (in each case,
"Misweighting Amount"), from the weighting of the Index Security in the S&amp;P 500
Index.

   The Trustee examines each stock in the Portfolio on each Business Day,
comparing its weighting to the weighting of the corresponding Index Security,
based on prices at the close of the market on the preceding Business Day (a
"Weighting Analysis"). If there is a Misweighting in any stock in the Portfolio
in excess of one hundred and fifty percent (150%) of the applicable
Misweighting Amount, the Trustee calculates an adjustment to the Portfolio in
order to bring the Misweighting within the Misweighting Amount, based on prices
at the close of the market on the day on which such Misweighting occurs. Also,
on a monthly basis, the Trustee performs a Weighting Analysis for each stock in
the Portfolio, and in any case where there exists a Misweighting exceeding one
hundred percent (100%) of the applicable Misweighting Amount, the Trustee
calculates an adjustment to the Portfolio in order to bring the Misweighting
within the applicable Misweighting Amount, based on prices at the close of the
market on the day on which such Misweighting occurs. In the case of any
adjustment to the Portfolio because of a Misweighting, the purchase or sale of
stock necessitated by the adjustment is made within three (3) Business Days of
the day on which such Misweighting is determined. In addition to the foregoing
adjustments, the Trustee may make additional periodic adjustments to Portfolio
Securities that may be misweighted by an amount within the applicable
Misweighting Amount.

   The foregoing guidelines with respect to Misweighting also apply to any
Index Security that (a) is likely to be unavailable for delivery or available
in insufficient quantity for delivery or (b) cannot be delivered to the Trustee
due to restrictions prohibiting a creator from engaging in a transaction
involving such Index Security. Upon receipt of an order for a Creation Unit
that involves such an Index Security, the Trustee determines whether the
substitution of cash for the stock would cause a Misweighting in the Portfolio.
If a Misweighting results, the Trustee will purchase the required number of
shares of the Index Security on the opening of the market on the

                                      38

<page>

following Business Day. If a Misweighting does not result and the Trustee does
not hold cash in excess of the permitted amounts, the Trustee may hold the cash
or, if such excess would result, make the required adjustments to the Portfolio.

   As a result of the purchase and sale of stock in accordance with these
requirements, or the creation of Creation Units, the Trust may hold some amount
of residual cash (other than cash held temporarily due to timing differences
between the sale and purchase of stock or cash delivered in lieu of Index
Securities or undistributed income or undistributed capital gains). This amount
may not exceed for more than two (2) consecutive Business Days 5/10th of 1
percent of the value of the Portfolio. If the Trustee has made all required
adjustments and is left with cash in excess of 5/10th of 1 percent of the value
of the Portfolio, the Trustee will use such cash to purchase additional Index
Securities that are under-weighted in the Portfolio as compared to their
relative weightings in the S&amp;P 500 Index, although the Misweighting of such
Index Securities may not be in excess of the applicable Misweighting Amount.

   All portfolio adjustments are made as described herein unless such
adjustments would cause the Trust to lose its status as a "regulated investment
company" under Subchapter M of the Code. Additionally, the Trustee is required
to adjust the composition of the Portfolio at any time to insure the continued
qualification of the Trust as a regulated investment company.

   The Trustee relies on industry sources for information as to the composition
and weightings of Index Securities. If the Trustee becomes incapable of
obtaining or processing such information or NSCC is unable to receive such
information from the Trustee on any Business Day, the Trustee shall use the
composition and weightings of Index Securities for the most recently effective
Portfolio Deposit for the purposes of all adjustments and determinations
(including, without limitation, determination of the stock portion of the
Portfolio Deposit) until the earlier of (a) such time as current information
with respect to Index Securities is available or (b) three (3) consecutive
Business Days have elapsed. If such current information is not available and
three (3) consecutive Business Days have elapsed, the composition and
weightings of Portfolio Securities (as opposed to Index Securities) shall be
used for the purposes of all adjustments and determinations (including, without
limitation, determination of the stock portion of the Portfolio Deposit) until
current information with respect to Index Securities is available.

   If the Trust is terminated, the Trustee shall use the composition and
weightings of Portfolio Securities as of such notice date for the purpose and
determination of all redemptions or other required uses of the basket.

   From time to time S&amp;P may adjust the composition of the S&amp;P 500 Index
because of a merger or acquisition involving one or more Index Securities. In
such

                                      39

<page>

cases, the Trust, as shareholder of an issuer that is the object of such merger
or acquisition activity, may receive various offers from would-be acquirors of
the issuer. The Trustee is not permitted to accept any such offers until such
time as it has been determined that the stocks of the issuer will be removed
from the S&amp;P 500 Index. As stocks of an issuer are often removed from the S&amp;P
500 Index only after the consummation of a merger or acquisition of such
issuer, in selling the securities of such issuer the Trust may receive, to the
extent that market prices do not provide a more attractive alternative,
whatever consideration is being offered to the shareholders of such issuer that
have not tendered their shares prior to such time. Any cash received in such
transactions is reinvested in Index Securities in accordance with the criteria
set forth above. Any stocks received as a part of the consideration that are
not Index Securities are sold as soon as practicable and the cash proceeds of
such sale are reinvested in accordance with the criteria set forth above.

Adjustments to the Portfolio Deposit

   On each Business Day (each such day an "Adjustment Day"), the number of
shares and identity of each Index Security in a Portfolio Deposit are adjusted
in accordance with the following procedure. At the close of the market the
Trustee calculates the NAV of the Trust. The NAV is divided by the number of
outstanding SPDRs multiplied by 50,000 SPDRs in one Creation Unit, resulting in
a NAV per Creation Unit ("NAV Amount"). The Trustee then calculates the number
of shares (without rounding) of each of the component stocks of the S&amp;P 500
Index in a Portfolio Deposit for the following Business Day ("Request Day"), so
that (a) the market value at the close of the market on the Adjustment Day of
the stocks to be included in the Portfolio Deposit on Request Day, together
with the Dividend Equivalent Payment effective for requests to create or redeem
on the Adjustment Day, equals the NAV Amount and (b) the identity and weighting
of each of the stocks in a Portfolio Deposit mirrors proportionately the
identity and weightings of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 Index, each as in effect
on Request Day. For each stock, the number resulting from such calculation is
rounded to the nearest whole share, with a fraction of 0.50 being rounded up.
The identities and weightings of the stocks so calculated constitute the stock
portion of the Portfolio Deposit effective on Request Day and thereafter until
the next subsequent Adjustment Day, as well as Portfolio Securities to be
delivered by the Trustee in the event of request for redemption on the Request
Day and thereafter until the following Adjustment Day.

   In addition to the foregoing adjustments, if a corporate action such as a
stock split, stock dividend or reverse split occurs with respect to any Index
Security that does not result in an adjustment to the S&amp;P 500 Index divisor,
the Portfolio Deposit shall be adjusted to take into account the corporate
action in each case rounded to the nearest whole share.

                                      40

<page>

   On the Request Day and on each day that a request for the creation or
redemption is deemed received, the Trustee calculates the market value of the
stock portion of the Portfolio Deposit as in effect on the Request Day as of
the close of the market and adds to that amount the Dividend Equivalent Payment
effective for requests to create or redeem on Request Day (such market value
and Dividend Equivalent Payment are collectively referred to herein as
"Portfolio Deposit Amount"). The Trustee then calculates the NAV Amount, based
on the close of the market on the Request Day. The difference between the NAV
Amount so calculated and the Portfolio Deposit Amount is the "Balancing
Amount". The Balancing Amount serves the function of compensating for any
differences between the value of the Portfolio Deposit Amount and the NAV
Amount at the close of trading on Request Day due to, for example, (a)
differences in the market value of the securities in the Portfolio Deposit and
the market value of the Securities on Request Day and (b) any variances from
the proper composition of the Portfolio Deposit.

   On any Adjustment Day on which (a) no change in the identity and/or share
weighting of any Index Security is scheduled to take effect that would cause
the S&amp;P 500 Index divisor to be adjusted after the close of the market on that
Business Day,* and (b) no stock split, stock dividend or reverse stock split
with respect to any Index Security has been declared to take effect on the
corresponding Request Day, the Trustee may forego making any adjustment to the
stock portion of the Portfolio Deposit and to use the composition and
weightings of Index Securities for the most recently effective Portfolio
Deposit for the Request Day following such Adjustment Day. In addition, the
Trustee may calculate the adjustment to the number of shares and identity of
Index Securities in a Portfolio Deposit as described above except that such
calculation would be employed two (2) Business Days rather than one (1)
Business Day before the Request Day.

   The Dividend Equivalent Payment and the Balancing Amount in effect at the
close of business on the Request Date are collectively referred to as the Cash
Component or the Cash Redemption Payment. If the Balancing Amount is a positive
number (i.e., if the NAV Amount exceeds the Portfolio Deposit Amount) then,
with respect to creation, the Balancing Amount increases the Cash Component of
the then effective Portfolio Deposit transferred to the Trustee by the creator.
With respect to redemptions, the Balancing Amount is added to the cash
transferred to the redeemer by the Trustee. If the Balancing Amount is a
negative number (i.e., if the NAV Amount is less than the Portfolio Deposit
Amount) then, with respect to creation, this amount decreases the Cash
Component of the then effective Portfolio Deposit to be transferred to the
Trustee by the creator or, if such cash portion is less than the Balancing
Amount, the difference must be paid by the Trustee to the creator. With
--------
* S&amp;P publicly announces changes in the identity and/or weighting of Index
  Securities up to five Business Days in advance of the actual change. The
  announcements are made after the close of trading on such day.

                                      41

<page>

respect to redemptions, the Balancing Amount is deducted from the cash
transferred to the redeemer or, if such cash is less than the Balancing Amount,
the difference must be paid by the redeemer to the Trustee.

   If the Trustee has included the cash equivalent value of one or more Index
Securities in the Portfolio Deposit because the Trustee has determined that
such Index Securities are likely to be unavailable or available in insufficient
quantity for delivery, of if a creator or redeemer is restricted from investing
or engaging in transactions in one or more of such Index Securities, the
Portfolio Deposit so constituted shall determine the Index Securities to be
delivered in connection with the creation of SPDRs in Creation Unit size
aggregations and upon the redemption of SPDRs until the time the stock portion
of the Portfolio Deposit is subsequently adjusted.

                               THE S&amp;P 500 INDEX

The S&amp;P 500 Index is composed of 500 selected stocks, all of which are listed
on the AMEX, the NYSE or NASDAQ, and spans over 108 separate industry groups.
As of December 31, 2001, the five largest industry segments comprising the S&amp;P
500 Index were: financial (diversified) 5.81%, health care (drugs--major
pharmaceuticals) 5.78%, computers (software &amp; services) 5.24%, oil
(international integrated) 4.48% and electrical equipment 4.43%. Since 1968,
the S&amp;P 500 Index has been a component of the U.S. Commerce Department's list
of Leading Indicators that track key sectors of the U.S. economy. Current
information regarding the market value of the S&amp;P 500 Index is available from
market information services. The S&amp;P 500 Index is determined, comprised and
calculated without regard to the Trust.

   S&amp;P is not responsible for and does not participate in the creation or sale
of SPDRs or in the determination of the timing, pricing, or quantities and
proportions of purchases or sales of Index Securities or Portfolio Securities.
The information in this Prospectus concerning S&amp;P and the S&amp;P 500 Index has
been obtained from sources that the Sponsor believes to be reliable, but the
Sponsor takes no responsibility for the accuracy of such information.

   The following table shows the actual performance of the S&amp;P 500 Index for
the years 1960 through 2001. Stock prices fluctuated widely during this period
and were higher at the end than at the beginning. The results shown should not
be considered representative of the income yield or capital gain or loss that
may be generated by the S&amp;P 500 Index in the future. The results should not be
considered representative of the performance of the Trust.

                               EXCHANGE LISTING

   SPDRs are listed on the Exchange. The Trust is not required to pay a listing
fee to the Exchange. Transactions involving SPDRs in the public trading market
are subject to customary brokerage charges and commissions.

   The Sponsor's aim in designing SPDRs was to provide investors with a
security whose initial market value would approximate one-tenth (1/10th) the
value of the S&amp;P 500 Index. Of course, the market value of a SPDR is affected
by a variety of factors, including capital gains distributions made, and
expenses incurred, by the Trust, and therefore, over time, a SPDR may no longer
approximate 1/10th the value of the S&amp;P 500 Index. The market price of a SPDR
should reflect its share of the dividends accumulated on Portfolio Securities
and may be affected by supply and demand, market volatility, sentiment and
other factors.

   There can be no assurance that SPDRs will always be listed on the Exchange.
The Trust will be terminated if SPDRs are delisted. The Exchange will consider
the suspension of trading in or removal from listing of SPDRs if (a) the Trust
has more than 60 days remaining until termination and there are fewer than 50
record and/or beneficial holders of SPDRs for 30 or more consecutive trading
days; (b) the S&amp;P 500 Index is no longer calculated or available; or (c) such
other event occurs or condition exists which, in the opinion of the Exchange,
makes further dealings on the Exchange inadvisable.

   SPDRs also are listed and traded on the Singapore Exchange Ltd. ("SGX")
pursuant to a joint venture created by the Exchange and the SGX. In the future,
SPDRs may be listed and traded on other non-U.S. exchanges pursuant to similar
arrangements.

                            TAX STATUS OF THE TRUST

   Effective September 30, 1997, the Trust changed its fiscal year from a
calendar year ending on each December 31 to a fiscal year ending each September
30. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001, the Trust believes that it
qualified for tax treatment as a "regulated investment company" under
Subchapter M of the Code. The Trust intends to continue to so qualify. To
qualify as a regulated investment company, the Trust must, among other things,
(a) derive in each taxable year at least 90% of its

                                      45

<page>

gross income from dividends, interest, gains from the sale or other disposition
of stock, securities or foreign currencies, or certain other sources, (b) meet
certain diversification tests, and (c) distribute in each year at least 90% of
its investment company taxable income. If the Trust qualifies as a regulated
investment company, subject to certain conditions and requirements, the Trust
will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent its income is
distributed in a timely manner. Any undistributed income may be subject to tax,
including a four percent (4%) excise tax imposed by section 4982 of the Code on
certain undistributed income of a regulated investment company that does not
distribute to shareholders in a timely manner at least ninety-eight percent
(98%) of its taxable income (including capital gains).

Tax Consequences to Beneficial Owners

   Dividends paid by the Trust from its investment company taxable income
(which includes dividends, interest and the excess of net short-term capital
gains over net long-term capital losses) are taxable to Beneficial Owners as
ordinary income. A dividend paid in January is considered for federal income
tax purposes to have been paid by the Trust and received by Beneficial Owners
on the preceding December 31 if the dividend was declared in the preceding
October, November or December to Beneficial Owners of record as shown on the
records of DTC and the DTC Participants on a date in one of those months.

   Distributions paid by the Trust from the excess of net long-term capital
gains over net short-term capital losses are considered "capital gains
dividends" regardless of the length of time an investor has owned SPDRs. Any
loss on the sale or exchange of a share held for six months or less may be
treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any capital gain dividends
received by the Beneficial Owner. For corporate investors, dividends from net
investment income (but not return of capital distributions or capital gain
dividends) generally qualify for the corporate dividends-received deduction to
the extent of qualifying dividend income received by the Trust, subject to the
limitations contained in the Code. Investors should note that the regular
quarterly dividends paid by the Trust are not based on the Trust's investment
company taxable income and net capital gain, but rather are based on the
dividends paid with respect to Portfolio Securities. As a result, a portion of
the distributions of the Trust may be treated as a return of capital or a
capital gain dividend for federal income tax purposes or the Trust may make
additional distributions in excess of the yield performance of Portfolio
Securities in order to distribute all of its investment company taxable income
and net capital gain.

   Distributions in excess of the Trust's current or accumulated earnings and
profits (as specially computed) generally are treated as a return of capital
for federal income tax purposes and reduce a Beneficial Owner's tax basis in
SPDRs. Return of capital distributions may result, for example, if a portion of
the dividends declared represents

                                      46

<page>

cash amounts deposited in connection with Portfolio Deposits rather than
dividends actually received by the Trust. Under certain circumstances, a
significant portion of the Trust's regular quarterly dividends could be treated
as return of capital distributions. Such circumstances may be more likely to
occur in periods during which the number of outstanding SPDRs fluctuates
significantly, as may occur during the initial years of the Trust. Beneficial
Owners receive annually notification from the Trustee through the DTC
Participants as to the tax status of the Trust's distributions. A distribution
paid shortly after a purchase or creation of SPDRs may be taxable even though
in effect it may represent a return of capital.

   Distributions reinvested in additional SPDRs through the means of the
Service are nevertheless taxable dividends to Beneficial Owners acquiring such
additional SPDRs to the same extent as if such dividends were received in cash.

   The sale of SPDRs by a Beneficial Owner is a taxable event, and may result
in a gain or loss, which generally should be a capital gain or loss for
Beneficial Owners that are not dealers in securities.

   Dividend distributions, capital gains distributions, and capital gains from
sales or redemptions may also be subject to state, local and foreign taxes.

   Under the Code, an in-kind redemption of SPDRs does not result in the
recognition of taxable gain or loss by the Trust but generally constitutes a
taxable event for the redeeming shareholder. Upon redemption, a Beneficial
Owner generally recognizes gain or loss measured by the difference on the date
of redemption between the aggregate value of the cash and stocks received and
its tax basis in the SPDRs redeemed. Stocks received upon redemption (which
will be comprised of the stock portion of the Portfolio Deposit in effect on
the date of redemption) generally have an initial tax basis equal to their
respective market values on the date of redemption. The Internal Revenue
Service ("IRS") may assert that any resulting loss may not be deducted by a
Beneficial Owner on the basis that there has been no material change in such
Beneficial Owner's economic position or that the transaction has no significant
economic or business utility apart from the anticipated tax consequences.
Beneficial Owners of SPDRs in Creation Unit size aggregations should consult
their own tax advisors as to the consequences to them of the redemption of
SPDRs.

   Deposit of a Portfolio Deposit with the Trustee in exchange for Creation
Units do not result in the recognition of taxable gain or loss by the Trust but
generally constitute a taxable event to the investor under the Code, and an
investor generally recognizes gain or loss with respect to each stock deposited
equal to the difference between the amount realized in respect of the stock and
the investor's tax basis therein. The amount realized with respect to a stock
deposited should be determined by allocating the value on the date of deposit
of the SPDRs received (less any cash paid to the Trust, or plus any cash
received from the Trust, in connection with the

                                      47

<page>

deposit) among the stocks deposited on the basis of their respective fair
market values at that time. The IRS may assert that any resulting losses may
not be deducted by an investor on the basis that there has been no material
change in the investor's economic position or that the transaction has no
significant economic or business utility or purpose apart from the anticipated
tax consequences. Investors should consult their own tax advisors as to the tax
consequences to them of a deposit to the Trust.

   The Trustee has the right to reject the order to create Creation Units
transmitted to it by the Distributor if the investor or group of investors,
upon obtaining the SPDRs ordered, would own eighty percent (80%) or more of the
outstanding SPDRs, and if pursuant to section 351 of the Code such a
circumstance would result in the Trust having a basis in the stocks deposited
different from the market value of such stocks on the date of deposit. The
Trustee has the right to require information regarding SPDR ownership pursuant
to the Participant Agreement and from DTC and to rely thereon to the extent
necessary to make the foregoing determination as a condition to the acceptance
of a Portfolio Deposit.

   Ordinary income dividends received via DTC by Beneficial Owners who are
non-resident aliens are subject to a thirty percent (30%) United States
withholding tax unless a reduced rate of withholding or a withholding exemption
is provided under applicable tax treaties. Non-resident holders of SPDRs are
urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning the applicability of United
States withholding tax.

   Backup withholding at a rate equal to the fourth lowest income tax rate
applicable to individuals (which, under current law, is 30% for 2002 and 2003,
29% for 2004 and 2005, and 28% for 2006 and thereafter) applies to dividends,
capital gain distributions, redemptions and sales of SPDRs unless (a) the
Beneficial Owner is a corporation or comes within certain other exempt
categories and, when required, demonstrates this fact, or (b) provides a
taxpayer identification number, certifies as to no loss of exemption from
backup withholding, and otherwise complies with applicable requirements of the
backup withholding rules. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment
to a Beneficial Owner is allowed as a credit against the holder's U.S. federal
income tax liability and may entitle such holder to a refund from the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service, if the required information is furnished to the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service.

   The tax discussion set forth above is included for general information only.
Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors concerning the
federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences to them of an investment in
the Trust, including the effect of possible legislative changes.

ERISA Considerations

   In considering the advisability of an investment in SPDRs, fiduciaries of
pension, profit sharing or other tax-qualified retirement plans (including
Keogh Plans) and

                                      48

<page>

welfare plans (collectively, "Plans") subject to the fiduciary responsibility
requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
("ERISA"), should consider whether an investment in SPDRs is permitted by the
documents and instruments governing the Plan and whether the investment
satisfies the exclusive benefit, prudence and diversification requirements of
ERISA. Individual retirement account ("IRA") investors should consider that an
IRA may make only such investments as are authorized by its governing
instruments.

   The fiduciary standards and prohibited transaction rules of ERISA and the
Code will not apply to transactions involving the Trust's assets while SPDRs
are held by a Plan or IRA. Unlike many other investment vehicles offered to
Plans and IRAs, the Trust's assets will not be treated as "plan assets" of the
Plans or IRAs which acquire or purchase SPDRs. Although ERISA imposes certain
duties on Plan fiduciaries and ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code prohibit
certain transactions involving "plan assets" between Plans or IRAs and their
fiduciaries or certain related persons, those rules will not apply to
transactions involving the Trust's assets because SPDRs represent an interest
in the Trust, and the Trust is registered as an investment company under the
Investment Company Act of 1940. ERISA, the Code and U.S. Department of Labor
regulations contain unconditional language exempting the assets of registered
investment companies from treatment as "plan assets" in applying the fiduciary
and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code.

   Employee benefit plans that are governmental plans (as defined in Section
3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA)
and foreign plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) are not subject to
the requirements of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. The fiduciaries of
governmental plans should, however, consider the impact of their respective
state pension codes on investments in SPDRs and the considerations discussed
above, to the extent applicable.

                         CONTINUOUS OFFERING OF SPDRs

   Creation Units are offered continuously to the public by the Trust through
the Distributor. Persons making Portfolio Deposits and creating Creation Units
receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any
kind from the Sponsor or the Distributor, and no such person has any obligation
or responsibility to the Sponsor or Distributor to effect any sale or resale of
SPDRs.

   Because new SPDRs can be created and issued on an ongoing basis, at any
point during the life of the Trust, a "distribution", as such term is used in
the Securities Act of 1933 ("1933 Act"), may be occurring. Broker-dealers and
other persons are cautioned that some of their activities may result in their
being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner which could render them
statutory underwriters and subject

                                      49

<page>

them to the prospectus-delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. For
example, a broker-dealer firm or its client may be deemed a statutory
underwriter if it takes Creation Units after placing a creation order with the
Distributor, breaks them down into the constituent SPDRs and sells the SPDRs
directly to its customers; or if it chooses to couple the creation of a supply
of new SPDRs with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary
market demand for SPDRs. A determination of whether one is an underwriter must
take into account all the facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities
of the broker-dealer or its client in the particular case, and the examples
mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the
activities that could lead to categorization as an underwriter.

   Dealers who are not "underwriters" but are participating in a distribution
(as contrasted to ordinary secondary trading transactions), and thus dealing
with SPDRs that are part of an "unsold allotment" within the meaning of Section
4(3)(C) of the 1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the
prospectus-delivery exemption provided by Section 4(3) of the 1933 Act.

   The Sponsor intends to qualify SPDRs in states selected by the Sponsor and
through broker-dealers who are members of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. Investors intending to create or redeem Creation Units
in transactions not involving a broker-dealer registered in such investor's
state of domicile or residence should consult their legal advisor regarding
applicable broker-dealer or securities regulatory requirements under the state
securities laws prior to such creation or redemption.

                         DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT SERVICE

   The Trust has made the Service available for use by Beneficial Owners
through DTC Participants for reinvestment of their cash proceeds. Some DTC
Participants may not elect to utilize the Service; therefore, an interested
SPDR investor may wish to contact such investor's broker to ascertain the
availability of the Service through such broker. Each broker may require
investors to adhere to specific procedures and timetables in order to
participate in the Service and such investors should ascertain from their
broker such necessary details.

   Distributions reinvested in additional SPDRs through the Service are
nevertheless taxable dividends to Beneficial Owners to the same extent as if
received in cash.

   The Trustee generally uses the cash proceeds of dividends received from all
Beneficial Owners participating in reinvestment through the Service to obtain
Index Securities necessary to create the requisite number of SPDRs at the close
of business on each SPDR distribution date. Any cash balance remaining after
the requisite

                                      50

<page>

number of SPDRs has been created is distributed, on a pro rata basis, to all
Beneficial Owners who participated in the Service. Brokerage commissions, if
any, incurred in obtaining Index Securities necessary to create additional
SPDRs with the cash from the distributions is an expense of the Trust.*

                             EXPENSES OF THE TRUST

   Ordinary operating expenses of the Trust currently are being accrued at an
annual rate of 0.1200%. Future accruals will depend primarily on the level of
the Trust's net assets and the level of Trust expenses. The Trustee has agreed
to waive a portion of its fee until March 9, 2003. Thereafter, the Trustee may
discontinue this voluntary waiver policy. Therefore, there is no guarantee that
the Trust's ordinary operating expenses will not exceed 0.1200% of the Trust's
daily NAV.

   Until further notice, the Sponsor has undertaken that it will not permit the
ordinary operating expenses of the Trust, as calculated by the Trustee, to
exceed an amount that is 18.45/100 of 1% (0.1845%) per annum of the daily NAV
of the Trust. To the extent the ordinary operating expenses of the Trust do
exceed such 0.1845% amount, the Sponsor will reimburse the Trust for, or
assume, the excess. The Sponsor retains the ability to be repaid by the Trust
for expenses so reimbursed or assumed to the extent that subsequently during
the fiscal year expenses fall below the 0.1845% per annum level on any given
day. For purposes of this undertaking, ordinary operating expenses of the Trust
do not include taxes, brokerage commissions and any extraordinary non-recurring
expenses, including the cost of any litigation to which the Trust or the
Trustee may be a party. The Sponsor may discontinue this undertaking or renew
it for a specified period of time, or may choose to reimburse or assume certain
Trust expenses in later periods to keep Trust expenses at a level it believes
to be attractive to investors. In any event, on any day and during any period
over the life of the Trust, total fees and expenses of the Trust may exceed
0.1845% per annum.

   Subject to any applicable cap, the Sponsor may charge the Trust a special
fee for certain services the Sponsor may provide to the Trust which would
otherwise be provided by the Trustee in an amount not to exceed the actual cost
of providing such services. The Sponsor or the Trustee from time to time may
voluntarily assume some expenses or reimburse the Trust so that total expenses
of the Trust are reduced. Neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee is obligated to
do so and either one or both parties may discontinue such voluntary assumption
of expenses or reimbursement at any time without notice.

* It is difficult to estimate the annual dollar amount of brokerage commissions
  that might be incurred in connection with the Dividend Reinvestment Service
  during any fiscal year. The Trustee estimates that during fiscal year 2001,
  the approximate amount of annual brokerage commissions incurred in
  implementing the Service was less than $0.001 per SPDR.

                                      51

   The following charges are or may be accrued and paid by the Trust: (a) the
Trustee's fee, (b) fees payable to transfer agents for the provision of
transfer agency services; (c) fees of the Trustee for extraordinary services
performed under the Trust Agreement; (d) various governmental charges; (e) any
taxes, fees and charges payable by the Trustee with respect to SPDRs (whether
in Creation Units or otherwise); (f) expenses and costs of any action taken by
the Trustee or the Sponsor to protect the Trust and the rights and interests of
Beneficial Owners of SPDRs (whether in Creation Units or otherwise); (g)
indemnification of the Trustee or the Sponsor for any losses, liabilities or
expenses incurred by it in the administration of the Trust; (h) expenses
incurred in contacting Beneficial Owners of SPDRs during the life of the Trust
and upon termination of the Trust; and (i) other out-of-pocket expenses of the
Trust incurred pursuant to actions permitted or required under the Trust
Agreement.

   In addition, the following expenses are or may be charged to the Trust: (a)
reimbursement to the Sponsor of amounts paid by it to S&amp;P in respect of annual
licensing fees pursuant to the License Agreement, (b) federal and state annual
registration fees for the issuance of SPDRs, and (c) expenses of the Sponsor
relating to the printing and distribution of marketing materials describing
SPDRs and the Trust (including, but not limited to, associated legal,
consulting, advertising, and marketing costs and other out-of-pocket expenses
such as printing). Pursuant to the provisions of an exemptive order, the
expenses set forth in this paragraph may be charged to the Trust by the Trustee
in an amount equal to the actual costs incurred, but in no case shall such
charges exceed 20/100 of 1% (0.20%) per annum of the daily NAV of the Trust.

   If the income received by the Trust in the form of dividends and other
distributions on Portfolio Securities is insufficient to cover Trust expenses,
the Trustee may make advances to the Trust to cover such expenses. Otherwise,
the Trustee may sell Portfolio Securities in an amount sufficient to pay such
expenses. The Trustee may reimburse itself in the amount of any such advance,
together with interest thereon at a percentage rate equal to the then current
overnight federal funds rate, by deducting such amounts from (a) dividend
payments or other income of the Trust when such payments or other income is
received, (b) the amounts earned or benefits derived by the Trustee on cash
held by the Trustee for the benefit of the Trust, and (c) the sale of Portfolio
Securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any advance remains outstanding
for more than forty-five (45) Business Days, the Trustee may sell Portfolio
Securities to reimburse itself for such advance and any accrued interest
thereon. These advances will be secured by a lien on the assets of the Trust in
favor of the Trustee. The expenses of the Trust are reflected in the NAV of the
Trust.

   For services performed under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee is paid a fee
at an annual rate of 6/100 of 1% to 10/100 of 1% of the NAV of the Trust, as
shown below, such percentage amount to vary depending on the NAV of the Trust,
plus or

                                      52

minus the Adjustment Amount. The compensation is computed on each Business Day
based on the NAV of the Trust on such day, and the amount thereof is accrued
daily and paid monthly. To the extent that the amount of the Trustee's
compensation, before any adjustment in respect of the Adjustment Amount, is
less than specified amounts, the Sponsor has agreed to pay the amount of any
such shortfall. The Trustee also may waive all or a portion of such fee.

* The fee indicated applies to that portion of the NAV of the Trust that falls
  in the size category indicated.

   As of September 30, 2001, and as of December 31, 2001 the NAV of the Trust
was $24,875,862,538.00 and $30,438,331,364.11, respectively. No representation
is made as to the actual NAV of the Trust on any future date, as it is subject
to change at any time due to fluctuations in the market value of the Portfolio,
or to creations or redemptions made in the future.

   The Adjustment Amount is calculated at the end of each quarter and applied
against the Trustee's fee for the following quarter. "Adjustment Amount" is an
amount which is intended, depending upon the circumstances, either to (a)
reduce the Trustee's fee by the amount that the Transaction Fees paid on
creation and redemption exceed the costs of those activities, and by the amount
of excess earnings on cash held for the benefit of the Trust* or (b) increase
the Trustee's fee by the amount that the Transaction Fee (plus additional
amounts paid in connection with creations or redemptions outside the SPDR
Clearing Process), paid on creations or redemptions, falls short of the actual
costs of these activities. If in any quarter the Adjustment Amount exceeds the
fee payable to the Trustee as set forth above, the Trustee uses such excess
amount to reduce other Trust expenses, subject to certain federal tax
limitations. To the extent that the amount of such excess exceeds the Trust's
expenses for such quarter, any remaining excess is retained by the Trustee as
part of its

  monthly basis.

compensation. If in any quarter the costs of processing creations and
redemptions exceed the amounts charged as a Transaction Fee (plus the
additional amounts paid in connection with creations or redemptions outside the
SPDR Clearing Process) net of the excess earnings, if any, on cash held for the
benefit of the Trust, the Trustee will augment the Trustee's fee by the
resulting Adjustment Amount. The net Adjustment Amount is usually a credit to
the Trust. To make the expense ratio of the Trust comparable to the expense
ratio of most other investment companies, it is shown as a "below the line"
adjustment to Trust's expenses. If the adjustment is negative, it is shown
"above the line."

                                   VALUATION

   The NAV of the Trust is computed as of the Evaluation Time shown under
"Summary--Essential Information" on each Business Day. The NAV of the Trust on
a per SPDR basis is determined by subtracting all liabilities (including
accrued expenses and dividends payable) from the total value of the Portfolio
and other assets and dividing the result by the total number of outstanding
SPDRs.

   The value of the Portfolio is determined by the Trustee in good faith in the
following manner. If Portfolio Securities are listed on one or more national
securities exchanges, such evaluation is generally based on the closing sale
price on that day (unless the Trustee deems such price inappropriate as a basis
for evaluation) on the exchange which is deemed to be the principal market
therefor (the New York or American Stock Exchange if the stocks are listed
thereon) or, if there is no such appropriate closing sale price on such
exchange, at the last sale price (unless the Trustee deems such price
inappropriate as a basis for evaluation). If the stocks are not so listed or,
if so listed and the principal market therefor is other than on such exchange
or there is no such closing sale price available, such evaluation shall
generally be made by the Trustee in good faith based on the closing price on
the over-the-counter market (unless the Trustee deems such price inappropriate
as a basis for evaluation) or if there is no such appropriate closing price,
(a) on current bid prices, (b) if bid prices are not available, on the basis of
current bid prices for comparable stocks, (c) by the Trustee's appraising the
value of the stocks in good faith on the bid side of the market, or (d) by any
combination thereof.

                          ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRUST

Distributions to Beneficial Owners

   The regular quarterly ex-dividend date for SPDRs is the third Friday in each
of March, June, September and December, unless such day is not a Business Day,
in

                                      54

<page>

which case the ex-dividend date is the immediately preceding Business Day
("Ex-Dividend Date"). Beneficial Owners reflected on the records of DTC and the
DTC Participants on the second Business Day following the Ex-Dividend Date
("Record Date") are entitled to receive an amount representing dividends
accumulated on Portfolio Securities through the quarterly dividend period which
ends on the Business Day preceding such Ex-Dividend Date (including stocks with
ex-dividend dates falling within such quarterly dividend period), net of fees
and expenses, accrued daily for such period. For the purposes of all dividend
distributions, dividends per SPDR are calculated at least to the nearest
1/1000th of $0.01. The payment of dividends is made on the last Business Day in
the calendar month following each Ex-Dividend Date ("Dividend Payment Date").
Dividend payments are made through DTC and the DTC Participants to Beneficial
Owners then of record with funds received from the Trustee.

   Dividends payable to the Trust in respect of Portfolio Securities are
credited by the Trustee to a non-interest bearing account as of the date on
which the Trust receives such dividends. Other moneys received by the Trustee
in respect of the Portfolio, including but not limited to the Cash Component,
the Cash Redemption Payment, all moneys realized by the Trustee from the sale
of options, warrants or other similar rights received or distributed in respect
of Portfolio Securities as dividends or distributions and capital gains
resulting from the sale of Portfolio Securities are credited by the Trustee to
a non-interest bearing account. All funds collected or received are held by the
Trustee without interest until distributed in accordance with the provisions of
the Trust Agreement. To the extent the amounts credited to the account generate
interest income or an equivalent benefit to the Trustee, such interest income
or benefit is used to reduce the Trustee's annual fee.

   Any additional distributions the Trust may need to make so as to continue to
qualify as a "regulated investment company" would consist of (a) an increase in
the distribution scheduled for January to include any amount by which estimated
Trust investment company taxable income and net capital gains for a year
exceeds the amount of Trust taxable income previously distributed with respect
to such year or, if greater, the minimum amount required to avoid imposition of
such excise tax, and (b) a distribution soon after actual annual investment
company taxable income and net capital gains of the Trust have been computed of
the amount, if any, by which such actual income exceeds the distributions
already made. The NAV of the Trust is reduced in direct proportion to the
amount of such additional distributions. The magnitude of the additional
distributions, if any, depends upon a number of factors, including the level of
redemption activity experienced by the Trust. Because substantially all
proceeds from the sale of stocks in connection with adjustments to the
Portfolio are used to purchase shares of Index Securities, the Trust may have
no cash or insufficient cash with which to pay such additional distributions.
In that case, the

                                      55

<page>

Trustee has to sell shares of Portfolio Securities sufficient to produce the
cash required to make such additional distributions. In selecting the stocks to
be sold to produce cash for such distributions, the Trustee chooses among the
stocks that are over-weighted in the Portfolio relative to their weightings in
the S&amp;P 500 Index first and then from among all other stocks in such a manner
to maintain the weightings of Portfolio Securities within the applicable
Misweighting Amount.

   The Trustee may declare special dividends if such action is necessary or
advisable to preserve the status of the Trust as a regulated investment company
or to avoid imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income, and
to vary the frequency with which periodic distributions are made (e.g., from
quarterly to monthly) if it is determined by the Sponsor and the Trustee that
such a variance would be advisable to facilitate compliance with the rules and
regulations applicable to regulated investment companies or would otherwise be
advantageous to the Trust. In addition, the Trustee may change the regular
ex-dividend date for SPDRs to another date within the month or quarter if it is
determined by the Sponsor and the Trustee that such a change would be
advantageous to the Trust. Notice of any such variance or change shall be
provided to Beneficial Owners via DTC and the DTC Participants.

   As soon as practicable after notice of termination of the Trust, the Trustee
will distribute via DTC and the DTC Participants to each Beneficial Owner
redeeming Creation Units before the termination date specified in such notice a
portion of Portfolio Securities and cash as described above. Otherwise, the
Trustee will distribute to each Beneficial Owner (whether in Creation Unit size
aggregations or otherwise), as soon as practical after termination of the
Trust, such Beneficial Owner's pro rata share of the NAV of the Trust.

   All distributions are made by the Trustee through DTC and the DTC
Participants to Beneficial Owners as recorded on the book entry system of DTC
and the DTC Participants.

   The settlement date for the creation of SPDRs or the purchase of SPDRs in
the secondary market must occur on or before the Record Date in order for such
creator or purchaser to receive a distribution on the next Dividend Payment
Date. If the settlement date for such creation or a secondary market purchase
occurs after the Record Date, the distribution will be made to the prior
securityholder or Beneficial Owner as of such Record Date.

   Any Beneficial Owner interested in acquiring additional SPDRs with proceeds
received from distributions described above may elect dividend reinvestment
through DTC Participants by means of the Service, if such service is available
through the Beneficial Owner's broker.

                                      56

Statements to Beneficial Owners; Annual Reports

   With each distribution, the Trustee furnishes for distribution to Beneficial
Owners a statement setting forth the amount being distributed, expressed as a
dollar amount per SPDR.

   Promptly after the end of each fiscal year, the Trustee furnishes to the DTC
Participants for distribution to each person who was a Beneficial Owner of
SPDRs at the end of such fiscal year, an annual report of the Trust containing
financial statements audited by independent accountants of nationally
recognized standing and such other information as may be required by applicable
laws, rules and regulations.

Rights of Beneficial Owners

   Beneficial Owners may sell SPDRs in the secondary market, but must
accumulate enough SPDRs to constitute a full Creation Unit in order to redeem
through the Trust. The death or incapacity of any Beneficial Owner does not
operate to terminate the Trust nor entitle such Beneficial Owner's legal
representatives or heirs to claim an accounting or to take any action or
proceeding in any court for a partition or winding up of the Trust.

   Beneficial Owners shall not (a) have the right to vote concerning the Trust,
except with respect to termination and as otherwise expressly set forth in the
Trust Agreement, (b) in any manner control the operation and management of the
Trust, or (c) be liable to any other person by reason of any action taken by
the Sponsor or the Trustee. The Trustee has the right to vote all of the voting
stocks in the Trust. The Trustee votes the voting stocks of each issuer in the
same proportionate relationship as all other shares of each such issuer are
voted to the extent permissible and, if not permitted, abstains from voting.

Amendments to the Trust Agreement

   The Trust Agreement may be amended from time to time by the Trustee and the
Sponsor without the consent of any Beneficial Owners (a) to cure any ambiguity
or to correct or supplement any provision that may be defective or inconsistent
or to make such other provisions as will not adversely affect the interests of
Beneficial Owners; (b) to change any provision as may be required by the SEC;
(c) to add or change any provision as may be necessary or advisable for the
continuing qualification of the Trust as a "regulated investment company" under
the Code; (d) to add or change any provision as may be necessary or advisable
if NSCC or DTC is unable or unwilling to continue to perform its functions; and
(e) to add or change any provision to conform the adjustments to the Portfolio
and the Portfolio Deposit to changes, if any, made by S&amp;P in its method of
determining the S&amp;P 500 Index. The Trust Agreement may also

                                      57

<page>

be amended by the Sponsor and the Trustee with the consent of the Beneficial
Owners of 51% of the outstanding SPDRs to add provisions to, or change or
eliminate any of the provisions of, the Trust Agreement or to modify the rights
of Beneficial Owners; although, the Trust Agreement may not be amended without
the consent of the Beneficial Owners of all outstanding SPDRs if such amendment
would (a) permit the acquisition of any securities other than those acquired in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Trust Agreement; (b) reduce the
interest of any Beneficial Owner in the Trust; or (c) reduce the percentage of
Beneficial Owners required to consent to any such amendment.

   Promptly after the execution of an amendment, the Trustee receives from DTC,
pursuant to the terms of the Depository Agreement, a list of all DTC
Participants holding SPDRs. The Trustee inquires of each such DTC Participant
as to the number of Beneficial Owners for whom such DTC Participant holds
SPDRs, and provides each such DTC Participant with sufficient copies of a
written notice of the substance of such amendment for transmittal by each such
DTC Participant to Beneficial Owners.

Termination of the Trust Agreement

   The Trust Agreement provides that the Sponsor has the discretionary right to
direct the Trustee to terminate the Trust if at any time the NAV of the Trust
is less than $350,000,000, as such dollar amount shall be adjusted for
inflation in accordance with the CPI-U. This adjustment is to take effect at
the end of the fourth year following the Initial Date of Deposit and at the end
of each year thereafter and to be made so as to reflect the percentage increase
in consumer prices as set forth in the CPI-U for the twelve month period ending
in the last month of the preceding fiscal year.

   The Trust may be terminated (a) by the agreement of the Beneficial Owners of
66 2/3% of outstanding SPDRs; (b) if DTC is unable or unwilling to continue to
perform its functions as set forth under the Trust Agreement and a comparable
replacement is unavailable; (c) if NSCC no longer provides clearance services
with respect to SPDRs, or if the Trustee is no longer a participant in NSCC;
(d) if S&amp;P ceases publishing the S&amp;P 500 Index; (e) if the License Agreement is
terminated; or (f) if SPDRs are delisted from the Exchange. The Trust will also
terminate by its terms on the Termination Date.

   The Trust will terminate if either the Sponsor or the Trustee resigns or is
removed and a successor is not appointed. The dissolution of the Sponsor or its
ceasing to exist as a legal entity for any cause whatsoever, however, will not
cause the termination of the Trust Agreement or the Trust unless the Trustee
deems termination to be in the best interests of Beneficial Owners.

                                      58

<page>

   Prior written notice of the termination of the Trust must be given at least
twenty (20) days before termination of the Trust to all Beneficial Owners. The
notice must set forth the date on which the Trust will be terminated, the
period during which the assets of the Trust will be liquidated, the date on
which Beneficial Owners of SPDRs (whether in Creation Unit size aggregations or
otherwise) will receive in cash the NAV of the SPDRs held, and the date upon
which the books of the Trust shall be closed. The notice shall further state
that, as of the date thereof and thereafter, neither requests to create
additional Creation Units nor Portfolio Deposits will be accepted, that no
additional SPDRs will be created for the purpose of reinvesting dividend
distributions, and that, as of the date thereof and thereafter, the portfolio
of stocks delivered upon redemption shall be identical in composition and
weighting to Portfolio Securities as of such date rather than the stock portion
of the Portfolio Deposit as in effect on the date request for redemption is
deemed received. Beneficial Owners of Creation Units may, in advance of the
Termination Date, redeem in kind directly from the Trust.

   Within a reasonable period after the Termination Date, the Trustee shall,
subject to any applicable provisions of law, use its best efforts to sell all
of the Portfolio Securities not already distributed to redeeming Beneficial
Owners of Creation Units. The Trustee shall not be liable for or responsible in
any way for depreciation or loss incurred because of any such sale. The Trustee
may suspend such sales upon the occurrence of unusual or unforeseen
circumstances, including but not limited to a suspension in trading of a stock,
the closing or restriction of trading on a stock exchange, the outbreak of
hostilities, or the collapse of the economy. The Trustee shall deduct from the
proceeds of sale its fees and all other expenses and transmit the remaining
amount to DTC for distribution, together with a final statement setting forth
the computation of the gross amount distributed. SPDRs not redeemed before
termination of the Trust will be redeemed in cash at NAV based on the proceeds
of the sale of Portfolio Securities, with no minimum aggregation of SPDRs
required.

                                    SPONSOR

   The Sponsor is a Delaware limited liability company incorporated on April 6,
1998 with offices c/o the Exchange, 86 Trinity Place, New York, New York 10006.
The Sponsor's Internal Revenue Service Employer Identification Number is
52-2127241. The Exchange is the sole member of the Sponsor and the Exchange is
a "control person" of the Sponsor as such term is defined in the Securities Act
of 1933.

   The Sponsor, at its own expense, may from time to time provide additional
promotional incentives to brokers who sell SPDRs to the public. In certain
instances, these incentives may be provided only to those brokers who meet
certain threshold requirements for participation in a given incentive program,
such as selling a significant number of SPDRs within a specified period.

                                      59

<page>

   If at any time the Sponsor fails to undertake or perform or becomes
incapable of undertaking or performing any of the duties required under the
Trust Agreement, or resigns, or becomes bankrupt or its affairs are taken over
by public authorities, the Trustee may appoint a successor Sponsor, agree to
act as Sponsor itself, or may terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the
Trust. Notice of the resignation or removal of the Sponsor and the appointment
of a successor shall be mailed by the Trustee to DTC and the DTC Participants
for distribution to Beneficial Owners. Upon a successor Sponsor's execution of
a written acceptance of appointment as Sponsor of the Trust, the successor
Sponsor becomes vested with all of the rights, powers, duties and obligations
of the original Sponsor. Any successor Sponsor may be compensated at rates
deemed by the Trustee to be reasonable.

   The Sponsor may resign by executing and delivering to the Trustee an
instrument of resignation. Such resignation shall become effective upon the
appointment of a successor Sponsor and the acceptance of appointment by the
successor Sponsor, unless the Trustee either agrees to act as Sponsor or
terminates the Trust Agreement and liquidates the Trust. The dissolution of the
Sponsor or its ceasing to exist as a legal entity for any cause whatsoever will
not cause the termination of the Trust Agreement or the Trust unless the
Trustee deems termination to be in the best interests of the Beneficial Owners
of SPDRs.

   The Trust Agreement provides that the Sponsor is not liable to the Trustee,
the Trust or to the Beneficial Owners of SPDRs for taking any action, or for
refraining from taking any action, made in good faith or for errors in
judgment, but is liable only for its own gross negligence, bad faith, willful
misconduct or willful malfeasance in the performance of its duties or its
reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under the Trust Agreement. The
Sponsor is not liable or responsible in any way for depreciation or loss
incurred by the Trust because of the sale of any Portfolio Securities. The
Trust Agreement further provides that the Sponsor and its directors,
subsidiaries, shareholders, officers, employees, and affiliates under common
control with the Sponsor shall be indemnified from the assets of the Trust and
held harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross
negligence, bad faith, willful misconduct or willful malfeasance on the part of
any such party in the performance of its duties or reckless disregard of its
obligations and duties under the Trust Agreement, including the payment of the
costs and expenses of defending against any claim or liability.

   The Trustee is a bank and trust company organized under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts with its principal place of business at 225
Franklin

                                      60

<page>

Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02110. The Trustee's Internal Revenue Service
Employer Identification Number is 04-1867445. The Trustee is subject to
supervision and examination by the Massachusetts Division of Banks and the
Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.

   Information regarding Cash Redemption Payment amounts, number of outstanding
SPDRs and Transaction Fees may be obtained from the Trustee at the toll-free
number: 1-800-545-4189. Complete copies of the Trust Agreement and a list of
the parties that have executed a Participant Agreement may be obtained from the
Trustee's principal office.

   The Trustee may resign and be discharged of the Trust created by the Trust
Agreement by executing a notice of resignation in writing and filing such
notice with the Sponsor and mailing a copy of the notice of resignation to all
DTC Participants reflected on the records of DTC as owning SPDRs for
distribution to Beneficial Owners as provided above not less than sixty (60)
days before the date such resignation is to take effect. Such resignation
becomes effective upon the appointment of and the acceptance of the Trust by a
successor Trustee. The Sponsor, upon receiving notice of such resignation, is
obligated to use its best efforts to appoint a successor Trustee promptly. If
no successor is appointed within sixty (60) days after the date such notice of
resignation is given, the Trust shall terminate.

   If the Trustee becomes incapable of acting as such or is adjudged bankrupt
or is taken over by any public authority, the Sponsor may discharge the Trustee
and appoint a successor Trustee as provided in the Trust Agreement. The Sponsor
shall mail notice of such discharge and appointment via the DTC Participants to
Beneficial Owners. Upon a successor Trustee's execution of a written acceptance
of an appointment as Trustee for the Trust, the successor Trustee becomes
vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of the original
Trustee. A successor Trustee must be (a) a trust company, corporation or
national banking association organized, doing business under the laws of the
United States or any state thereof; (b) authorized under such laws to exercise
corporate trust powers; and (c) at all times have an aggregate capital, surplus
and undivided profit of not less than $50,000,000.

   Beneficial Owners of 51% of the then outstanding SPDRs may at any time
remove the Trustee by written instrument(s) delivered to the Trustee and the
Sponsor. The Sponsor shall thereupon use its best efforts to appoint a
successor Trustee as described above.

   The Trust Agreement limits Trustee's liabilities. It provides, among other
things, that the Trustee is not liable for (a) any action taken in reasonable
reliance on properly executed documents or for the disposition of monies or
stocks or for the evaluations

                                      61

required to be made thereunder, except by reason of its own gross negligence,
bad faith, willful malfeasance, willful misconduct, or reckless disregard of
its duties and obligations; (b) depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the
sale by the Trustee of any Portfolio Securities; (c) any action the Trustee
takes where the Sponsor fails to act; and (d) any taxes or other governmental
charges imposed upon or in respect of Portfolio Securities or upon the interest
thereon or upon it as Trustee or upon or in respect of the Trust which the
Trustee may be required to pay under any present or future law of the United
States of America or of any other taxing authority having jurisdiction.

   The Trustee and its directors, subsidiaries, shareholders, officers,
employees, and affiliates under common control with the Trustee will be
indemnified from the assets of the Trust and held harmless against any loss,
liability or expense incurred without gross negligence, bad faith, willful
misconduct, willful malfeasance on the part of such party or reckless disregard

                INFORMATION AND COMPARISONS RELATING TO TRUST,
             SECONDARY MARKET TRADING, NET ASSET SIZE, PERFORMANCE
                               AND TAX TREATMENT

   Information regarding various aspects of the Trust, including the net asset
size thereof, as well as the secondary market trading, the performance and the
tax treatment of SPDRs, may be included from time to time in advertisements,
sales literature and other communications and in reports to current or
prospective Beneficial Owners.

   Information may be provided to prospective investors to help them assess
their specific investment goals and to aid in their understanding of various
financial strategies. Such information may present current economic and
political trends and conditions and may describe general principles of
investing such as asset allocation, diversification and risk tolerance, as well
as specific investment techniques such as indexing and hedging. In addition,
information may be presented to prospective or current Beneficial Owners
regarding the purchase of SPDRs in the secondary market, such as margin
requirements, types of orders that may be entered, and information concerning
short sales. Similarly, market data symbols, trading fractions, other trading
information and the CUSIP number relating to SPDRs may be included in such
information. Comparisons with other investment vehicles, such as mutual funds,
may be made with respect to the application of such requirements; costs of fund
management and administration; cost and advantages of intraday trading; and
rules applicable to short sales.

   Information regarding the Trust's net asset size may be stated in
communications to prospective or current Beneficial Owners for one or more
periods, including annual, year-to-date or daily periods. Such information may
also be expressed in terms of the total number of SPDRs outstanding as of one
or more periods. Factors integral to the size of the Trust's net assets, such
as creation volume and activity, may also be discussed, and may be specified
from time to time or with respect to various periods of time. Comparisons of
such information during various periods may also be made, and may be expressed
by means of percentages.

   Information may be provided to investors regarding the ability to engage in
short sales of SPDRs, including reference to the exemption from the "tick test"
provision

                                      63

<page>

of the SEC short sale rule (Rule 10a-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934), to permit short sales on "minus" or "zero-minus" ticks. Selling short
refers to the sale of securities which the seller does not own, but which the
seller arranges to borrow before effecting the sale. Institutional investors
may be advised that lending their SPDRs shares to short sellers may generate
stock loan credits that may supplement the return they can earn from an
investment in SPDRs. These stock loan credits may provide a useful source of
additional income for certain institutional investors who can arrange to lend
SPDRs. Potential short sellers may be advised that a short rebate (functionally
equivalent to partial use of proceeds of the short sale) may reduce their cost
of selling short.

   Information may be provided to investors regarding capital gains
distributions by the Trust, including historical information relating to such
distributions. Comparisons between the Trust and other investment vehicles such
as mutual funds may be made regarding such capital gains distributions, as well
as relative tax efficiencies between the Trust and such other investment
vehicles (e.g. realization of capital gains or losses to the Trust and to such
other investment vehicles in connection with redemption of their respective
securities). Based on projected differences between SPDRs and conventional
mutual funds with regard to capital gains distributions, projections may be
made regarding comparative capital gains distributions and tax rates for
taxable investors holding SPDRs over a long period of time. Comparisons may
also be provided regarding the probable tax impact resulting from rebalancing
of the Trust portfolio and adjustments to the portfolio of an actively managed
investment vehicle.

   Specifically, information may be provided to prospective or current
investors comparing and contrasting the tax efficiencies of conventional mutual
funds with SPDRs. Both conventional mutual funds and the Trust may be required
to recognize capital gains incurred as a result of adjustments to the
composition of the S&amp;P 500 Index and therefore to their respective portfolios.
From a tax perspective, however, a significant difference between a
conventional mutual fund and the Trust is the process by which their shares are
redeemed. In cases where a conventional mutual fund experiences redemptions in
excess of subscriptions ("net redemptions") and has insufficient cash available
to fund such net redemptions, such fund may have to sell stocks held in its
portfolio to raise and pay cash to redeeming shareholders. A mutual fund will
generally experience a taxable gain or loss when it sells such portfolio stocks
in order to pay cash to redeeming fund shareholders. In contrast, the
redemption mechanism for SPDRs does not involve selling the portfolio stocks.
Instead, the Trust delivers the actual portfolio of stocks in an in-kind
exchange to any person redeeming SPDRs shares in Creation Unit size
aggregations. While this in-kind exchange is a taxable transaction to the
redeeming entity (usually a broker/dealer) making the exchange, it generally
does not constitute a taxable transaction at the Trust level and, consequently,
there is no realization of taxable gain or loss by the Trust with respect to
such in-kind exchanges. In a period of market appreciation of the S&amp;P 500 Index
and,

                                      64

<page>

consequently, appreciation of the portfolio stocks held in the Trust, this
in-kind redemption mechanism has the effect of eliminating the recognition and
distribution of those net unrealized gains at the Trust level. Although the
same result would obtain for conventional mutual funds utilizing an in-kind
redemption mechanism, the opportunities to redeem fund shares by delivering
portfolio stocks in-kind are limited in most mutual funds.

   Investors may be informed that, while no unequivocal statement can be made
as to the net tax impact on a conventional mutual fund resulting from the
purchases and sales of its portfolio stocks over a period of time, conventional
funds that have accumulated substantial unrealized capital gains, if they
experience net redemptions and do not have sufficient available cash, may be
required to make taxable capital gains distributions that are generated by
changes in such fund's portfolio. In contrast, in-kind redemption mechanism of
SPDRs may make them more tax efficient investments under most circumstances
than comparable conventional mutual fund shares. As discussed above, in-kind
redemption feature tends to lower the amount of annual net capital gains
distributions to SPDRs holders as compared to their conventional mutual fund
counterparts. Since shareholders are generally required to pay income tax on
capital gains distributions, the smaller the amount of such distributions, the
less taxes that are payable currently. To the extent that the Trust is not
required to recognize capital gains, the SPDRs holder is able, in effect, to
defer tax on such gains until he sells or otherwise disposes of his shares, or
the Trust terminates. If such holder retains his shares until his death, under
current law the tax basis of such shares would be adjusted to their then fair
market value.

   Information regarding the secondary market trading activity of SPDRs also
may be presented over one or more stated periods, such as for daily, monthly,
quarterly or annual periods. Secondary market trading volume information may be
compared with similar information relating to other issues trading on the
Exchange during the same reporting period. Average daily secondary market
trading volume of SPDRs may also be reported from time to time. Comparisons of
such information during various periods may also be made, and may be expressed
by means of percentages.

   Information may also be provided in communications to prospective investors
or current Beneficial Owners comparing and contrasting the relative advantages
of investing in SPDRs as compared to other investment vehicles, such as mutual
funds, both on an individual and a group basis (e.g., stock index mutual
funds). Such information may include comparisons of costs and expense ratios,
expressed either in dollars or basis points, stock lending activities,
permitted investments and hedging activities (e.g., engaging in options or
futures transactions), and portfolio turnover data and analyses. In addition,
such information may quote, reprint or include portions of financial, scholarly
or business publications or periodicals, including model allocation schedules
or portfolios, as the foregoing relate to the comparison of SPDRs

                                      65

<page>

to other investment vehicles, current economic, financial and political
conditions, investment philosophy or techniques, or the desirability of owning
SPDRs.

   In addition, information on the performance of SPDRs based on changes in
price per SPDR with or without reinvesting all dividends and/or any
distributions of capital in additional SPDRs may be included from time to time
in such information. Total return measures the percentage growth in the total
dollar value of an investment in SPDRs (reflecting dividends and capital
appreciation but without provision for any income taxes payable). Average
annualized performance will be stated for various periods. Total return figures
may also be stated for a period from the Initial Date of Deposit, a date at
least twelve months prior to the end of the reporting period or for annual
periods for the life of the Trust. Information on the S&amp;P 500 Index contained
in this Prospectus, as updated from time to time, may also be included from
time to time in such material. Information on performance of SPDRs also may be
presented on an after tax basis, using methods of calculation that are in
accordance with the SEC's rules and regulations. The performance of the Trust,
of the S&amp;P 500 Index (provided information is also given reflecting the
performance of the Trust in comparison to that S&amp;P 500 Index) or both may also
be compared to the performance of money managers as reported in market surveys
such as SEI Fund Evaluation Survey (a leading data base of tax-exempt funds) or
mutual funds such as those reported by Lipper Analytical Services Inc., Money
Magazine Fund Watch, Wiesenberger Investment Companies Service, Morningstar
Incorporated and Value Line Investment Survey each of which measures
performance following their own specific and well-defined calculation measures,
or of the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index, the American Stock Exchange
Index (indices of stocks traded on the New York and American Stock Exchanges,
respectively), the Dow Jones Industrial Average (an index of 30 widely traded
common stocks) or the NASDAQ Composite Index (an unmanaged index of
over-the-counter stocks) or similar measurement standards during the same
period of time. In addition to all other sources of comparative information,
comparative performance figures published by other funds or money managers may
be included from time to time. Information may also be included regarding the
aggregate amount of assets committed to index investing generally by various
types of investors, such as pension funds and other institutional investors,
which currently exceeds $300 billion.

   Information on the relative price performance of SPDRs in relation to other
securities and/or indices may be represented in the form of "correlation."
Correlation is a standard measure of the degree of linear association between
two price series, and ranges from minus one hundred percent (-100%) (i.e.
perfect negative linear association) to positive one hundred percent (100%)
(i.e., perfect linear association).

   One important difference between SPDRs and conventional mutual fund shares
is that the SPDRs are available for purchase or sale on an intraday basis on the

                                      66

<page>

American Stock Exchange. An investor who buys shares in a conventional mutual
fund will buy or sell shares at a price at or related to the closing NAV per
share, as determined by the fund. In contrast, SPDRs are not offered for
purchase or redeemed for cash at a fixed relationship to closing NAV. The
tables below illustrate the distribution relationship of SPDRs closing prices
to NAV for the period 1/29/93 (the first trading date of the SPDR Trust)
through 12/31/01, the distribution relationships of high, low and closing
prices over the same period, and distribution of bid/asked spreads for 2001.
This table should help investors evaluate some of the advantages and
disadvantages of SPDRs relative to funds sold and redeemed at prices related to
closing NAV. Specifically, the table illustrates in an approximate way the
risks of buying or selling SPDRs at prices less favorable than closing NAV and,
correspondingly, the opportunities to buy or sell at prices more favorable than
closing NAV.

   The investor may wish to evaluate the opportunity to buy or sell on an
intraday basis versus the assurance of a transaction at or related to closing
NAV. To assist investors in making this comparison, the table illustrates the
distribution of percentage ranges between the high and the low price each day
and between each extreme daily value and the closing NAV for all trading days
from 1/29/93 through 12/31/01. The investor may wish to compare these ranges
with the average bid/asked spread on SPDRs and add any commissions charged by a
broker. The trading ranges for this period will not necessarily be typical of
trading ranges in future years and the bid/asked spread on SPDRs may vary
materially over time and may be significantly greater at times in the future.
There is some evidence, for example, that the bid/asked spread will widen in
markets that are more volatile and narrow when markets are less volatile.
Consequently, the investor should expect wider bid/asked spreads to be
associated with wider daily spread ranges.

   Information relating to the relative price performance of SPDRs may be
compared against a wide variety of investment categories and asset classes,
including common stocks, small capitalization stocks, long and intermediate
term corporate and government bonds, Treasury bills, the rate of inflation in
the United States (based on the Consumer Price Index ("CPI") and combinations
of various capital markets. Historical returns of these and other capital
markets in the United States may be provided by independent statistical studies
and sources, such as those provided by Ibbotson Associates of Chicago,
Illinois. The performance of these capital markets is based on the returns of
different indices. Information may be presented using the performance of these
and other capital markets to demonstrate general investment strategies. So, for
example, performance of SPDRs may be compared to the performance of selected
asset classes such as short-term U.S. Treasury bills, long-term U.S. Treasury
bonds, long-term corporate bonds, mid-capitalization stocks, foreign stocks and
small capitalization stocks and may also be measured against the rate of
inflation as set forth in well-known indices (such as the CPI). Performance
comparisons may also include the value of a hypothetical investment in any of
these capital markets. Performance of SPDRs may also be compared to that of
other indices or compilations that may be developed and made available to the
investing public in the future. Of course, such comparisons will only reflect
past performance of SPDRs and the investment categories, indices or
compilations chosen and no guarantees can be made of future results regarding
the performance of either SPDRs or the asset classes chosen for such
comparisons.
