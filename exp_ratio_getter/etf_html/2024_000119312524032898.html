<p><b>iShares<sup>®</sup><sup> </sup> </b></p> <p><b>iShares Trust </b></p>
<p><b>Supplement dated February 13, 2024 to the </b></p>
<p><b>currently effective Statement of Additional Information (the “SAI”) for the </b></p>
<p><b>iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (IVV) </b></p> <p><b>Effective immediately
with respect to iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (the “Fund”), the section of the SAI entitled “Proxy Voting Policy” is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: </b></p>
<p>The Board of Trustees of iShares Trust (the “Board”) has approved a proxy voting pilot program for the Fund (the “Pilot”). Under the Pilot, eligible
Fund shareholders will have the opportunity to select from among seven proxy voting policies that include: 1) BFA’s proxy voting policies and procedures (“BFA’s Proxy Voting Policy”), and 2) proxy voting policies from third
parties (each, a “Third-Party Proxy Voting Policy” and together with BFA’s Proxy Voting Policy, the “IVV Proxy Voting Policies”). BFA will administer the Pilot, will utilize the applicable IVV Proxy Voting Policy when
selected by an eligible Fund shareholder (as described below), and will be responsible for any interpretative questions in connection with the Pilot and the utilization of a IVV Proxy Voting Policy, including the Third-Party Proxy Voting Policies.
</p> <p>Once an IVV Proxy Voting Policy is selected by an eligible Fund shareholder, BFA will apply it at the annual general shareholder meetings (“AGMs”) of
issuers of securities held by the Fund based on the Fund shareholder’s proportional ownership of the Fund as of the record date of the applicable AGM, subject to certain exceptions described below. If a Fund shareholder does not, or is unable
to, select an IVV Proxy Voting Policy, BFA will continue to use BFA’s Proxy Voting Policy for each such Fund shareholder’s proportional ownership of the Fund. The Pilot will be applied to AGMs held through 2024. At the end of the Pilot,
the Board will determine whether to extend, modify or terminate the Pilot based on, among other things, investor interest, the availability of necessary proxy voting infrastructure, expected costs, and overall investor experience. </p>
<p><b>Shareholder Eligibility for the Pilot </b></p> <p>BFA is working with Broadridge Investor
Communication Solutions Inc. (“Broadridge”) to identify and track known shareholder accounts in the Fund, which are referred to as “Eligible Shareholders.” Broadridge will identify shareholder accounts that are Eligible
Shareholders but will only do so for the initial and subsequent communication in February and March 2024 using its network of brokers to identify Fund shareholder information. Fund shareholder accounts that are not known to Broadridge or are not
accounts at the time of the communications and shareholders that cannot be reached due to limits on proxy voting infrastructure are not expected to be eligible to participate in the Pilot. Shareholders purchasing shares after March 2024 will not be
Eligible Shareholders during the Pilot. The Eligible Shareholders will be notified by email or mail, as applicable under their current preferences to receive Fund proxy communications, and will be asked to participate in a survey to select from the
IVV Proxy Voting Polices. </p> <p>Shareholders that hold the Fund in multiple shareholder accounts may receive a survey request for each account identified by Broadridge
and may only receive the survey for certain accounts. Shareholders should submit a response for each shareholder account that they want to participate in the Pilot. </p>
<p>Eligible Shareholders may also subsequently select a different IVV Proxy Voting Policy, from time to time, by accessing the survey through the prior communication they
received. BFA will review and implement initial and subsequent shareholder selections; provided that such selections will not be implemented until after all such reviews are complete. Eligible Shareholders should expect a reasonable delay after each
selection is made before being implemented. For Fund shareholders that choose not to participate or are not eligible to participate, BFA will continue to vote the Fund shareholder’s proportional ownership of the Fund pursuant to BFA’s
Proxy Voting Policy. If BFA has invested another client (including a registered investment company) in the Fund, BFA will utilize BFA’s Proxy Voting Policy as the client’s selection unless otherwise agreed between the client and BFA. BFA
will not seek the preferences of the investors in other registered investment company clients during the Pilot. </p>

<p><b>Pilot Administration and Voting </b></p>
<p>BFA has been delegated the responsibility to administer the Pilot and vote proxies for the Fund. BFA will cast votes on behalf of the Fund on specific proxy issues in
respect of securities held by the Fund (or may refrain from voting) in accordance with the IVV Proxy Voting Policies at AGMs, subject to BFA’s interpretation of the IVV Proxy Voting Polices. The number of shares voted pursuant to each IVV Proxy
Voting Policy will be based on the pro rata ownership of Eligible Shareholders that have selected such IVV Proxy Voting Policy, calculated as of the record date for the applicable proxy for the underlying security held by the Fund. BFA will rely on
the information reasonably available to it to determine the percentages and corresponding votes for the Eligible Shareholders. </p> <p>BFA is authorized to use discretion
in not voting or limiting the use of a Third-Party Proxy Voting Policy for certain underlying securities or certain proposals due to considerations including, but not limited to, cost, operational risk and/or complexity, local market regulation and
practice, and financial considerations, including the decision not to recall securities on loan by the Fund. In addition, for corporate actions, special meetings such as in connection with merger transactions or other change of control transactions,
voting in contested director elections, or other proxy issues where BFA has determined that a consistent vote cast according to BFA’s Proxy Voting Policy would be in the best interest of the Fund as a whole, BFA will apply BFA’s Proxy
Voting Policy. </p> <p>BFA will review proxy voting activity on behalf of the Fund, including any voting conducted in accordance with a Third-Party Proxy Voting Policy, to
ensure that votes are cast in accordance with the Board’s delegation and applicable IVV Proxy Voting Policy. </p> <p><b>IVV Proxy Voting Policies </b></p>

<p><b><a name="regsupp745737a_1"></a>Introduction to BlackRock </b></p>
<p>BlackRock’s purpose is to help more and more people experience financial well-being. We manage assets on behalf of institutional and individual clients, across a
full spectrum of investment strategies, asset classes, and regions. Our client base includes pension plans, endowments, foundations, charities, official institutions, insurers, and other financial institutions, as well as individuals around the
world. </p> <p><b><a name="regsupp745737a_2"></a>Philosophy on investment stewardship </b></p>
<p>As part of our fiduciary duty to our clients, we consider it one of our responsibilities to promote sound corporate governance as an informed, engaged shareholder on
their behalf. At BlackRock, this is the responsibility of the BlackRock Investment Stewardship (BIS) team. </p> <p>In our experience, sound governance is critical to the
success of a company, the protection of investors’ interests, and long-term financial value creation. We take a constructive, long-term approach with companies and seek to understand how they are managing the drivers of risk and financial value
creation in their business models. We have observed that well-managed companies will effectively evaluate and address risks and opportunities relevant to their businesses, which supports durable, long-term financial value creation. As one of many
minority shareholders, BlackRock cannot – and does not try to – direct a company’s strategy or its implementation. </p>
<p><b><a name="regsupp745737a_3"></a>Shareholder rights </b></p> <p>We believe that there are
certain fundamental rights attached to shareholding. Shareholders should have the right to: </p> <p> </p>

<td> <p>Access sufficient and timely information on material governance, strategic, and business matters to make informed

vote” helps to achieve this balance. </p> <p>Consistent with these shareholder rights, BlackRock monitors and provides feedback to companies in our role as stewards
of our clients’ assets. Investment stewardship is how we use our voice as an investor to promote sound corporate governance and business practices that support the ability of companies to deliver long-term financial performance for our clients.
We do this through engagement with companies, proxy voting on behalf of those clients who have given us authority, and participating in market-level dialogue to improve corporate governance standards. </p>
<p>Engagement is an important mechanism for providing feedback on company practices and disclosures, particularly where our observations indicate that they could be
enhanced to support a company’s ability to deliver financial performance. Similarly, it provides us with an opportunity to hear directly from company boards and management on how they believe their actions are aligned with the long-term
economic interests of shareholders. Engagement with companies may also inform our proxy voting decisions. </p> <p>As a fiduciary, we vote in the long-term economic
interests of our clients. Generally, we support the recommendations of the board of directors and management. However, there may be instances where we vote against the election of directors or other management proposals, or support shareholder
proposals. For instance, we may vote against management recommendations where we are concerned that the board may not be acting in the long-term economic interests of shareholders, or disclosures do not provide sufficient information to assess how
material, strategic risks and opportunities are being managed. Our regional proxy voting guidelines are informed by our market-specific approach and standards of corporate governance best practices. </p>

<p><b><a name="regsupp745737a_4"></a>Key themes </b></p>
<p>While accepted standards and norms of corporate governance can differ between markets, in our experience, there are certain globally-applicable fundamental elements of
governance that contribute to a company’s ability to create long-term financial value for shareholders. These global themes are set out in this overarching set of principles (the “Principles”), which are anchored in transparency and
accountability. At a minimum, it is our view that companies should observe the accepted corporate governance standards in their domestic market and we ask that, if they do not, they explain how their approach better supports durable, long-term
financial value creation. </p> <p><b>These Principles cover seven key subjects: </b></p> <p> </p>

<p>Our regional and market-specific <u>voting guidelines</u> explain how these Principles inform our voting decisions in relation to common ballot items for shareholder
meetings in those markets. Alongside the Principles and regional voting guidelines, BIS publishes our <u>engagement priorities</u> which reflect the <u>five themes</u> on which we most frequently engage companies, where they are relevant, as these
can be a source of material business risk or opportunity. Collectively, these BIS policies set out the core elements of corporate governance that guide our investment stewardship efforts globally and within each market, including when engaging with
companies and voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS policies are applied on a <font><font>case-by-case</font></font> basis, taking into consideration the context within which a company is
operating. </p>

<h5><a href="#toc">Table of Contents</a></h5>
<p><b><a name="regsupp745737a_5"></a>Boards and directors </b></p>
<p>We believe that an effective and well-functioning board that has appropriate governance structures to facilitate oversight of a company’s management and strategic
initiatives is critical to the long-term financial success of a company and the protection of shareholders’ economic interests. In our view, a strong board can be a competitive advantage to a company, providing valuable oversight of and
perspectives to management on the most important decisions in support of long-term financial performance. As part of their responsibilities, board members have a fiduciary duty to shareholders to oversee the strategic direction, operations, and risk
management of a company. For this reason, BIS sees engagement with and the election of directors as one of our most important responsibilities. Disclosure of material risks that may affect a company’s long-term strategy and financial value
creation, including material sustainability-related factors when relevant, is essential for shareholders to appropriately understand and assess how effectively management is identifying, managing, and mitigating such risks. </p>
<p>The board should establish and maintain a framework of robust and effective governance mechanisms to support its oversight of the company’s strategy and operations
consistent with the long-term economic interests of investors. There should be clear descriptions of the role of the board and the committees of the board and how directors engage with and oversee management. We look to the board to articulate the
effectiveness of these mechanisms in overseeing the management of business risks and opportunities and the fulfillment of the company’s purpose and strategy. </p>
<p>Where a company has not adequately disclosed and demonstrated that its board has fulfilled these corporate governance and risk oversight responsibilities, we will
consider voting against the election of directors who, on our assessment, have particular responsibility for the issues. We assess director performance on a <font><font>case-by-case</font></font>
basis and in light of each company’s circumstances, taking into consideration their governance, business practices that support durable, long-term financial value creation, and performance. Set out below are ways in which boards and directors
can demonstrate a commitment to acting in the long-term economic interests of all shareholders. </p> <p><b>Regular accountability through director elections </b></p>
<p>It is our view that directors should stand for election on a regular basis, ideally annually. In our experience, annual director elections allow shareholders to reaffirm
their support for board members and/or hold them accountable for their decisions in a timely manner. When board members are not elected annually, in our experience, it is good practice for boards to have a rotation policy to ensure that, through a
board cycle, all directors have had their appointment <font>re-confirmed,</font> with a proportion of directors being put forward for election at each annual general meeting. </p>
<p><b>Effective board composition </b></p> <p>Regular director elections also give boards the
opportunity to adjust their composition in an orderly way to reflect developments in the company’s strategy and the market environment. In our view, it is beneficial for new directors to be brought onto the board periodically to refresh the
group’s thinking, while supporting both continuity and appropriate succession planning. We consider the average overall tenure of the board, and seek a balance between the knowledge and experience of longer-serving directors and the fresh
perspectives of directors who joined more recently. We encourage companies to regularly review the effectiveness of their board (including its size), and assess directors nominated for election in the context of the composition of the board as a
whole. In our view, the company’s assessment should consider a number of factors, including each director’s independence and time commitments, as well as the diversity and relevance of director experiences and skillsets, and how these
factors may contribute to the financial performance of the company. </p> <p>Similarly, there should be a sufficient number of independent directors, free from conflicts of
interest or undue influence from connected parties, to ensure objectivity in the decision-making of the board and its ability to oversee management. Common impediments to independence may include but are not limited to: </p>

<td> <p>Having any other interest, business, or other relationship which could, or could reasonably be perceived to, materially
interfere with a director’s ability to act in the best interests of the company and shareholders. </p></td></tr></table> <p>In our experience, boards are most
effective at overseeing and advising management when there is a senior, independent board leader. This director may chair the board, or, where the chair is also the CEO (or is otherwise not independent), be designated as a lead independent director.
The role of this director is to enhance the effectiveness of the independent members of the board through shaping the agenda, ensuring adequate information is provided to the board, and encouraging independent director participation in board
deliberations. The lead independent director or another appropriate director should be available to meet with shareholders in those situations where an independent director is best placed to explain and contextualize a company’s approach. </p>
<p>There are matters for which the board has responsibility that may involve a conflict of interest for executives or for affiliated directors, or require additional
focus. It is our view that objective oversight of such matters is best achieved when the board forms committees comprised entirely of independent directors. In many markets, these committees of the board specialize in audit, director nominations,
and compensation matters. An ad hoc committee might also be formed to decide on a special transaction, particularly one involving a related party, or to investigate a significant adverse event. </p>
<p>When nominating directors to the board, we look to companies to provide sufficient information on the individual candidates so that shareholders can assess
the capabilities and suitability of each individual nominee and their fit within overall board composition. These disclosures should give an understanding of how the collective experience and expertise of the board, as well as the
particular skill-sets of individual directors, aligns with the company’s long-term strategy and business model. Highly qualified, engaged directors with professional characteristics relevant to a company’s business and strategy
enhance the ability of the board to add value and be the voice of shareholders in board discussions. </p> <p>It is in this context that we are interested in diversity in
the board room. We see it as a means to promoting diversity of thought and avoiding “group think” when the board advises and oversees management. This position is based on our view that diversity of perspective and thought – in the
board room, in the management team, and throughout the company – leads to better long-term economic outcomes for companies. Academic research has revealed correlations between specific dimensions of diversity and effects on decision-making
processes and outcomes.<sup>1</sup> In our experience, greater diversity in the board room can contribute to more robust discussions and more innovative and resilient decisions. Over time, greater diversity
in the board room can also promote greater diversity and resilience in the leadership team, and the workforce more broadly. That diversity can enable companies to develop businesses that better address the needs of the customers and communities they
serve. </p> <p>We ask boards to disclose how diversity is considered in board composition, including professional characteristics, such as a director’s industry
experience, specialist areas of expertise and geographic location; as well as demographic characteristics such as gender, race/ethnicity, and age. </p> <p>We look to
understand a board’s diversity in the context of a company’s domicile, market capitalization, business model, and strategy. Increasingly, we see the most effective boards nominating directors from diverse backgrounds which helps ensure
boards can more effectively understand the company’s customers, employees, and communities. We note that in many markets, policymakers have set board gender diversity goals which we may discuss with companies, particularly if there is a
risk their board composition may be misaligned. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>

Matters,” May 2022; <u>Harvard Business Review</u>, “Diverse Teams Feel Less Comfortable – and That’s Why They Perform Better,” September 2016; “<u>Do Diverse Directors Influence DEI Outcomes,</u>” September 2022.

diversity of membership, while recognizing that building a strong, diverse board can take time. </p> <p><b>Sufficient capacity </b></p>
<p>As the role and expectations of a director are increasingly demanding, directors must be able to commit an appropriate amount of time to board and committee matters. It
is important that directors have the capacity to meet all of their responsibilities – including when there are unforeseen events – and therefore, they should not take on an excessive number of roles that would impair their ability to
fulfill their duties. </p> <p><b><a name="regsupp745737a_6"></a>Auditors and audit-related issues </b></p>
<p>BlackRock recognizes the critical importance of financial statements, which should provide a true and fair picture of a company’s financial condition. Accordingly,
the assumptions made by management and reviewed by the auditor in preparing the financial statements should be reasonable and justified. </p> <p>The accuracy of financial
statements, inclusive of financial and <font>non-financial</font> information as required or permitted under market-specific accounting rules, is of paramount importance to BlackRock. Investors increasingly recognize that
a broader range of risks and opportunities have the potential to materially impact financial performance. Over time, we anticipate investors and other users of company reporting will increasingly seek to understand and scrutinize the assumptions
underlying financial statements, particularly those that pertain to the impact of the transition to a <font>low-carbon</font> economy on a company’s business model and asset mix. We recognize that this is an area of
evolving practice and note that international standards setters, such as the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Board and the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB), continue to develop their guidance to
companies.<sup>2</sup> </p> <p>In this context, audit committees, or equivalent, play a vital role in a company’s financial
reporting system by providing independent oversight of the accounts, material financial and, where appropriate to the jurisdiction, <font>non-financial</font> information and internal control frameworks. Moreover, in the
absence of a dedicated risk committee, these committees can provide oversight of Enterprise Risk Management systems.<sup>3</sup> In our view, effective audit committee oversight strengthens the quality and
reliability of a company’s financial statements and provides an important level of reassurance to shareholders.</p> <p>We hold members of the audit committee or
equivalent responsible for overseeing the management of the audit function. Audit committees or equivalent should have clearly articulated charters that set out their responsibilities and have a rotation plan in place that allows for a periodic
refreshment of the committee membership to introduce fresh perspectives to audit oversight. We recognize that audit committees will rely on management, internal audit, and the independent auditor in fulfilling their responsibilities but look to
committee members to demonstrate they have relevant expertise to monitor and oversee the audit process and related activities. </p> <p>We take particular note of
unexplained changes in reporting methodology, cases involving significant financial restatements, or ad hoc notifications of material financial weakness. In this respect, audit committees should provide timely disclosure on the remediation of Key
and Critical Audit Matters identified either by the external auditor or internal audit function. </p> <p>The integrity of financial statements depends on the auditor being
free of any impediments to being an effective check on management. To that end, it is important that auditors are, and are seen to be, independent. Where an </p> <p> </p>

audit firm provides services to the company in addition to the audit, the fees earned should be disclosed and explained. Audit committees should have in place a procedure for assessing annually
the independence of the auditor and the quality of the external audit process. </p> <p>Comprehensive disclosure provides investors with a sense of the company’s
long-term operational risk management practices and, more broadly, the quality of the board’s oversight. The audit or risk committee, should periodically review the company’s risk assessment and risk management policies and the significant
risks and exposures identified by management, the internal auditors or the independent auditors and management’s steps to address them. In the absence of detailed disclosures, we may reasonably conclude that companies are not adequately
managing risk. </p> <p><b><a name="regsupp745737a_7"></a>Capital structure, mergers, asset sales, and other special transactions </b></p>
<p>The capital structure of a company is critical to shareholders as it impacts the value of their investment and the priority of their interest in the company relative to
that of other equity or debt investors. <font>Pre-emptive</font> rights are a key protection for shareholders against the dilution of their interests. </p>
<p>Effective voting rights are basic rights of share ownership and a core principle of effective governance. Shareholders, as the residual claimants, have the strongest
interest in protecting the financial value of the company, and voting rights should match economic exposure, i.e. one share, one vote. </p> <p>In principle, we disagree
with the creation of a share class with equivalent economic exposure and preferential, differentiated voting rights. In our view, this structure violates the fundamental corporate governance principle of proportionality and results in a
concentration of power in the hands of a few shareholders, thus disenfranchising other shareholders and amplifying any potential conflicts of interest. However, we recognize that in certain markets, at least for a period of time, companies may have
a valid argument for listing dual classes of shares with differentiated voting rights. In our view, such companies should review these share class structures on a regular basis or as company circumstances change. Additionally, they should seek
shareholder approval of their capital structure on a periodic basis via a management proposal at the company’s shareholder meeting. The proposal should give unaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to affirm the current structure or establish
mechanisms to end or phase out controlling structures at the appropriate time, while minimizing costs to shareholders. </p> <p>In assessing mergers, asset sales, or other
special transactions, BlackRock’s primary consideration is the long-term economic interests of our clients as shareholders. Boards proposing a transaction should clearly explain the economic and strategic rationale behind it. We will review a
proposed transaction to determine the degree to which it can enhance long-term shareholder value. We find long-term investors like our clients typically benefit when proposed transactions have the unanimous support of the board and have been
negotiated at arm’s length. We may seek reassurance from the board that the financial interests of executives and/or board members in a given transaction have not adversely affected their ability to place shareholders’ interests before
their own. Where the transaction involves related parties, the recommendation to support should come from the independent directors, a best practice in most markets, and ideally, the terms should have been assessed through an independent appraisal
process. In addition, it is good practice that it be approved by a separate vote of the <font>non-conflicted</font> parties. </p> <p>As a matter
of sound governance practice, shareholders should have a right to dispose of company shares in the open market without unnecessary restriction. In our view, corporate mechanisms designed to limit shareholders’ ability to sell their shares are
contrary to basic property rights. Such mechanisms can serve to protect and entrench interests other than those of the shareholders. In our view, shareholders are broadly capable of making decisions in their own best interests. We encourage any <font>so-called</font> “shareholder rights plans” proposed by a board to be subject to shareholder approval upon introduction and periodically thereafter. </p>

<p><b><a name="regsupp745737a_8"></a>Executive compensation </b></p>
<p>In most markets, one of the most important roles for a company’s board of directors is to put in place a compensation structure that incentivizes and rewards
executives appropriately. There should be a clear link between variable pay and operational and financial performance. Performance metrics should be stretching and aligned with a company’s strategy and business model. BIS does not have a
position on the use of sustainability-related criteria in compensation structures, but in our view, where companies choose to include these components, they should be adequately disclosed, material to the company’s strategy, and as rigorous as
other financial or operational targets. Long-term incentive plans should encompass timeframes that 1) are distinct from annual executive compensation structures and metrics, and 2) encourage the delivery of strong financial results over a period of
years. Compensation committees should guard against contractual arrangements that would entitle executives to material compensation for early termination of their employment. Finally, pension contributions and other deferred compensation
arrangements should be reasonable, in light of market practices. </p> <p>We are not supportive of <font>one-off</font> or special bonuses
unrelated to company or individual performance. Where discretion has been used by the compensation committee or its equivalent, we expect disclosure relating to how and why the discretion was used, and how the adjusted outcome is aligned with the
interests of shareholders. We acknowledge that the use of peer group evaluation by compensation committees can help ensure competitive pay; however, we are concerned when the rationale for increases in total compensation at a company is solely based
on peer benchmarking, rather than a rigorous measure of outperformance. We encourage companies to clearly explain how compensation outcomes have rewarded performance. </p>
<p>We encourage boards to consider building clawback provisions into incentive plans such that companies could clawback compensation or require executives to forgo awards
when compensation was based on faulty financial statements or deceptive business practices. We also favor recoupment from or the foregoing of the grant of any awards by any senior executive whose behavior caused material financial harm to
shareholders, material reputational risk to the company, or resulted in a criminal investigation, even if such actions did not ultimately result in a material restatement of past results. </p>
<p><font>Non-executive</font> directors should be compensated in a manner that is commensurate with the time and effort expended in fulfilling
their professional responsibilities. Additionally, these compensation arrangements should not risk compromising directors’ independence or aligning their interests too closely with those of the management, whom they are charged with overseeing.
</p> <p>We use third party research, in addition to our own analysis, to evaluate existing and proposed compensation structures. BIS may signal concerns through not
supporting management’s proposals to approve compensation, where they are on the agenda. We may also vote against members of the compensation committee or equivalent board members for poor compensation practices or structures. </p>
<p><b><a name="regsupp745737a_9"></a>Material sustainability-related risks and opportunities </b></p>
<p>It is our view that well-managed companies will effectively evaluate and manage material sustainability-related risks and opportunities relevant to their businesses. As
with all risks and opportunities in a company’s business model, appropriate oversight of material sustainability considerations is a core component of having an effective governance framework, which supports durable, long-term financial value
creation. </p> <p>Robust disclosure is essential for investors to effectively evaluate companies’ strategy and business practices related to material
sustainability-related risks and opportunities. Long-term investors like our clients can benefit when companies demonstrate that they have a resilient business model through disclosures thatcover governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics
and targets, including industry-specific metrics. The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) standards, IFRS S1 and S2,<sup>4</sup> provide companies with a </p>

useful guide to preparing this disclosure. The standards build on the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework and the standards and metrics developed by the
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), which have converged under the ISSB. We recognize that companies may phase in reporting aligned with the ISSB standards over several years. We also recognize that some companies may report using
different standards, which may be required by regulation, or one of a number of voluntary standards. In such cases, we ask that companies highlight the metrics that are industry-or company-specific. </p>
<p>We note that climate and other sustainability-related disclosures often require companies to collect and aggregate data from various internal and external sources. We
recognize that the practical realities of data collection and reporting may not line up with financial reporting cycles and companies may require additional time after their fiscal <font>year-end</font> to accurately
collect, analyze, and report this data to investors. That said, to give investors time to assess the data, we encourage companies to produce climate and other sustainability-related disclosures sufficiently in advance of their annual meeting, to the
best of their abilities. </p> <p>Companies may also choose to adopt or refer to guidance on sustainable and responsible business conduct issued by supranational
organizations such as the United Nations or the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Further, industry initiatives on managing specific operational risks may provide useful guidance to companies on best practices and disclosures.
We find it helpful to our understanding of investment risk when companies disclose any relevant global climate and other sustainability-related standards adopted, the industry initiatives in which they participate, any peer group benchmarking
undertaken, and any assurance processes to help investors understand their approach to sustainable and responsible business practices. We will express any concerns through our voting where a company’s actions or disclosures do not seem adequate
in light of the materiality of the business risks. </p> <p><b>Climate and nature-related risk </b></p>
<p>While companies in various sectors and geographies may be affected differently by climate-related risks and opportunities, the
<font>low-carbon</font> transition is an investment factor that can be material for many companies and economies around the globe. </p> <p>We
seek to understand, from company disclosures and engagement, the strategies companies have in place to manage material risks to, and opportunities for, their long-term business model associated with a range of climate-related scenarios, including a
scenario in which global warming is limited to well below 2°C, considering global ambitions to achieve a limit of 1.5°C. As one of many shareholders, and typically a minority one, BlackRock does not tell companies what to do. It is the role
of the board and management to set and implement a company’s long-term strategy to deliver long-term financial returns. </p> <p>Our research shows that the <font>low-carbon</font> transition is a structural shift in the global economy that will be shaped by changes in government policies, technology, and consumer preferences, which may be material for many companies.<sup>5</sup> Yet the path to a <font>low-carbon</font> economy is deeply uncertain and uneven, with different parts of the economy moving at different speeds. BIS recognizes that it can
be challenging for companies to predict the impact of climate-related risk and opportunity on their businesses and operating environments. Many companies are assessing how to navigate the <font>low-carbon</font> transition
while delivering long-term value to investors. In this context, we encourage companies to publicly disclose, consistent with their business model and sector, how they intend to deliver long-term financial performance through the transition to a <font>low-carbon</font> economy. Where available, we appreciate companies publishing their transition plan.<sup>6</sup> </p>
<p> </p> <p> </p>
<p><sup>5</sup> BlackRock Investment Institute, “Tracking the <font>low-carbon</font>
transition”, July 2023. </p> <p><sup>6</sup> We have observed that more companies are developing such plans, and public policy
makers in a number of markets are signaling their intentions to require them. We view transition plans (TPs) as a method for a company to both internally assess and externally communicate long-term strategy, ambition, objectives, and actions to
create financial value through the global transition towards a <font>low-carbon</font> economy. While many initiatives across jurisdictions outline a framework for TPs, there is no consensus on the key elements these plans
should contain. We view useful disclosure as that which communicates a company’s approach to managing financially material, business relevant risks and opportunities – including climate-related risks – to deliver long-term financial
performance, thus enabling investors to make more informed decisions. </p>

<p>Consistent with the ISSB standards, we are better able to assess preparedness for the
<font>low-carbon</font> transition when companies disclose short-, medium- and long-term targets, ideally science-based where these are available for their sector, for scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)
reductions and to demonstrate how their targets are consistent with the long-term financial interests of their investors. </p> <p>While we recognize that regulators in
some markets are moving to mandate certain disclosures, at this stage, we view scope 3 emissions differently from scopes 1 and 2, given methodological complexity, regulatory uncertainty, concerns about double-counting, and lack of direct control by
companies. We welcome disclosures and commitments companies choose to make regarding scope 3 emissions and recognize these are provided on a good-faith basis as methodology develops. Our publicly available <u>commentary</u> provides more information
on our approach to climate-related risks and opportunities. </p> <p>In addition to climate-related risks and opportunities, the management of nature-related factors is
increasingly a component of some companies’ ability to generate durable, long-term financial returns for shareholders, particularly where a company’s strategy is heavily reliant on the availability of natural capital, or whose supply
chains are exposed to locations with nature-related risks. We look for such companies to disclose how they manage any reliance and impact on, as well as use of, natural capital, including appropriate risk oversight and relevant metrics and targets,
to understand how these factors are integrated into strategy. We will evaluate these disclosures to inform our view of how a company is managing material nature-related risks and opportunities, as well as in our assessment of relevant shareholder
proposals. Our publicly available <u>commentary</u> provides more information on our approach to natural capital.<sup>7</sup> </p>
<p><b>Key stakeholder interests </b></p> <p>In order to advance long-term shareholders’
interests, companies should consider the interests of the various parties on whom they depend for their success over time. It is for each company to determine their key stakeholders based on what is material to their business and long-term financial
performance. For many companies, key stakeholders include employees, business partners (such as suppliers and distributors), clients and consumers, regulators, and the communities in which they operate. </p>
<p>As a long-term shareholder on behalf of our clients, we find it helpful when companies disclose how they have identified their key stakeholders and considered their
interests in business decision-making. In addition to understanding broader stakeholder relationships, BIS finds it helpful when companies consider the needs of their workforce today, and the skills required for their future business strategy. We
are also interested to understand the role of the board, which is well positioned to ensure that the approach taken is informed by and aligns with the company’s strategy and purpose. </p>
<p>Companies should articulate how they address material adverse impacts that could arise from their business practices and affect critical relationships with their
stakeholders. We encourage companies to implement, to the extent appropriate, monitoring processes (often referred to as due diligence) to identify and mitigate potential adverse impacts and grievance mechanisms to remediate any actual adverse
material impacts. In our view, maintaining trust within these relationships can contribute to a company’s long-term success. </p>
<p><b><a name="regsupp745737a_10"></a>Other corporate governance matters and shareholder protections </b></p>
<p>In our view, shareholders have a right to material and timely information on the financial performance and viability of the companies in which they invest. In addition,
companies should publish information on the governance structures in place and the rights of shareholders to influence these structures. The reporting and disclosure provided by companies help shareholders assess the effectiveness of the
board’s oversight of </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>
<p><sup>7</sup> Given the growing awareness of the materiality of these issues for certain businesses, enhanced reporting on a
company’s natural capital dependencies and impacts would aid investors’ understanding. In our view, the final recommendations of the <u>Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures</u> may prove useful to some companies. We recognize
that some companies may report using different standards, which may be required by regulation, or one of a number of other private sector standards. </p>

management and whether investors’ economic interests have been protected. We believe shareholders should have the right to vote on key corporate governance matters, including changes to
governance mechanisms, to submit proposals to the shareholders’ meeting, and to call special meetings of shareholders. </p> <p><b>Corporate form </b></p>
<p>In our view, it is the responsibility of the board to determine the corporate form that is most appropriate given the company’s purpose and business model.<sup>8</sup> Companies proposing to change their corporate form to a public benefit corporation or similar entity should put it to a shareholder vote if not already required to do so under applicable
law. Supporting documentation from companies or shareholder proponents proposing to alter the corporate form should clearly articulate how the interests of shareholders and different stakeholders would be impacted as well as the accountability and
voting mechanisms that would be available to shareholders. As a fiduciary on behalf of clients, we generally support management proposals if our analysis indicates that shareholders’ economic interests are adequately protected. Relevant
shareholder proposals are evaluated on a <font><font>case-by-case</font></font> basis. </p> <p><b><a name="regsupp745737a_11">
</a>Shareholder proposals </b></p> <p>In most markets in which BlackRock invests on behalf of clients, shareholders have the right to submit proposals to be voted on by
shareholders at a company’s annual or extraordinary meeting, as long as eligibility and procedural requirements are met. The matters that we see put forward by shareholders address a wide range of topics, including governance reforms, capital
management, and improvements in the management or disclosure of sustainability-related risks. </p> <p>BlackRock is subject to legal and regulatory requirements in the U.S.
that place restrictions and limitations on how BlackRock can interact with the companies in which we invest on behalf of our clients, including our ability to submit shareholder proposals. We can vote, on behalf of clients who authorize us to do so,
on proposals put forth by others. </p> <p>When assessing shareholder proposals, we evaluate each proposal on its merit, with a singular focus on its implications for
long-term financial value creation by that company. We believe it is helpful for companies to disclose the names of the proponent or organization that has submitted or advised on the proposal. We consider the business and economic relevance of the
issue raised, as well as its materiality and the urgency with which our experience indicates it should be addressed. We would not support proposals that we believe would result in over-reaching into the basic business decisions of the company. We
take into consideration the legal effect of the proposal, as shareholder proposals may be advisory or legally binding depending on the jurisdiction, while others may make requests that would be deemed illegal in a given jurisdiction. </p>
<p>Where a proposal is focused on a material business risk that we agree needs to be addressed and the intended outcome is consistent with long-term financial value
creation, we will look to the board and management to demonstrate that the company has met the intent of the request made in the shareholder proposal. Where our analysis and/or engagement indicate an opportunity for improvement in the company’s
approach to the issue, we may support shareholder proposals that are reasonable and not unduly prescriptive or constraining on management. </p> <p>We recognize that some
shareholder proposals bundle topics and/or specific requests and include supporting statements that explain the reasoning or objectives of the proponent. In voting on behalf of clients, we do not submit or edit proposals or the supporting statements
– we must vote yes or no on the proposal as phrased by the proponent. Therefore, when we vote in support of a proposal, we are not necessarily endorsing every element of the proposal or the reasoning, objectives, or supporting statement of the
proponent. We may support a proposal for different reasons from those put forth by the proponent, when we believe that, overall, it can advance our clients’ long-term financial interests. We would normally explain to the company our
rationale for supporting such proposals. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>

<p><b><a name="regsupp745737a_12"></a>BlackRock’s oversight of its investment stewardship activities </b></p>
<p><b>Oversight </b></p> <p>BlackRock maintains three regional advisory committees
(Stewardship Advisory Committees) for a) the Americas; b) Europe, the Middle East and Africa; and c) Asia-Pacific, generally consisting of senior BlackRock investment professionals and/or senior employees with practical boardroom experience. The
regional Stewardship Advisory Committees review and advise on amendments to BIS regional proxy voting guidelines (the Guidelines) covering markets within each respective region. The advisory committees do not determine voting decisions, which are
the responsibility of BIS. </p> <p>In addition to the regional Stewardship Advisory Committees, the Investment Stewardship Global Oversight Committee (Global Oversight
Committee) is a risk-focused committee, comprised of senior representatives from various BlackRock investment teams, a senior legal representative, the Global Head of Investment Stewardship (Global Head), and other senior executives with relevant
experience and team oversight. The Global Committee does not determine voting decisions, which are the responsibility of BIS. </p> <p>The Global Head has primary oversight
of the activities of BIS, including voting in accordance with the Guidelines, which require the application of professional judgment and consideration of each company’s unique circumstances. The Global Committee reviews and approves amendments
to these Principles. The Global Committee also reviews and approves amendments to the regional Guidelines, as proposed by the regional Stewardship Advisory Committees. </p>
<p>In addition, the Global Committee receives and reviews periodic reports regarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as updates on material process issues, procedural
changes, and other risk oversight considerations. The Global Committee reviews these reports in an oversight capacity as informed by the Guidelines. </p> <p>BIS carries
out engagement with companies, executes proxy votes, and conducts vote operations (including maintaining records of votes cast) in a manner consistent with the relevant Guidelines. BIS also conducts research on corporate governance issues and
participates in industry discussions to contribute to and keep abreast of important developments in the corporate governance field. BIS may utilize third parties for certain of the foregoing activities and performs oversight of those third parties.
BIS may raise complicated or particularly controversial matters for internal discussion with the relevant investment teams and governance specialists for discussion and guidance prior to making a voting decision. </p>

These issues include, but are not limited to: i) untimely notice of shareholder meetings; ii) restrictions on a foreigner’s ability to exercise votes; iii) requirements to vote proxies in person; iv) “share-blocking” (requirements
that investors who exercise their voting rights surrender the right to dispose of their holdings for some specified period in proximity to the shareholder meeting); v) potential difficulties in translating the proxy; vi) regulatory constraints; and
vii) requirements to provide local agents with unrestricted powers of attorney to facilitate voting instructions. We are not supportive of impediments to the exercise of voting rights such as share-blocking or overly burdensome administrative
requirements. </p> <p>As a consequence, BlackRock votes proxies in these situations on a “best-efforts” basis. In addition, BIS may determine that it is
generally in the interests of BlackRock’s clients not to vote proxies (or not to vote our full allocation) if the costs (including but not limited to opportunity costs associated with share-blocking constraints) associated with exercising a
vote are expected to outweigh the benefit the client would derive by voting on the proposal. </p> <p>Active portfolio managers have full discretion to vote the shares in
the Funds they manage based on their analysis of the economic impact of a particular ballot item on their investors. Portfolio managers may, from time to time, reach differing views on how to maximize economic value with respect to a particular
investment. Therefore, portfolio managers may, and sometimes do, vote shares in the Funds under their management differently from BIS or from one another. However, because BlackRock’s clients are mostly long-term investors with long-term
economic goals, ballots are generally cast in a uniform manner. </p> <p><b><a name="regsupp745737a_14"></a>Voting Choice </b></p>
<p>BlackRock offers a <u>Voting Choice</u> program, which provides eligible clients with more opportunities to participate in the proxy voting process where legally and
operationally viable. BlackRock Voting Choice aims to make proxy voting easier and more accessible for eligible clients. </p> <p>Voting Choice is currently available for
eligible clients invested in certain institutional pooled funds in the U.S., UK, Ireland, and Canada that utilize equity index investment strategies, as well as eligible clients in certain institutional pooled funds in the U.S., UK, and Canada that
use systematic active equity (SAE) strategies. Currently, this includes over 650 pooled investment funds, including equity index funds and SAE investment funds. In addition, institutional clients in separately managed accounts (SMAs) continue to be
eligible for BlackRock Voting Choice regardless of their investment strategies.<sup>9</sup> </p> <p>As a result, the shares
attributed to BlackRock in company share registers may be voted differently depending on whether our clients have authorized BIS to vote on their behalf, have authorized BIS to vote in accordance with a third-party policy, or have elected to vote
shares in accordance with their own policy. Agreements with our clients to allow them greater control over their voting, including which policies they have selected, will be treated confidentially consistent with our treatment of similar client
agreements. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>

<p>BIS maintains policies and procedures that seek to prevent undue influence on BlackRock’s proxy voting activity. Such influence might stem from any relationship

dissident shareholders or shareholder proponents are managed consistently and without regard to BlackRock’s relationship with such parties. Clients or business partners are not given special treatment or differentiated access to BIS. BIS
prioritizes engagements based on factors including, but not limited to, our need for additional information to make a voting decision or our view on the likelihood that an engagement could lead to positive outcome(s) over time for the economic value
of the company. Within the normal course of business, BIS may engage directly with BlackRock clients, business partners and/or third parties, and/or with employees with sales, vendor management, or business partnership roles, in discussions

<h5><a href="#toc">Table of Contents</a></h5>
<p>In selecting an independent third-party voting service provider, we assess several characteristics, including but not
limited to: independence, an ability to analyze proxy issues and make recommendations in the economic interest of our clients in accordance with the Guidelines, reputation for reliability and integrity, and operational capacity to accurately deliver
the assigned recommendations in a timely manner. We may engage more than one independent third-party voting service provider, in part to mitigate potential or perceived conflicts of interest at a single voting service provider. The Global Committee
appoints and reviews the performance of the independent third-party voting service providers, generally on an annual basis. </p>
<p><b><a name="regsupp745737a_16"></a>Securities lending </b></p> <p>When so authorized,
BlackRock acts as a securities lending agent on behalf of Funds. Securities lending is a well-regulated practice that contributes to capital market efficiency. It also enables funds to generate additional returns while allowing fund providers to
keep fund expenses lower. </p> <p>With regard to the relationship between securities lending and proxy voting, BlackRock cannot vote shares on loan and may determine to
recall them for voting, as guided by our fiduciary responsibility to act in our clients’ financial interests. While this has occurred in a limited number of cases, the decision to recall securities on loan as part of BlackRock’s securities
lending program in order to vote is based on an evaluation of various factors that include, but are not limited to, assessing potential securities lending revenue alongside the potential long-term financial value to clients of voting those
securities (based on the information available at the time of recall consideration).<sup>10</sup> BIS works with colleagues in the Securities Lending and Risk and Quantitative Analysis teams to evaluate the
costs and benefits to clients of recalling shares on loan. </p> <p>In almost all instances , BlackRock anticipates that the potential long-term financial value to the Fund
of voting shares would be less than the potential revenue the loan may provide the Fund. However, in certain instances, BlackRock may determine, in our independent business judgment as a fiduciary, that the value of voting outweighs the securities
lending revenue loss to clients and would therefore recall shares to be voted in those instances. </p> <p>Periodically, BlackRock reviews our process for determining
whether to recall securities on loan in order to vote and may modify it as necessary. </p> <p><b><a name="regsupp745737a_17"></a>Voting guidelines </b></p>
<p>The voting guidelines published for each region/country in which we vote are intended to summarize BlackRock’s general philosophy and approach to issues that may
commonly arise in the proxy voting context in each market where we invest. The Guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. BIS applies the Guidelines on a <font><font>case-by-case</font></font>
basis, in the context of the individual circumstances of each company and the specific issue under review. As such, the Guidelines do not indicate how BIS will vote in every instance. Rather, they reflect our view about corporate governance issues
generally, and provide insight into how we typically approach issues that commonly arise on corporate ballots. As previously discussed, the Guidelines should be read in conjunction with the Principles and engagement priorities. Collectively, these
“BIS policies” set out the core elements of corporate governance that guide our investment stewardship efforts globally and within each market, including when engaging with companies and voting at shareholder meetings. The BIS policies are
applied on a <font><font>case-by-case</font></font> basis, taking into consideration the context within which a company is operating. </p>
<p> </p> <p> </p>
<p><sup>10</sup> Recalling securities on loan can be impacted by the timing of record dates. In the U.S., for example, the record
date of a shareholder meeting typically falls before the proxy statements are released. Accordingly, it is not practicable to evaluate a proxy statement, determine that a vote has a material impact on a fund and recall any shares on loan in advance
of the record date for the annual meeting. As a result, managers must weigh independent business judgement as a fiduciary, the benefit to a fund’s shareholders of recalling loaned shares in advance of an estimated record date without knowing
whether there will be a vote on matters which have a material impact on the fund (thereby forgoing potential securities lending revenue for the fund’s shareholders) or leaving shares on loan to potentially earn revenue for the fund (thereby
forgoing the opportunity to vote). </p>

<p>We are committed to transparency in the stewardship work we do on behalf of clients. We inform clients about our engagement and voting policies and activities through
direct communication and through disclosure on our <u>website</u>. Each year we publish an annual report that provides a global overview of our investment stewardship engagement and voting activities and a voting spotlight that summarizes our voting
over a proxy year.<sup>11</sup> Additionally, we make public our regional proxy voting guidelines for the benefit of clients and the companies in which we invest on their behalf. We also publish commentaries
to share our perspective on market developments and emerging key themes. </p> <p>At a more granular level, on a quarterly basis, we publish our vote record for each
company that held a shareholder meeting during the period, showing how BIS voted on each proposal and providing our rationale for any votes against management proposals or on shareholder proposals. For shareholder meetings where a vote might be high
profile or of significant interest to clients, we may publish a vote bulletin after the meeting, disclosing and explaining our vote on key proposals. We also publish a quarterly list of all companies with which we engaged and the key topics
addressed in the engagement meeting. </p> <p>In this way, we help inform our clients about the work we do on their behalf in promoting the governance and business
practices that support durable, long-term financial value creation. </p> <p> </p>

Introduction </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_3"></a>Summary of Changes for 2024 </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis evaluates these guidelines on an ongoing basis and formally updates them on an annual basis. This year we’ve made noteworthy
revisions in the following areas, which are summarized below but discussed in greater detail in the relevant section of this document: </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9">Material Weaknesses </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">We have
included a new discussion on our approach to material weaknesses. Effective internal controls over financial reporting should ensure the integrity of companies’ accounting and financial reporting. A material weakness occurs when a company
identifies a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">We believe it is the responsibility of audit committees to ensure that material weaknesses
are remediated in a timely manner and that companies disclose remediation plans that include detailed steps to resolve a given material weakness. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">When a material weakness is reported and the company has not disclosed a remediation plan, or when a material weakness has been ongoing for more than one year and the company has not disclosed an updated remediation plan that
clearly outlines the company’s progress toward remediating the material weakness, we will consider recommending that shareholders vote against all members of a company’s audit committee who served on the committee during the time when the
material weakness was identified. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9">Cyber Risk Oversight </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">We have updated our discussion on our approach to cyber risk oversight. On July 26, 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
announced rules requiring public companies to report cybersecurity incidents deemed material within four days of identifying them; furthermore, in annual reports, they must disclose their processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material
cybersecurity risks, along with their material effects and past incidents’ impacts. Similar rules were also adopted for foreign private issuers. The final rules became effective on September 5, 2023. Given the continued regulatory focus on
and the potential adverse outcomes from cyber-related issues, it is our view that cyber risk is material for all companies. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">In the
absence of material cybersecurity incidents, we will generally not make voting recommendations on the basis of a company’s oversight or disclosure concerning cyber-related issues. However, in instances where cyber-attacks have caused
significant harm to shareholders, we will closely evaluate the board’s oversight of cybersecurity as well as the company’s response and disclosures. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Moreover, in instances where a company has been materially impacted by a cyber-attack, we believe shareholders can reasonably expect periodic
updates from the company communicating its ongoing progress towards resolving and remediating the impact of the cyber-attack. These disclosures should focus on the company’s response to address the impacts to affected stakeholders and should
not reveal specific and/or technical details that could impede the company’s response or remediation of the incident or that could assist threat actors. </font></p>

</p> <p> </p> <p><font color="#565656">In instances where a company has been
materially impacted by a cyber-attack, we may recommend against appropriate directors should we find the board’s oversight, response or disclosures concerning cybersecurity-related issues to be insufficient or are not provided to shareholders.
</font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9">Board Oversight of Environmental and Social Issues </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">We have updated our discussion of board oversight of environmental and social issues. Given the importance of the board’s role in overseeing
environmental and social risks, we believe that this responsibility should be formally designated and codified in the appropriate committee charters or other governing documents. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">When evaluating the board’s role in overseeing environmental and/or social issues, we will examine a company’s committee charters and
governing documents to determine if the company has codified a meaningful level of oversight of and accountability for a company’s material environmental and social impacts. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9">Board Accountability for Climate-Related Issues </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">We have updated our discussion of board accountability for climate-related issues, and how our policy is applied. In 2023, our policy on this topic was applied to the largest, most significant emitters; however beginning in 2024,
Glass Lewis will apply this policy to companies in the S&amp;P 500 index operating in industries where the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) has determined that the companies’ GHG emissions represent a financially material risk,
as well as companies where we believe emissions or climate impacts, or stakeholder scrutiny thereof, represent an outsized, financially material risk. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">We will assess whether such companies have produced disclosures in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). We have further clarified that we will also assess whether these
companies have disclosed explicit and clearly defined board-level oversight responsibilities for climate-related issues. In instances where we find either of these disclosures to be absent of significantly lacking, we may recommend voting against
responsible directors. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9">Clawback Provisions </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">In light of new NYSE and Nasdaq listing requirements to comply with SEC Rule <font>10D-1</font> under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, Glass Lewis has updated our views on the utility of clawback provisions. Although the negative impacts of excessive risk-taking do not always result in financial restatements, they may nonetheless prove harmful to shareholder
value. In addition to meeting listing requirements, effective clawback policies should provide companies with the power to recoup incentive compensation from an executive when there is evidence of problematic decisions or actions, such as
material misconduct, a material reputational failure, material risk management failure, or a material operational failure, the consequences of which have not already been reflected in incentive payments and where recovery is warranted. Such
power to recoup should be provided regardless of whether the employment of the executive officer was terminated with or without cause. In these circumstances, rationale should be provided if the company determines ultimately to refrain from
recouping compensation as well as disclosure of alternative measures that are instead pursued, such as the exercise of negative discretion on future payments. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9">Executive Ownership Guidelines </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">We have added a discussion to formally outline our approach to executive ownership guidelines. We believe that companies should facilitate an
alignment between the interests of the executive leadership with those of long-term shareholders by adopting and enforcing minimum share ownership rules for their named executive officers. Companies should provide clear disclosure in the
Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of the </font></p>

</p> <p> </p> <p><font color="#565656">proxy statement of their executive share
ownership requirements and how various outstanding equity awards are treated when determining an executive’s level of ownership. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">In the process of determining an executive’s level of share ownership, counting unearned performance-based full value awards and/or
unexercised stock options is inappropriate. Companies should provide a cogent rationale should they count these awards towards shares held by an executive. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9">Proposals for Equity Awards for Shareholders </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Regarding proposals seeking approval for individual equity awards, we
have included new discussion of provisions that require a <font>non-vote,</font> or vote of abstention, from a shareholder if the shareholder is also the recipient of the proposed grant. Such provisions help to address
potential conflict of interest issues and provide disinterested shareholders with more meaningful say over the proposal. The inclusion of such provisions will be viewed positively during our holistic analysis, especially when a vote from the
recipient of the proposed grant would materially influence the passage of the proposal. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9">Net Operating Loss (NOL) Pills </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">We have updated our discussion of NOL pills to include our concerns with acting in concert provisions. Over the past several years, the terms and
structures of NOL pills have evolved to include features such as acting in concert provisions, among other concerning terms, that may disempower shareholders and insulate the board and management. When acting in concert provisions are present within
the terms of a NOL pill, we believe this may raise concerns as to the true objective of the pill. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Acting in concert provisions broaden
the definition of beneficial ownership to prohibit parallel conduct, or multiple shareholders party to a formal or informal agreement collaborating to influence the board and management of a company, and aggregate the ownership of such shareholders
towards the triggering threshold. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">As such, we have added the inclusion of an acting in concert provision and whether the pill is
implemented following the filing of a Schedule 13D by a shareholder or there is evidence of hostile activity or shareholder activism as part of our considerations to recommend shareholders vote against a management proposed NOL pill. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9">Control Share Statutes </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">We have
added a new discussion outlining our approach to control share statutes. Certain states, including Delaware, have adopted control share acquisition statutes as an anti-takeover defense for certain <font>closed-end</font>
investment companies and business development companies. Control share statutes may prevent changes in control by limiting voting rights of a person that acquires the ownership of “control shares.” Control shares are shares of stock equal
to or exceeding specified percentages of company voting power, and a control share statute prevents shares in excess of the specified percentage from being voted, unless: (i) the board approves them to be voted; or (ii) the holder of the
“control shares” receives approval from a supermajority of <font>“non-interested”</font> shareholders.</font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Depending on the state of incorporation, companies may automatically rely on control share statutes unless the fund’s board of trustees eliminates the application of the control share statute to any or all fund share
acquisitions, through adoption of a provision in the fund’s governing instrument or by fund board action alone. In certain other states, companies must adopt control share statutes.</font></p>

</p> <p> </p> <p><font color="#565656">In our view, control share statues
disenfranchise shareholders by reducing their voting power to a level less than their economic interest and effectively function as an anti-takeover device. We believe all shareholders should have an opportunity to vote all of their shares.
Moreover, we generally believe anti-takeover measures prevent shareholders from receiving a <font>buy-out</font> premium for their stock. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">As such, we will generally recommend voting for proposals to opt out of control share acquisition statutes, unless doing so would allow the
completion of a takeover that is not in the best interests of shareholders; and recommend voting against proposals to amend the charter to include control share acquisition provisions.</font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Further, in cases where a <font>closed-end</font> fund or business development company has received a public buyout
offer and has relied on a control share statute as a defense mechanism in the prior year, we will generally recommend shareholders vote against the chair of the nominating and governance committee, absent a compelling rationale as to why a rejected
acquisition was not in the best interests of shareholders.</font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_4"></a>Clarifying Amendments </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">The following clarifications of our existing policies are included this year: </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9">Board Responsiveness </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">We have
clarified our discussion of board responsiveness to remove a reference to shareholder proposals from our discussion of when 20% or more of shareholders vote contrary to management. In addition, we have clarified that our calculation of opposition
includes votes cast as either AGAINST and/or ABSTAIN. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9">Interlocking Directorships </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">We have clarified our policy on interlocking directorships to reference that, on a
<font><font>case-by-case</font></font> basis, we evaluate other types of interlocking relationships, such as interlocks with close family members of executives or within group companies.
</font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9">Board Gender Diversity </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">We have clarified our policy on board gender diversity to emphasize that when making these voting recommendations, we will carefully review a company’s disclosure of its diversity considerations and may refrain from
recommending that shareholders vote against directors when boards have provided a sufficient rationale or plan to address the lack of diversity on the board, including a timeline of when the board intends to appoint additional gender diverse

Directors that Serves Shareholder Interest </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_6"></a>Election of Directors </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">The purpose of Glass Lewis’ proxy research and advice is to facilitate shareholder voting in favor of governance structures that will drive
performance, create shareholder value and maintain a proper tone at the top. Glass Lewis looks for talented boards with a record of protecting shareholders and delivering value over the medium- and long-term. We believe that a board can best protect
and enhance the interests of shareholders if it is sufficiently independent, has a record of positive performance, and consists of individuals with diverse backgrounds and a breadth and depth of relevant experience. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_7"></a>Independence </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The independence of directors, or lack thereof, is ultimately demonstrated through the decisions they make. In assessing the independence of directors, we will take into consideration, when appropriate, whether a director has a
track record indicative of making objective decisions. Likewise, when assessing the independence of directors we will also examine when a director’s track record on multiple boards indicates a lack of objective decision-making. Ultimately, we
believe the determination of whether a director is independent or not must take into consideration both compliance with the applicable independence listing requirements as well as judgments made by the director. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">We look at each director nominee to examine the director’s relationships with the company, the company’s executives, and other
directors. We do this to evaluate whether personal, familial, or financial relationships (not including director compensation) may impact the director’s decisions. We believe that such relationships make it difficult for a director to put
shareholders’ interests above the director’s or the related party’s interests. We also believe that a director who owns more than 20% of a company can exert disproportionate influence on the board, and therefore believe such a
director’s independence may be hampered, in particular when serving on the audit committee. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Thus, we put directors into three
categories based on an examination of the type of relationship they have with the company: </font></p> <p><font color="#565656"><b>Independent Director</b>
— An independent director has no material financial, familial or other current relationships with the company, its executives, or other board members, except for board service and standard fees paid for that service. Relationships that existed
within three to five years<sup>1</sup> before the inquiry are usually considered “current” for purposes of this test. For material financial relationships with the company, we apply a three-year
look back, and for former employment relationships with the company, we apply a five-year look back. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656"><b>Affiliated
Director</b> — An affiliated director has, (or within the past three years, had) a material financial, familial or other relationship with the company or its executives, but is not an employee of the company.<sup>2</sup> </font></p> <p> </p>
<p><font color="#565656"><sup>1</sup> NASDAQ originally proposed a five-year look-back period but both it and the NYSE ultimately
settled on a three-year look-back prior to finalizing their rules. A five-year standard for former employment relationships is more appropriate, in our view, because we believe that the unwinding of conflicting relationships between former
management and board members is more likely to be complete and final after five years. However, Glass Lewis does not apply the five-year look-back period to directors who have previously served as executives of the company on an interim basis for
less than one year. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656"><sup>2</sup> If a company does not consider a <font>non-employee</font> director to be independent, Glass Lewis will classify that director as an affiliate. </font></p> <p> </p>

whose employers have a material financial relationship with the company<sup>3</sup>. In addition, we view a director who either owns or controls 20% or more of the company’s voting stock, or is an
employee or affiliate of an entity that controls such amount, as an affiliate.<sup>4</sup> </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">We view 20% shareholders as affiliates because they typically have access to and involvement with the management of a company that is
fundamentally different from that of ordinary shareholders. More importantly, 20% holders may have interests that diverge from those of ordinary holders, for reasons such as the liquidity (or lack thereof) of their holdings, personal tax issues,
etc. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis applies a three-year look back period to all directors who have an affiliation with the company other than former
employment, for which we apply a five-year look back. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Definition of <b>“Material”</b>: A material relationship is one in

uncles, aunts, cousins, nieces, nephews, <font>in-laws,</font> and anyone (other than domestic employees) who shares such person’s home. A director is an affiliate if: i) he or she has a family member who is employed
by the company and receives more than $120,000<sup>8</sup> in annual compensation; or, ii) he or she has a family member who is employed by the company and the company does not disclose this
individual’s compensation. </font></p> <p> </p> <p><font color="#565656"><sup>3</sup> We allow a five-year grace period for former executives of the company or merged companies who have consulting agreements with the surviving company. (We do not automatically
recommend voting against directors in such cases for the first five years.) If the consulting agreement persists after this five-year grace period, we apply the materiality thresholds outlined in the definition of “material.” </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656"><sup>4</sup> This includes a director who serves on a board as a representative (as part of his or her
basic responsibilities) of an investment firm with greater than 20% ownership. However, while we will generally consider him/her to be affiliated, we will not recommend voting against unless (i) the investment firm has disproportionate board
representation or (ii) the director serves on the audit committee. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656"><sup>5</sup> We may
deem such a transaction to be immaterial where the amount represents less than 1% of the firm’s annual revenues and the board provides a compelling rationale as to why the director’s independence is not affected by the relationship.
</font></p> <p><font color="#565656"><sup>6</sup> We will generally take into consideration the size and nature of such
charitable entities in relation to the company’s size and industry along with any other relevant factors such as the director’s role at the charity. However, unlike for other types of related party transactions, Glass Lewis generally does
not apply a look-back period to affiliated relationships involving charitable contributions; if the relationship between the director and the school or charity ceases, or if the company discontinues its donations to the entity, we will consider the
director to be independent. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656"><sup>7</sup> This includes cases where a director is employed
by, or closely affiliated with, a private equity firm that profits from an acquisition made by the company. Unless disclosure suggests otherwise, we presume the director is affiliated. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656"><sup>8</sup> Pursuant to SEC rule Item 404 of Regulation <font>S-K</font>
under the Securities Exchange Act, compensation exceeding $120,000 is the minimum threshold deemed material for disclosure of transactions involving family members of directors. </font></p>

</p> <p> </p> <p><font color="#565656">Definition of <b>“Company”</b>
— A company includes any parent or subsidiary in a group with the company or any entity that merged with, was acquired by, or acquired the company. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656"><b>Inside Director </b>— An inside director simultaneously serves as a director and as an employee of the company. This
category may include a board chair who acts as an employee of the company or is paid as an employee of the company. In our view, an inside director who derives a greater amount of income as a result of affiliated transactions with the company rather
than through compensation paid by the company (i.e., salary, bonus, etc. as a company employee) faces a conflict between making decisions that are in the best interests of the company versus those in the director’s own best interests.
Therefore, we will recommend voting against such a director. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Additionally, we believe a director who is currently serving in an
interim management position should be considered an insider, while a director who previously served in an interim management position for less than one year and is no longer serving in such capacity is considered independent. Moreover, a director
who previously served in an interim management position for over one year and is no longer serving in such capacity is considered an affiliate for five years following the date of the director’s resignation or departure from the interim
management position. </font></p> <p><font color="#ff2d00">Voting Recommendations on the Basis of Board Independence </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis believes a board will be most effective in protecting shareholders’ interests if it is at least
<font>two-thirds</font> independent. We note that each of the Business Roundtable, the Conference Board, and the Council of Institutional Investors advocates that <font>two-thirds</font> of the
board be independent. Where more than <font>one-third</font> of the members are affiliated or inside directors, we typically<sup>8</sup> recommend voting against some of the inside
and/or affiliated directors in order to satisfy the <font>two-thirds</font> threshold. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">In the case of a
less than <font>two-thirds</font> independent board, Glass Lewis strongly supports the existence of a presiding or lead director with authority to set the meeting agendas and to lead sessions outside the insider
chair’s presence. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">In addition, we scrutinize avowedly “independent” chairs and lead directors. We believe that they
should be unquestionably independent, or the company should not tout them as such. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_8"></a>Committee Independence
</font></p> <p><font color="#565656">We believe that only independent directors should serve on a company’s audit, compensation, nominating, and governance
committees.<sup>9</sup> We typically recommend that shareholders vote against any affiliated or inside director seeking appointment to an audit, compensation, nominating, or governance committee, or who has
served in that capacity in the past year. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Pursuant to Section 952 of the Dodd-Frank Act, as of January 11, 2013, the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved new listing requirements for both the NYSE and NASDAQ which require that boards apply enhanced standards of independence when making an affirmative determination of the independence of compensation
committee members. Specifically, when making this determination, in addition </font></p> <p> </p>
<p><font color="#565656"><sup>8</sup> With a staggered board, if the affiliates or insiders that we believe should not be on the
board are not up for election, we will express our concern regarding those directors, but we will not recommend voting against the other affiliates or insiders who are up for election just to achieve
<font>two-thirds</font> independence. However, we will consider recommending voting against the directors subject to our concern at their next election if the issue giving rise to the concern is not resolved. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656"><sup>9</sup> We will recommend voting against an audit committee member who owns 20% or more of the
company’s stock, and we believe that there should be a maximum of one director (or no directors if the committee is composed of less than three directors) who owns 20% or more of the company’s stock on the compensation, nominating, and
governance committees. </font></p>

</p> <p> </p> <p><font color="#565656">to the factors considered when assessing
general director independence, the board’s considerations must include: (i) the source of compensation of the director, including any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee paid by the listed company to the director (the “Fees
Factor”); and (ii) whether the director is affiliated with the listing company, its subsidiaries, or affiliates of its subsidiaries (the “Affiliation Factor”). </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis believes it is important for boards to consider these enhanced independence factors when assessing compensation committee members.
However, as discussed above in the section titled Independence, we apply our own standards when assessing the independence of directors, and these standards also take into account consulting and advisory fees paid to the director, as well as the
director’s affiliations with the company and its subsidiaries and affiliates. We may recommend voting against compensation committee members who are not independent based on our standards. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_9"></a>Independent Chair </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis believes that separating the roles of CEO (or, more rarely, another executive position) and chair creates a better governance structure than a combined CEO/chair position. An executive manages the business according to a
course the board charts. Executives should report to the board regarding their performance in achieving goals set by the board. This is needlessly complicated when a CEO chairs the board, since a CEO/chair presumably will have a significant
influence over the board. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">While many companies have an independent lead or presiding director who performs many of the same functions
of an independent chair (e.g., setting the board meeting agenda), we do not believe this alternate form of independent board leadership provides as robust protection for shareholders as an independent chair. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">It can become difficult for a board to fulfill its role of overseer and policy setter when a CEO/chair controls the agenda and the boardroom
discussion. Such control can allow a CEO to have an entrenched position, leading to longer-than-optimal terms, fewer checks on management, less scrutiny of the business operation, and limitations on independent, shareholder-focused goal-setting by
the board. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">A CEO should set the strategic course for the company, with the board’s approval, and the board should enable the CEO
to carry out the CEO’s vision for accomplishing the board’s objectives. Failure to achieve the board’s objectives should lead the board to replace that CEO with someone in whom the board has confidence. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Likewise, an independent chair can better oversee executives and set a <font>pro-shareholder</font> agenda without the
management conflicts that a CEO and other executive insiders often face. Such oversight and concern for shareholders allows for a more proactive and effective board of directors that is better able to look out for the interests of shareholders.
</font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Further, it is the board’s responsibility to select a chief executive who can best serve a company and its shareholders and to
replace this person when his or her duties have not been appropriately fulfilled. Such a replacement becomes more difficult and happens less frequently when the chief executive is also in the position of overseeing the board. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis believes that the installation of an independent chair is almost always a positive step from a corporate governance perspective and
promotes the best interests of shareholders. Further, the presence of an independent chair fosters the creation of a thoughtful and dynamic board, not dominated by the views of senior management. Encouragingly, many companies appear to be moving in
this direction — one study indicates that only 10 percent of incoming CEOs in 2014 were awarded the chair title, versus 48 percent in 2002.<sup>10</sup> Another study finds that
53 percent of S&amp;P 500 boards now separate the CEO and chair roles, up from 37 percent in 2009, although the same study found that only 34 percent of S&amp;P 500 boards have truly independent chairs.<sup>11</sup> </font></p> <p> </p>

vote against CEOs who chair the board. However, we typically recommend that our clients support separating the roles of chair and CEO whenever that question is posed in a proxy (typically in the form of a shareholder proposal), as we believe that it
is in the long-term best interests of the company and its shareholders. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Further, where the company has neither an independent chair
nor independent lead director, we will recommend voting against the chair of the governance committee. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_10"></a>Performance </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The most crucial test of a board’s commitment to the company and its shareholders lies in the actions of the board and its members. We look at the performance of these individuals as directors and executives of the company and
of other companies where they have served. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">We find that a director’s past conduct is often indicative of future conduct and
performance. We often find directors with a history of overpaying executives or of serving on boards where avoidable disasters have occurred serving on the boards of companies with similar problems. Glass Lewis has a proprietary database of
directors serving at over 8,000 of the most widely held U.S. companies. We use this database to track the performance of directors across companies. </font></p> <p><font color="#ff2d00">Voting Recommendations on the Basis of Performance </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">We typically recommend that shareholders vote against directors
who have served on boards or as executives of companies with records of poor performance, inadequate risk oversight, excessive compensation, audit- or accounting-related issues, and/or other indicators of mismanagement or actions against the
interests of shareholders. We will reevaluate such directors based on, among other factors, the length of time passed since the incident giving rise to the concern, shareholder support for the director, the severity of the issue, the director’s
role (e.g., committee membership), director tenure at the subject company, whether ethical lapses accompanied the oversight lapse, and evidence of strong oversight at other companies. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Likewise, we examine the backgrounds of those who serve on key board committees to ensure that they have the required skills and diverse
backgrounds to make informed judgments about the subject matter for which the committee is responsible. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">We believe shareholders should
avoid electing directors who have a record of not fulfilling their responsibilities to shareholders at any company where they have held a board or executive position. We typically recommend voting against: </font></p>

approval or disapproval attributed to unaffiliated shareholders when determining whether board responsiveness is warranted. In the case of companies that have multi-class share structures with unequal voting rights, we will generally examine the
level of approval or disapproval attributed to unaffiliated shareholders on a “one share, one vote” basis. At controlled and multi-class companies, when at least 20% or more of unaffiliated shareholders vote contrary to management, we
believe that boards should engage with shareholders and demonstrate some initial level of responsiveness, and when a majority or more of unaffiliated shareholders vote contrary to management, we believe that boards should engage with shareholders
and provide a more robust response to address shareholder concerns. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">As a general framework, our evaluation of board responsiveness

<p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis believes that a designated committee chair maintains primary responsibility for the actions of his or her respective committee. As
such, many of our committee-specific voting recommendations are against the applicable committee chair rather than the entire committee (depending on the seriousness of the issue). In cases where the committee chair is not up for election due to a
staggered board, and where we have identified multiple concerns, we will generally recommend voting against other members of the committee who are up for election, on a
<font><font>case-by-case</font></font> basis. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">In cases where we would ordinarily
recommend voting against a committee chair but the chair is not specified, we apply the following general rules, which apply throughout our guidelines: </font></p> <p> </p>
<table>
<tr>
<td> </td>

<td> <p><font color="#565656">If there is no committee chair, we recommend voting against the longest-serving committee member or,

voting against both (or all) such senior directors. </font></p></td></tr></table> <p><font color="#565656">In our view, companies should provide clear disclosure of which
director is charged with overseeing each committee. In cases where that simple framework is ignored and a reasonable analysis cannot determine which committee member is the designated leader, we believe shareholder action against the longest serving
committee member(s) is warranted. Again, this only applies if we would ordinarily recommend voting against the committee chair but there is either no such position or no designated director in such role. </font></p>

<p><font color="#565656">Audit committees play an integral role in overseeing the financial reporting process because stable capital markets depend on reliable,
transparent, and objective financial information to support an efficient and effective capital market process. Audit committees play a vital role in providing this disclosure to shareholders. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">When assessing an audit committee’s performance, we are aware that an audit committee does not prepare financial statements, is not
responsible for making the key judgments and assumptions that affect the financial statements, and does not audit the numbers or the disclosures provided to investors. Rather, an audit committee member monitors and oversees the process and
procedures that management and auditors perform. The 1999 Report and Recommendations of the Blue Ribbon Committee on Improving the Effectiveness of Corporate Audit Committees stated it best: </font></p>

the outside auditors — form a ‘three legged stool’ that supports responsible financial disclosure and active participatory oversight. However, in the view of the Committee, the audit committee must be ‘first among equals’ in
this process, since the audit committee is an extension of the full board and hence the ultimate monitor of the process.</i> </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_14">
</a>Standards for Assessing the Audit Committee </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">For an audit committee to function effectively on investors’ behalf, it must
include members with sufficient knowledge to diligently carry out their responsibilities. In its audit and accounting recommendations, the Conference Board Commission on Public Trust and Private Enterprise said “members of the audit committee
must be independent and have both knowledge and experience in auditing financial matters.”<sup>13</sup> </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">We are skeptical of audit committees where there are members that lack expertise as a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), Chief Financial Officer (CFO) or corporate controller, or similar experience. While we will not necessarily
recommend voting against members of an audit committee when such expertise is lacking, we are more likely to recommend voting against committee members when a problem such as a restatement occurs and such expertise is lacking. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis generally assesses audit committees against the decisions they make with respect to their oversight and monitoring role. The quality
and integrity of the financial statements and earnings reports, the completeness of disclosures necessary for investors to make informed decisions, and the effectiveness of the internal controls should provide reasonable assurance that the financial
statements are materially free from errors. The independence of the external auditors and the results of their work all provide useful information by which to assess the audit committee. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">When assessing the decisions and actions of the audit committee, we typically defer to its judgment and generally recommend voting in favor of its
members. However, we will consider recommending that shareholders vote against the following: </font></p> <p> </p>

</font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The SEC guidance regarding Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting requires that reports on internal
control should include: (i) a statement of management’s responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company; (ii) management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the company’s most recent fiscal year; (iii) a statement identifying the framework used by management to evaluate the effectiveness of the company’s internal
control over financial reporting; and (iv) a statement that the registered public accounting firm that audited the company’s financial statements included in the annual report has issued an attestation report on management’s
assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">A material weakness occurs when a company identifies a
deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. Failure to maintain effective internal controls can create doubts regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may lead to companies
publishing financial statements that are not free of errors or misstatements. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">We believe it is the responsibility of audit committees
to ensure that material weaknesses are remediated in a timely manner and that companies disclose remediation plans that include detailed steps to resolve a given material weakness. In cases where a material weakness has been ongoing for more than
one fiscal year, we expect the company to disclose an updated remediation plan at least annually thereafter. Updates to existing remediation plans should state the progress the company has made toward remediating the material weakness and the
remaining actions the company plans to take until the material weakness is fully remediated. As such, we are critical of audit committees when companies disclose remediation plans that remain unchanged from a prior period. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">When a material weakness is reported and the company has not disclosed a remediation plan, or when a material weakness has been ongoing for more
than one year and the company has not disclosed an updated remediation plan that clearly outlines the company’s progress toward remediating the material weakness, we will consider recommending that shareholders vote against all members of a
company’s audit committee who served on the committee during the time when the material weakness was identified. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">We also take a
dim view of audit committee reports that are boilerplate, and which provide little or no information or transparency to investors. When a problem such as a material weakness, restatement or late filings occurs, in forming our judgment with respect
to the audit committee we take into consideration the transparency of the audit committee report. </font></p>

Committee Performance </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Compensation committees have a critical role in determining the compensation of executives. This includes
deciding the basis on which compensation is determined, as well as the amounts and types of compensation to be paid. This process begins with the hiring and initial establishment of employment agreements, including the terms for such items as pay,
pensions and severance arrangements. It is important in establishing compensation arrangements that compensation be consistent with, and based on the long-term economic performance of, the business’s long-term shareholders returns. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Compensation committees are also responsible for the oversight of the transparency of compensation. This oversight includes disclosure of
compensation arrangements, the matrix used in assessing pay for performance, and the use of compensation consultants. In order to ensure the independence of the board’s compensation consultant, we believe the compensation committee should only
engage a compensation consultant that is not also providing any services to the company or management apart from their contract with the compensation committee. It is important to investors that they have clear and complete disclosure of all the
significant terms of compensation arrangements in order to make informed decisions with respect to the oversight and decisions of the compensation committee. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Finally, compensation committees are responsible for oversight of internal controls over the executive compensation process. This includes
controls over gathering information used to determine compensation, establishment of equity award plans, and granting of equity awards. For example, the use of a compensation consultant who maintains a business relationship with company management
may cause the committee to make decisions based on information that is compromised by the consultant’s conflict of interests. Lax controls can also contribute to improper awards of compensation such as through granting of backdated or
spring-loaded options, or granting of bonuses when triggers for bonus payments have not been met. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Central to understanding the actions
of compensation committee is a careful review of the CD&amp;A report included in each company’s proxy. We review the CD&amp;A in our evaluation of the overall compensation practices of a company, as overseen by the compensation committee. The
CD&amp;A is also integral to the evaluation of compensation proposals at companies, such as advisory votes on executive compensation, which allow shareholders to vote on the compensation paid to a company’s top executives. </font></p>

<p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis evaluates the risk management function of a public company board on a strictly <font><font>case-by-case</font></font> basis. Sound risk management, while necessary at all companies, is particularly important at financial firms which inherently maintain significant exposure to financial risk. We believe such
financial firms should have a chief risk officer reporting directly to the board and a dedicated risk committee or a committee of the board charged with risk oversight. Moreover, many <font>non-financial</font> firms
maintain strategies which involve a high level of exposure to financial risk. Similarly, since many <font>non-financial</font> firms have complex hedging or trading strategies, those firms should also have a chief risk
officer and a risk committee. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Our views on risk oversight are consistent with those expressed by various regulatory bodies. In its
December 2009 Final Rule release on Proxy Disclosure Enhancements, the SEC noted that risk oversight is a key competence of the board and that additional disclosures would improve investor and shareholder understanding of the role of the board in
the organization’s risk management practices. The final rules, which became effective on February 28, 2010, now explicitly require companies and mutual funds to describe (while allowing for some degree of flexibility) the board’s role
in the oversight of risk. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">When analyzing the risk management practices of public companies, we take note of any significant losses or
writedowns on financial assets and/or structured transactions. In cases where a company has disclosed a sizable loss or writedown, and where we find that the company’s board-level risk committee’s poor oversight </font></p>

initially raised shareholder concern as well as company responsiveness to such matters, and will only recommend voting against the nominating chair if a reasonable analysis suggests that it would be most appropriate. In rare cases, we will consider
recommending against the nominating chair when a director receives a substantial (i.e., 20% or more) vote against based on the same analysis. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656"><sup>27</sup> Women and directors that identify with a gender other than male or female. </font></p>

<p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis recognizes the importance of ensuring the sustainability of companies’ operations. We believe that insufficient oversight of
material environmental and social issues can present direct legal, financial, regulatory and reputational risks that could serve to harm shareholder interests. Therefore, we believe that these issues should be carefully monitored and managed by
companies, and that all companies should have an appropriate oversight structure in place to ensure that they are mitigating attendant risks and capitalizing on related opportunities to the best extent possible. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">To that end, Glass Lewis believes that companies should ensure that boards maintain clear oversight of material risks to their operations,
including those that are environmental and social in nature. These risks could include, but are not limited to, matters related to climate change, human capital management, diversity, stakeholder relations, and health, safety &amp; environment.
Given the importance of the board’s role in overseeing environmental and social risks, we believe this responsibility should be formally designated and codified in the appropriate committee charters or other governing documents. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">While we believe that it is important that these issues are overseen at the board level and that shareholders are afforded meaningful disclosure
of these oversight responsibilities, we believe that companies should determine the best structure for this oversight. In our view, this oversight can be effectively conducted by specific directors, the entire board, a separate committee, or
combined with the responsibilities of a key committee. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">For companies in the Russell 3000 index and in instances where we identify
material oversight concerns, Glass Lewis will review a company’s overall governance practices and identify which directors or board-level committees have been charged with oversight of environmental and/or social issues. Furthermore, given the
importance of the board’s role in overseeing environmental and social risks, Glass Lewis will generally recommend voting against the governance committee chair of a company in the Russell 1000 index that fails to provide explicit disclosure
concerning the board’s role in overseeing these issues. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">When evaluating the board’s role in overseeing environmental and/or
social issues, we will examine a company’s committee charters and governing documents to determine if the company has codified and maintained a meaningful level of oversight of and accountability for a company’s material environmental and
social impacts. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_20"></a>Cyber Risk Oversight </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Companies and consumers are exposed to a growing risk of cyber-attacks. These attacks can result in customer or employee data breaches, harm to a
company’s reputation, significant fines or penalties, and interruption to a company’s operations. Further, in some instances, cyber breaches can result in national security concerns, such as those impacting companies operating as
utilities, defense contractors, and energy companies. </font></p> <p> </p>
<p><font color="#565656"><sup>28</sup> A committee responsible for risk management could be a dedicated risk committee, the audit
committee, or the finance committee, depending on a given company’s board structure and method of disclosure. At some companies, the entire board is charged with risk management. </font></p>

</p> <p> </p> <p><font color="#565656">In response to these issues, regulators
have increasingly been focused on ensuring companies are providing appropriate and timely disclosures and protections to stakeholders that could have been adversely impacted by a breach in a company’s cyber infrastructure. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">On July 26, 2023, the SEC approved final rules requiring public companies to report cybersecurity incidents deemed material within four days
of identifying them, detailing their nature, scope, timing, and material impact under Item 1.05 on Form <font>8-K.</font> </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Furthermore, in annual reports, companies must disclose their processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material cybersecurity risks, along with their material effects; and describe whether any risks from prior incidents
have materially affected its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition (or are reasonably likely to), pursuant to Regulation <font>S-K</font> Item 106. Item 106 will also require registrants to
describe the board of directors’ oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats and management’s role and expertise in assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. Similar rules were also adopted for foreign private
issuers. The final rules became effective on September 5, 2023. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Given the regulatory focus on, and the potential adverse outcomes
from, cyber-related issues, it is our view that cyber risk is material for all companies. We therefore believe that it is critical that companies evaluate and mitigate these risks to the greatest extent possible. With that view, we encourage all
issuers to provide clear disclosure concerning the role of the board in overseeing issues related to cybersecurity, including how companies are ensuring directors are fully versed on this rapidly evolving and dynamic issue. We believe such
disclosure can help shareholders understand the seriousness with which companies take this issue. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">In the absence of material cyber
incidents, we will generally not make voting recommendations on the basis of a company’s oversight or disclosure concerning cyber-related issues. However, in instances where cyber-attacks have caused significant harm to shareholders we will
closely evaluate the board’s oversight of cybersecurity as well as the company’s response and disclosures. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Moreover, in
instances where a company has been materially impacted by a cyber-attack, we believe shareholders can reasonably expect periodic updates communicating the company’s ongoing progress towards resolving and remediating the impact of the
cyber-attack. We generally believe shareholders are best served when such updates include (but are not necessarily limited to) details such as when the company has fully restored its information systems, when the company has returned to normal
operations, what resources the company is providing for affected stakeholders, and any other potentially relevant information, until the company considers the impact of the cyber-attack to be fully remediated. These disclosures should focus on the
company’s response to address the impacts to affected stakeholders and should not reveal specific and/or technical details that could impede the company’s response or remediation of the incident or that could assist threat actors.
</font></p> <p><font color="#565656">In such instances, we may recommend against appropriate directors should we find the board’s oversight, response or disclosure
concerning cybersecurity-related issues to be insufficient, or are not provided to shareholders. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_21"></a>Board

<p><font color="#ff2d00">Board Accountability for Climate-related Issues </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Given the exceptionally broad impacts of a changing climate on companies, the economy, and society in general, we view climate risk as a material risk for all companies. We therefore believe that boards should be considering and
evaluating their operational resilience under lower-carbon scenarios. While all companies maintain exposure to climate-related risks, we believe that additional consideration should be given to, and that disclosure should be provided by those
companies whose GHG emissions represent a financially material risk. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">We believe that companies with this increased risk exposure
should provide clear and comprehensive disclosure regarding these risks, including how they are being mitigated and overseen. We believe such information is crucial to allow investors to understand the company’s management of this issue, as
well as the impact of a lower carbon future on the company’s operations. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">In line with this view, Glass Lewis will carefully
examine the climate-related disclosures provided by companies in the S&amp;P 500 index with material exposure to climate risk stemming from their own operations<sup>29</sup>, as well as companies where we
believe emissions or climate impacts, or stakeholder scrutiny thereof, represent an outsized, financially material risk, in order to assess whether they have produced disclosures in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related
Financial Disclosures (TCFD). We will also assess whether these companies have disclosed explicit and clearly defined board-level oversight responsibilities for climate-related issues. In instances where we find either (or both) of these disclosures
to be absent or significantly lacking, we may recommend voting against the chair of the committee (or board) charged with oversight of climate-related issues, or if no committee has been charged with such oversight, the chair of the governance
committee. Further, we may extend our recommendation on this basis to additional members of the responsible committee in cases where the committee chair is not standing for election due to a classified board, or based on other factors, including the
company’s size, industry and its overall governance profile. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_22"></a>Director Commitments </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">We believe that directors should have the necessary time to fulfill their duties to shareholders. In our view, an overcommitted director can pose
a material risk to a company’s shareholders, particularly during periods of crisis. In addition, recent research indicates that the time commitment associated with being a director has been on a significant upward trend in the past decade.<sup>30</sup> As a result, we generally recommend that shareholders vote against a director who serves as an executive officer (other than executive chair) of any </font></p>
<p> </p> <p><font color="#565656"><sup>29</sup> This policy will generally apply to companies in the following SASB-defined industries: agricultural products, air freight &amp; logistics, airlines, chemicals, construction materials,
containers &amp; packaging, cruise lines, electric utilities &amp; power generators, food retailers &amp; distributors, health care distributors, iron &amp; steel producers, marine transportation, meat, poultry &amp; dairy,
metals &amp; mining, <font>non-alcoholic</font> beverages, oil &amp; gas, pulp &amp; paper products, rail transportation, road transportation, semiconductors, waste management. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656"><sup>30</sup> For example, the 2015-2016 NACD Public Company Governance Survey states that, on average,
directors spent a total of 248.2 hours annual on board-related matters during the past year, which it describes as a “historically high level” that is significantly above the average hours recorded in 2006. Additionally, the 2020 Spencer
Stuart Board Index indicates that, while 39% of S&amp;P 500 CEOs serve on one additional public board, just 2% of S&amp;P 500 CEOs serve on two additional public boards and only one CEO serves on three. </font></p>

other director who serves on more than five public company boards. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Because we believe that executives will primarily devote their
attention to executive duties, we generally will not recommend that shareholders vote against overcommitted directors at the companies where they serve as an executive. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">When determining whether a director’s service on an excessive number of boards may limit the ability of the director to devote sufficient
time to board duties, we may consider relevant factors such as the size and location of the other companies where the director serves on the board, the director’s board roles at the companies in question, whether the director serves on the
board of any large privately-held companies, the director’s tenure on the boards in question, and the director’s attendance record at all companies. In the case of directors who serve in executive roles other than CEO (e.g., executive
chair), we will evaluate the specific duties and responsibilities of that role in determining whether an exception is warranted. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">We
may also refrain from recommending against certain directors if the company provides sufficient rationale for their continued board service. The rationale should allow shareholders to evaluate the scope of the directors’ other commitments, as
well as their contributions to the board including specialized knowledge of the company’s industry, strategy or key markets, the diversity of skills, perspective and background they provide, and other relevant factors. We will also generally
refrain from recommending to vote against a director who serves on an excessive number of boards within a consolidated group of companies in related industries, or a director that represents a firm whose sole purpose is to manage a portfolio of
investments which include the company. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_23"></a>Other Considerations </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">In addition to the three key characteristics — independence, performance, experience — that we use to evaluate board members, we
consider <font><font>conflict-of-interest</font></font> issues as well as the size of the board of directors when making voting recommendations. </font></p>
<p><font color="#ff2d00">Conflicts of Interest </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">We
believe board members should be wholly free of identifiable and substantial conflicts of interest, regardless of the overall level of independent directors on the board. Accordingly, we recommend that shareholders vote against the following types of

directors, since they may be forced to weigh their own interests against shareholder interests when making board decisions. In addition, a company’s decisions regarding where to turn for the best professional services may be compromised when
doing business with the professional services firm of one of the company’s directors. </font></td></tr></table> <p> </p>

<p><font color="#ff2d00">Size of the Board of Directors </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">While we do not believe there is a universally applicable optimal board size, we do believe boards should have at least five directors to ensure
sufficient diversity in decision-making and to enable the formation of key board committees with independent directors. Conversely, we believe that boards with more than 20 members will typically suffer under the weight of “too many cooks in
the kitchen” and have difficulty reaching consensus and making timely decisions. Sometimes the presence of too many voices can make it difficult to draw on the wisdom and experience in the room by virtue of the need to limit the discussion so
that each voice may be heard. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">To that end, we typically recommend voting against the chair of the nominating committee (or the

function is to protect shareholder interests; however, when an individual, entity (or group of shareholders party to a formal agreement) owns more than 50% of the voting shares, the interests of the majority of shareholders are the interests of that
entity or individual. Consequently, Glass Lewis does not apply our usual <font>two-thirds</font> board independence rule and therefore we will not recommend voting against boards whose composition reflects the makeup of

will generally examine the level of approval or disapproval attributed to unaffiliated shareholders on a “one share, one vote” basis. At controlled and multi-class companies, when at least 20% or more of unaffiliated shareholders vote
contrary to management, we believe that boards should engage with shareholders and demonstrate some initial level of responsiveness, and when a majority or more of unaffiliated shareholders vote contrary to management we believe that boards should
engage with shareholders and provide a more robust response to fully address shareholder concerns. </font></p>

<p><font color="#565656">In cases where Glass Lewis determines that the board has approved overly restrictive governing documents, we will generally recommend voting
against members of the governance committee. If there is no governance committee, or if a portion of such committee members are not standing for election due to a classified board structure, we will expand our recommendations to additional director
nominees, based on who is standing for election. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">In cases where, preceding an IPO, the board adopts a multi-class share structure
where voting rights are not aligned with economic interest, or an anti-takeover provision, such as a poison pill or classified board, we will generally recommend voting against all members of the board who served at the time of the IPO if the board:
(i) did not also commit to submitting these provisions to a shareholder vote at the company’s first shareholder meeting following the IPO; or (ii) did not provide for a reasonable sunset of these provisions (generally three to five
years in the case of a classified board or poison pill; or seven years or less in the case of a multi-class share structure). In the case of a multi-class share structure, if these provisions are put to a shareholder vote, we will examine the level
of approval or disapproval attributed to unaffiliated shareholders when determining the vote outcome. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">In our view, adopting an
anti-takeover device unfairly penalizes future shareholders who (except for electing to buy or sell the stock) are unable to weigh in on a matter that could potentially negatively impact their ownership interest. This notion is strengthened when a
board adopts a classified board with an infinite duration or a poison pill with a five- to <font>ten-year</font> term immediately prior to going public, thereby insulating management for a substantial amount of time.
</font></p> <p><font color="#565656">In addition, shareholders should also be wary of companies that adopt supermajority voting requirements before their IPO. Absent
explicit provisions in the articles or bylaws stipulating that certain policies will be phased out over a certain period of time, long-term shareholders could find themselves in the predicament of having to attain a supermajority vote to approve
future proposals seeking to eliminate such policies. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_27"></a>Governance Following a Business Combination with a

</p> <p> </p> <p><font color="#565656">At meetings where shareholders vote on
the business combination of a SPAC with a private company, shareholders are generally voting on a new corporate charter for the post-combination company as a condition to approval of the business combination. In many cases, shareholders are faced
with the dilemma of having to approve corporate charters that severely restrict shareholder rights to facilitate the business combination. Therefore, when shareholders are required to approve binding charters as a condition to approval of a business
combination with a SPAC, we believe shareholders should also be provided with advisory votes on material charter amendments as a means to voice their opinions on such restrictive governance provisions. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">When evaluating companies that have recently gone public via business combination with a SPAC, Glass Lewis will review the terms of the applicable
governing documents to determine whether shareholder rights are being severely restricted indefinitely and whether these restrictive provisions were put forth for a shareholder vote on an advisory basis at the prior meeting where shareholders voted
on the business combination. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">In cases where, prior to the combined company becoming publicly traded, the board adopts a multi-class
share structure where voting rights are not aligned with economic interest, or an anti-takeover provision, such as a poison pill or classified board, we will generally recommend voting against all members of the board who served at the time of the
combined company becoming publicly traded if the board: (i) did not also submit these provisions to a shareholder vote on an advisory basis at the prior meeting where shareholders voted on the business combination; (ii) did not also commit
to submitting these provisions to a shareholder vote at the company’s first shareholder meeting following the company becoming publicly traded; or (iii) did not provide for a reasonable sunset of these provisions (generally three to five
years in the case of a classified board or poison pill; or seven years or less in the case of a multi-class share structure). </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Consistent with our view on IPOs, adopting an anti-takeover device unfairly penalizes future shareholders who (except for electing to buy or sell

(i) the corporate governance structure and features of the company including whether the board structure is unique to a particular market; (ii) the nature of the proposals; (iii) the location of the company’s primary listing, if
one can be determined; (iv) the regulatory/governance regime that the board is reporting against; and (v) the availability and completeness of the company’s SEC filings. </font></p>

governance standards as listed companies. However, we believe that more stringent corporate governance standards should be applied to these companies given that their shares are still publicly traded. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">When reviewing OTC companies, Glass Lewis will review the available disclosure relating to the shareholder meeting to determine whether
shareholders are able to evaluate several key pieces of information, including: (i) the composition of the board’s key committees, if any; (ii) the level of share ownership of company insiders or directors; (iii) the board
meeting attendance record of directors; (iv) executive and <font>non-employee</font> director compensation; (v) related-party transactions conducted during the past year; and (vi) the board’s leadership
structure and determinations regarding director independence. </font></p>

company disclosure lacks any information regarding the board’s key committees. We believe that committees of the board are an essential tool for clarifying how the responsibilities of the board are being delegated, and specifically for
indicating which directors are accountable for ensuring: (i) the independence and quality of directors, and the transparency and integrity of the nominating process; (ii) compensation programs that are fair and appropriate;
(iii) proper oversight of the company’s accounting, financial reporting, and internal and external audits; and (iv) general adherence to principles of good corporate governance. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">In cases where shareholders are unable to identify which board members are responsible for ensuring oversight of the above-mentioned
responsibilities, we may consider recommending against certain members of the board. Ordinarily, we believe it is the responsibility of the corporate governance committee to provide thorough disclosure of the board’s governance practices. In
the absence of such a committee, we believe it is appropriate to hold the board’s chair or, if such individual is an executive of the company, the longest-serving <font>non-executive</font> board member accountable.

increasing the independence threshold to 75%. In 2006, a federal appeals court ordered that this rule amendment be put back out for public comment, putting it back into “proposed rule” status. Since mutual fund boards play a vital role in
overseeing the relationship between the fund and its investment manager, there is greater need for independent oversight than there is for an operating company board. </font></td></tr></table>

are the same person and the fund does not have an independent lead or presiding director. Seven former SEC commissioners support the appointment of an independent chair and we agree with them that “an independent board chair would be better

<p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis favors the repeal of staggered boards and the annual election of directors. We believe staggered boards are less accountable to
shareholders than boards that are elected annually. Furthermore, we feel the annual election of directors encourages board members to focus on shareholder interests. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Empirical studies have shown: (i) staggered boards are associated with a reduction in a firm’s valuation; and (ii) in the context
of hostile takeovers, staggered boards operate as a takeover defense, which entrenches management, discourages potential acquirers, and delivers a lower return to target shareholders. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">In our view, there is no evidence to demonstrate that staggered boards improve shareholder returns in a takeover context. Some research has
indicated that shareholders are worse off when a staggered board blocks a transaction; further, when a staggered board negotiates a friendly transaction, no statistically significant difference in premium occurs.<sup>35</sup> Additional research found that charter-based staggered boards “reduce the market value of a firm by 4% to 6% of its market capitalization” and that “staggered boards bring about and
not merely reflect this reduction in market value.”<sup>36</sup> A subsequent study reaffirmed that classified boards reduce shareholder value, finding “that the ongoing process of dismantling
staggered boards, encouraged by institutional investors, could well contribute to increasing shareholder wealth.”<sup>37</sup> </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Shareholders have increasingly come to agree with this view. In 2019, 90% of S&amp;P 500 companies had declassified boards, up from 68% in 2009.<sup>38</sup> Management proposals to declassify boards are approved with near unanimity and shareholder proposals on the topic also receive strong shareholder support; in 2014, shareholder proposals requesting
that companies declassify their boards received average support of 84% (excluding abstentions and broker <font>non-votes),</font> whereas in 1987, only 16.4% of votes cast favored board </font></p>

the proposal or made no recommendation, a departure from the more traditional management recommendation to vote against shareholder proposals. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Given our belief that declassified boards promote director accountability, the empirical evidence suggesting staggered boards reduce a company’s value and the established shareholder opposition to such a structure, Glass Lewis
supports the declassification of boards and the annual election of directors. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_32"></a>Board Composition and
Refreshment </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis strongly supports routine director evaluation, including independent external reviews, and periodic board
refreshment to foster the sharing of diverse perspectives in the boardroom and the generation of new ideas and business strategies. Further, we believe the board should evaluate the need for changes to board composition based on an analysis of
skills and experience necessary for the company, as well as the results of the director evaluations, as opposed to relying solely on age or tenure limits. When necessary, shareholders can address concerns regarding proper board composition through
director elections. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">In our view, a director’s experience can be a valuable asset to shareholders because of the complex, critical
issues that boards face. This said, we recognize that in rare circumstances, a lack of refreshment can contribute to a lack of board responsiveness to poor company performance. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">We will note as a potential concern instances where the average tenure of non-executive directors is 10 years or more and no new directors have
joined the board in the past five years. While we will be highlighting this as a potential area of concern, we will not be making voting recommendations strictly on this basis, unless we have identified other governance or board performance
concerns. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">On occasion, age or term limits can be used as a means to remove a director for boards that are unwilling to police their
membership and enforce turnover. Some shareholders support term limits as a way to force change in such circumstances. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">While we
understand that age limits can aid board succession planning, the long-term impact of age limits restricts experienced and potentially valuable board members from service through an arbitrary means. We believe that shareholders are better off
monitoring the board’s overall composition, including the diversity of its members, the alignment of the board’s areas of expertise with a company’s strategy, the board’s approach to corporate governance, and its stewardship of
company performance, rather than imposing inflexible rules that don’t necessarily correlate with returns or benefits for shareholders. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">However, if a board adopts term/age limits, it should follow through and not waive such limits. In cases where the board waives its term/age limits for two or more consecutive years, Glass Lewis will generally recommend that
shareholders vote against the nominating and/or governance committee chair, unless a compelling rationale is provided for why the board is proposing to waive this rule, such as consummation of a corporate transaction. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_33"></a>Board Diversity </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis recognizes the importance of ensuring that the board is composed of directors who have a diversity of skills, thought and experience, as such diversity benefits companies by providing a broad range of perspectives and
insights. Glass Lewis closely reviews the composition of the board for representation of diverse director candidates. </font></p> <p> </p>

nominating committee of a board with no gender diverse directors, at companies within the Russell 3000 index. For companies outside the Russell 3000 index, our policy requires a minimum of one gender diverse director. </font></p>

director” as an individual who self-identifies as Black, African American, North African, Middle Eastern, Hispanic, Latino, Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, Native Hawaiian, or Alaskan Native, or who self-identifies as a member of the

enacting certain disclosure or reporting requirements in filings made with each respective state annually. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis will recommend
in accordance with mandatory board composition requirements set forth in applicable state laws when they come into effect. We will generally refrain from recommending against directors when applicable state laws do not mandate board composition
requirements, are <font>non-binding,</font> or solely impose disclosure or reporting requirements. </font></p>

</font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Because company disclosure is critical when measuring the mix of diverse attributes and skills of directors, Glass Lewis assesses the
quality of such disclosure in companies’ proxy statements. Accordingly, we reflect how a company’s proxy statement presents: (i) the board’s current percentage of racial/ethnic diversity; (ii) whether the board’s
definition of diversity explicitly includes gender and/or race/ethnicity; (iii) whether the board has adopted a policy requiring women and minorities to be included in the initial pool of candidates when selecting new director nominees (aka
“Rooney Rule”); and (iv) board skills disclosure. Such ratings will help inform our assessment of a company’s overall governance and may be a contributing factor in our recommendations when additional board-related concerns have
been identified. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">At companies in the Russell 1000 index that have not provided any disclosure in any of the above categories, we will

</a>Stock Exchange Diversity Disclosure Requirements </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">On August 6, 2021, the SEC approved new listing rules regarding board
diversity and disclosure for Nasdaq-listed companies. Beginning in 2022, companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange are required to disclose certain board diversity statistics annually in a standardized format in the proxy statement or on the
company’s website. Nasdaq-listed companies are required to provide this disclosure by the later of (i) August 8, 2022, or (ii) the date the company files its proxy statement for its 2022 annual meeting. Accordingly, for annual
meetings held after August 8, 2022, of applicable Nasdaq-listed companies, we will recommend voting against the chair of the governance committee when the required disclosure has not been provided. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_39"></a>Proxy Access </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">In lieu of running their own contested election, proxy access would not only allow certain shareholders to nominate directors to company boards but the shareholder nominees would be included on the company’s ballot,
significantly enhancing the ability of shareholders to play a meaningful role in selecting their representatives. Glass Lewis generally supports affording shareholders the right to nominate director candidates to management’s proxy as a means
to ensure that significant, long-term shareholders have an ability to nominate candidates to the board. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Companies generally seek
shareholder approval to amend company bylaws to adopt proxy access in response to shareholder engagement or pressure, usually in the form of a shareholder proposal requesting proxy access, although some companies may adopt some elements of proxy
access without prompting. Glass Lewis considers several factors when evaluating whether to support proposals for companies to adopt proxy access including the specified minimum ownership and holding requirement for shareholders to nominate one or
more directors, as well as company size, performance and responsiveness to shareholders. </font></p> <p> </p>

<p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_40"></a>Majority Vote for Election of Directors </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Majority voting for the election of directors is fast becoming the de facto standard in corporate board elections. In our view, the majority
voting proposals are an effort to make the case for shareholder impact on director elections on a company-specific basis. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">While this
proposal would not give shareholders the opportunity to nominate directors or lead to elections where shareholders have a choice among director candidates, if implemented, the proposal would allow shareholders to have a voice in determining whether
the nominees proposed by the board should actually serve as the overseer-representatives of shareholders in the boardroom. We believe this would be a favorable outcome for shareholders. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">The number of shareholder proposals requesting that companies adopt a majority voting standard has declined significantly during the past decade,
largely as a result of widespread adoption of majority voting or director resignation policies at U.S. companies. In 2019, 89% of the S&amp;P 500 Index had implemented a resignation policy for directors failing to receive majority shareholder
support, compared to 65% in 2009.<sup>40</sup> </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_41"></a>The Plurality Vote
Standard </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Today, most U.S. companies still elect directors by a plurality vote standard. Under that standard, if one shareholder
holding only one share votes in favor of a nominee (including that director, if the director is a shareholder), that nominee “wins” the election and assumes a seat on the board. The common concern among companies with a plurality voting
standard is the possibility that one or more directors would not receive a majority of votes, resulting in “failed elections.” </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_42"></a>Advantages of a Majority Vote Standard </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">If a majority vote standard were implemented, a
nominee would have to receive the support of a majority of the shares voted in order to be elected. Thus, shareholders could collectively vote to reject a director they believe will not pursue their best interests. Given that so few directors (less
than 100 a year) do not receive majority support from shareholders, we think that a majority vote standard is reasonable since it will neither result in many failed director elections nor reduce the willingness of qualified, shareholder-focused
directors to serve in the future. Further, most directors who fail to receive a majority shareholder vote in favor of their election do not step down, underscoring the need for true majority voting. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">We believe that a majority vote standard will likely lead to more attentive directors. Although shareholders only rarely fail to support
directors, the occasional majority vote against a director’s election will likely deter the election of directors with a record of ignoring shareholder interests. Glass Lewis will therefore generally support proposals calling for the election
of directors by a majority vote, excepting contested director elections. </font></p> <p> </p>

</p> <p> </p> <p><font color="#565656">In response to the high level of support
majority voting has garnered, many companies have voluntarily taken steps to implement majority voting or modified approaches to majority voting. These steps range from a modified approach requiring directors that receive a majority of withheld
votes to resign (i.e., a resignation policy) to actually requiring a majority vote of outstanding shares to elect directors. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">We feel
that the modified approach does not go far enough because requiring a director to resign is not the same as requiring a majority vote to elect a director and does not allow shareholders a definitive voice in the election process. Further, under the
modified approach, the corporate governance committee could reject a resignation and, even if it accepts the resignation, the corporate governance committee decides on the director’s replacement. And since the modified approach is usually
adopted as a policy by the board or a board committee, it could be altered by the same board or committee at any time. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_43">
</a>Conflicting and Excluded Proposals </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">SEC Rule <font>14a-8(i)(9)</font> allows companies to exclude
shareholder proposals “if the proposal directly conflicts with one of the company’s own proposals to be submitted to shareholders at the same meeting.” On October 22, 2015, the SEC issued Staff Legal Bulletin No. 14H (SLB 14H)
clarifying its rule concerning the exclusion of certain shareholder proposals when similar items are also on the ballot. SLB 14H increased the burden on companies to prove to SEC staff that a conflict exists; therefore, many companies still chose to
place management proposals alongside similar shareholder proposals in many cases. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">During the 2018 proxy season, a new trend in the
SEC’s interpretation of this rule emerged. Upon submission of shareholder proposals requesting that companies adopt a lower special meeting threshold, several companies petitioned the SEC for <font>no-action</font>
relief under the premise that the shareholder proposals conflicted with management’s own special meeting proposals, even though the management proposals set a higher threshold than those requested by the proponent. <font>No-action</font> relief was granted to these companies; however, the SEC stipulated that the companies must state in the rationale for the management proposals that a vote in favor of management’s proposal was
tantamount to a vote against the adoption of a lower special meeting threshold. In certain instances, shareholder proposals to lower an existing special meeting right threshold were excluded on the basis that they conflicted with management
proposals seeking to ratify the existing special meeting rights. We find the exclusion of these shareholder proposals to be especially problematic as, in these instances, shareholders are not offered any enhanced shareholder right, nor would the
approval (or rejection) of the ratification proposal initiate any type of meaningful change to shareholders’ rights. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">In instances
where companies have excluded shareholder proposals, such as those instances where special meeting shareholder proposals are excluded as a result of “conflicting” management proposals, Glass Lewis will take a

long-term interests of shareholders, and value and respect the limitations placed on shareholder proponents, as certain shareholder proposals can unduly burden companies. However, Glass Lewis believes that shareholders should be able to vote on
issues of material importance. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">We view the shareholder proposal process as an important part of advancing shareholder rights and
encouraging responsible and financially sustainable business practices. While recognizing that certain proposals cross the line between the purview of shareholders and that of the board, we generally believe that companies should not limit
investors’ ability to vote on shareholder proposals that advance certain rights or promote beneficial disclosure. Accordingly, Glass Lewis will make note of instances where a company has successfully petitioned the SEC to exclude shareholder
proposals. If after review we believe that the exclusion of a shareholder proposal is detrimental to shareholders, we may, in certain very limited circumstances, recommend against members of the governance committee. </font></p>

and Integrity in Financial Reporting </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_45"></a>Auditor Ratification </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">The auditor’s role as gatekeeper is crucial in ensuring the integrity and transparency of the financial information necessary for protecting
shareholder value. Shareholders rely on the auditor to ask tough questions and to do a thorough analysis of a company’s books to ensure that the information provided to shareholders is complete, accurate, fair, and that it is a reasonable
representation of a company’s financial position. The only way shareholders can make rational investment decisions is if the market is equipped with accurate information about a company’s fiscal health. As stated in the October 6,
2008 Final Report of the Advisory Committee on the Auditing Profession to the U.S. Department of the Treasury: </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656"><i>“The auditor is expected to offer critical and objective judgment on the financial matters under consideration, and actual
and perceived absence of conflicts is critical to that expectation. The Committee believes that auditors, investors, public companies, and other market participants must understand the independence requirements and their objectives, and that
auditors must adopt a mindset of skepticism when facing situations that may compromise their independence.” </i></font></p> <p><font color="#565656">As such,
shareholders should demand an objective, competent and diligent auditor who performs at or above professional standards at every company in which the investors hold an interest. Like directors, auditors should be free from conflicts of interest and
should avoid situations requiring a choice between the auditor’s interests and the public’s interests. Almost without exception, shareholders should be able to annually review an auditor’s performance and to annually ratify a
board’s auditor selection. Moreover, in October 2008, the Advisory Committee on the Auditing Profession went even further, and recommended that “to further enhance audit committee oversight and auditor accountability ... disclosure in the
company proxy statement regarding shareholder ratification [should] include the name(s) of the senior auditing partner(s) staffed on the engagement.”<sup>41</sup> </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">On August 16, 2011, the PCAOB issued a Concept Release seeking public comment on ways that auditor independence, objectivity and professional
skepticism could be enhanced, with a specific emphasis on mandatory audit firm rotation. The PCAOB convened several public roundtable meetings during 2012 to further discuss such matters. Glass Lewis believes auditor rotation can ensure both the
independence of the auditor and the integrity of the audit; we will typically recommend supporting proposals to require auditor rotation when the proposal uses a reasonable period of time (usually not less than
<font>5-7</font> years), particularly at companies with a history of accounting problems. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">On June 1,
2017, the PCAOB adopted new standards to enhance auditor reports by providing additional important information to investors. For companies with fiscal year end dates on or after December 15, 2017, reports were required to include the year in
which the auditor began serving consecutively as the company’s auditor. For large accelerated filers with fiscal year ends of June 30, 2019 or later, and for all other companies with fiscal year ends of December 15, 2020 or later,
communication of critical audit matters (CAMs) will also be required. CAMs are matters that have been communicated to the audit committee, are related to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements, and involve especially
challenging, subjective, or complex auditor judgment. </font></p> <p> </p>

Accounting Issues </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">A pension accounting question occasionally raised in proxy proposals is what effect, if any, projected returns on

to award performance-based compensation. Because many of the assumptions used in accounting for retirement plans are subject to the company’s discretion, management would have an obvious conflict of interest if pay were tied to pension income.
In our view, projected income from pensions does not truly reflect a company’s performance. </font></p>

Between Compensation and Performance </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis carefully reviews the compensation awarded to senior executives, as we believe that
this is an important area in which the board’s priorities are revealed. Glass Lewis strongly believes executive compensation should be linked directly with the performance of the business the executive is charged with managing. We believe the
most effective compensation arrangements provide for an appropriate mix of performance-based short- and long-term incentives in addition to fixed pay elements while promoting a prudent and sustainable level of risk-taking. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis believes that comprehensive, timely and transparent disclosure of executive pay is critical to allowing shareholders to evaluate the
extent to which pay is aligned with company performance. When reviewing proxy materials, Glass Lewis examines whether the company discloses the performance metrics used to determine executive compensation. We recognize performance metrics must
necessarily vary depending on the company and industry, among other factors, and may include a wide variety of financial measures as well as industry-specific performance indicators. However, we believe companies should disclose why the specific
performance metrics were selected and how the actions they are designed to incentivize will lead to better corporate performance. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Moreover, it is rarely in shareholders’ interests to disclose competitive data about individual salaries below the senior executive level.
Such disclosure could create internal personnel discord that would be counterproductive for the company and its shareholders. While we favor full disclosure for senior executives and we view pay disclosure at the aggregate level (e.g., the number of
employees being paid over a certain amount or in certain categories) as potentially useful, we do not believe shareholders need or will benefit from detailed reports about individual management employees other than the most senior executives.

practice of allowing shareholders a <font>non-binding</font> vote on a company’s compensation report is standard practice in many <font>non-U.S.</font> countries, and has been a requirement
for most companies in the United Kingdom since 2003 and in Australia since 2005. Although <font><font>say-on-pay</font></font> proposals are <font>non-binding,</font> a
high level of “against” or “abstain” votes indicates substantial shareholder concern about a company’s compensation policies and procedures. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Given the complexity of most companies’ compensation programs, Glass Lewis applies a highly nuanced approach when analyzing advisory votes on
executive compensation. We review each company’s compensation on a <font><font>case-by-case</font></font> basis, recognizing that each company must be examined in the context of industry,
size, maturity, performance, financial condition, its historic pay for performance practices, and any other relevant internal or external factors. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">We believe that each company should design and apply specific compensation policies and practices that are appropriate to the circumstances of the company and, in particular, will attract and retain competent executives and other
staff, while motivating them to grow the company’s long-term shareholder value. </font></p>

compensation program with some concerns and a “Poor” rating represents a compensation program that deviates significantly from best practice or contains one or more egregious compensation practices. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">We believe that it is important for companies to provide investors with clear and complete disclosure of all the significant terms of compensation
arrangements. Similar to structure, we evaluate disclosure on a “Good, Fair, Poor” rating scale whereby a “Good” rating represents a thorough discussion of all elements of compensation, a “Fair” rating represents an
adequate discussion of all or most elements of compensation and a “Poor” rating represents an incomplete or absent discussion of compensation. In instances where a company has simply failed to provide sufficient disclosure of its policies,
we may recommend shareholders vote against this proposal solely on this basis, regardless of the appropriateness of compensation levels. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">In general, most companies will fall within the “Fair” range for both structure and disclosure, and Glass Lewis largely uses the “Good” and “Poor” ratings to highlight outliers. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Where we identify egregious compensation practices, we may also recommend voting against the compensation committee based on the practices or
actions of its members during the year. Such practices may include approving large <font>one-off</font> payments, the inappropriate, unjustified use of discretion, or sustained poor pay for performance practices. (Refer to
the section on “Compensation Committee Performance” for more information.) </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_51"></a>Company Responsiveness
</font></p> <p><font color="#565656">When companies receive a significant level of shareholder opposition to a <font><font>say-on-pay</font></font> proposal, which occurs when more than 20% of votes on the proposal are cast as AGAINST and/or ABSTAIN. we believe the board should demonstrate a commensurate level of engagement and responsiveness
to the concerns behind the disapproval, with a particular focus on responding to shareholder feedback. When assessing the level of opposition to <font><font>say-on-pay</font></font> proposals, we
may further examine the level of opposition among disinterested shareholders as an independent group. While we recognize that sweeping changes cannot be made to a compensation program without due consideration, and that often a majority of
shareholders may have voted in favor of the proposal, given that the average approval rate for <font><font>say-on-pay</font></font> proposals is about 90%, we believe the compensation committee
should provide some level of response to a significant vote against. In general, our expectations regarding the minimum appropriate levels of responsiveness will correspond with the level of shareholder opposition, as expressed both through the
magnitude of opposition in a single year, and through the persistence of shareholder disapproval over time. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Responses we consider
appropriate include engaging with large shareholders, especially dissenting shareholders, to identify their concerns, and, where reasonable, implementing changes and/or making commitments that directly address those concerns within the
company’s compensation program. In cases where particularly egregious pay decisions caused the say on pay proposal to fail, Glass Lewis will closely consider whether any changes were made directly relating to the pay decision that may address
structural concerns that shareholders have. In the absence of any evidence in the disclosure that the board is actively engaging shareholders on these issues and responding accordingly, we may recommend holding compensation committee members
accountable for failing to adequately respond to shareholder opposition. Regarding such recommendations, careful consideration will be given to the level of shareholder protest and the severity and history of compensation practices. </font></p>

Performance </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis believes an integral part of a well-structured compensation package is a successful link between pay and
performance. Our proprietary <font><font>pay-for-performance</font></font> model was developed to better evaluate the link between pay and performance. Generally, compensation and performance are
measured against a peer group of appropriate companies that may overlap, to a certain extent, with a company’s self-disclosed peers. This quantitative analysis provides a consistent framework and historical context for our clients to determine
how well companies link executive compensation to relative performance. Companies that demonstrate a weaker link are more likely to receive a negative recommendation; however, other qualitative factors such as overall incentive structure,
significant forthcoming changes to the compensation program or reasonable long-term payout levels may mitigate our concerns to a certain extent. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">While we assign companies a letter grade of A, B, C, D or F based on the alignment between pay and performance, the grades derived from the Glass Lewis
<font><font>pay-for-performance</font></font> analysis do not follow the traditional U.S. school letter grade system. Rather, the grades are generally interpreted as follows: </font></p>
<p> </p>
<table>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <p><font color="#565656"><b>Grade of A</b>:</font></p></td>
<td> </td>
<td><font color="#565656">The company’s percentile rank for pay is significantly less than its percentile rank for performance</font></td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <p><font color="#565656"><b>Grade of B</b>:</font></p></td>
<td> </td>
<td><font color="#565656">The company’s percentile rank for pay is moderately less than its percentile rank for performance</font></td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <p><font color="#565656"><b>Grade of C</b>:</font></p></td>
<td> </td>
<td><font color="#565656">The company’s percentile rank for pay is approximately aligned with its percentile rank for performance</font></td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <p><font color="#565656"><b>Grade of D</b>:</font></p></td>
<td> </td>
<td><font color="#565656">The company’s percentile rank for pay is higher than its percentile rank for performance</font></td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <p><font color="#565656"><b>Grade of F</b>:</font></p></td>
<td> </td>
<td><font color="#565656">The company’s percentile rank for pay is significantly higher than its percentile rank for performance</font></td></tr>
</table> <p><font color="#565656">Separately, a specific comparison between the company’s executive pay and its peers’ executive pay
levels may be discussed in the analysis for additional insight into the grade. Likewise, a specific comparison between the company’s performance and its peers’ performance is reflected in the analysis for further context. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">We also use this analysis to inform our voting decisions on
<font><font>say-on-pay</font></font> proposals. As such, if a company receives a “D” or “F” from our proprietary model, we are more likely to recommend that shareholders vote
against the <font><font>say-on-pay</font></font> proposal. However, supplemental quantitative factors like analyses of realized pay levels and the “compensation actually paid” data
mandated by the SEC’s 2022 final rule regarding pay versus performance may be considered, and other qualitative factors such as an effective overall incentive structure, the relevance of selected performance metrics, significant forthcoming
enhancements or reasonable long-term payout levels may give us cause to recommend in favor of a proposal even when we have identified a disconnect between pay and performance. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">In determining the peer groups used in our <font>A-F</font> <font><font>pay-for-performance</font></font> letter grades, Glass Lewis utilizes a proprietary methodology that considers both market and industry peers, along with each company’s network of self-disclosed peers. Each component
is considered on a weighted basis and is subject to <font>size-based</font> ranking and screening. The peer groups used are provided to Glass Lewis by Diligent Intel based on Glass Lewis’ methodology and using
Diligent Intel’s data. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Selecting an appropriate peer group to analyze a company’s compensation program is a subjective
determination, requiring significant judgment and on which there is not a “correct” answer. Since the peer group used is based on an independent, proprietary technique, it will often differ from the one used by the company which, in turn,
will affect the resulting analyses. While Glass Lewis believes that the independent, rigorous methodology it uses provides a valuable perspective on the company’s compensation program, the company’s self-selected peer group may also
presented in the Proxy Paper for comparative purposes. </font></p>

</p> <p> </p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_53"></a>Short-Term
Incentives </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">A short-term bonus or incentive (STI) should be demonstrably tied to performance. Whenever possible, we believe a mix of
corporate and individual performance measures is appropriate. We would normally expect performance measures for STI plans to be based on company-wide or divisional financial measures as well as <font>non-financial,</font>
qualitative or <font>non-formulaic</font> factors such as those related to safety, environmental issues, and customer satisfaction. While we recognize that companies operating in different sectors or markets may seek to
utilize a wide range of metrics, we expect such measures to be appropriately tied to a company’s business drivers. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Further, the
threshold, target and maximum performance goals and corresponding payout levels that can be achieved under STI plans should be disclosed. Shareholders should expect stretching performance targets for the maximum award to be achieved. Any increase in
the potential target and maximum award should be clearly justified to shareholders, as should any decrease in target and maximum performance levels from the previous year. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis recognizes that disclosure of some measures or performance targets may include commercially confidential information. Therefore, we
believe it may be reasonable to exclude such information in some cases as long as the company provides sufficient justification for <font>non-disclosure.</font> However, where a short-term bonus has been paid, companies
should disclose the extent to which performance has been achieved against relevant targets, including disclosure of the actual target achieved. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Where management has received significant short-term incentive payments but overall performance and/or the shareholder experience over the measurement year prima facie appears to be poor or negative, we believe the company should
provide a clear explanation of why these significant short-term payments were made. We also believe any significant changes to the program structure should be accompanied by rationalizing disclosure. Further, where a company has applied upward
discretion, which includes lowering goals <font>mid-year,</font> increasing calculated payouts or retroactively <font>pro-rating</font> performance periods, we expect a robust discussion of why
the decision was necessary. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">In addition, we believe that where companies use <font>non-GAAP</font> or
bespoke metrics, clear reconciliations between these figures and GAAP figures in audited financial statements should be provided. Adjustments to GAAP figures may be considered in Glass Lewis’ assessment of the effectiveness of the incentive at
tying executive pay with performance. Moreover, Glass Lewis believes that in circumstances where significant adjustments were applied to performance results, thorough, detailed discussion of adjustments akin to a <font><font><font>GAAP-to-non-GAAP</font></font></font> reconciliation and their impact on payouts within the proxy statement is warranted. The absence of such enhanced disclosure for significant adjustments
will impact Glass Lewis’ assessment of the quality of disclosure and, in turn, may play a role in the overall recommendation for the advisory vote on executive compensation. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis recognizes the importance of the compensation committee’s judicious and responsible exercise of discretion over incentive pay
outcomes to account for significant, material events that would otherwise be excluded from performance results of selected metrics of incentive programs. For instance, major litigation settlement charges may be removed from <font>non-GAAP</font> results before the determination of formulaic incentive payouts, or health and safety failures may not be reflected in performance results where companies do not expressly include health and safety metrics
in incentive plans; such events may nevertheless be consequential to corporate performance results, impact the shareholder experience, and, in some cases, may present material risks. Conversely, certain events may adversely impact formulaic payout
results despite being outside executives’ control. We believe that companies should provide thorough discussion of how such events were considered in the committee’s decisions to exercise discretion or refrain from applying discretion over
incentive pay outcomes. The inclusion of this disclosure may be helpful when we consider concerns around the exercise or absence of committee discretion. </font></p>

</p> <p> </p> <p><font color="#565656">We do not generally recommend against a
pay program due to the use of a <font>non-formulaic</font> plan. If a company has chosen to rely primarily on a subjective assessment or the board’s discretion in determining short-term bonuses, we believe that the
proxy statement should provide a meaningful discussion of the board’s rationale in determining the bonuses paid as well as a rationale for the use of a <font>non-formulaic</font> mechanism. Particularly where the
aforementioned disclosures are substantial and satisfactory, such a structure will not provoke serious concern in our analysis on its own. However, in conjunction with other significant issues in a program’s design or operation, such as a
disconnect between pay and performance, the absence of a cap on payouts, or a lack of performance-based long-term awards, the use of a <font>non-formulaic</font> bonus may help drive a negative recommendation. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_54"></a>Long-Term Incentives </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis recognizes the value of equity-based incentive programs, which are often the primary long-term incentive for executives. When used appropriately, they can provide a vehicle for linking an executive’s pay to company
performance, thereby aligning their interests with those of shareholders. In addition, equity-based compensation can be an effective way to attract, retain and motivate key employees. </font></p>

<p><font color="#565656">In evaluating long-term incentive grants, Glass Lewis generally believes that at least half of the grant should consist of performance-based
awards, putting a material portion of executive compensation <font>at-risk</font> and demonstrably linked to the performance of the company. While we will consistently raise concern with programs that do not meet this
criterion, we may refrain from a negative recommendation in the absence of other significant issues with the program’s design or operation. However, in cases where performance-based awards are significantly rolled back or eliminated from a
company’s long-term incentive plan, such decisions will generally be viewed negatively outside of exceptional circumstances and may lead to a recommendation against the proposal. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">As with the short-term incentive, Glass Lewis recognizes the importance of the compensation committee’s judicious and responsible exercise of
discretion over incentive pay outcomes to account for significant events that would otherwise be excluded from performance results of selected metrics of incentive programs. We believe that companies should provide thorough discussion of how such
events were considered in the committee’s decisions to exercise discretion or refrain from applying discretion over incentive pay outcomes. Furthermore, considerations related to the use of <font>non-GAAP</font>
metrics under the STI plan similarly apply to the long-term incentive program. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Performance measures should be carefully selected and
should relate to the specific business/industry in which the company operates and, especially, to the key value drivers of the company’s business. As with short-term incentive plans, the basis for any adjustments to metrics or results should be
clearly explained, as should the company’s judgment on the use of discretion and any significant changes to the performance program structure. </font></p>

</p> <p> </p> <p><font color="#565656">While cognizant of the inherent
complexity of certain performance metrics, Glass Lewis generally believes that measuring a company’s performance with multiple metrics serves to provide a more complete picture of the company’s performance than a single metric. Further,
reliance on just one metric may focus too much management attention on a single target and is therefore more susceptible to manipulation. When utilized for relative measurements, external benchmarks such as a sector index or peer group should be
disclosed and transparent. The rationale behind the selection of a specific index or peer group should also be disclosed. Internal performance benchmarks should also be disclosed and transparent, unless a cogent case for confidentiality is made and
fully explained. Similarly, actual performance and vesting levels for previous grants earned during the fiscal year should be disclosed. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">We also believe shareholders should evaluate the relative success of a company’s compensation programs, particularly with regard to existing equity-based incentive plans, in linking pay and performance when evaluating potential
changes to LTI plans and determining the impact of additional stock awards. We will therefore review the company’s <font><font>pay-for-performance</font></font> grade (see above for more
information) and specifically the proportion of total compensation that is stock-based. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_55"></a>Grants of
Front-Loaded Awards </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Many U.S. companies have chosen to provide large grants, usually in the form of equity awards, that are intended
to serve as compensation for multiple years. This practice, often called front-loading, is taken up either in the regular course of business or as a response to specific business conditions and with a predetermined objective. The <font>so-called</font> “mega-grant”, an outsized award to one individual sometimes valued at over $100 million is sometimes but not always provided as a front-loaded award. We believe shareholders should generally
be wary of this approach, and we accordingly weigh these grants with particular scrutiny. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">While the use of front-loaded awards is
intended to <font>lock-in</font> executive service and incentives, the same rigidity also raises the risk of effectively tying the hands of the compensation committee. As compared with a more responsive annual granting
schedule program, front-loaded awards may preclude improvements or changes to reflect evolving business strategies or to respond to other unforeseen factors. Additionally, if structured poorly, early vesting of such awards may reduce or eliminate
the retentive power at great cost to shareholders. The considerable emphasis on a single grant can place intense pressures on every facet of its design, amplifying any potential perverse incentives and creating greater room for unintended
consequences. In particular, provisions around changes of control or separations of service must ensure that executives do not receive excessive payouts that do not reflect shareholder experience or company performance. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">We consider a company’s rationale for granting awards under this structure and also expect any front-loaded awards to include a firm
commitment not to grant additional awards for a defined period, as is commonly associated with this practice. Even when such a commitment is provided, unexpected circumstances may lead the board to make additional payments or awards for retention
purposes, or to incentivize management towards more realistic goals or a revised strategy. If a company breaks its commitment not to grant further awards, we may recommend against the pay program unless a convincing rationale is provided. In
situations where the front-loaded award was meant to cover a certain portion of the regular long-term incentive grant for each year during the covered period, our analysis of the value of the remaining portion of the regular long-term incentives
granted during the period covered by the award will account for the annualized value of the front-loaded portion, and we expect no supplemental grant be awarded during the vesting period of the front-loaded portion. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">The multiyear nature of these awards generally lends itself to significantly higher compensation figures in the year of grant than might otherwise
be expected. In our qualitative analysis of the grants of front-loaded awards to executives, Glass Lewis considers the quantum of the award on an annualized basis and may compare this result to the prior practice and peer data, among other
benchmarks. Additionally, for awards that are granted in the form of equity, Glass Lewis may consider the total potential dilutive effect of such award on shareholders. </font></p>

Executive Pay to Environmental and Social Criteria </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis believes that explicit environmental and/or social (E&amp;S) criteria
in executive incentive plans, when used appropriately, can serve to provide both executives and shareholders a clear line of sight into a company’s ESG strategy, ambitions, and targets. Although we are strongly supportive of companies’
incorporation of material E&amp;S risks and opportunities in their long-term strategic planning, we believe that the inclusion of E&amp;S metrics in compensation programs should be predicated on each company’s unique circumstances. In order to
establish a meaningful link between pay and performance, companies must consider factors including their industry, size, risk profile, maturity, performance, financial condition, and any other relevant internal or external factors. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">When a company is introducing E&amp;S criteria into executive incentive plans, we believe it is important that companies provide shareholders with
sufficient disclosure to allow them to understand how these criteria align with its strategy. Additionally, Glass Lewis recognizes that there may be situations where certain E&amp;S performance criteria are reasonably viewed as prerequisites for
executive performance, as opposed to behaviors and conditions that need to be incentivized. For example, we believe that shareholders should interrogate the use of metrics that award executives for ethical behavior or compliance with policies and
regulations. It is our view that companies should provide shareholders with disclosures that clearly lay out the rationale for selecting specific E&amp;S metrics, the target-setting process, and corresponding payout opportunities. Further,
particularly in the case of qualitative metrics, we believe that shareholders should be provided with a clear understanding of the basis on which the criteria will be assessed. Where quantitative targets have been set, we believe that shareholders
are best served when these are disclosed on an <font>ex-ante</font> basis, or the board should outline why it believes it is unable to do so. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">While we believe that companies should generally set long-term targets for their environmental and social ambitions, we are mindful that not all
compensation schemes lend themselves to the inclusion of E&amp;S metrics. We also are of the view that companies should retain flexibility in not only choosing to incorporate E&amp;S metrics in their compensation plans, but also in the placement of
these metrics. For example, some companies may resolve that including E&amp;S criteria in the annual bonus may help to incentivize the achievement of short-term milestones and allow for more maneuverability in strategic adjustments to long-term
goals. Other companies may determine that their long-term sustainability targets are best achieved by incentivizing executives through metrics included in their long-term incentive plans. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_57"></a><font>One-Time</font> Awards </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis believes shareholders should generally be wary of awards granted outside of the standard incentive schemes, as such awards have the
potential to undermine the integrity of a company’s regular incentive plans or the link between pay and performance, or both. We generally believe that if the existing incentive programs fail to provide adequate incentives to executives,
companies should redesign their compensation programs rather than make additional grants. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">However, we recognize that in certain
circumstances, additional incentives may be appropriate. In these cases, companies should provide a thorough description of the awards, including a cogent and convincing explanation of their necessity and why existing awards do not provide
sufficient motivation and a discussion of how the quantum of the award and its structure were determined. Further, such awards should be tied to future service and performance whenever possible. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Additionally, we believe companies making supplemental or <font>one-time</font> awards should also describe if and how
the regular compensation arrangements will be affected by these additional grants. In reviewing a company’s use of supplemental awards, Glass Lewis will evaluate the terms and size of the grants in the context of the company’s overall
incentive strategy and granting practices, as well as the current operating environment. </font></p>

transitions at the executive level. In evaluating the size of severance and <font>sign-on</font> arrangements, we may consider the executive’s regular target compensation level, or the sums paid to other executives
(including the recipient’s predecessor, where applicable) in evaluating the appropriateness of such an arrangement. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">We believe <font>sign-on</font> arrangements should be clearly disclosed and accompanied by a meaningful explanation of the payments and the process by which the amounts were reached. Further, the details of and basis for any
“make-whole” payments (paid as compensation for awards forfeited from a previous employer) should be provided. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">With respect
to severance, we believe companies should abide by predetermined payouts in most circumstances. While in limited circumstances some deviations may not be inappropriate, we believe shareholders should be provided with a meaningful explanation of any
additional or increased benefits agreed upon outside of regular arrangements. However, where Glass Lewis determines that such predetermined payouts are particularly problematic or unfavorable to shareholders, we may consider the execution of such
payments in a negative recommendation for the advisory vote on executive compensation. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">In the U.S. market, most companies maintain
severance entitlements based on a multiple of salary and, in many cases, bonus. In almost all instances we see, the relevant multiple is three or less, even in the case of a change in control. We believe the basis and total value of severance should
be reasonable and should not exceed the upper limit of general market practice. We consider the inclusion of long-term incentives in cash severance calculations to be inappropriate, particularly given the commonality of accelerated vesting and the
proportional weight of long-term incentives as a component of total pay. Additional considerations, however, will be accounted for when reviewing atypically structured compensation approaches. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_60"></a>Change in Control </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis considers double-trigger change in control arrangements, which require both a change in control and termination or constructive termination, to be best practice. Any arrangement that is not explicitly double-trigger may
be considered a single-trigger or modified single-trigger arrangement. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Further, we believe that excessively broad definitions of
change in control are potentially problematic as they may lead to situations where executives receive additional compensation where no meaningful change in status or duties has occurred. </font></p>

We believe that under no normal circumstance is the inclusion of excise tax <font>gross-up</font> provisions in new agreements or the addition of such provisions to amended agreements acceptable. In consideration of the fact that minor increases in <font><font>change-in-control</font></font> payments can lead to disproportionately large excise taxes, the potential negative impact of tax <font>gross-ups</font> far outweighs any retentive benefit.
</font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Depending on the circumstances, the addition of new <font>gross-ups</font> around this excise tax may lead
to negative recommendations for a company’s <font><font>say-on-pay</font></font> proposal, the chair of the compensation committee, or the entire committee, particularly in cases where a
company had committed not to provide any such entitlements in the future. For situations in which the addition of new excise tax gross ups will be provided in connection with a specific
<font><font>change-in-control</font></font> transaction, this policy may be applied to the <font><font>say-on-pay</font></font> proposal, the
golden parachute proposal and recommendations related to the compensation committee for all involved corporate parties, as appropriate. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_62"></a>Amended Employment Agreements </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Any contractual arrangements providing for problematic pay practices which are not addressed in materially amended employment agreements will
potentially be viewed by Glass Lewis as a missed opportunity on the part of the company to align its policies with current best practices. Such problematic pay practices include, but are not limited to, excessive change in control entitlements,
modified single-trigger change in control entitlements, excise tax <font>gross-ups,</font> and multi-year guaranteed awards. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_63"></a>Recoupment Provisions (Clawbacks) </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">On October 26, 2022, the SEC adopted Rule <font>10D-1</font> under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The rule mandates national securities exchanges and associations to promulgate new listing standards requiring companies to maintain recoupment policies
(“clawback provisions”). The final clawback listing standards were approved by the SEC, effective October 2, 2023 and required listed companies to adopt a compliant policy by December 1, 2023. Glass Lewis believes that clawback
provisions play an important role in mitigating excessive risk-taking that may be encouraged by poorly structured variable incentive programs. Current listing standards require recoupment of erroneously awarded payouts to current and former
executive officers in the event of an accounting restatement or correction to previous financial statements that is material to the current period, regardless of fault or misconduct. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis recognizes that excessive risk-taking that can materially and adversely impact shareholders may not necessarily result in such
restatements. We believe that clawback policies should allow recovery from current and former executive officers in the event of a restatement of financial results or similar revision of performance indicators upon which the awards were based.
Additionally, recoupment policies should provide companies with the ability to claw back variable incentive payments (whether time-based or performance-based) when there is evidence of problematic decisions or actions, such as material
misconduct, a material reputational failure, material risk management failure, or a material operational failure, the consequences of which have not already been reflected in incentive payments and where recovery is warranted. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">In situations where the company ultimately determines not to follow through with recovery, Glass Lewis will assess the appropriateness of such
determination for each case. A thorough, detailed discussion of the company’s decision to not pursue recoupment and, if applicable, how the company has otherwise rectified the disconnect between executive pay outcomes and negative impacts of
their actions on the company and the shareholder experience will be considered. The absence of such enhanced disclosure may impact Glass Lewis’ </font></p>

terminated with or without cause. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_64"></a>Hedging of Stock </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis believes that the hedging of shares by executives in the shares of the companies where they are employed severs the alignment of
interests of the executive with shareholders. We believe companies should adopt strict policies to prohibit executives from hedging the economic risk associated with their share ownership in the company. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_65"></a>Pledging of Stock </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis believes that shareholders should examine the facts and circumstances of each company rather than apply a
<font><font><font>one-size-fits-all</font></font></font> policy regarding employee stock pledging. Glass Lewis believes that shareholders benefit when employees,
particularly senior executives, have meaningful financial interest in the success of the company under their management, and therefore we recognize the benefits of measures designed to encourage employees to both buy shares out of their own pocket
and to retain shares they have been granted; blanket policies prohibiting stock pledging may discourage executives and employees from doing either. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">However, we also recognize that the pledging of shares can present a risk that, depending on a host of factors, an executive with significant pledged shares and limited other assets may have an incentive to take steps to avoid a
forced sale of shares in the face of a rapid stock price decline. Therefore, to avoid substantial losses from a forced sale to meet the terms of the loan, the executive may have an incentive to boost the stock price in the short term in a manner
that is unsustainable, thus hurting shareholders in the long-term. We also recognize concerns regarding pledging may not apply to less senior employees, given the latter group’s significantly more limited influence over a company’s stock
price. Therefore, we believe that the issue of pledging shares should be reviewed in that context, as should policies that distinguish between the two groups. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis believes that the benefits of stock ownership by executives and employees may outweigh the risks of stock pledging, depending on many
factors. As such, Glass Lewis reviews all relevant factors in evaluating proposed policies, limitations and prohibitions on pledging stock, including: </font></p> <p> </p>

Ownership Guidelines </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The alignment between shareholder interests and those of executives represents an important assurance to
disinterested shareholders that executives are acting in their best long-term interests. Companies should facilitate this relationship through the adoption and enforcement of minimum executive share ownership requirements. Companies should clearly
disclose their executive ownership requirements in their Compensation Discussion and Analysis section and how the various types of outstanding equity awards are counted or excluded from the ownership level calculation. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">In determining whether executives have met the requirements or not, the inclusion of unearned performance-based full value awards and/or
unexercised stock options without cogent rationale may be viewed as problematic. While Glass Lewis views the inclusion of unearned performance-based equity in the ownership determination as problematic, we continue to believe that performance-based
equity compensation plays an important role in aligning executive pay with performance. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_67"></a>Compensation
Consultant Independence </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">As mandated by Section 952 of the Dodd-Frank Act, as of January 11, 2013, the SEC approved listing
requirements for both the NYSE and NASDAQ which require compensation committees to consider six factors <font>(https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2012/33-9330.pdf,</font> <font>p.31-32)</font> in
assessing compensation advisor independence. According to the SEC, “no one factor should be viewed as a determinative factor.” Glass Lewis believes this <font>six-factor</font> assessment is an important process
for every compensation committee to undertake but believes companies employing a consultant for board compensation, consulting and other corporate services should provide clear disclosure beyond just a reference to examining the six points, in order
to allow shareholders to review the specific aspects of the various consultant relationships. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">We believe compensation consultants are
engaged to provide objective, disinterested, expert advice to the compensation committee. When the consultant or its affiliates receive substantial income from providing other services to the company, we believe the potential for a conflict of
interest arises and the independence of the consultant may be jeopardized. Therefore, Glass Lewis will, when relevant, note the potential for a conflict of interest when the fees paid to the advisor or its affiliates for other services exceed those
paid for compensation consulting. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_68"></a>CEO Pay Ratio </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">As mandated by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Consumer and Protection Act, beginning in 2018, issuers will be required to
disclose the median annual total compensation of all employees except the CEO, the total annual compensation of the CEO or equivalent position, and the ratio between the two amounts. Glass Lewis will display the pay ratio as a data point in our
Proxy Papers, as available. While we recognize that the pay ratio has the potential to provide additional insight when assessing a company’s pay practices, at this time it will not be a determinative factor in our voting recommendations.

</p> <p> </p> <p><font color="#565656">triennial votes on executive compensation
limits shareholders’ ability to hold the board accountable for its compensation practices through means other than voting against the compensation committee. Unless a company provides a compelling rationale or unique circumstances for <font><font>say-on-pay</font></font> votes less frequent than annually, we will generally recommend that shareholders support annual votes on compensation. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_70"></a>Vote on Golden Parachute Arrangements </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">The Dodd-Frank Act also requires companies to provide shareholders with a separate <font>non-binding</font> vote on
approval of golden parachute compensation arrangements in connection with certain <font><font>change-in-control</font></font> transactions. However, if the golden parachute arrangements have
previously been subject to a <font><font>say-on-pay</font></font> vote which shareholders approved, then this required vote is waived. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis believes the narrative and tabular disclosure of golden parachute arrangements benefits all shareholders. Glass Lewis analyzes each
golden parachute arrangement on a <font><font>case-by-case</font></font> basis, taking into account, among other items: the nature of the <font><font>change-in-control</font></font> transaction, the ultimate value of the payments particularly compared to the value of the transaction, any excise tax <font>gross-up</font> obligations, the tenure
and position of the executives in question before and after the transaction, any new or amended employment agreements entered into in connection with the transaction, and the type of triggers involved (i.e., single vs. double). In cases where new
problematic features, such as excise tax <font>gross-up</font> obligations, are introduced in a golden parachute proposal, such features may contribute to a negative recommendation not only for the golden parachute
proposal under review, but for the next <font><font>say-on-pay</font></font> proposal of any involved corporate parties, as well as recommendations against their compensation committee as
appropriate. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_71"></a>Equity-Based Compensation Proposals </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">We believe that equity compensation awards, when not abused, are useful for retaining employees and providing an incentive for them to act in a
way that will improve company performance. Glass Lewis recognizes that equity-based compensation plans are critical components of a company’s overall compensation program, and we analyze such plans accordingly based on both quantitative and
qualitative factors. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Our quantitative analysis assesses the plan’s cost and the company’s pace of granting utilizing a
number of different analyses, comparing the program with absolute limits we believe are key to equity value creation and with a carefully chosen peer group. In general, our model seeks to determine whether the proposed plan is either absolutely
excessive or is more than one standard deviation away from the average plan for the peer group on a range of criteria, including dilution to shareholders and the projected annual cost relative to the company’s financial performance. Each of the
analyses (and their constituent parts) is weighted and the plan is scored in accordance with that weight. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">We compare the
program’s expected annual expense with the business’s operating metrics to help determine whether the plan is excessive in light of company performance. We also compare the plan’s expected annual cost to the enterprise value of the
firm rather than to market capitalization because the employees, managers and directors of the firm contribute to the creation of enterprise value but not necessarily market capitalization (the biggest difference is seen where cash represents the
vast majority of market capitalization). Finally, we do not rely exclusively on relative comparisons with averages because, in addition to creeping averages serving to inflate compensation, we believe that some absolute limits are warranted.
</font></p> <p><font color="#565656">We then consider qualitative aspects of the plan such as plan administration, the method and terms of exercise, repricing history,
express or implied rights to reprice, and the presence of evergreen provisions. We also closely review the choice and use of, and difficulty in meeting, the awards’ performance metrics and targets, if any. We believe significant changes to the
terms of a plan should be explained for shareholders and clearly indicated. Other factors such as a company’s size and operating environment may also be relevant in assessing the severity of concerns or the benefits of certain changes. Finally,
we may consider a company’s executive compensation practices in certain situations, as applicable. </font></p>

of the proposed grant is also a large shareholder of the company whose vote can materially affect the passage of the proposal, we believe that the company should strongly consider the level of approval from disinterested shareholders before
proceeding with the proposed grant. Glass Lewis recognizes potential conflicts of interests when vote outcomes can be heavily influenced by the recipient of the grant. A required abstention vote or <font>non-vote</font>
from the recipient for an equity award proposal in these situations can help to avoid such conflicts. This favorable feature will be weighed alongside the structure, disclosure, dilution, provided rationale, and other provisions related to the
individual award to assess the award’s alignment with long-term shareholder interests. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_72"></a>Option
Exchanges and Repricing </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis is generally opposed to the repricing of employee and director options regardless of how it is
accomplished. Employees should have some downside risk in their equity-based compensation program and repricing eliminates any such risk. As shareholders have substantial risk in owning stock, we believe that the equity compensation of employees and
directors should be similarly situated to align their interests with those of shareholders. We believe this will facilitate appropriate risk- and opportunity-taking for the company by employees. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">We are concerned that option grantees who believe they will be “rescued” from underwater options will be more inclined to take
unjustifiable risks. Moreover, a predictable pattern of repricing or exchanges substantially alters a stock option’s value because options that will practically never expire deeply out of the money are worth far more than options that carry a
risk of expiration. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">In short, repricings and option exchange programs change the bargain between shareholders and employees after the
bargain has been struck. </font></p>

</p> <p> </p> <p><font color="#565656">There is one circumstance in which a
repricing or option exchange program may be acceptable: if macroeconomic or industry trends, rather than specific company issues, cause a stock’s value to decline dramatically and the repricing is necessary to motivate and retain employees. In
viewing the company’s stock decline as part of a larger trend, we would expect the impact to approximately reflect the market or industry price decline in terms of timing and magnitude. In this circumstance, we think it fair to conclude that
option grantees may be suffering from a risk that was not foreseeable when the original “bargain” was struck. In such a scenario, we may opt to support a repricing or option exchange program only if sufficient conditions are met. We are

Bullet-Dodging </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis views option backdating, and the related practices of spring-loading and bullet-dodging, as egregious
actions that warrant holding the appropriate management and board members responsible. These practices are similar to repricing options and eliminate much of the downside risk inherent in an option grant that is designed to induce recipients to
maximize shareholder return. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Backdating an option is the act of changing an option’s grant date from the actual grant date to an
earlier date when the market price of the underlying stock was lower, resulting in a lower exercise price for the option. In past studies, Glass Lewis identified over 270 companies that have disclosed internal or government investigations into their
past stock-option grants. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Spring-loading is granting stock options while in possession of material, positive information that has not
been disclosed publicly. Bullet-dodging is delaying the grants of stock options until after the release of material, negative information. This can allow option grants to be made at a lower price either before the release of positive news or
following the release of negative news, assuming the stock’s price will move up or down in response to the information. This raises a concern similar to that of insider trading, or the trading on material
<font>non-public</font> information. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The exercise price for an option is determined on the day of grant,
providing the recipient with the same market risk as an investor who bought shares on that date. However, where options were backdated, the executive or the board (or the compensation committee) changed the grant date retroactively. The new date may
be at or near the lowest price for the year or period. This would be like allowing an investor to look back and select the lowest price of the year at which to buy shares. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">A 2006 study of option grants made between 1996 and 2005 at 8,000 companies found that option backdating can be an indication of poor internal
controls. The study found that option backdating was more likely to occur at companies without a majority independent board and with a long-serving CEO; both factors, the study </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">concluded, were associated with greater CEO influence on the company’s compensation and governance practices.<sup>43</sup> </font></p> <p> </p> <p> </p>

</p> <p> </p> <p><font color="#565656">Where a company granted backdated options
to an executive who is also a director, Glass Lewis will recommend voting against that executive/director, regardless of who decided to make the award. In addition, Glass Lewis will recommend voting against those directors who either approved or
allowed the backdating. Glass Lewis feels that executives and directors who either benefited from backdated options or authorized the practice have failed to act in the best interests of shareholders. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Given the severe tax and legal liabilities to the company from backdating, Glass Lewis will consider recommending voting against members of the
audit committee who served when options were backdated, a restatement occurs, material weaknesses in internal controls exist and disclosures indicate there was a lack of documentation. These committee members failed in their responsibility to ensure
the integrity of the company’s financial reports. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">When a company has engaged in spring-loading or bullet-dodging, Glass Lewis
will consider recommending voting against the compensation committee members where there has been a pattern of granting options at or near historic lows. Glass Lewis will also recommend voting against executives serving on the board who benefited
from the spring-loading or bullet-dodging. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_74"></a>Director Compensation Plans </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis believes that <font>non-employee</font> directors should receive reasonable and appropriate compensation
for the time and effort they spend serving on the board and its committees. However, a balance is required. Fees should be competitive in order to retain and attract qualified individuals, but excessive fees represent a financial cost to the company
and potentially compromise the objectivity and independence of <font>non-employee</font> directors. We will consider recommending support for compensation plans that include option grants or other equity-based awards that
help to align the interests of outside directors with those of shareholders. However, to ensure directors are not incentivized in the same manner as executives but rather serve as a check on imprudent risk-taking in executive compensation plan
design, equity grants to directors should not be performance-based. Where an equity plan exclusively or primarily covers <font>non-employee</font> directors as participants, we do not believe that the plan should provide
for performance-based awards in any capacity. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">When <font>non-employee</font> director equity grants are
covered by the same equity plan that applies to a company’s broader employee base, we will use our proprietary model and analyst review of this model to guide our voting recommendations. If such a plan broadly allows for performance-based
awards to directors or explicitly provides for such grants, we may recommend against the overall plan on this basis, particularly if the company has granted performance-based awards to directors in past. </font></p>
<p> </p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_75"></a>Employee Stock Purchase Plans </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis believes that employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs) can provide employees with a sense of ownership in their company and help
strengthen the alignment between the interests of employees and shareholders. We evaluate ESPPs by assessing the expected discount, purchase period, expected purchase activity (if previous activity has been disclosed) and whether the plan has a
“lookback” feature. Except for the most extreme cases, Glass Lewis will generally support these plans given the regulatory purchase limit of $25,000 per employee per year, which we believe is reasonable. We also look at the number of
shares requested to see if a ESPP will significantly contribute to overall shareholder dilution or if shareholders will not have a chance to approve the program for an excessive period of time. As such, we will generally recommend against ESPPs that
contain “evergreen” provisions that automatically increase the number of shares available under the ESPP each year. </font></p>

Compensation Tax Deductibility — </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9">Amendment to IRC 162(M) </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">The “Tax Cut and Jobs Act” had significant implications on Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, a provision that allowed
companies to deduct compensation in excess of $1 million for the CEO and the next three most highly compensated executive officers, excluding the CFO, if the compensation is performance-based and is paid under shareholder-approved plans. Glass
Lewis does not generally view amendments to equity plans and changes to compensation programs in response to the elimination of tax deductions under 162(m) as problematic. This specifically holds true if such modifications contribute to the
maintenance of a sound performance-based compensation program. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">As grandfathered contracts may continue to be eligible for tax
deductions under the transition rule for Section 162(m), companies may therefore submit incentive plans for shareholder approval to take of advantage of the tax deductibility afforded under 162(m) for certain types of compensation. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">We believe the best practice for companies is to provide robust disclosure to shareholders so that they can make fully informed judgments about
the reasonableness of the proposed compensation plan. To allow for meaningful shareholder review, we prefer that disclosure should include specific performance metrics, a maximum award pool, and a maximum award amount per employee. We also believe
it is important to analyze the estimated grants to see if they are reasonable and in line with the company’s peers. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">We typically
recommend voting against a 162(m) proposal where: (i) a company fails to provide at least a list of performance targets; (ii) a company fails to provide one of either a total maximum or an individual maximum; or (iii) the proposed
plan or individual maximum award limit is excessive when compared with the plans of the company’s peers. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The company’s
record of aligning pay with performance (as evaluated using our proprietary <font><font>pay-for-performance</font></font> model) also plays a role in our recommendation. Where a company has a
record of setting reasonable pay relative to business performance, we generally recommend voting in favor of a plan even if the plan caps seem large relative to peers because we recognize the value in special pay arrangements for continued
exceptional performance. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">As with all other issues we review, our goal is to provide consistent but contextual advice given the
specifics of the company and ongoing performance. Overall, we recognize that it is generally not in shareholders’ best interests to vote against such a plan and forgo the potential tax benefit since shareholder rejection of such plans will not
curtail the awards; it will only prevent the tax deduction associated with them. </font></p>

<p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis believes that poison pill plans are not generally in shareholders’ best interests. They can reduce management accountability by
substantially limiting opportunities for corporate takeovers. Rights plans can thus prevent shareholders from receiving a <font>buy-out</font> premium for their stock. Typically we recommend that shareholders vote against
these plans to protect their financial interests and ensure that they have an opportunity to consider any offer for their shares, especially those at a premium. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">We believe boards should be given wide latitude in directing company activities and in charting the company’s course. However, on an issue
such as this, where the link between the shareholders’ financial interests and their right to consider and accept buyout offers is substantial, we believe that shareholders should be allowed to vote on whether they support such a plan’s
implementation. This issue is different from other matters that are typically left to board discretion. Its potential impact on and relation to shareholders is direct and substantial. It is also an issue in which management interests may be
different from those of shareholders; thus, ensuring that shareholders have a voice is the only way to safeguard their interests. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">In
certain circumstances, we will support a poison pill that is limited in scope to accomplish a particular objective, such as the closing of an important merger, or a pill that contains what we believe to be a reasonable qualifying offer clause. We
will consider supporting a poison pill plan if the qualifying offer clause includes each of the following attributes: </font></p> <p> </p>

<p><font color="#565656">Similarly, Glass Lewis may consider supporting a limited poison pill in the event that a company seeks shareholder approval of a rights plan for
the express purpose of preserving Net Operating Losses (NOLs). While companies with NOLs can generally carry these losses forward to offset future taxable income, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code limits companies’ ability to use
NOLs in the event of a “change of ownership.”<sup>44</sup> In this case, a company may adopt or amend a poison pill (NOL pill) in order to prevent an inadvertent change of ownership by multiple
investors purchasing small chunks of stock at the same time, and thereby preserve the ability to carry the NOLs forward. Often such NOL pills have trigger thresholds much lower than the common 15% or 20% thresholds, with some NOL pill triggers as
low as 5%. </font></p> <p> </p> <p><font color="#565656"><sup>44</sup> Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code refers to a “change of ownership” of more than 50 percentage points by one or more 5% shareholders within a three-year period. The statute is
intended to deter the “trafficking” of net operating losses. </font></p>

</p> <p> </p> <p><font color="#565656">In many cases, companies will propose the
adoption of bylaw amendments specifically restricting certain share transfers, in addition to proposing the adoption of a NOL pill. In general, if we support the terms of a particular NOL pill, we will generally support the additional protective
amendment in the absence of significant concerns with the specific terms of that proposal. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">As with traditional poison pills, NOL pills
may deter shareholders and potentially serve as entrenchment mechanisms. Certain features such as low thresholds combined with acting in concert provisions, among other concerning terms, may disempower shareholders and insulate the board and
management. When acting in concert provisions are present within the terms of a NOL pill, we believe this may raise concerns as to the true objective of the pill. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Acting in concert provisions broaden the definition of beneficial ownership to prohibit parallel conduct, or multiple shareholders party to a
formal or informal agreement collaborating to influence the board and management of a company, and aggregate the ownership of such shareholders towards the triggering threshold. In our view, acting in concert provisions broadly limit the voice of
shareholders and may diminish their ability to engage in a productive dialogue with the company and with other shareholders. When a board adopts defensive measures without engaging with shareholders, we take a dim view of the board and the overall
governance of the company. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">As such, Glass Lewis evaluates NOL pills on a strictly <font><font>case-by-case</font></font> basis, taking into consideration, among other factors: (i) the value of the NOLs to the company; (ii) the likelihood of a change of ownership based on the size of the holdings and the
nature of the larger shareholders; (iii) the trigger threshold; (iv) the duration of the plan (i.e., whether it contains a reasonable “sunset” provision, generally one year or less); (v) the inclusion of an acting in concert
provision; (vi) whether the pill is implemented following the filing of a Schedule 13D by a shareholder or there is evidence of hostile activity or shareholder activism; and (vii) if the pill is subject to periodic board review and/or
shareholder ratification. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">We believe that shareholders should be offered the opportunity to vote on any adoption or renewal of a NOL
pill regardless of any potential tax benefit that it offers a company. As such, we will consider recommending voting against those members of the board who served at the time when an NOL pill was adopted without shareholder approval within the prior
twelve months and where the NOL pill is not subject to shareholder ratification. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_81"></a>Fair Price Provisions
</font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Fair price provisions, which are rare, require that certain minimum price and procedural requirements be observed by any party that
acquires more than a specified percentage of a corporation’s common stock. The provision is intended to protect minority shareholder value when an acquirer seeks to accomplish a merger or other transaction which would eliminate or change the
interests of the minority shareholders. The provision is generally applied against the acquirer unless the takeover is approved by a majority of “continuing directors” and holders of a majority, in some cases a supermajority as high as
80%, of the combined voting power of all stock entitled to vote to alter, amend, or repeal the above provisions. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The effect of a fair
price provision is to require approval of any merger or business combination with an “interested shareholder” by 51% of the voting stock of the company, excluding the shares held by the interested shareholder. An interested shareholder is
generally considered to be a holder of 10% or more of the company’s outstanding stock, but the trigger can vary. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Generally,
provisions are put in place for the ostensible purpose of preventing a <font>back-end</font> merger where the interested shareholder would be able to pay a lower price for the remaining shares of the company than he or she
paid to gain control. The effect of a fair price provision on shareholders, however, is to limit their ability to gain a premium for their shares through a partial tender offer or open market acquisition which typically raise

fair price provision discourages such transactions because of the potential costs of seeking shareholder approval and because of the restrictions on purchase price for completing a merger or other transaction at a later time. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis believes that fair price provisions, while sometimes protecting shareholders from abuse in a takeover situation, more often act as an
impediment to takeovers, potentially limiting gains to shareholders from a variety of transactions that could significantly increase share price. In some cases, even the independent directors of the board cannot make exceptions when such exceptions
may be in the best interests of shareholders. Given the existence of state law protections for minority shareholders such as Section 203 of the Delaware Corporations Code, we believe it is in the best interests of shareholders to remove fair
price provisions. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_82"></a>Control Share Statutes </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Certain states, including Delaware, have adopted control share acquisition statutes as an anti-takeover defense for certain <font>closed-end</font> investment companies and business development companies. Control share statutes may prevent changes in control by limiting voting rights of a person that acquires the ownership of “control
shares.” Control shares are shares of stock equal to or exceeding specified percentages of company voting power, and a control share statute prevents shares in excess of the specified percentage from being voted, unless: (i) the board
approves them to be voted; or (ii) the holder of the “control shares” receives approval from a supermajority of <font>“non-interested”</font> shareholders.</font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Depending on the state of incorporation, companies may automatically rely on control share statutes unless the fund’s board of trustees
eliminates the application of the control share statute to any or all fund share acquisitions, through adoption of a provision in the fund’s governing instrument or by fund board action alone. In certain other states, companies must adopt
control share statutes.</font></p> <p><font color="#565656">In our view, control share statues disenfranchise shareholders by reducing their voting power to a level less
than their economic interest and effectively function as an anti-takeover device. We believe all shareholders should have an opportunity to vote all of their shares. Moreover, anti-takeover measures may prevent shareholders from receiving a <font>buy-out</font> premium for their stock. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">As such, we will generally recommend voting for proposals to opt
out of control share acquisition statutes, unless doing so would allow the completion of a takeover that is not in the best interests of shareholders; and against proposals to amend the charter to include control share acquisition
provisions.</font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Further, in cases where a <font>closed-end</font> fund or business development company has
received a public buyout offer and has relied on a control share statute as a defense mechanism in the prior year, we will generally recommend shareholders vote against the chair of the nominating and governance committee, absent a compelling
rationale as to why a rejected acquisition was not in the best interests of shareholders.</font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_83"></a>Quorum
Requirements </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis believes that a company’s quorum requirement should be set at a level high enough to ensure that a broad
range of shareholders are represented in person or by proxy, but low enough that the company can transact necessary business. Companies in the U.S. are generally subject to quorum requirements under the laws of their specific state of incorporation.
Additionally, those companies listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market are required to specify a quorum in their bylaws, provided however that such quorum may not be less than <font>one-third</font> of outstanding shares. Prior
to 2013, the New York Stock Exchange required a quorum of 50% for listed companies, although this requirement was dropped in recognition of individual state requirements and potential confusion for issuers. Delaware, for example, required companies
to provide for a quorum of no less than <font>one-third</font> of outstanding shares; otherwise such quorum shall default to a majority. </font></p>

</p> <p> </p> <p><font color="#565656">We generally believe a majority of
outstanding shares entitled to vote is an appropriate quorum for the transaction of business at shareholder meetings. However, should a company seek shareholder approval of a lower quorum requirement we will generally support a reduced quorum of at
least <font>one-third</font> of shares entitled to vote, either in person or by proxy. When evaluating such proposals, we also consider the specific facts and circumstances of the company, such as size and shareholder
base. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_84"></a>Director and Officer Indemnification </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">While Glass Lewis strongly believes that directors and officers should be held to the highest standard when carrying out their duties to
shareholders, some protection from liability is reasonable to protect them against certain suits so that these officers feel comfortable taking measured risks that may benefit shareholders. As such, we find it appropriate for a company to provide
indemnification and/or enroll in liability insurance to cover its directors and officers so long as the terms of such agreements are reasonable. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_85"></a>Officer Exculpation </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">In August 2022, the Delaware General Assembly amended
Section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”) to authorize corporations to adopt a provision in their certificate of incorporation to eliminate or limit monetary liability of certain corporate officers for breach
of fiduciary duty of care. Previously, the DGCL allowed only exculpation of corporate directors from breach of fiduciary duty of care claims if the corporation’s certificate of incorporation includes an exculpation provision. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">The amendment authorizes corporations to provide for exculpation of the following officers: (i) the corporation’s president, chief
executive officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, chief legal officer, controller, treasurer or chief accounting officer, (ii) “named executive officers” identified in the corporation’s SEC filings, and
(iii) individuals who have agreed to be identified as officers of the corporation. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Corporate exculpation provisions under the
DGCL only apply to claims for breach of the duty of care, and not to breaches of the duty of loyalty. Exculpation provisions also do not apply to acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct, knowing violations of the
law, or transactions involving the receipt of any improper personal benefits. Furthermore, officers may not be exculpated from claims brought against them by, or in the right of, the corporation (i.e., derivative actions). </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Under Section 102(b)(7), a corporation must affirmatively elect to include an exculpation provision in its certificate of incorporation. We
will closely evaluate proposals to adopt officer exculpation provisions on a <font><font>case-by-case</font></font> basis. We will generally recommend voting against such proposals eliminating
monetary liability for breaches of the duty of care for certain corporate officers, unless compelling rationale for the adoption is provided by the board, and the provisions are reasonable. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_86"></a>Reincorporation </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">In general, Glass Lewis believes that the board is in the best position to determine the appropriate jurisdiction of incorporation for the company. When examining a management proposal to reincorporate to a different state or
country, we review the relevant financial benefits, generally related to improved corporate tax treatment, as well as changes in corporate governance provisions, especially those relating to shareholder rights, resulting from the change in domicile.
Where the financial benefits are de minimis and there is a decrease in shareholder rights, we will recommend voting against the transaction. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">However, costly, shareholder-initiated reincorporations are typically not the best route to achieve the furtherance of shareholder rights.

<p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis recognizes that companies may be subject to frivolous and opportunistic lawsuits, particularly in conjunction with a merger or
acquisition, that are expensive and distracting. In response, companies have sought ways to prevent or limit the risk of such suits by adopting bylaws regarding where the suits must be brought or shifting the burden of the legal expenses to the
plaintiff, if unsuccessful at trial. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis believes that charter or bylaw provisions limiting a shareholder’s choice of
legal venue are not in the best interests of shareholders. Such clauses may effectively discourage the use of shareholder claims by increasing their associated costs and making them more difficult to pursue. As such, shareholders should be wary
about approving any limitation on their legal recourse including limiting themselves to a single jurisdiction (e.g., Delaware or federal courts for matters arising under the Securities Act of 1933) without compelling evidence that it will benefit
shareholders. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">For this reason, we recommend that shareholders vote against any bylaw or charter amendment seeking to adopt an
exclusive forum provision unless the company: (i) provides a compelling argument on why the provision would directly benefit shareholders; (ii) provides evidence of abuse of legal process in other,
<font>non-favored</font> jurisdictions; (iii) narrowly tailors such provision to the risks involved; and (iv) maintains a strong record of good corporate governance practices. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Moreover, in the event a board seeks shareholder approval of a forum selection clause pursuant to a bundled bylaw amendment rather than as a
separate proposal, we will weigh the importance of the other bundled provisions when determining the vote recommendation on the proposal. We will nonetheless recommend voting against the chair of the governance committee for bundling disparate
proposals into a single proposal (refer to our discussion of nominating and governance committee performance in Section I of the guidelines). </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Similarly, some companies have adopted bylaws requiring plaintiffs who sue the company and fail to receive a judgment in their favor pay the legal expenses of the company. These bylaws, also known as
<font>“fee-shifting”</font> or “loser pays” bylaws, will likely have a chilling effect on even meritorious shareholder lawsuits as shareholders would face an strong financial disincentive not to sue a
company. Glass Lewis therefore strongly opposes the adoption of such <font>fee-shifting</font> bylaws and, if adopted without shareholder approval, will recommend voting against the governance committee. While we note that
in June of 2015 the State of Delaware banned the </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">adoption of <font>fee-shifting</font> bylaws, such
provisions could still be adopted by companies incorporated in other states. </font></p>

split appropriate if desired by management or would almost never be a reasonable price at which to split a stock. </font></td></tr></table>

defending against or discouraging a hostile takeover as a reason for a requested increase. Glass Lewis is typically against such defenses and will oppose actions intended to bolster such defenses. </font></td></tr></table>
<table>
<tr>
<td> </td>
<td><font color="#565656">3.</font></td>
<td> </td>
<td><font color="#565656"><b>Financing for Acquisitions</b> — We look at whether the company has a history of using stock for acquisitions and attempt to determine what levels of stock have typically been required to
accomplish such transactions. Likewise, we look to see whether this is discussed as a reason for additional shares in the proxy. </font></td></tr></table>
<table>
<tr>
<td> </td>
<td><font color="#565656">4.</font></td>
<td> </td>
<td><font color="#565656"><b>Financing for Operations</b> — We review the company’s cash position and its ability to secure financing through borrowing or other means. We look at the company’s history of
capitalization and whether the company has had to use stock in the recent past as a means of raising capital. </font></td></tr></table> <p><font color="#565656">Issuing
additional shares generally dilutes existing holders in most circumstances. Further, the availability of additional shares, where the board has discretion to implement a poison pill, can often serve as a deterrent to interested suitors. Accordingly,
where we find that the company has not detailed a plan for use of the proposed shares, or where the number of shares far exceeds those needed to accomplish a detailed plan, we typically recommend against the authorization of additional shares.
Similar concerns may also lead us to recommend against a proposal to conduct a reverse stock split if the board does not state that it will reduce the number of authorized common shares in a ratio proportionate to the split. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">With regard to authorizations and/or increases in preferred shares, Glass Lewis is generally against such authorizations, which allow the board to
determine the preferences, limitations and rights of the preferred shares (known as “blank-check preferred stock”). We believe that granting such broad discretion should be of concern to common shareholders, since blank-check preferred
stock could be used as an anti-takeover device or in some other fashion that adversely affects the voting power or financial interests of common shareholders. Therefore, we will generally recommend voting against such requests, unless the company
discloses a commitment to not use such shares as an anti-takeover defense or in a shareholder rights plan, or discloses a commitment to submit any shareholder rights plan to a shareholder vote prior to its adoption. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">While we think that having adequate shares to allow management to make quick decisions and effectively operate the business is critical, we prefer
that, for significant transactions, management come to shareholders to justify their use of additional shares rather than providing a blank check in the form of a large pool of unallocated shares available for any purpose. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_89"></a>Advance Notice Requirements </font></p>

nominees. </font></p> <p> </p>

</p> <p> </p> <p><font color="#565656">These proposals typically attempt to
require a certain amount of notice before shareholders are allowed to place proposals on the ballot. Notice requirements typically range between three to six months prior to the annual meeting. Advance notice requirements typically make it
impossible for a shareholder who misses the deadline to present a shareholder proposal or a director nominee that might be in the best interests of the company and its shareholders. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">We believe shareholders should be able to review and vote on all proposals and director nominees. Shareholders can always vote against proposals
that appear with little prior notice. Shareholders, as owners of a business, are capable of identifying issues on which they have sufficient information and ignoring issues on which they have insufficient information. Setting arbitrary notice
restrictions limits the opportunity for shareholders to raise issues that may come up after the window closes. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_90"></a>Virtual Shareholder Meetings </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">A growing contingent of companies have elected to hold shareholder meetings by virtual means only. Glass Lewis believes that virtual meeting
technology can be a useful complement to a traditional, <font>in-person</font> shareholder meeting by expanding participation of shareholders who are unable to attend a shareholder meeting in person (i.e., a “hybrid
meeting”). However, we also believe that virtual-only meetings have the potential to curb the ability of a company’s shareholders to meaningfully communicate with the company’s management. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Prominent shareholder rights advocates, including the Council of Institutional Investors, have expressed concerns that such virtual-only meetings
do not approximate an <font>in-person</font> experience and may serve to reduce the board’s accountability to shareholders. When analyzing the governance profile of companies that choose to hold virtual-only meetings,
we look for robust disclosure in a company’s proxy statement which assures shareholders that they will be afforded the same rights and opportunities to participate as they would at an <font>in-person</font> meeting.
</font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Examples of effective disclosure include: (i) addressing the ability of shareholders to ask questions during the meeting,
including time guidelines for shareholder questions, rules around what types of questions are allowed, and rules for how questions and comments will be recognized and disclosed to meeting participants; (ii) procedures, if any, for posting
appropriate questions received during the meeting and the company’s answers, on the investor page of their website as soon as is practical after the meeting; (iii) addressing technical and logistical issues related to accessing the virtual

governance and shareholder rights, we believe shareholders should have the power to speak and the opportunity to effect change. That power should not be concentrated in the hands of a few for reasons other than economic stake. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">We generally consider a multi-class share structure to reflect negatively on a company’s overall corporate governance. Because we believe
that companies should have share capital structures that protect the interests of <font>non-controlling</font> shareholders as well as any controlling entity, we typically recommend that shareholders vote in favor of
recapitalization proposals to eliminate dual-class share structures. Similarly, we will generally recommend against proposals to adopt a new class of common stock. We will generally recommend voting against the chair of the governance committee at
companies with a multi-class share structure and unequal voting rights when the company does not provide for a reasonable sunset of the multi-class share structure (generally seven years or less). </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">In the case of a board that adopts a multi-class share structure in connection with an IPO, <font>spin-off,</font> or
direct listing within the past year, we will generally recommend voting against all members of the board who served at the time of the IPO if the board: (i) did not also commit to submitting the multi-class structure to a shareholder vote at
the company’s first shareholder meeting following the IPO; or (ii) did not provide for a reasonable sunset of the multi-class structure (generally seven years or less). If the multi-class share structure is put to a shareholder vote, we
will examine the level of approval or disapproval attributed to unaffiliated shareholders when determining the vote outcome. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">At
companies that have multi-class share structures with unequal voting rights, we will carefully examine the level of approval or disapproval attributed to unaffiliated shareholders when determining whether board responsiveness is warranted. In the
case of companies that have multi-class share structures with unequal voting rights, we will generally examine the level of approval or disapproval attributed to unaffiliated shareholders on a “one share, one vote” basis. At controlled and
multi-class companies, when at least 20% or more of unaffiliated shareholders vote contrary to management, we believe that boards should engage with shareholders and demonstrate some initial level of responsiveness, and when a majority or more of
unaffiliated shareholders vote contrary to management we believe that boards should engage with shareholders and provide a more robust response to fully address shareholder concerns. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_93"></a>Cumulative Voting </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Cumulative voting increases the ability of minority shareholders to elect a director by allowing shareholders to cast as many shares of the stock they own multiplied by the number of directors to be elected. As companies generally
have multiple nominees up for election, cumulative voting allows shareholders to cast all of their votes for a single nominee, or a smaller number of nominees than up for election, thereby raising the likelihood of electing one or more of their
preferred nominees to the board. It can be important when a board is controlled by insiders or affiliates and where the company’s ownership structure includes one or more shareholders who control a majority-voting block of company stock.
</font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis believes that cumulative voting generally acts as a safeguard for shareholders by ensuring that those who hold a
significant minority of shares can elect a candidate of their choosing to the board. This allows the creation of boards that are responsive to the interests of all shareholders rather than just a small group of large holders. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">We review cumulative voting proposals on a <font><font>case-by-case</font></font> basis,
factoring in the independence of the board and the status of the company’s governance structure. But we typically find these proposals on ballots at companies where independence is lacking and where the appropriate checks and balances favoring
shareholders are not in place. In those instances we typically recommend in favor of cumulative voting. </font></p>

</p> <p> </p> <p><font color="#565656">Where a company has adopted a true
majority vote standard (i.e., where a director must receive a majority of votes cast to be elected, as opposed to a modified policy indicated by a resignation policy only), Glass Lewis will recommend voting against cumulative voting proposals due to
the incompatibility of the two election methods. For companies that have not adopted a true majority voting standard but have adopted some form of majority voting, Glass Lewis will also generally recommend voting against cumulative voting proposals
if the company has not adopted anti-takeover protections and has been responsive to shareholders. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Where a company has not adopted a
majority voting standard and is facing both a shareholder proposal to adopt majority voting and a shareholder proposal to adopt cumulative voting, Glass Lewis will support only the majority voting proposal. When a company has both majority voting
and cumulative voting in place, there is a higher likelihood of one or more directors not being elected as a result of not receiving a majority vote. This is because shareholders exercising the right to cumulate their votes could unintentionally
cause the failed election of one or more directors for whom shareholders do not cumulate votes. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_94"></a>Supermajority Vote Requirements </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis believes that supermajority vote requirements impede shareholder action on ballot items critical to shareholder interests. An example
is in the takeover context, where supermajority vote requirements can strongly limit the voice of shareholders in making decisions on such crucial matters as selling the business. This in turn degrades share value and can limit the possibility of
buyout premiums to shareholders. Moreover, we believe that a supermajority vote requirement can enable a small group of shareholders to overrule the will of the majority shareholders. We believe that a simple majority is appropriate to approve all
matters presented to shareholders. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_95"></a>Transaction of Other Business </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">We typically recommend that shareholders not give their proxy to management to vote on any other business items that may properly come before an
annual or special meeting. In our opinion, granting unfettered discretion is unwise. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_96"></a>Anti-Greenmail
Proposals </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis will support proposals to adopt a provision preventing the payment of greenmail, which would serve to prevent
companies from buying back company stock at significant premiums from a certain shareholder. Since a large or majority shareholder could attempt to compel a board into purchasing its shares at a large premium, the anti-greenmail provision would
generally require that a majority of shareholders other than the majority shareholder approve the buyback. </font></p>

<p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis believes that decisions about a fund’s structure and/or a fund’s relationship with its investment advisor or <font>sub-advisors</font> are generally best left to management and the members of the board, absent a showing of egregious or illegal conduct that might threaten shareholder value. As such, we focus our analyses of such

</p> <p> </p> <p><font color="#565656">We generally support amendments to a
fund’s investment advisory agreement absent a material change that is not in the best interests of shareholders. A significant increase in the fees paid to an investment advisor would be reason for us to consider recommending voting against a
proposed amendment to an investment advisory agreement or fund reorganization. However, in certain cases, we are more inclined to support an increase in advisory fees if such increases result from being performance-based rather than asset-based.
Furthermore, we generally support <font>sub-advisory</font> agreements between a fund’s advisor and <font>sub-advisor,</font> primarily because the fees received by the <font>sub-advisor</font> are paid by the advisor, and not by the fund. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">In matters pertaining to a fund’s
investment objective or strategy, we believe shareholders are best served when a fund’s objective or strategy closely resembles the investment discipline shareholders understood and selected when they initially bought into the fund. As such, we
generally recommend voting against amendments to a fund’s investment objective or strategy when the proposed changes would leave shareholders with stakes in a fund that is noticeably different than when originally purchased, and which could
therefore potentially negatively impact some investors’ diversification strategies. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_98"></a>Real Estate
Investment Trusts </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The complex organizational, operational, tax and compliance requirements of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)
provide for a unique shareholder evaluation. In simple terms, a REIT must have a minimum of 100 shareholders (the 100 Shareholder Test) and no more than 50% of the value of its shares can be held by five or fewer individuals (the “5/50
Test”). At least 75% of a REITs’ assets must be in real estate, it must derive 75% of its gross income from rents or mortgage interest, and it must pay out 90% of its taxable earnings as dividends. In addition, as a publicly traded
security listed on a stock exchange, a REIT must comply with the same general listing requirements as a publicly traded equity. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">In
order to comply with such requirements, REITs typically include percentage ownership limitations in their organizational documents, usually in the range of 5% to 10% of the REITs outstanding shares. Given the complexities of REITs as an asset class,
Glass Lewis applies a highly nuanced approach in our evaluation of REIT proposals, especially regarding changes in authorized share capital, including preferred stock. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_99"></a>Preferred Stock Issuances at REITs </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis is generally against the authorization of “blank-check preferred stock.” However, given the requirement that a REIT must
distribute 90% of its net income annually, it is inhibited from retaining capital to make investments in its business. As such, we recognize that equity financing likely plays a key role in a REIT’s growth and creation of shareholder value.
Moreover, shareholder concern regarding the use of preferred stock as an anti-takeover mechanism may be allayed by the fact that most REITs maintain ownership limitations in their certificates of incorporation. For these reasons, along with the fact
that REITs typically do not engage in private placements of preferred stock (which result in the rights of common shareholders being adversely impacted), we may support requests to authorize shares of blank-check preferred stock at REITs.
</font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_100"></a>Business Development Companies </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Business Development Companies (BDCs) were created by the U.S. Congress in 1980; they are regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and
are taxed as regulated investment companies (RICs) under the Internal Revenue Code. BDCs typically operate as publicly traded private equity firms that invest in early stage to mature private companies as well as small public companies. BDCs realize
operating income when their investments are sold off, and therefore maintain complex organizational, operational, tax and compliance requirements that are similar to those of REITs—the most evident of which is that BDCs must distribute at least
90% of their taxable earnings as dividends. </font></p>

to Sell Shares at a Price Below Net Asset Value </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Considering that BDCs are required to distribute nearly all their earnings to
shareholders, they sometimes need to offer additional shares of common stock in the public markets to finance operations and acquisitions. However, shareholder approval is required in order for a BDC to sell shares of common stock at a price below
Net Asset Value (NAV). Glass Lewis evaluates these proposals using a <font><font>case-by-case</font></font> approach, but will recommend supporting such requests if the following conditions are
met: </font></p> <p> </p>
<table>
<tr>
<td> </td>
<td><font color="#565656">•</font></td>

issuance approve the sale. </font></p></td></tr></table> <p><font color="#565656">In short, we believe BDCs should demonstrate a responsible approach to issuing shares
below NAV, by proactively addressing shareholder concerns regarding the potential dilution of the requested share issuance, and explaining if and how the company’s past <font>below-NAV</font> share issuances have
benefitted the company. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_102"></a>Auditor Ratification and <font>Below-NAV</font>
Issuances </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">When a BDC submits a <font>below-NAV</font> issuance for shareholder approval, we will refrain
from recommending against the audit committee chair for not including auditor ratification on the same ballot. Because of the unique way these proposals interact, votes may be tabulated in a manner that is not in shareholders’ interests. In
cases where these proposals appear on the same ballot, auditor ratification is generally the only “routine proposal,” the presence of which triggers a scenario where broker <font>non-votes</font> may be counted
toward shareholder quorum, with unintended consequences. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Under the 1940 Act, <font>below-NAV</font>
issuance proposals require relatively high shareholder approval. Specifically, these proposals must be approved by the lesser of: (i) 67% of votes cast if a majority of shares are represented at the meeting; or (ii) a majority of outstanding
shares. Meanwhile, any broker <font>non-votes</font> counted toward quorum will automatically be registered as “against” votes for purposes of this proposal. The unintended result can be a case where the issuance
proposal is not approved, despite sufficient voting shares being cast in favor. Because broker <font>non-votes</font> result from a lack of voting instruction by the shareholder, we do not believe shareholders’
ability to weigh in on the selection of auditor outweighs the consequences of failing to approve an issuance proposal due to such technicality. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_103"></a>Special Purpose Acquisition Companies </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs), also
known as “blank check companies,” are publicly traded entities with no commercial operations and are formed specifically to pool funds in order to complete a merger or acquisition within a set time frame. In general, the acquisition target
of a SPAC is either not yet identified or otherwise not explicitly disclosed to the public even when the founders of the SPAC may have at least one target in mind. Consequently, IPO investors often do not know what company they will ultimately be
investing in. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">SPACs are therefore very different from typical operating companies. Shareholders do not have the same expectations
associated with an ordinary publicly traded company and executive officers of a SPAC typically do not continue in employment roles with an acquired company. </font></p>

Business Combination Deadline </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Governing documents of SPACs typically provide for the return of IPO proceeds to common shareholders if
no qualifying business combination is consummated before a certain date. Because the time frames for the consummation of such transactions are relatively short, SPACs will sometimes hold special shareholder meetings at which shareholders are asked
to extend the business combination deadline. In such cases, an acquisition target will typically have been identified, but additional time is required to allow management of the SPAC to finalize the terms of the deal. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis believes management and the board are generally in the best position to determine when the extension of a business combination
deadline is needed. We therefore generally defer to the recommendation of management and support reasonable extension requests. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_105">
</a>SPAC Board Independence </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The board of directors of a SPAC’s acquisition target is in many cases already established prior to
the business combination. In some cases, however, the board’s composition may change in connection with the business combination, including the potential addition of individuals who served in management roles with the SPAC. The role of a SPAC
executive is unlike that of a typical operating company executive. Because the SPAC’s only business is identifying and executing an acquisition deal, the interests of a former SPAC executive are also different. Glass Lewis does not
automatically consider a former SPAC executive to be affiliated with the acquired operating entity when their only position on the board of the combined entity is that of an otherwise independent director. Absent any evidence of an employment
relationship or continuing material financial interest in the combined entity, we will therefore consider such directors to be independent. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_106"></a>Director Commitments of SPAC Executives </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">We believe the primary role of executive officers
at SPACs is identifying acquisition targets for the SPAC and consummating a business combination. Given the nature of these executive roles and the limited business operations of SPACs, when a directors’ only executive role is at a SPAC, we
will generally apply our higher limit for company directorships. As a result, we generally recommend that shareholders vote against a director who serves in an executive role only at a SPAC while serving on more than five public company boards.

<p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis believes that shareholders should seek to promote governance structures that protect shareholders, support effective ESG oversight and
reporting, and encourage director accountability. Accordingly, Glass Lewis places a significant emphasis on promoting transparency, robust governance structures and companies’ responsiveness to and engagement with shareholders. We also believe
that companies should be transparent on how they are mitigating material ESG risks, including those related to climate change, human capital management, and stakeholder relations. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">To that end, we evaluate all shareholder proposals on a
<font><font>case-by-case</font></font> basis with a view to promoting long-term shareholder value. While we are generally supportive of those that promote board accountability, shareholder
rights, and transparency, we consider all proposals in the context of a company’s unique operations and risk profile. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">For a

Approach to Environmental, Social &amp; Governance Issues </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis evaluates all environmental and social issues through the
lens of long-term shareholder value. We believe that companies should be considering material environmental and social factors in all aspects of their operations and that companies should provide shareholders with disclosures that allow them to
understand how these factors are being considered and how attendant risks are being mitigated. We also are of the view that governance is a critical factor in how companies manage environmental and social risks and opportunities and that a
well-governed company will be generally managing these issues better than one without a governance structure that promotes board independence and accountability. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">We believe part of the board’s role is to ensure that management conducts a complete risk analysis of company operations, including those
that have material environmental and social implications. We believe that directors should monitor management’s performance in both capitalizing on environmental and social opportunities and mitigating environmental and social risks related to
operations in order to best serve the interests of shareholders. Companies face significant financial, legal and reputational risks resulting from poor environmental and social practices, or negligent oversight thereof. Therefore, in cases where the
board or management has neglected to take action on a pressing issue that could negatively impact shareholder value, we believe that shareholders should take necessary action in order to effect changes that will safeguard their financial interests.
</font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Given the importance of the role of the board in executing a sustainable business strategy that allows for the realization of
environmental and social opportunities and the mitigation of related risks, relating to environmental risks and opportunities, we believe shareholders should seek to promote governance structures that protect shareholders and promote director
accountability. When management and the board have displayed disregard for environmental or social risks, have engaged in egregious or illegal conduct, or have failed to adequately respond to current or imminent environmental and social risks that
threaten shareholder value, we believe shareholders should consider holding directors accountable. In such instances, we will generally recommend against responsible members of the board that are specifically charged with oversight of the issue in
question. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">When evaluating environmental and social factors that may be relevant to a given company, Glass Lewis does so in the context
of the financial materiality of the issue to the company’s operations. We believe that all companies face risks associated with environmental and social issues. However, we recognize that these risks manifest themselves differently at each
company as a result of a company’s operations, workforce, structure, and geography, among other factors. Accordingly, we place a significant emphasis on the financial implications of a company’s actions with regard to impacts on its
stakeholders and the environment. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">When evaluating environmental and social issues, Glass Lewis examines companies’: </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656"><b>Direct environmental and social risk</b> — Companies should evaluate financial exposure to direct environmental risks associated with
their operations. Examples of direct environmental risks include those associated with oil or gas spills, contamination, hazardous leakages, explosions, or reduced water or air quality, among others. Social risks may include <font>non-inclusive</font> employment policies, inadequate human rights policies, or issues that adversely affect the company’s stakeholders. Further, we believe that firms should consider their exposure to risks emanating
from a broad range of issues, over which they may have no or only limited control, such as insurance companies being affected by increased storm severity and frequency resulting from climate change. </font></p>

risk</b> — Failure to take action on important environmental or social issues may carry the risk of inciting negative publicity and potentially costly litigation. While the effect of high-profile campaigns on shareholder value may not be

mindful that such matters may involve unadjudicated allegations or other charges that have not been resolved. Glass Lewis does not assume the truth of such allegations or charges or that the law has been violated. Instead, Glass Lewis focuses more
broadly on whether, under the particular facts and circumstances presented, the nature and number of such concerns, lawsuits or investigations reflects on the risk profile of the company or suggests that appropriate risk mitigation measures may be
warranted. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656"><b>Governance risk</b> — Inadequate oversight of environmental and social issues carries significant risks to
companies. When leadership is ineffective or fails to thoroughly consider potential risks, such risks are likely unmitigated and could thus present substantial risks to the company, ultimately leading to loss of shareholder value. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis believes that one of the most crucial factors in analyzing the risks presented to companies in the form of environmental and social
issues is the level and quality of oversight over such issues. When management and the board have displayed disregard for environmental risks, have engaged in egregious or illegal conduct, or have failed to adequately respond to current or imminent
environmental risks that threaten shareholder value, we believe shareholders should consider holding directors accountable. When companies have not provided for explicit, board-level oversight of environmental and social matters and/or when a
substantial environmental or social risk has been ignored or inadequately addressed, we may recommend voting against members of the board. In addition, or alternatively, depending on the proposals presented, we may also consider recommending voting
in favor of relevant shareholder proposals or against other relevant management-proposed items, such as the ratification of auditor, a company’s accounts and reports, or ratification of management and board acts. </font></p>

Changes for 2024 </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9">Board Diversity </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy has updated its policy concerning gender diversity on boards. The policy has been updated to provide that, if less than 30% of the board is female the Climate Policy will vote against the entire incumbent male
nominating committee members for large- and <font>mid-cap</font> companies; however, where local market standards dictate a higher level of expected gender diversity, the Climate Policy will follow the local market
requirement. Previously, the Climate Policy would vote against members of the nominating committee in instances where <font>large-cap</font> companies did not have at least 30% gender diversity and the chair of the
nominating committee when <font>mid-</font> and <font>small-cap</font> companies did not have at least one woman on their boards. The policy will continue to recommend against male members of the
nominating committee when <font>small-cap</font> companies do not have at least one woman on their boards. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9">Stakeholder Considerations </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">In
order to drive long-term shareholder value, companies require a social license to operate. A lack of consideration for stakeholders can present legal, regulatory, and reputational risks. With this view, the Climate Policy has narrowed its focus to
vote against the chair of the board in instances where companies in major blue chip indices are not signatories or participants in the United Nations Global Compact (“UNGC”) or have not adopted a human rights policy that is aligned with
the standards set forth by the International Labour Organization (“ILO”) or the Universal Declaration on Human Rights (“UDHR”). </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9">Other Changes </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">A number of updates have also been made to the Glass Lewis standard guidelines, which underpin and
inform the Climate Policy. Further details can be found at www.glasslewis.com </font></p>

</p> <p> </p> <p><font color="#ff2d00"><a name="gl745737a_3"></a>Introduction
</font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Institutional investors are increasingly recognizing the importance of incorporating material environmental, social, and governance
(“ESG”) factors into their investment processes. Active ownership on ESG issues will typically include also applying these considerations to proxy voting practices. Furthermore, climate change is presenting unprecedented risks to
companies, investors and society, more broadly. As the physical, regulatory, legal and reputational risks associated with climate change continue to mount, investors are taking an increasingly active role in engaging companies on how they are
mitigating their climate impacts and managing the related risks and opportunities to their businesses. One very important part of this active engagement is how investors are casting votes in alignment with their portfolio-related climate risk
strategies and in a manner that mitigates attendant risks to the best extent possible. This policy allows investors to incorporate companies’ governance, oversight, management, and reporting of climate risks and opportunities into their proxy
voting practices. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy was designed for clients with a strong focus on environmental risk mitigation as well as those
who look to promote enhanced climate disclosure and climate-related risk mitigation strategies. The Climate Policy takes into account a company’s size and sector in order ensure that shareholders execute votes that both promote a transition to
a <font>low-carbon</font> future and that make sense from a financial perspective in the context of a company’s operations. The Climate Policy underscores that, while all companies face risks attendant to climate
change, these risks will manifest themselves in different ways. In addition, it recognizes that the majority of the world’s carbon emissions are emitted by select, systemically important emitters. Accordingly, the Climate Policy will apply an
additional layer of scrutiny to ensure that those companies have effective oversight of and mechanisms to respond to the changing climate. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Specifically, the Climate Policy has identified three tiers of companies: </font></p> <p><font color="#565656"><b>Tier 1:</b> Climate
Action 100+ companies. These companies are the highest-emitting companies and thus have significant exposure to climate-related risks. Accordingly, the Climate Policy will ensure that these companies are held to the highest standard with
respect to the governance afforded to climate change, the disclosures expected by these companies and the way that these companies incentivize executives to mitigate climate-related risks. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656"><b>Tier 2:</b> Companies where greenhouse gas emissions represent a material risk, as defined by the Sustainability Accounting
Standards Board (SASB). For companies that are determined to have significant risk exposure as a result of their GHG emissions, the Climate Policy will promote enhanced governance and disclosure of climate-related issues, as well as the
establishment of policies and strategies to help mitigate climate-related risks. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656"><b>Tier 3:</b> All other companies.
The Climate Policy recognizes that climate change represents a risk to all businesses, regardless of industry or exposure to climate-related regulatory or legal risks. As a result, the Climate Policy will promote enhanced disclosure on these
climate-related risks as well as enhanced board-level oversight of environmental and social issues. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy is guided by a
framework established by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which is based on four pillars: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656"><b>Governance</b>: The Climate Policy will closely evaluate the roles and responsibilities of the board and its committees in
order to understand what level of oversight is afforded to environmental and climate- related risks and opportunities. In instances where a company does not afford proper oversight to these issues, the Climate Policy will vote against relevant
directors. </font></p>

</p> <p> </p> <p><font color="#565656"><b>Strategy</b>: For
heavily-emitting or highly-exposed companies, the Climate Policy will evaluate how a company’s strategy has incorporated issues related to climate change, by evaluating whether the company has established GHG reduction goals. In instances where
such goals are financially material, the Climate Policy will, depending on the market, vote against either relevant directors or a company’s Accounts and Reports at companies that have failed to establish meaningful emissions reductions
targets. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656"><b>Risk Management:</b> In order to determine how risks related to climate change are established throughout
an organization, the Climate Policy will carefully evaluate the incentive structures driving the top levels of an organization and to what extent climate and other environmental risks are built into a company’s reward structures. When companies
have failed to provide an incentive structure that properly takes into account climate and environmental issues, the Climate Policy will vote against a company’s remuneration proposals. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656"><b>Metrics and Targets:</b> Understanding that shareholders require comprehensive disclosure of companies’ climate and
sustainability-related risks, the Climate Policy will vote against relevant directors in instances where a company has failed to provide adequate disclosure to allow shareholders to evaluate how a company is considering issues of climate change. For
heavily-emitting companies, the Climate Policy will also evaluate if a company has provided disclosure on SASB topics and metrics in order to determine to what level the company has provided thorough, financially-material, and comparable disclosure
to shareholders. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy acts as an overlay for Glass Lewis’ benchmark policies. Accordingly, the Climate Policy
guidelines are underpinned and informed by the Glass Lewis benchmark policy guidelines. Implementation of the Climate Policy may vary <font><font>market-to-market</font></font> in accordance with
regulatory requirements, corporate governance best practices, and other relevant standards in individual markets. Detailed information on the contents and implementation of Glass Lewis’ benchmark guidelines for all major global markets are
publicly available on the Glass Lewis website. </font></p>

Directors </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_5"></a>Board of Directors </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Boards are established in order to represent shareholders and protect their interests. Glass Lewis seeks boards that have a record for protecting
shareholders and delivering value over the medium- and long-term. For boards that wish to protect and enhance the interests of shareholders they must have sufficient levels of independence (the percentage varies by local market practice and
regulations), boast a record of positive performance, have directors with diverse backgrounds, and appoint new directors that have a depth of relevant experience. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9">Board Composition </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The Climate
Policy examines a variety of elements to the board when voting on director elections. In terms of the directors, the policy looks at each individual on the board and explores their relationship with the company, the company’s executives and
with other board members. This is to ensure and determine whether a director has an existing relationship with the company that are likely to impact any decision processes of that board member. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">The biographical information provided by the company on the individual director is essential for investors to understand the background and skills
of the directors of the board. This information should be provided in the company’s documents well in advance of the shareholder meeting, in order to give shareholders sufficient time to analyze the information. In cases where the company fails
to disclose the names or backgrounds of director nominees, the Climate Policy may vote against or abstain from voting on the directors’ elections. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy will vote in favor of governance structures that will drive positive performance and enhance shareholder value. The most crucial test of a board’s commitment to the company and to its shareholders is the
performance of the board and its members. The performance of directors in their capacity as board members and as executives of the company, when applicable, and in their roles at other companies where they serve is critical to this evaluation.
</font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Directors are formed into three categories based on an examination of the type of relationship they have with the company. The table
below includes a breakdown of how Glass Lewis classifies these director relationships with the company. </font></p> <p> </p>

</p> <p> </p> <p><font color="#565656">With respect to the creation of board
committees and the composition thereof, the Climate Policy will generally support shareholder proposals requesting that companies create a committee to oversee climate-related issues or the appointment of climate experts to the board. The Climate
Policy will also support shareholder proposals requesting the establishment of other environmental or social committees or the appointment of individuals with specific expertise (such as human rights or public policy) if the issue is deemed material
to the company or if it is evident that the company has provided insufficient oversight of the issue in question. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9">Board Oversight of
Environmental and Social Issues </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy is strongly focused on the governance that companies establish around material
environmental and social risks. The Climate Policy looks to companies to provide some level of board oversight of these risks. Depending on a company’s governance structure and that market in which it is domiciled, the Climate Policy will vote
against the board chair or the chair of the audit committee if a company has not established proper risk oversight of material environmental and social risks, including those related to climate change. In executing these votes, the Climate Policy
will take into account the company’s exposure to climate- related risks when determining whether a company has established appropriate governance mechanisms to oversee these issues. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9">Board Diversity, Tenure and Refreshment </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy acknowledges the importance of ensuring that the board is comprised of directors who have a diversity of skills, backgrounds, thoughts, and experiences. As such, having diverse boards benefits companies greatly by
encompassing an array of different perspectives and insights. The Climate Policy may vote against the chair of the nominating committee when the board has failed to address the lack of diverse skills, and experience of the board members or when it
fails to meet legal requirements or relevant market best practice standards, and when the company has not disclosed any explanation or plan regarding its approach to board diversity. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">In terms of board tenure and refreshment, the Climate Policy strongly supports routine director evaluations, including independent external
reviews, and periodic board refreshment in order to enable the company to maintain a fresh set of ideas and business strategies in an ever-changing world and market. Having directors with diverse experiences and skills can strengthen the position of
a company within the market. Therefore, the Climate Policy promotes refreshment within boards, as a lack of refreshment can lead to poor company performance. Thus, the Climate Policy may consider voting against directors with a lengthy tenure (e.g.
over 12 years) when significant performance or governance concerns are identified that indicate a fresh perspective would be beneficial and there is no evidence of any plans of future board refreshment. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy will also evaluate a company’s policies and actions with respect to board refreshment and diversity. As a part of this
evaluation, we will review the diversity of board members and support shareholder proposals to report on or increase board diversity. The nominating and governance committee, as an agent for the shareholders, is responsible for the governance by the
board of the company and its executives. In performing this role, the committee is responsible and accountable for selection of objective and competent board members. To that end, the Climate Policy will: (i) vote against members of the
nominating committee in the event that the board has an average tenure of over ten years and the board has not appointed a new nominee to the board in at least five years; (ii) vote against the incumbent male nominating committee members in
instances where the board of a large- or <font>mid-cap</font> company is comprised of fewer than 30% female directors, or the local market requirement for gender diversity where higher; or (iii) vote against the male
members of the nominating committee where there is not at least one woman on the board of a <font>small-cap</font> company. </font></p>

</p> <p> </p> <p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy conducts a further
level of analysis for U.S. companies included in the Russel 1000 index. For these companies, the Climate Policy will vote against members of the nominating and governance committee when they receive a “Poor” score in Glass Lewis’
Diversity Disclosure Assessment. The Diversity Disclosure Assessment is an analysis of companies’ proxy statement disclosure relating to board diversity, skills and the director nomination process. This assessment reflects how a company’s
proxy statement presents: (i) the board’s current percentage of racial/ethnic diversity; (ii) whether the board’s definition of diversity explicitly includes gender and/or race/ethnicity; (iii) whether the board has adopted
a policy requiring women and minorities to be included in the initial pool of candidates when selecting new director nominees (“Rooney Rule”); and (iv) board skills disclosure. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9">Director Overboarding </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The
Climate Policy will generally recommend that shareholders vote against a director who serves as an executive officer (other than executive chair) of any public company while serving on more than one external public company board, a director who
serves as an executive chair of any public company while serving on more than two external public company boards, and any other director who serves on more than five public company boards. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9">Board Size </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Although there is
not a universally acceptable optimum board size, boards should have a minimum of five directors to ensure sufficient diversity in decision making and to enable the establishment of key committees with independent directors. Further, boards should
not be composed of more than 20 directors as the board may suffer as a result of too many voices to be heard and have difficulty reaching consensus on issues with this number of members. As a result, the Climate Policy will generally vote against
the chair of the nominating committee at a board with fewer than five directors or more than 20 directors. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9">Classified Boards
</font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy favors the repeal of staggered boards in favor of the annual election of directors. Staggered boards are generally
less accountable to shareholders than annually elected directors to the board. In addition, the annual election of directors encourages board members to focus on protecting the interests of shareholders. Further to this, if shareholders are
unsatisfied with board members the annual election of directors allows them to voice these concerns. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9">Controlled Companies </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy allows certain exceptions to the independence standards at controlled companies. The board’s main function is to protect
shareholder interests, however, when an individual, entity, or group own more than 50% of the voting shares, the interests of majority shareholders are the interests of that entity or individual. As a result, the Climate Policy does not apply the
usual <font>two-thirds</font> independence threshold on controlled companies instead it includes the following guidelines: </font></p> <p> </p>

<p><font color="#565656">Significant shareholders are either an individual or an entity which holds between <font>20-50%</font> of a
company’s voting power, and the Climate Policy provides that shareholders should be allowed proportional representation on the board and in committees (excluding the audit committee) based on their percentage of ownership. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9">Director Performance and Oversight </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Board members performance and their actions in regard to performance of the board is an essential element tounderstanding the board’s commitment to the company and to shareholders. The Climate Policy will look at the
performance of individuals as directors and executives of the company and of other companies where they have served. Often a director’s past conduct is indicative of future conduct and performance. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy will typically vote against directors who have served on boards or as executives of companies with records of poor performance,
inadequate risk oversight, excessive compensation, audit or accounting- related issues, and other actions or indicators of mismanagement. However, the Climate Policy will also reevaluate the directors based on factors such as the length of time that
has passed since the incident, the director’s role, and the severity of the issue. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9">Environmental and Social Oversight and
Performance </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy considers the oversight afforded to environmental and social issues. The Climate Policy looks to ensure
that companies maintain appropriate board-level oversight of material risks to their operations, including those that are environmental and social in nature. When it is clear that these risks have not been properly managed or mitigated, the Climate
Policy may vote against members of the board who are responsible for the oversight of environmental and social risks. In the absence of explicit board oversight of environmental and social issues, the Climate Policy may vote against members of the
audit committee. In making these determinations, the Climate Policy will take into account the situation at hand, its effect on shareholder value, as well as any corrective action or other response made by the company. </font></p>
<p><font color="#ff2d00">Disclosure </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy
expects companies to provide a sufficient level of disclosure to shareholders to allow them to understand what environmental and social risks face the company and what steps the company is taking to mitigate those risks. Shareholders require that
companies provide disclosure of financially-material environmental and social risks, such as that recommended by the TCFD or SASB, in order to track a company’s performance against these risks as well as how the company’s strategies help
to reduce a company’s exposure to these risks. Accordingly, the Climate Policy will vote against relevant directors when a company has not provided such disclosure. Specifically, the Climate Policy will vote against directors charged with
oversight of environmental and social issues at companies that do not provide robust sustainability information. For companies more exposed to climate-related risks, the Climate Policy will vote against directors responsible for overseeing
environmental and social issues if they do not provide reporting that is aligned with the recommendations of the TCFD or SASB. However, for Climate Action 100+ focus list companies, the Climate Policy expects to see TCFD reporting and will vote
against directors that oversee environmental and social issues if such reporting has not been produced by the company. In all aforementioned cases, if the company does not maintain explicit oversight of environmental and social issue, the Climate
Policy will instead vote against the chair of the board or the audit committee chair (if the chair and CEO roles are combined). </font></p>

</p> <p> </p> <p><font color="#ff2d00">Target Setting </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">While appropriate disclosure of environmental and social risks is very important to shareholders’ understanding of their portfolio companies
and how they are managing attendant risks, it is also important that companies have outlined a strategy to mitigate climate impacts, particularly when they operate in heavily-emitting industries or industries with significant exposure to
climate-related risks. When companies have such exposure, the Climate Policy will evaluate whether the companies have established greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals, and whether those goals are aligned with those set forth by the Paris
Agreement. Specifically, the Climate Policy looks to companies in emissions-intensive industries or those that are highly exposed to climate-related risks to set a net zero target or ambition. For companies with less exposure to emissions-related
risks, the Climate Policy will evaluate whether or not they have established any forward-looking GHG emissions reductions targets. In instances where companies have failed to establish such goals, the Climate Policy will vote against board members
responsible for oversight of environmental and social issues. In instances where such oversight is not provided, the Climate Policy will vote against the chair of the board. If the chair is combined with the CEO, the Climate Policy will vote against
the audit committee chair. </font></p> <p><font color="#ff2d00">Board-Level Oversight of Environmental and Social Risks </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">The insufficient oversight of environmental and social issues can present direct legal, financial, regulatory and reputational risks that could
serve to harm shareholder interests. As a result, the Climate Policy promotes oversight structures that ensure that companies are mitigating attendant risks ad capitalizing on related opportunities to the best extent possible. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">To that end, the Climate Policy looks to boards to maintain clear oversight of material risks to their operations, including those that are
environmental and social in nature. These risks could include, but are not limited to, matters related to climate change, human capital management, diversity, stakeholder relations, and health, safety &amp; environment. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Glass Lewis will review a company’s overall governance practices to identify which directors or board-level committees have been charged with
oversight of environmental and/or social issues. Given the importance of the board’s role in overseeing environmental and social risks, the Climate Policy will vote against members of the governance committee that fails to provide explicit
disclosure concerning the board’s role in overseeing these issues. </font></p> <p><font color="#ff2d00">Climate Risk </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Given the importance of companies mitigation and management of climate-related risks, the Climate Policy includes specific consideration for
companies’ disclosure of and policies concerning climate change. For companies included in the Climate Action 100+ focus list and those that operate in industries where the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) has determined
that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions represent a financially material risk, the Climate Policy will vote against the chair of the board in instances where a company has not adopted a net zero emissions target or ambition. For all other companies, the
Climate Policy will vote against the chair of the board in instances where companies have not established any forward-looking GHG emissions reduction targets. In both instances, if the chair of the board is also the company’s CEO, the Climate
Policy will vote against the chair of the audit committee. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy also takes into consideration investors’ growing
expectation for robust climate and sustainability disclosures. For Climate Action 100+ focus list companies, as well as those where SASB has determined that GHG emissions represent a material risk, the Climate Policy will vote against the chair
of the board when the company has failed to produce reporting that is aligned with the recommendations of the Task </font></p>

<p><font color="#ff2d00">Stakeholder Considerations </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">In
order to drive long-term shareholder value, companies require a social license to operate. A lack of consideration for stakeholders can present legal, regulatory, and reputational risks. With this view, the Climate Policy will vote against the chair
of the board in instances where companies in major blue-chip indices are not signatories or participants in the United Nations Global Compact (“UNGC”) or have not adopted a human rights policy that is aligned with the standards set forth
by the International Labour Organization (“ILO”) or the Universal Declaration on Human Rights (“UDHR”). </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">For U.S.
companies listed in the S&amp;P 500 index, the Climate Policy will also evaluate whether companies have provided sufficient disclosure concerning their workforce diversity. In instances where these companies have not disclosed their full <font>EEO-1</font> reports, the Climate Policy will vote against the nominating and governance chair. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9">Review of
Risk Management Controls </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy evaluates the risk management function of a public company on a <font><font>case-by-case</font></font> basis. Companies, particularly financial firms, should have a dedicated risk committee, or a committee on the board in charge of risk oversight, as well as a
chief risk officer who reports directly to that committee, not to the CEO or another executive of the company. When analyzing the risk management practices of public companies the Climate Policy takes note of any significant losses or write-downs on
financial assets and/or structured transactions. In cases where a company has disclosed a sizable loss or write-down, and where the company’s board-level risk committee’s poor oversight contributed to the loss, the Climate Policy will
recommend that shareholders vote against such committee members on that basis. In addition, in cases where a company maintains a significant level of financial risk exposure but fails to disclose any explicit form of board-level risk oversight
(committee or otherwise), the Climate Policy may vote against the chair of the board on that basis. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9">Slate Elections </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">In some countries, in particular Italy, companies elect their board members as a slate, whereby shareholders are unable to vote on the election of
an individual director, but rather are limited to voting for or against the board as a whole. The Climate Policy will generally support the slate if no major governance or board-related concerns have been raised in the analysis, and the slate
appears to support and protect the best interests of all shareholders. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9">Board Responsiveness </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Any time 20% or more of shareholders vote contrary to the recommendation of management on compensation or director elections proposals, the board
should, depending on the issue, demonstrate some level of responsiveness to address the concerns of shareholders. While the 20% threshold alone will not automatically generate a negative vote from the Climate Policy on a future proposal (e.g., to
vote against a director nominee, against a remuneration proposal, etc.), it will be a contributing factor to a vote against management’s recommendation in the event we determine that the board did not respond appropriately. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">As a general framework, the evaluation of board responsiveness involves a review of the publicly available disclosures released following the date
of the company’s last annual meeting up through the publication date of the most current Proxy Paper. </font></p>

</p> <p> </p> <p><font color="#1654f9">Separation of the Roles of CEO and Chair
</font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The separation of the positions of CEO and chair creates a better and more independent governance structure than a combined CEO/chair
position. The role of executives is to manage the business based on the course charted by the board. Executives should be in the position of reporting and answering to the board for their performance in achieving their goals as set out by the board.
This would become more complicated if they too held the position of chair as it would be difficult for them to fulfil the duty of being both the overseer and policy setter when they, the CEO/chair control both the agenda and boardroom. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy views an independent chair as better able to oversee the executives of the company and set a
<font>pro-shareholder</font> agenda without the management conflicts that a CEO and other executive insiders often face. Such oversight and concern for shareholders allows for a more proactive and effective board of
directors that is better able to look out for the interests of shareholders. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Furthermore, it is the board’s responsibility to
select a chief executive to best serve the company and its shareholders and to replace this person when his or her duties have not been appropriately fulfilled. Such a replacement becomes more difficult and happens less frequently when the chief
executive is also in the position of overseeing the board. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">However, even considering the above, the Climate Policy will not vote
against CEOs who also chair the board. The Climate Policy will generally support separating the positions of CEO and chair whenever the question is posed in a proxy, as in the long-term it is in the best interests of the company. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">In the absence of an independent chair, the Climate Policy will support the appointment of a presiding or lead independent director with authority
to set the agenda for the meeting and to lead sessions. In the case where the company has neither an independent chair nor independent lead director, the Climate Policy may vote against the chair of the governance committee. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9">Governance Following an IPO or <font>Spin-Off</font> </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Companies that have recently completed an initial public offering (IPO), or <font>spin-off</font> should be given
adequate time to fully adjust and comply with marketplace listing requirements and meet basic corporate governance standards. The Climate Policy generally allows the company a <font>one-year</font> period following the IPO
to comply with these requirements and as such refrains from voting based on governance standards (e.g., board independence, committee membership and structure, meeting attendance, etc.). </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">However, there are some cases that warrant shareholder action against the board of a company that have completed an IPO or <font>spin-off</font> in the past year. The Climate Policy will evaluate the terms of applicable governing documents when determining the recommendations and whether the shareholders rights will be severely restricted. In order
to come to a conclusion the following points will be considered: </font></p> <p> </p>

Incentive Plans </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy recognizes the value of equity-based incentive programs. When used appropriately, they provide a
means of linking an employee’s pay to a company’s performance, thereby aligning their interests with those of shareholders. In addition, equity-based compensation is an effective way to attract, retain and motivate key employees.
</font></p> <p><font color="#565656">In order to allow for meaningful shareholder review, incentive programs should generally include: </font></p>

should be reasonable relative to the performance of the business and total compensation paid to those included under the plan should be in line with compensation paid by the company’s peers. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_13"></a>Performance-Based Equity Compensation </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy supports performance-based equity compensation plans for senior executives; where it is warranted by both their performance,
and that of the company. While it is unnecessary to base equity-based compensation for all employees to company performance, placing such limitations on grants to senior executives is considered advisable (although in specific scenarios equity-based
compensation granted to senior executives without performance criteria is acceptable under Glass Lewis guidelines, such as in the case of moderate incentive grants made in an initial offer of employment). While it is not uncommon for a board to
state that tying equity compensation to performance goals may hinder them in attracting, and retaining, talented executives, the Climate Policy takes the stance that performance – based compensation aids in aligning executive interests to that
of shareholders, and as such will support the company in achieving its objectives. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy will generally vote in favor of
all performance-based option or share schemes; with the exception of plans that include a provision to allow for the <font>re-testing</font> of performance conditions; for which a vote against is recommended. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_14"></a>Director Compensation </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy supports <font>non-employee</font> directors receiving an appropriate form, and level, of compensation for the time and effort they spend serving on the board and its committees; and
director fees being at a level that allows a company to retain and attract qualified individuals. The Climate Policy compares the cost of compensation to that of peer companies with similar market capitalizations in the same country so that
compensation plans may be evaluated thoroughly, and a fair vote outcome reached. </font></p>

Benefits for Directors </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy will typically vote against the granting of retirement benefits to <font>non-executive</font> directors. Such extended payments can impair the objectivity and independence of these board members. Initial, and annual fees should be of a level that provides appropriate compensation to directors
throughout their service to the company. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_16"></a>Limits on Executive Compensation </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">As a general rule, shareholders should not seek to micromanage executive compensation programs. Such matters should be left to the board’s
compensation committee. The election of directors, and specifically those who sit on the compensation committee, is viewed as an appropriate mechanism for shareholders to express their support, or disapproval, of board policy on this issue. Further,
companies whose <font><font>pay-for-performance</font></font> is in line with their peers should be granted the flexibility to compensate their executives in a manner that drives sustainable
growth. However, the Climate Policy favors performance-based compensation as an effective means of motivating executives to act in the best interests of shareholders. Performance-based compensation may be limited if a chief executive’s pay is
capped at a low level rather than flexibly tied to the performance of the company. </font></p>

Structure </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_18"></a>Amendments to the Articles of Association </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy will evaluate proposed amendments to a company’s articles of association on a <font><font>case-by-case</font></font> basis. The Climate Policy is generally opposed to bundling several amendments under a single proposal as it prevents shareholders from evaluating each amendment on its own merits. In cases, where
it is a bundled amendment, the Climate Policy will evaluate each amendment individually and only support the proposal if, in the aggregate, the amendments are in the best interests of shareholders. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_19"></a>Anti-Takeover Measures </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9">Multi-Class Share Structures </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy views multi-class share structures as not in the best interests of
shareholders and instead is in favor of one vote per share. This structure operates as a safeguard for common shareholders by ensuring that those who hold a significant minority of shares are still able to weigh in on issues set forth by the board.
The economic stake of each shareholder should match their voting power and that no small group of shareholders, family or otherwise, should have differing voting rights from those of all other shareholders. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy considers a multi-class share structure as having the potential to negatively impact the overall corporate governance of a
company. Companies should have share class structures that protect the interests of <font>non-controlling</font> shareholders as well as any controlling entity. Therefore, the Climate Policy will generally vote in favor of
recapitalization proposals to eliminate multi-class share structures. Similarly, the Climate Policy will typically vote against proposals to adopt a new class of common stock. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9">Cumulative Voting </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">When voting
on cumulative voting proposals, the Climate Policy will factor in the independence of the board and the company’s governance structure. Cumulative voting is often found on ballots at companies where independence is lacking and where the
appropriate balances favoring the interests of shareholders are not in place. However, cumulative voting increases the ability of minority shareholders to elect a director by allowing shareholders to cast as many shares of stock they own multiplied
by the number of directors to be elected. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Cumulative voting allows shareholders to cast all their votes for one single nominee, or a
smaller number of nominees than up for election, thereby raising the likelihood of electing one or more of their preferred nominees to the board. Accordingly, cumulative voting generally acts as a safeguard for shareholders by ensuring that those
who hold a significant minority of shares can elect a candidate of their choosing to the board. As a result, the Climate Policy will typically vote in favor proposals concerning cumulative voting. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">In the case, where the company has adopted a true majority vote standard (i.e., where a director must receive a majority of votes cast to be
elected, as opposed to a modified policy indicated by a resignation policy only), the Climate Policy will vote against cumulative voting proposals due to the incompatibility of the two election methods. For companies, that have not adopted the true
majority vote standard but have some form of majority voting, the Climate Policy will also recommend voting against cumulative voting proposals if the company has also not adopted anti-takeover provisions and has been responsive to shareholder. In

<p><font color="#1654f9">Fair Price Provision </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Fair price
provisions, which are rare, require that certain minimum price and procedural requirements to be observed by any party that acquires more than a specified percentage of a corporation’s common stock. The intention of this provision is to protect
minority shareholder value when an acquirer seeks to accomplish a merger or other transaction which would eliminate or change the rights of the shareholder. Fair price provisions sometimes protecting the rights of shareholders in a takeover
situation. However, more often than not they act as an impediment to takeovers, potentially limiting gains to shareholders from a variety of transactions that could potentially increase share price. As a result, the Climate Policy will generally
vote to fair price provisions. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9">Supermajority Vote Requirements </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy favors a simple majority voting structure except where a supermajority voting requirement is explicitly intended to protect the
rights of minority shareholders in a controlled company. In the case of <font>non-</font> controlled companies, supermajority vote requirements act as impediments to shareholder action on ballot items that are critical to
their interests. For example, supermajority vote requirements can strongly limit the voice of shareholders in making decisions on critical matters such as the selling of the business. Supermajority vote requirements can also allow small groups of
shareholders to overrule and dictate the will of the majority of shareholders. Thus, having a simple majority is appropriate for protecting the rights of all shareholders. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9">Poison Pills (Shareholder Rights Plan) </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy will generally oppose companies’ adoption of poison pills, as they can reduce management accountability by substantially limiting opportunities for corporate takeovers. As a result, rights plans can prevent
shareholders from receiving a <font>buy-out</font> premium for their stock. Generally, the Climate Policy will vote against these plans to protect their financial interests. While boards should be given wide latitude in
directing the activities of the company and charting the company’s course, on an issue such as this where the link between the financial interests of shareholders and their right to consider and accept buyout offers is so </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">substantial, shareholders should be allowed to vote on whether or not they support such a plan’s implementation. In certain limited
circumstances, the Climate Policy will support a limited poison pill to accomplish a particular objective, such as the closing of an important merger, or a pill that contains what we believe to be a reasonable ‘qualifying offer’ clause.

<p><font color="#565656">Generally, the Climate Policy will support proposals to increase authorized shares up to 100% of the number of shares currently authorized unless,

<p><font color="#565656">Typically, the Climate Policy will recommend vote against provisions that would require advance notice of shareholder proposals or of director
nominees. Advance notice requirements typically range between three to six months prior to the annual meeting. These requirements often make it impossible for a shareholder who misses the deadline to present a shareholder proposal or director
nominee that may be in the best interests of the company. Shareholders should be able to review and vote on all proposals and director nominees and are able to vote against proposals that appear with little prior notice. Therefore, by setting
advance notice requirements it limits the opportunity for shareholders to raise issues that may arise after the window closes. </font></p>

Proposals </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy will support proposals to adopt a provision preventing the payment of greenmail, which would serve to
prevent companies from buying back company stock at significant premiums from a certain shareholder. The anti-greenmail provision helps to protect the company as it requires that a majority of shareholders other than the majority shareholder approve
the buyback, thus, eliminating cases where a majority shareholder could attempt to charge a board a large premium for the shares. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_27">
</a>Virtual-Only Shareholder Meetings </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">A growing number of companies have elected to hold shareholder meetings by virtual means only.
The Climate Policy supports companies allowing a virtual option alongside an <font>in-person</font> meeting, so long as the shareholder interests are not compromised. Without proper controls, conducting a virtual-only
meeting of shareholders could eliminate or significantly limit the rights of shareholders to confront, and ask management on any concerns they may have. When companies decide to only hold virtual-only meetings, the Climate Policy will examine the
level of disclosure provided by the company on the virtual meeting procedures and base the voting outcome on that level of disclosure. </font></p>

Proposals </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy has a strong emphasis on mitigating climate-related risks and promoting climate-related accountability.
At the same time, the Climate Policy places significant focus on materiality and the protection and enhancement of shareholder value. Because not all shareholder proposals, particularly those that deal with environmental and social issues, make
sense in the context of a company’s unique operations and circumstances, the Climate Policy will carefully examine the request of each proposal to ensure that it promotes a company’s environmental and financial sustainability. With the
exception of shareholder proposals addressed below, the Climate Policy will generally only support proposals that have been determined to be financially material for the company. Specifically, for most environmental and social proposals, the Climate
Policy will support such proposals when: (i) the proposal is deemed to address a material topic for the Company and its industry, as determined by SASB; or (ii) Glass Lewis’ standard policy recommends in favor of the resolution.
</font></p> <p><font color="#565656">In addition, in extraordinary cases, when companies have failed to adequately mitigate risks stemming from environmental or social
practices, the Climate Policy may vote against: </font></p> <p> </p>

Climate Policy will vote in favor of initiatives that seek to enhance shareholder rights, such as the introduction of majority voting to elect directors, the adoption and amendment of proxy access bylaws, the elimination/reduction of supermajority
provisions, the declassification of the board, the submission of shareholder rights’ plans to a shareholder vote, and the principle of one share, one vote. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy will also support proposals aimed at increasing the diversity of boards or management as well as those requesting additional
information concerning workforce diversity and the adoption of more inclusive nondiscrimination policies. Further, the Climate Policy will support enhanced oversight of environmental and social issues at the board level by supporting resolutions
calling for the creation of an climate-related committee of the board or proposals requesting that the board adopt a subject-matter expert, such as one with deep knowledge and experience in climate change-related issues. The Climate Policy will also
generally vote for proposals seeking to increase disclosure of a company’s business ethics and code of conduct, as well as of its activities that relate to social welfare. </font></p>

<p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy will generally support proposals regarding the environment, in particular, those seeking improved sustainability reporting and
disclosure about company practices which impact the environment. The Climate Policy will vote in favor of increased disclosure of a company’s environmental risk through company-specific disclosure as well as compliance with international
environmental conventions and adherence to environmental principles. Similarly, the Climate Policy will support proposals requesting companies develop greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals, comprehensive recycling programs, and other proactive
means to mitigate a company’s environmental footprint. </font></p>

</p> <p> </p> <p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy will also support
proposals requesting that companies provide certain disclosures or adopt certain policies related to mitigating their climate change-related risks. For example, regardless of industry, the Climate Policy will support proposals requesting that
companies disclose information concerning their scenario analyses or that request the company provide disclosure in line with certain reporting recommendations, such as those promulgated by the TCFD. Further, the Climate Policy will support
proposals requesting that a company consider energy efficiency and renewable energy sources in its project development and overall business strategy. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">With respect to issues related to bioengineering and nanotechnology, the Climate Policy will carefully scrutinize any proposals requesting that a company adopt a policy concerning these matters. In general, the Climate Policy
support proposals that seek additional reporting on these topics, as well as the development of safety standards to regulate their use. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy will evaluate a company’s impact on the environment, in addition to the regulatory risk a company may face by not adopting
environmentally responsible policies. Further, the Climate Policy will consider voting against directors for not appropriately overseeing environmental risk. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy will also support proposals seeking to tie executive compensation to climate mitigation activities or those that request that
companies adjust their compensation practices to ensure that they are more aligned with a transition to a <font>low-carbon</font> economy. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_32"></a>Say on Climate </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9">Shareholder Proposals </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Beginning in 2021, companies began placing management proposals on their ballots that ask
shareholders to vote on their climate transition plans, or a Say on Climate vote. The Climate Policy will generally recommend in favor of shareholder proposals requesting that companies adopt a Say on Climate vote. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9">Management Proposals </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">When
evaluating management-sponsored votes seeking approval of climate transition plans the Climate Policy looks to the board to provide information concerning the governance of the Say on Climate vote. Specifically, the Climate Policy evaluates whether
companies provide sufficient disclosure concerning the board’s role in setting strategy in light of this vote, and how the board intends to interpret the vote results for the proposal. In instances where disclosure concerning the governance of
the Say on Climate vote is not present, the Climate Policy will either abstain, or, depending on the quality of the plan presented, will vote against the proposal. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy also looks to companies to clearly articulate their climate plans in a distinct and easily understandable document, which, as a
best practice, should generally be aligned with the recommendations of the TCFD. In this disclosure, it is important that companies clearly explain their goals, how their GHG emissions targets support achievement of broader goals (i.e. net zero
emissions goals), and any foreseeable obstacles that could hinder their progress on these initiatives. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">When evaluating these
proposals, the Climate Policy will take into account a variety of factors, including: (i) the request of the resolution (e.g., whether companies are asking shareholders to approve its disclosure or its size; </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">whether the company’s GHG emissions targets and the disclosure of these targets appear reasonable in light of its operations and risk
profile; and (iv) where the company is on its climate reporting journey (e.g., whether the company has been reporting and engaging with shareholders on climate risk for a number of years or if this is a

the Climate Policy will determine if sufficient disclosure has been made concerning a company’s capital allocations and expenditures in the context of its strategy and will also evaluate any stated net zero ambitions or targets. If either of
these are absent, the Climate Policy will generally vote against management Say on Climate proposals. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_33"></a>Social Proposals </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy will support proposals requesting that a company develop sustainable business practices, such as animal welfare policies, human rights policies, and fair lending policies. Furthermore, the Climate Policy will
support reporting and reviewing a company’s political and charitable spending as well as its lobbying practices. In addition, the Climate Policy will support proposals requesting that companies cease political spending or associated activities.
</font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy will also generally support enhancing the rights of workers, as well as considering the communities and broader
constituents in the areas in which companies do business. Accordingly, the Climate Policy will generally vote for proposals requesting that companies provide greater disclosure regarding impact on local stakeholders, workers’ rights and human
rights in general. In addition, the Climate Policy will support proposals for companies to adopt or comply with certain codes of conduct relating to labor standards, human rights conventions, and corporate responsibility at large. The Climate Policy
will also support proposals </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">requesting independent verification of a company’s contractors’ compliance with labor and human
rights standards. In addition, the Climate Policy supports the International Labor Organization standards and encourage companies to adopt such standards in its business operations. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy will provide for a review of the performance and oversight of certain directors in instances in which a company is found to
have violated international human rights standards. Pursuant to the Climate Policy, if directors have not adequately overseen the overall business strategy of the company to ensure that basic human rights standards are met or if a company is subject
to regulatory or legal action with a foreign government or entity due to human rights violations, the Policy may vote against directors taking into account the severity of the violations and the outcome of the claims. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy also generally votes in favor of proposals seeking increased disclosure regarding public health and safety issues, including
those related to product responsibility. In particular, the Climate Policy supports proposals calling for the labeling of the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), the elimination or reduction of toxic emissions and use of toxic chemicals in
manufacturing, and the prohibition of tobacco sales to minors. The Climate Policy also supports proposals seeking a report on a company’s drug reimportation guidelines, as well as on a company’s ethical responsibility as it relates to drug
distribution and manufacture. The Climate Policy further supports proposals related to worker safety and companies’ compliance with internationally recognized human rights or safety standards. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_34"></a>Compensation Proposals </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy recognizes that ESG performance factors should be an important component of the overall consideration of proper levels of executive performance and compensation. Therefore, the Climate Policy generally votes in
favor of proposals seeking to tie executive compensation to performance measures such as compliance with environmental regulations, health and safety regulations, nondiscrimination laws and compliance with international human rights standards.
Furthermore, the Climate Policy will generally support proposals that seek to evaluate overall director performance based on environmental and social criteria. </font></p>

seeking to prohibit or require more disclosure about stock hedging and pledging by executives. The Climate Policy will also generally support proposals requesting that companies adopt executive stock retention policies and prohibiting the
accelerated vesting of equity awards. Furthermore, the Climate Policy will vote in favor of shareholder proposals to link pay with performance, to eliminate or require shareholder approval of golden coffins, and to clawback unearned bonuses.
Finally, the Climate Policy will support proposals requesting disclosure from companies regarding gender pay inequity and company initiatives to reduce the gap in compensation paid to women compared to men. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_35"></a>Lobbying and Political Spending Proposals </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">For many years, there has been an attempt by many shareholders to promote accountability in companies’ political spending and lobbying
activities by requesting that companies provide additional information concerning their attendant expenditures and the oversight provided to these issues. More recently, companies have received these proposals largely on account of how they were
using corporate resources to influence public policy concerning climate change. This focus extends beyond companies’ direct political and lobbying expenditures to the funds that companies are providing to the trade associations of which they
are members in order to effect changes to climate policy. It is particularly important that companies reconcile any divergence between their own public stances on important issues, such as climate change, and the views held by their trade
associations. Accordingly, the Climate Policy will not only broadly support proposals aimed at enhancing the transparency of companies’ political contributions and lobbying expenditures, but it will also broadly support proposals requesting
that companies provide additional disclosure concerning how they are engaging with trade associations on issues of climate change and whether they have identified any differences between their own positions climate change and those held by their
trade associations. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_36"></a>Trojan Horse Proposals </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy will carefully examine each proposal’s merits in order to ensure it seeks enhanced environmental disclosure and/or
practices, and is not conversely aimed at limiting environmental or social disclosure or consideration. Accordingly, the Climate Policy will not support such proposals, which are often referred to as “Trojan Horse” proposals. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_37"></a><font>Vote-No</font> Campaigns </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">The Climate Policy will carefully review any <font>“vote-no”</font> campaigns launched by shareholders as a
result of their concerns regarding a company’s failure to adequately oversee environmental and social risks or those related to poor compensation or governance practices. When it is determined that such campaigns either address a failure of
oversight on behalf of the company or that broadly seek to promote more responsible corporate behavior, the Climate Policy may vote in line with the recommendations of the shareholder(s) running the <font>vote-no</font>
campaign. </font></p>

Changes for 2024 </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">On an ongoing basis, Glass Lewis extensively reviews and consults with stakeholders and clients on its policy
guidelines. Annually, Glass Lewis updates its policy guidelines in accordance with market trends, developments and the results of our ongoing consultations. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">In advance of the 2024 proxy season, Glass Lewis has not made material revisions to the Corporate Governance Focused Thematic Voting Policy.
</font></p> <p><font color="#ff2d00"><a name="gl745737a_3"></a>Overview </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The Corporate Governance Focused Policy is designed to ensure compliance with the fiduciary responsibility to drive long-term, economic shareholder value with additional emphasis on widely accepted components of corporate
governance. While the Policy reflects analysis and identification of both financial and corporate governance risk, the Corporate Governance Focused Policy also includes consideration of key shareholder rights in making proxy voting decisions.
</font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The Corporate Governance Focused Policy will vote in favor of governance structures that will drive positive performance or enhance
shareholder value and believes that policies are generally best left to management and the board absent a showing of egregious or illegal conduct that might threaten shareholder value. The most crucial test of a board’s commitment to the
company and to its shareholders is the performance of the board and its members. The performance of directors in their capacity as board members and as executives of the company, when applicable, and in their roles at other companies where they
serve is critical to this evaluation. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Directors are formed into three categories based on an examination of the type of relationship
they have with the company. The table below includes a breakdown of how Glass Lewis classifies these director relationships with the company. </font></p> <p> </p>

Boards </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The Corporate Governance Focused Policy favors the repeal of staggered boards in favor of the annual election of directors.
Staggered boards are generally less accountable to shareholders than annually elected directors to the board. In addition, the annual election of directors encourages board members to focus on protecting the interests of shareholders. Further to
this, if shareholders are unsatisfied with board members the annual election of directors allows them to voice these concerns. </font></p> <p><font color="#ff2d00"><a name="gl745737a_11">

<p><font color="#565656">The role of the auditor is crucial in protecting shareholder value. Like directors, auditors should be free from conflicts of interest and should
assiduously avoid situations that require them to make choices between their own interests and the interests of the shareholders. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The
Corporate Governance Focused Policy will generally support the ratification of the auditor and approval to set the audit fees, except in cases where <font>non-audit</font> fees are greater than half of the total fees, or
there has been an egregious oversight by the auditor that comprises the integrity of their audit or independence. </font></p> <p><font color="#ff2d00"><a name="gl745737a_13">
</a>Compensation </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_14"></a>Compensation Reports and Compensation Policies </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">As a general rule, shareholders should not seek to micromanage executive compensation programs. Such matters should be left to the board’s
compensation committee. The election of directors, and specifically those who sit on the compensation committee, is viewed as an<b> </b>appropriate mechanism for shareholders to express their support, or disapproval, of board policy on this issue.
Further, companies whose <font><font>pay-for-performance</font></font> is in line with their peers should be granted the flexibility to compensate their executives in a manner that drives
sustainable<b> </b>growth. The Corporate Governance Focused Policy favors performance-based compensation as an effective means of motivating executives to act in the best interests of shareholders. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Depending on the market, compensation report and compensation policy vote proposals may be either advisory or binding, e.g. in the UK a <font>non-binding</font> compensation report based upon the most recent fiscal year is voted upon annually, and a forward-looking compensation policy will be subject to a binding vote every three years. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">In all markets, company filings are evaluated closely to determine how well information pertinent to compensation practices has been disclosed,
the extent to which overall compensation is tied to performance, which performance metrics have been employed, as well as how the company’s remuneration practices compare to that of its peers. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">The Corporate Governance Focused Policy will vote against the approval of a compensation report or policy in instances where the company has poor
financial performance over the previous three-year period, there is a severe and sustained disconnect between executive pay and performance, and Glass Lewis believes that the compensation plan or policy does not warrant shareholder support.

Incentive Plans </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The Corporate Governance Focused Policy recognizes the value of equity-based incentive programs. When used
appropriately, they provide a means of linking an employee’s pay to a company’s performance, thereby aligning their interests with those of shareholders. In addition, equity-based compensation is an effective way to attract, retain and
motivate key employees. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">In order to allow for meaningful shareholder review, incentive programs should generally include: </font></p>

Focused Policy generally supports the adoption of and amendment to equity-based incentive programs except in cases where adoption of the proposal would result in significant dilution to shareholders. In these instances, the size of the company is
taken into consideration when determining the appropriate level of dilution. For example, small cap companies may be afforded a larger degree of dilution given the unique needs to attract and retain talent through equity-based programs, whereas
large cap companies are expected to craft incentive plans where dilution does not exceed 20%. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_16"></a>Performance-Based Equity Compensation </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">The Corporate Governance Focused Policy supports performance-based equity compensation plans for senior executives; where it is warranted by both
their performance, and that of the company. While it is not uncommon for a board to state that tying equity compensation to performance goals may hinder them in attracting, and retaining, talented executives, the Corporate Governance Focused Policy
takes the stance that performance-based compensation aids in aligning executive interests to that of shareholders, and as such will support the company in achieving its objectives. </font></p>

evaluate proposed amendments to a company’s articles of association on a <font><font>case-by-case</font></font> basis. In cases where the article amendments are bundled, the Corporate
Governance Focused Policy will evaluate each amendment individually and may recommend against the proposal if, in the aggregate, the amendments are not in the best interests of shareholders. </font></p>

structures as not in the best interests of shareholders and instead is in favor of one vote per share. This structure operates as a safeguard for common shareholders by ensuring that those who hold a significant minority of shares are still able to
weigh in on issues set forth by the board. The economic stake of each shareholder should match their voting power and that no small group of shareholders, family or otherwise, should have differing voting rights from those of all other shareholders.

</p> <p> </p> <p><font color="#565656">The Corporate Governance Focused Policy
considers a dual-class share structure as having the potential to negatively impact the overall corporate governance of a company. Companies should have share class structures that protect the interests of
<font>non-controlling</font> shareholders as well as any controlling entity. Therefore, the Corporate Governance Focused Policy will generally vote in favor of proposals to eliminate dual-class share structures. Similarly,
the Corporate Governance Focused Policy will typically vote against proposals to adopt a new class of common stock. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_21">
</a>Cumulative Voting </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Cumulative voting increases the ability of minority shareholders to elect a director by allowing shareholders to
cast as many shares of stock they own multiplied by the number of directors to be elected. Cumulative voting allows shareholders to cast all their votes for one single nominee, or a smaller number of nominees than up for election, thereby raising
the likelihood of electing one or more of their preferred nominees to the board. Accordingly, cumulative voting generally acts as a safeguard for shareholders by ensuring that those who hold a significant minority of shares can elect a candidate of
their choosing to the board. The Corporate Governance Focused Policy will generally oppose the adoption of cumulative voting unless the company has not adopted any form of majority voting, has adopted anti-takeover provisions, and has been
historically unresponsive to shareholders. </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">In instances where a company has not adopted majority voting standards and is facing both a
proposal on the adoption of majority voting and a proposal to adopt cumulative voting, the Corporate Governance Focused Policy will support only the majority voting proposal. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_22"></a>Fair Price Provision </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">Fair price provisions, which are rare, require certain minimum price and procedural requirements to be observed by any party that acquires more than a specified percentage of a corporation’s common stock. The intention of this
provision is to protect minority shareholder value when an acquirer seeks to accomplish a merger or other transaction which would eliminate or change the rights of the shareholder. Fair price provisions sometimes protect the rights of shareholders
in a takeover situation. However, more often than not they act as an impediment to takeovers, potentially limiting gains to shareholders from a variety of transactions that could potentially increase share price. As a result, the Corporate
Governance Focused Policy will generally vote to remove fair price provisions. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_23"></a>Supermajority Vote
Requirements </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The Corporate Governance Focused Policy favors a simple majority voting structure except where a supermajority voting
requirement is explicitly intended to protect the rights of minority shareholders in a controlled company. In the case of <font>non-controlled</font> companies, supermajority vote requirements act as impediments to
shareholder action on ballot items that are critical to their interests. For example, supermajority vote requirements can strongly limit the voice of shareholders in making decisions on critical matters such as the selling of the business.
Supermajority vote requirements can also allow small groups of shareholders to overrule and dictate the will of the majority of shareholders. Thus, having a simple majority is appropriate for protecting the rights of all shareholders. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_24"></a>Poison Pills (Shareholder Rights Plan) </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">The Corporate Governance Focused Policy will generally oppose companies’ adoption of poison pills, as they can reduce management
accountability by substantially limiting opportunities for corporate takeovers. As a result, rights plans can prevent shareholders from receiving a <font>buy-out</font> premium for their stock. Generally, the

vote against these plans to protect shareholders’ financial interests. While boards should be given wide latitude in directing the activities of the company and charting the company’s course, on an issue such as this where the link between
the financial interests of shareholders and their right to consider and accept buyout offers is so substantial, shareholders should be allowed to vote on whether or not they support such a plan’s implementation. In certain limited
circumstances, the Corporate Governance Focused Policy will support a limited poison pill to accomplish a particular objective, such as the closing of an important merger, or a pill that contains what we believe to be a reasonable ‘qualifying
offer’ clause. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_25"></a>Increase in Authorized Shares </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Adequate capital stock is important to a company’s operation. When analyzing a request for additional shares, the Corporate Governance
Focused Policy will typically review four common reasons why a company may need additional capital stock: (i) stock split; (ii) shareholder defenses; (iii) financing for acquisitions; and (iv) financing for operations.
</font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The Corporate Governance Focused Policy believes that having adequate shares to allow management to make quick decisions and
effectively operate the business is critical. The Corporate Governance Focused Policy favors that, when a company is undertaking significant transactions, management will justify its use of additional shares rather than providing a blank check in
the form of large pools of unallocated shares available for any purpose. The Corporate Governance Focused Policy will support proposals to increase authorized shares up to 100% of the number of shares currently authorized unless, after the increase
the company would be left with less than 30% of its authorized shares outstanding. In markets where such authorities typically also authorize the board to issue new shares without separate shareholder approval, the Corporate Governance Focused
Policy applies the policy described below on the issuance of shares. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_26"></a>Issuance of Shares </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Generally, the Corporate Governance Focused Policy will support proposals to authorize the board to issue shares (with <font>pre-emptive</font> rights) up to 100% of issued share capital. The authority of these shares should not exceed five years unless that is the market best practice. In accordance with the different market practices, the
specific thresholds for share issuance can vary. As a result, the Corporate Governance Focused Policy will vote on these proposals on a <font><font>case-by-case</font></font> basis. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">The Corporate Governance Focused Policy will also generally support proposals to suspend <font>pre-emption</font>
rights for a maximum of <font>5-20%</font> of the issued ordinary share capital of the company, depending on best practice in the country in which the company is located. This authority should not exceed five years, or
less for some countries. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_27"></a>Repurchase of Shares </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">The Corporate Governance Focused Policy typically supports proposals to repurchase shares when the plan includes the following provisions:

<p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_28"></a>Reincorporation </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">A company is in the best position to determine the appropriate jurisdiction of incorporation. The Corporate Governance Focused Policy will factor in several elements when a management proposal to reincorporate the company is put to
vote. These elements include reviewing the relevant financial benefits, generally related to incorporate tax treatment, as well as changes in corporate governance provisions, especially those related to shareholder rights, resulting from the change
in domicile. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_29"></a>Advance Notice Requirements </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">Typically, the Corporate Governance Focused Policy will vote against provisions that would require advance notice of shareholder proposals or of
director nominees. Advance notice requirements typically range between three to six months prior to the annual meeting. These requirements often make it impossible for a shareholder who misses the deadline to present a shareholder proposal or
director nominee that may be in the best interests of the company. Shareholders should be able to review and vote on all proposals and director nominees and are able to vote against proposals that appear with little prior notice. Therefore, by
setting advance notice requirements it limits the opportunity for shareholders to raise issues that may arise after the window closes. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_30"></a>Anti-Greenmail Proposals </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The Corporate Governance Focused Policy will support proposals to adopt a provision preventing the payment of greenmail, which would serve to prevent companies from buying back company stock at significant premiums from a certain
shareholder. The anti-greenmail provision helps to protect the company as it requires that a majority of shareholders other than the majority shareholder approve the buyback, thus, eliminating cases where a majority shareholder could attempt to
charge a board a large premium for the shares. </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_31"></a>Virtual-Only Shareholder Meetings </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">A growing number of companies have elected to hold shareholder meetings by virtual means only. The Corporate Governance Focused Policy supports
companies allowing a virtual option alongside an <font>in-person</font> meeting, so long as the shareholder interests are not compromised. Without proper controls, conducting a virtual-only meeting of shareholders could
eliminate or significantly limit the rights of shareholders to confront, and ask management on any concerns they may have. When companies decide to only hold virtual-only meetings, the Corporate Governance Focused Policy will examine the level of
disclosure assuring that shareholders will be afforded the same rights and opportunities to participate as they would at an <font>in-person</font> meeting. </font></p>
<p><font color="#ff2d00"><a name="gl745737a_32"></a>Merger, Acquisitions and Contested Meetings </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">For merger and acquisition proposals, the Corporate Governance Focused Policy undertakes a thorough examination of all elements of the
transactions and determine the transaction’s likelihood of maximizing shareholder return. In order to make a voting recommendation, the Corporate Governance Focused Policy will examine the process conducted, the specific parties and individuals
involved in negotiating an agreement, as well as the economic and governance terms of the proposal. </font></p>

</p> <p> </p> <p><font color="#565656">In the case of contested merger
situations, or board proxy fights, the Corporate Governance Focused Policy will evaluate the plan presented by the dissident party and how, if elected, it plans to enhance or protect shareholder value. The Corporate Governance Focused Policy will
also consider any concerns presented by the board, including any plans for improving the performance of the company, when making the ultimate recommendation. In addition, the Corporate Governance Focused Policy will support shareholder proposals
asking a company to consider the effects of a merger, <font>spin-off,</font> or other transaction on its employees and other stakeholders. </font></p>
<p><font color="#ff2d00"><a name="gl745737a_33"></a>Shareholder Proposals </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The Corporate Governance Focused Policy has a strong emphasis on electing a qualified board to manage the strategic direction of the company. The Corporate Governance Focused Policy believes that directors who are conscientiously
exercising their fiduciary duties will typically have more and better information about the Company and its situation than shareholders. Those directors are also charged with making business decisions and overseeing management. The default view,
therefore, is that the board and management, absent a suspicion of illegal or unethical conduct, will make decisions that are in the best interests of shareholders. Shareholder proposals are carefully reviewed to determine if the action or report
requested is necessary in light of the company’s current practices.  </font></p> <p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_34"></a>Governance Proposals
</font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The Corporate Governance Focused Policy supports increased shareholder participation and access to a company and its board of
directors. Accordingly, the Corporate Governance Focused Policy will vote in favor of initiatives that seek to enhance shareholder rights, such as the introduction of majority voting to elect directors, the adoption of proxy access bylaws, the
elimination/reduction of supermajority provisions, the declassification of the board, the submission of shareholder rights’ plans to a shareholder vote, and the principle of one share, one vote. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">The Corporate Governance Focused Policy will support shareholders’ right to call a special meeting and act by written consent; however, only
one of those provisions is necessary. As such, the Corporate Governance Focused Policy will recommend against shareholder proposals to adopt special meeting or written consent provisions where one such provision already exists. Similarly, the
Corporate Governance Focused Policy will support the board-sponsored special meeting or written consent proposal when competing management and shareholder proposals are on the same agenda. </font></p>
<p><font color="#565656">The Corporate Governance Focused Policy generally opposes shareholder proposals to separate the role of chair and CEO, except in limited
circumstances where there is no independent oversight of the board through a role such as lead director, and where Glass Lewis’ review of the company’s circumstances warrants supporting the proposal. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1654f9"><a name="gl745737a_35"></a>Compensation Proposals </font></p> <p><font color="#565656">The Corporate Governance Focused Policy does not believe shareholders should be directly involved in the design and negotiation of compensation packages. Such matters should be left to the board’s wholly-independent
compensation committee, which can be held accountable for its decisions through the election of directors. Further, in many markets, shareholders have the opportunity to voice their approval or dissatisfaction with respect to Company’s
executive compensation policies, practice, and disclosure through a </font></p>

</p> <p> </p> <p><font color="#1c82ba"><b><a name="ca745737a_1"></a>INTRODUCTION
</b></font></p> <p>ISS’ Catholic Advisory Services division recognizes that faith-based and other socially responsible investors have dual objectives: financial and
social. Religious and socially responsible investors invest for economic gain, as do all investors, but they also require that companies in which they invest conduct their business in a socially and environmentally responsible manner. </p>
<p>The dual objectives carry through to proxy voting activity, after the security selection process is completed. In voting their shares, faith-based socially responsible
institutional shareholders are concerned not only with sustainable economic returns to shareholders and good corporate governance, but also with the ethical behavior of corporations and the social and environmental impact of their actions. </p>
<p>Catholic Advisory Services has, therefore, developed faith-based proxy voting guidelines for Catholic and other Christian religious institutions that are consistent
with the objectives of socially responsible shareholders as well as the teachings of Catholicism and Christianity as a whole. On matters of social and environmental impact, the guidelines seek to reflect a broad consensus of the faith-based socially
responsible investing community. Generally, we take as our frame of reference policies and proposals promulgated by the Catholic Bishops’ Pastoral on economics, the Socially Responsible Investment Guidelines adopted by the Bishops, and the
policies developed by members of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR). </p> <p>On matters of corporate governance, executive compensation, and
corporate structure, these faith-based proxy voting guidelines are based on a commitment to create and preserve economic value and to advance principles of best practice corporate governance and shareholder rights, consistent with responsibilities
to society and the environment as a whole. </p> <p>The guidelines provide an overview of Catholic Advisory Services’ faith-based proxy voting policy for Catholic and
other Christian denomination institutions. We note there may be cases in which the final vote recommendation varies from the vote guideline due to the fact that we closely examine the merits of each proposal and consider relevant information and
company-specific circumstances in arriving at our decisions. These guidelines are revised on an annual basis to take into account emerging issues and trends on environmental, social and corporate governance topics, as well as the evolution of market
standards, regulatory changes and client feedback. </p>

</p> <p> </p> <p><font color="#1c82ba"><b><a name="ca745737a_2"></a>1. Board of
Directors </b></font></p> <p>A corporation’s board of directors sits at the apogee of the corporate governance system. Though they normally delegate responsibility
for the management of the business to the senior executives they select and oversee, directors bear ultimate responsibility for the conduct of the corporation’s business. The role of directors in publicly held corporations has undergone
considerable change in recent years. Once derided as rubber stamps for management, directors of public corporations today are expected to serve as effective guardians of shareholders’ interests. </p>
<p>Voting on directors and board-related issues is the most important use of the shareholder franchise, not simply a routine proxy item. Although uncontested director
elections do not present alternative nominees from whom to choose, a high percentage of opposition votes is an expression of shareholder dissatisfaction and should be sufficient to elicit a meaningful response from management. </p>
<p>The role and responsibilities of directors has increasingly been the subject of much discussion and debate, given the current economic climate and the difficulties many
companies now face in their respective markets. Influential organizations, including the American Law Institute, the American Bar Association, the National Association of Corporate Directors, and the Business Roundtable have issued reports and
recommendations regarding the duties and accountability of corporate boards. Both mainstream and alternative media outlets have highlighted the numerous gaps within risk oversight of company boards and individual directors, and many institutional
investors, in response, have capitalized on their rights as stakeholders to prompt changes. Corporations have taken notice, implementing many of the reforms championed by their shareholders. </p>
<p>Although differences of opinion remain, a fairly strong consensus has emerged on a number of key issues. It is widely agreed that the board’s most important
responsibility is to ensure that the corporation is managed in the shareholders’ best long-term economic interest. This will often require boards to consider the impact of their actions on other constituencies, including employees, customers,
local communities, and the environment. </p> <p> </p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><font color="#3d72ff">∎</font></td>
<td> </td>
<td> <p>The board’s principal functions are widely agreed to consist of the following: </p></td></tr></table>
<table>
<tr>
<td><font color="#3d72ff">∎</font></td>
<td> </td>
<td> <p>To select, evaluate, and if necessary, replace management, including the chief executive officer; </p></td></tr></table>
<table>
<tr>
<td><font color="#3d72ff">∎</font></td>
<td> </td>
<td> <p>To review and approve major strategies and financial objectives; </p></td></tr></table>

</p></td></tr></table>
<table>
<tr>
<td><font color="#3d72ff">∎</font></td>
<td> </td>
<td> <p>To nominate directors and otherwise ensure that the board functions effectively. </p></td></tr></table>
<p>Boards are expected to have a majority of directors independent of management. The independent directors are expected to organize much of the board’s work, even if
the chief executive officer also serves as Chair of the board. Key committees of the board are expected to be entirely independent of management. It is expected that boards will engage in critical self-evaluation of themselves and of individual
members. Individual directors, in turn, are expected to devote significant amounts of time to their duties, to limit the number of directorships they accept, and to own a meaningful amount of stock in companies on whose boards they serve. Directors
are ultimately responsible to the corporation’s shareholders. The most direct expression of this responsibility is the requirement that directors be elected to their positions by the shareholders. Shareholders are also asked to vote on a number
of other matters regarding the role, structure, and composition of the board. Catholic Advisory Services classifies directors as either executive, <font>non-independent</font>
<font>non-executive,</font> or independent directors. </p> <p><font color="#6d5e56"><b><a name="ca745737a_3"></a>Uncontested Election of

<table>
<tr>

<td><i><u>Board Accountability</u></i>: Accountability refers to the promotion of transparency into a company’s governance practices and annual board elections and the provision to shareholders the ability to remove

<td><i><u>Board Responsiveness</u></i>: Directors should be responsive to shareholders, particularly in regard to shareholder proposals that receive a majority vote or management proposals that receive significant
opposition and to tender offers where a majority of shares are tendered. Furthermore, shareholders should expect directors to devote sufficient time and resources to oversight of the company. </td></tr></table>

<td><u><i>Director Diversity/Competence</i></u>: Companies should seek a diverse board of directors who can add value to the board through their specific skills or expertise and who can devote sufficient time and commitment
to serve effectively. Boards should be of a size appropriate to accommodate diversity, expertise, and independence, while ensuring active and collaborative participation by all members. Boards should be sufficiently diverse to ensure

</p> <p> </p> <p><b>Footnotes: </b></p>
<p><b><i><sup>i</sup></i></b> The definition of officer will generally follow that of a
“Section 16 officer” (officers subject to Section 16 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934) and includes: the chief executive, operating, financial, legal, technology, and accounting officers of a company (including the
president, treasurer, secretary, controller, or any vice president in charge of a principal business unit, division, or policy function). Current interim officers are included in this category. For private companies, the equivalent positions are
applicable. A <font>non-employee</font> director serving as an officer due to statutory requirements (e.g. corporate secretary) will generally be classified as a <font>Non-Independent</font> <font>Non-Executive</font> Director under “Any material relationship with the company.” However, if the company provides explicit disclosure that the director is not receiving additional compensation exceeding $10,000
per year for serving in that capacity, then the director will be classified as an Independent Director. </p> <p><b><i><sup>ii </sup></i></b>“Affiliate” includes a subsidiary, sibling company, or parent company. Catholic Advisory Services uses 50 percent control ownership by the parent company as the standard for
applying its affiliate designation. The manager/advisor of an externally managed issuer (EMI) is considered an affiliate. </p> <p><b><i><sup>iii</sup></i></b> Includes any former CEO of the company prior to the company’s initial public offering (IPO). </p>
<p><b><i><sup>iv</sup></i></b> When there is a former CEO of a special purpose acquisition
company (SPAC) serving on the board of an acquired company, Catholic Advisory Services will generally classify such directors as independent unless determined otherwise taking into account the following factors: the applicable listing standards
determination of such director’s independence; any operating ties to the firm; and the existence of any other conflicting relationships or related party transactions. </p>
<p><b><i><sup>v </sup></i></b>Catholic Advisory Services will look at the terms of the interim
officer’s employment contract to determine if it contains severance pay, long-term health and pension benefits, or other such standard provisions typically contained in contracts of permanent,
<font>non-temporary</font> CEOs. Catholic Advisory Services will also consider if a formal search process was under way for a full-time officer at the time. </p>
<p><b><i><sup>vi </sup></i></b>“Immediate family member” follows the SEC’s
definition of such and covers spouses, parents, children, step-parents, step-children, siblings, <font>in-laws,</font> and any person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing the household of any director, nominee for
director, executive officer, or significant shareholder of the company. </p>
<p><b><i><sup>vii</sup></i></b> Professional services can be characterized as advisory in nature,
generally involve access to sensitive company information or to strategic decision-making, and typically have a commission- or <font>fee-based</font> payment structure. Professional services generally include, but are not
limited to the following: investment banking/financial advisory services; commercial banking (beyond deposit services); investment services; insurance services; accounting/audit services; consulting services; marketing services; legal services;
property management services; realtor services; lobbying services; executive search services; and IT consulting services. The following would generally be considered transactional relationships and not professional services: deposit services; IT
tech support services; educational services; and construction services. The case of participation in a banking syndicate by a <font>non-lead</font> bank should be considered a transactional (and hence subject to the
associated materiality test) rather than a professional relationship. “Of Counsel” relationships are only considered immaterial if the individual does not receive any form of compensation (in excess of $10,000 per year) from, or is a
retired partner of, the firm providing the professional service. The case of a company providing a professional service to one of its directors or to an entity with which one of its directors is affiliated, will be considered a transactional rather
than a professional relationship. Insurance services and marketing services are assumed to be professional services unless the company explains why such services are not advisory. </p>
<p><b><i><sup>viii</sup></i></b> A material transactional relationship,
including grants to <font>non-profit</font> organizations, exists if the company makes annual payments to, or receives annual payments from, another entity exceeding the greater of $200,000 or 5 percent of the
recipient’s gross revenues, in the case of a company which follows NASDAQ listing standards; or the greater of $1,000,000 or 2 percent of the recipient’s gross revenues, in the case of a company which follows NYSE listing standards.
In the case of a company which follows neither of the preceding standards, Catholic Advisory Services will apply the NASDAQ-based materiality test. (The recipient is the party receiving the financial proceeds from the transaction). </p>

</p> <p> </p> <p><b><i><sup>ix</sup></i></b> Dissident directors who are parties to a voting agreement pursuant to a settlement or similar arrangement may be classified as Independent Directors if an analysis of the following factors
indicates that the voting agreement does not compromise their alignment with all shareholders’ interests: the terms of the agreement; the duration of the standstill provision in the agreement; the limitations and requirements of actions that
are agreed upon; if the dissident director nominee(s) is subject to the standstill; and if there any conflicting relationships or related party transactions. </p>
<p><b><i><sup>x </sup></i></b>Interlocks include: executive officers serving as directors on each
other’s compensation or similar committees (or, in the absence of such a committee, on the board); or executive officers sitting on each other’s boards and at least one serves on the other’s compensation or similar committees (or, in
the absence of such a committee, on the board). </p> <p><b><i><sup>xi</sup></i></b> The operating
involvement of the founder with the company will be considered; if the founder was never employed by the company, Catholic Advisory Services may deem him or her an Independent Director. </p>
<p><b><i><sup>xii</sup></i></b> For purposes of Catholic Advisory
Services’ director independence classification, “material” will be defined as a standard of relationship (financial, personal or otherwise) that a reasonable person might conclude could potentially influence one’s objectivity in
the boardroom in a manner that would have a meaningful impact on an individual’s ability to satisfy requisite fiduciary standards on behalf of shareholders. </p> <p><font color="#6d5e56"><a name="ca745737a_16"></a>Board-Related Management Proposals </font></p>
<p><font color="#595959"><b><a name="ca745737a_17"></a>Classification/Declassification of the Board </b></font></p>
<p>Under a classified board structure only one class of directors would stand for election each year, and the directors in each class would generally serve three-year
terms. Although staggered boards can provide continuity for companies at the board level, there are also a number of downsides to the structure. First, a classified board can also be used to entrench management and effectively preclude most takeover
bids or proxy contests. Board classification forces dissidents and <font>would-be</font> acquirers to negotiate with the incumbent board, which has the authority to decide on offers without a shareholder vote. In addition,
when a board is classified, it is difficult to remove individual members for either poor attendance or poor performance; shareholders would only have the chance to vote on a given director every third year when he or she comes up for election. The
classified board structure can also limit shareholders’ ability to withhold votes from inside directors that sit on key board committee, or to withhold votes from an entire board slate to protest the lack of board diversity. According to
ISS’ 2012 Board Practices study, the number of S&amp;P 500 companies with classified boards has continued to fall. In 2015, only 17 percent of S&amp;P 500 companies maintained staggered boards, compared to 2 percent in 2014,
30 percent in 2013, 41 percent in 2009 and 53 percent in 2005. While we recognize that there are some advantages to classified boards, based on the latest studies on classified boards, the fact that classified boards can make it more
difficult for shareholders to remove individual directors, and the fact that classified boards can be used as an antitakeover device, Catholic Advisory Services recommends against the adoption of classified boards. </p>

to a board through cumulative voting, thereby ensuring representation for all sizes of shareholders. For example, if there is a company with a <font>ten-member</font> board and 500 shares outstanding—the total number

ensuring that directors would retain their directorship for their full-term unless found guilty of self-dealing. By requiring cause to be demonstrated through due process, management insulates the directors from removal even if a director has been

<p>Corporate takeover attempts come in various guises. Usually, a <font>would-be</font> acquirer makes a direct offer to the board of directors
of a targeted corporation. The bidder may offer to purchase the company for cash and/or stock. If the board approves the offer, a friendly transaction is completed and presented to shareholders for approval. If, however, the board of directors
rejects the bid, the acquirer can make a tender offer for the shares directly to the targeted corporation’s shareholders. Such offers are referred to as hostile tender bids. </p>
<p>Not wishing to wait until they are subjects of hostile takeover attempts, many corporations have adopted antitakeover measures designed to deter unfriendly bids or buy
time. The most common defenses are the shareholders rights protection plan, also known as the poison pill, and charter amendments that create barriers to acceptance of hostile bids. In the U.S., poison pills do not require shareholder approval.
However, shareholders must approve charter amendments, such as classified boards or supermajority vote requirements. In brief, the very existence of defensive measures can foreclose the possibility of tenders and hence, opportunities to premium
prices for shareholders. </p> <p>Anti-takeover statutes generally increase management’s potential for insulating itself and warding off hostile takeovers that may be
beneficial to shareholders. While it may be true that some boards use such devices to obtain higher bids and to enhance shareholder value, it is more likely that such provisions are used to entrench management. The majority of historical evidence on
individual corporate anti-takeover measures indicates that heavily insulated companies generally realize lower returns than those having managements that are more accountable to shareholders and the market. The evidence also suggests that when
states adopt their own anti-takeover devices, or endorse those employed by firms, shareholder returns are harmed. Moreover, the body of evidence appears to indicate that companies in states with the strongest anti-takeover laws experience lower
returns than they would absent such statutes. </p> <p><font color="#6d5e56"><a name="ca745737a_44"></a>Takeover Defenses and Shareholder Rights-Related Management
Proposals </font></p> <p><font color="#595959"><b><a name="ca745737a_45"></a>Poison Pills (Shareholder Rights Plans) </b></font></p>
<p>Poison pills are corporate-sponsored financial devices that, when triggered by potential acquirers, do one or more of the following: 1) dilute the acquirer’s
equity holdings in the target company; 2) dilute the acquirer’s voting interests in the target company; or 3) dilute the acquirer’s equity holdings in the post-merger company. Poison pills generally allow shareholders to purchase shares
from, or sell shares back to, the target company <font>(flip-in</font> pill) and/or the potential acquirer <font>(flip-out</font> pill) at a price far out of line with fair market value.
Depending on the type of pill, the triggering event can either transfer wealth from the target company or dilute the equity holdings of current shareholders. Poison pills insulate management from the threat of a change in control and provide the
target board with veto power over takeover bids. Because poison pills greatly alter the balance of power between shareholders and management, shareholders should be allowed to make their own evaluation of such plans. </p>

Operating Loss (NOL) Poison Pills/Protective Amendments </b></font></p> <p>The financial crisis has prompted widespread losses in certain industries. This has resulted in
previously profitable companies considering the adoption of a poison pill and/or NOL protective amendment to protect their NOL tax assets, which may be lost upon an acquisition of 5 percent of a company’s shares. </p>
<p>When evaluating management proposals seeking to adopt NOL pills or protective amendments, the purpose behind the proposal, its terms, and the company’s existing
governance structure should be taken into account to assess whether the structure actively promotes board entrenchment or adequately protects shareholder rights. While Catholic Advisory Services acknowledges the high estimated tax value of NOLs,
which benefit shareholders, the ownership acquisition limitations contained in an NOL pill/protective amendment coupled with a company’s problematic governance structure could serve as an antitakeover device. </p>
<p>Given the fact that shareholders will want to ensure that such an amendment does not remain in effect permanently, Catholic Advisory Services will also closely review
whether the pill/amendment contains a sunset provision or a commitment to cause the expiration of the NOL pill/protective amendment upon exhaustion or expiration of the NOLs. </p>

<p>In 2008, the Delaware courts handed down two decisions, which, read together, indicate a judicial move toward a narrower interpretation of companies’ advance
notice bylaws. These recent court decisions have encouraged companies to take a closer look at their bylaw provisions to ensure that broad language does not provide loopholes for activist investors. Specifically, companies are including language
designed to provide more detailed advance notice provisions and to ensure full disclosure of economic and voting interests in a shareholder’s notice of proposals, including derivatives and hedged positions. </p>
<p><font color="#1447dd"><b>Catholic Advisory Services Recommendation:</b></font><font> Vote <font><font>case-by-case</font></font> on advance notice proposals, giving support to those proposals which allow shareholders to submit proposals/nominations as close to the meeting date as reasonably
possible and within the broadest window possible, recognizing the need to allow sufficient notice for company, regulatory and shareholder review. </font></p> <p>To be
reasonable, the company’s deadline for shareholder notice of a proposal/ nominations must be no earlier than 120 days prior to the anniversary of the previous year’s meeting and have a submittal window of no shorter than 30 days from the
beginning of the notice period (also known as a <font>90-120</font> day window). The submittal window is the period under which a shareholder must file their proposals/nominations prior to the deadline. </p>
<p>In general, support additional efforts by companies to ensure full disclosure in regard to a proponent’s economic and voting position in the company so long as the
informational requirements are reasonable and aimed at providing shareholders with the necessary information to review such proposals. </p> <p><font color="#595959"><b><a name="ca745737a_52">

states that once control has been obtained, the target’s remaining shares will be purchased with cash, cash and securities or only securities. Since the payment offered for the remaining stock is, by design less valuable than the original offer
for the controlling shares, shareholders are forced to sell out early to maximize their value. Standard fair price provisions require that, absent board or shareholder approval of the acquisition, the bidder must pay the remaining shareholders the

and cast in the best interests of fiduciary clients and pension plan beneficiaries. In a confidential voting system, only vote tabulators and inspectors of election may examine individual proxies and ballots; management and shareholders are given
only vote totals. In an open voting system, management can determine who has voted against its nominees or proposals and then <font>re-solicit</font> those votes before the final vote count. As a result, shareholders can
be pressured to vote with management at companies with which they maintain, or would like to establish, a business relationship. Confidential voting also protects employee shareholders from retaliation. Shares held by employee stock ownership plans,
for example, are important votes that are typically voted by employees. </p> <p><font color="#1447dd"><b>Catholic Advisory Services

shareholders are treated equally. The debate over antitakeover devices centers on whether these devices enhance or detract from shareholder value. One theory argues that a company’s board, when armed with these takeover protections, may use
them as negotiating tools to obtain a higher premium for shareholders. The opposing view maintains that managements afforded such protection are more likely to become entrenched than to actively pursue the best interests of shareholders. Such
takeover defenses also serve as obstacles to the normal functioning of the marketplace which, when operating efficiently, should replace incapable and poorly performing managements. </p>

<p>The global financial crisis resulted in significant erosion of shareholder value and highlighted the need for greater assurance that executive compensation is
principally performance-based, fair, reasonable, and not designed in a manner that would incentivize excessive risk-taking by managements. The financial crisis raised questions about the role of pay incentives in influencing executive behavior and
motivating inappropriate or excessive risk-taking that could threaten a corporation’s long-term viability. The safety lapses that led to the disastrous explosions at BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil rig and Massey Energy’s Upper Big Branch
mine, and the resulting unprecedented losses in shareholder value; a) underscore the importance of incorporating meaningful economic incentives around social and environmental considerations in compensation program design, and b) exemplify the
costly liabilities of failing to do so. </p> <p>Evolving disclosure requirements have opened a wider window into compensation practices and processes, giving shareholders
more opportunity and responsibility to ensure that pay is designed to create and sustain value. Companies in the U.S. are now required to evaluate and discuss potential risks arising from misguided or misaligned compensation programs. The Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires advisory shareholder votes on executive compensation (management “say on pay”), an advisory vote on the frequency of say on pay, as well as a shareholder advisory vote on golden
parachute compensation. The advent of “say on pay” votes for shareholders in the U.S. has provided a new communication mechanism and impetus for constructive engagement between shareholders and managers/directors on pay issues. </p>
<p>The socially responsible investing community contends that corporations should be held accountable for their actions and decisions, including those around executive
compensation. Catholic Advisory Services believes that executive pay programs should be fair, competitive, reasonable, and create appropriate incentives, and that pay for performance should be a central tenet in executive compensation philosophy.
Most investors expect corporations to adhere to certain best practice pay considerations in designing and administering executive and director compensation programs, including: </p>

once they vest. However, requiring senior executives to hold company stock until they retire can encourage a long-term focus on company performance. </p></td></tr></table>

</p> <p> </p> <p>Stock-based plans can transfer significant amounts of wealth
from shareholders to executives and directors and are among the most economically significant issues that shareholders are entitled to vote on. Rightly, the cost of these plans must be in line with the anticipated benefits to shareholders. Clearly,
reasonable limits must be set on dilution as well as administrative authority. In addition, shareholders must consider the necessity of the various pay programs and examine the appropriateness of award types. Consequently, the pros and cons of these
proposals necessitate a <font><font>case-by-case</font></font> evaluation. </p> <p>Factors that increase the cost (or
have the potential to increase the cost) of plans to shareholders include: excessive dilution, options awarded at below-market discounts, permissive policies on pyramiding, restricted stock giveaways that reward tenure rather than results, sales of
shares on concessionary terms, blank-check authority for administering committees, option repricing or option replacements, accelerated vesting of awards in the event of defined changes in corporate control, stand-alone stock appreciation rights,
loans or other forms of assistance, or evidence of improvident award policies. </p> <p>Positive plan features that can offset costly features include: plans with modest
dilution potential (i.e. appreciably below double-digit levels), bars to pyramiding and related safeguards for investor interests. Also favorable are performance programs with a duration of two or more years, bonus schemes that pay off in <font>non-dilutive,</font> fully deductible cash, 401K and other thrift or profit sharing plans, and <font>tax-favored</font> employee stock purchase plans. In general, we believe that stock plans
should afford incentives, not sure-fire, risk-free rewards. </p> <p><font color="#1447dd"><b>Catholic Advisory Services

<p>The cost of the equity plans is expressed as Shareholder Value Transfer (SVT), which is measured using a binomial option pricing model that assesses the amount of
shareholders’ equity flowing out of the company to employees and directors. SVT is expressed as both a dollar amount and as a percentage of market value, and includes the new shares proposed, shares available under existing plans, and shares
granted but unexercised (using two measures, in the case of plans subject to the Equity Plan Scorecard evaluation, as noted above). All award types are valued. For omnibus plans, unless limitations are placed on the most expensive types of awards
(for example, full value awards), the assumption is made that all awards to be granted will be the most expensive types. See discussion of specific types of awards. </p>
<p>Except for proposals subject to Equity Plan Scorecard evaluation, Shareholder Value Transfer is reasonable if it falls below a company-specific benchmark. The benchmark
is determined as follows: The top quartile performers in each industry group (using the Global Industry Classification Standard: GICS) are identified. Benchmark SVT levels for each industry are established based on these top performers’
historic SVT. Regression analyses are run on each industry group to identify the variables most strongly correlated to SVT. The benchmark industry SVT level is then adjusted upwards or downwards for the specific company by plugging the
company-specific performance measures, size and cash compensation into the industry cap equations to arrive at the company’s benchmark.<sup>21</sup> </p>

<p>The board’s legal charge of fulfilling its fiduciary obligations of loyalty and care is put to the ultimate test through the task of the board setting its own
compensation. Directors themselves oversee the process for evaluating board performance and establishing pay packages for board members. </p> <p>Shareholders provide
limited oversight of directors by electing individuals who are primarily selected by the board, or a board nominating committee, and by voting on stock-based plans for directors designed by the board compensation committee. Additionally,
shareholders may submit and vote on their own resolutions seeking to limit or restructure director pay. While the cost of compensating <font>non-employee</font> directors is small in absolute terms, compared to the cost of
compensating executives, it is still a critical aspect of a company’s overall corporate governance structure. </p> <p>Overall, director pay levels are rising in part
because of the new forms of pay in use at many companies, as well as because of the increased responsibilities arising from the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act requirements. In addition to an annual retainer fee, many companies also pay fees for attending
board and committee meetings, fees for chairing a committee, or a retainer fee for chairing a committee. </p> <p>Director compensation packages should be designed to
provide value to directors for their contribution. Given that many directors are high-level executives whose personal income levels are generally high, cash compensation may hold little appeal. Stock-based incentives on the other hand reinforce the
directors’ role of protecting and enhancing shareholder value. The stock-based component of director compensation should be large enough to ensure that when faced with a situation in which the interests of shareholders and management differ,
the board will have a financial incentive to think as a shareholder. Additionally, many companies have instituted equity ownership programs for directors. Catholic Advisory Services recommends that directors receive stock grants equal to three times
of their annual retainer, as it is a reasonable starting point for companies of all sizes and industries. A vesting schedule for director grants helps directors to meet the stock ownership guidelines and maintains their long-term interests in the
firm. </p> <p> </p>

repricing or to submit repricings to a shareholder vote will be supported. </p> <p><font color="#1447dd"><b>Catholic Advisory Services Recommendation: </b></font></p>

<p>A cash balance plan is a defined benefit plan that treats an earned retirement benefit as if it was a credit from a defined contribution plan, but which provides a
stated benefit at the end of its term. Because employer contributions to these plans are credited evenly over the life of a plan, and not based on a seniority formula they may reduce payouts to long-term employees who are currently vested in plans.
</p> <p>Cash-balance pension conversions have undergone congressional and federal agency scrutiny following high-profile EEOC complaints on age discrimination and employee
anger at companies like IBM. While significant change is unlikely in the <font>short-tm,</font> business interests were concerned enough that the National Association of Manufacturers and other business lobbies formed a
Capitol Hill coalition to preserve the essential features of the plans and to overturn a IRS ruling. Driving the push behind conversions from traditional pension plans to cash-balance plans are the substantial savings that companies generate in the
process. Critics point out that these savings are gained at the expense of the most senior employees. Resolutions call on corporate boards to establish a committee of outside directors to prepare a report to shareholders on the potential impact of
pension-related proposals now being considered by national policymakers in reaction to the controversy spawned by the plans. </p> <p><font color="#1447dd"><b>Catholic

<td><i><u>Valuation</u></i>: Is the value being paid by the SPAC reasonable? SPACs generally lack an independent fairness opinion and the financials on the target may be limited. Compare the conversion price with the
intrinsic value of the target company provided in the fairness opinion. Also, evaluate the proportionate value of the combined entity attributable to the SPAC IPO shareholders versus the <font>pre-merger</font> value of
SPAC. Additionally, a private company discount may be applied to the target, if it is a private entity. </td></tr></table>

<table>
<tr>
<td><font color="#3d72ff">∎</font></td>
<td> </td>
<td><i><u>Deal timing</u></i>: A main driver for most transactions is that the SPAC charter typically requires the deal to be complete within 18 to 24 months, or the SPAC is to be liquidated. Evaluate the valuation,
market reaction, and potential conflicts of interest for deals that are announced close to the liquidation date. </td></tr></table>

</td></tr></table>
<table>
<tr>
<td><font color="#3d72ff">∎</font></td>
<td> </td>
<td><i><u>Conflicts of interest</u></i>: How are sponsors benefiting from the transaction compared to IPO shareholders? Potential conflicts could arise if a fairness opinion is issued by the insiders to qualify the deal
rather than a third party or if management is encouraged to pay a higher price for the target because of an 80 percent rule (the charter requires that the fair market value of the target is at least equal to 80 percent of net assets
of the SPAC). Also, there may be sense of urgency by the management team of the SPAC to close the deal since its charter typically requires a transaction to be completed within the <font>18-24</font> month timeframe.

<p>In general, Catholic Advisory Services supports proposals that request the company to furnish information helpful to shareholders in evaluating the company’s
operations. In order to be able to intelligently monitor their investments, shareholders often need information best provided by the company in which they have invested. Requests to report such information will merit support. Requests to establish
special committees of the board to address broad corporate policy and provide forums for ongoing dialogue on issues including, but not limited to shareholder relations, the environment, human rights, occupational health and safety, and executive
compensation, will generally be supported, particularly when they appear to offer a potentially effective method for enhancing shareholder value. We will closely evaluate proposals that ask the company to cease certain actions that the proponent
believes are harmful to society or some segment of society with special attention to the company’s legal and ethical obligations, its ability to remain profitable, and potential negative publicity if the company fails to honor the request.
Catholic Advisory Services supports shareholder proposals that improve the company’s public image, and reduce exposure to liabilities. </p> <p><font color="#6d5e56"><a name="ca745737a_167">
</a>Diversity and Equality </font></p> <p>Significant progress has been made in recent years in the advancement of gender and racial diversity in the workplace and the

discrimination based on race, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, and nationality. However, discrimination on the basis of federally protected characteristics continues. The SEC’s revised disclosure rules now require information
on how boards factor diversity into the director nomination process, as well as disclosure on how the board assesses the effectiveness of its diversity policy. Shareholder proposals on diversity may target a company’s board nomination

</p> <p> </p> <p>Globalization, relocation of production overseas, and
widespread use of subcontractors and vendors, often make it difficult to obtain a complete picture of a company’s labor practices in global markets. Deadly accidents at factories, notably in Bangladesh and Pakistan, have continued to intensify
these concerns. Many investors believe that companies would benefit from adopting a human rights policy based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization’s Core Labor Standards. Efforts that seek
greater disclosure on a company’s global labor practices, including its supply chain, and that seek to establish minimum standards for a company’s operations will be supported. In addition, requests for independent monitoring of overseas
operations will be supported. </p> <p>Catholic Advisory Services generally supports proposals that call for the adoption and/or enforcement of principles or codes relating
to countries in which there are systematic violations of human rights; such as the use of slave, child, or prison labor; a government that is illegitimate; or there is a call by human rights advocates,
<font>pro-democracy</font> organizations, or legitimately-elected representatives for economic sanctions. The use of child labor, or forced labor is unethical and can damage corporate reputations. Poor labor practices can
lead to litigation against the company, which can be costly and time consuming. </p> <p><font color="#595959"><b><a name="ca745737a_177"></a>Codes of Conduct and Vendor
Standards </b></font></p> <p>Shareholders have submitted proposals that pertain to the adoption of codes of conduct or provision, greater disclosure on a company’s
international workplace standards, or that request human rights risk assessment. Companies have been asked to adopt a number of different types of codes, including a workplace code of conduct, standards for international business operations, human
rights standards, International Labour Organization (ILO) standards and the SA 8000 principles. The ILO is an independent agency of the United Nations which consists of 187 member nations represented by workers, employers, and governments. The
ILO’s general mandate is to promote a decent workplace for all individuals. The ILO sets international labor standards in the form of its conventions and then monitors compliance with the standards. The seven conventions of the ILO fall under
four broad categories: Right to organize and bargain collectively, Nondiscrimination in employment, Abolition of forced labor, and End of child labor. Each of the 187 member-nations of the ILO is bound to respect and promote these rights to the best
of their abilities. SA 8000 is a set of labor standards, based on the principles of the ILO conventions and other human rights conventions, and covers eight workplace conditions, including: child labor, forced labor, health and safety, freedom of
association and the right to collective bargaining, discrimination, disciplinary practices, working hours and compensation. Companies have also turned to the United Nations “Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights,” a set of
guidelines that create a framework for states to protect human rights, corporations to respect human rights, and rights-holders to access remediation. </p> <p><font color="#1447dd"><b>Catholic Advisory Services Recommendation: </b></font></p> <p> </p>

<p>These resolutions have called for the adoption of the MacBride Principles for operations located in Northern Ireland. They request companies operating abroad to support
the equal employment opportunity policies that apply in facilities they operate domestically. The principles were established to address the sectarian hiring problems between Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland. It is well documented that
Northern Ireland’s Catholic community faced much higher unemployment figures than the Protestant community. In response to this problem, the U.K. government instituted the New Fair Employment Act of 1989 (and subsequent amendments) to address
the sectarian hiring problems. </p> <p>Many companies believe that the Act adequately addresses the problems and that further action, including adoption of the MacBride
Principles, only duplicates the efforts already underway. In evaluating a proposal to adopt the MacBride Principles, shareholders must decide whether the principles will cause companies to divest, and therefore worsen the unemployment problem, or
whether the principles will promote equal hiring practices. Proponents believe that the Fair Employment Act does not sufficiently address the sectarian hiring problems. They argue that the MacBride Principles serve to stabilize the situation and
promote further investment. </p> <p><font color="#1447dd"><b>Catholic Advisory Services

unstable, including state sponsors of terror. The U.S. government has active trade sanction regimes in place against specific companies, or persons, including Russia, China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria, among others. These sanctions
are enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, which is part of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, as well as U.S. Customs and Border Patrol for sanctioned goods. However, these countries do not comprise an exhaustive list of countries
considered to be high-risk markets. </p> <p>Shareholder proponents have filed resolutions addressing a variety of concerns around how investments and operations in
high-risk regions may support, or be perceived to support, potentially oppressive governments. Proponents contend that operations in these countries may lead to potential reputational, regulatory, and/or supply chain risks as a result of operational
disruptions. Concerned shareholders have requested investment withdrawals or cessation of operations in high-risk markets as well as reports on operations in high-risk markets. Such reports may seek additional disclosure from companies on criteria
employed for investing in, continuing to operate in, and withdrawing from specific countries. </p> <p>Depending on the country’s human rights record, investors have

</p> <p> </p> <p>While early shareholder resolutions on Internet issues focused
on censorship by repressive regimes and net neutrality, proponents have recently raised concerns regarding privacy and data security in the wake of increased breaches that result in the misuse of personal information. On Oct. 13, 2011, the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a guidance document about the disclosure obligations relating to cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents. In the document, the SEC references the negative consequences that are associated with
cyber-attacks, such as: remediation costs, including those required to repair relationships with customers and clients; increased cyber-security protection costs; lost revenues from unauthorized use of the information or missed opportunities to
attract clients; litigation; and reputational damage. The document says that while the federal securities laws do not explicitly require disclosure of cybersecurity risks and incidents, some disclosure requirements may impose an obligation on the
company to disclose such information and provides scenarios where disclosure may be required. According to the FBI’s 2021 Internet Crime report, potential losses from cybercrimes hit $6.9 billion, up 64% from 2018. </p>

<p>Climate change has emerged as the most significant environmental threat to the planet to date. Scientists generally agree that gases released by chemical reactions
including the burning of fossil fuels contribute to a “greenhouse effect” that traps the planet’s heat. Environmentalists claim that the Greenhouse Gases(GHG) produced by the industrial age have caused recent weather crises such as
heat waves, rainstorms, melting glaciers, rising sea levels and receding coastlines. Climate change skeptics have described the rise and fall of global temperatures as naturally occurring phenomena and depicted human impact on climate change as
minimal. Shareholder proposals requesting companies to issue a report to shareholders, “at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information,” on greenhouse gas emissions ask that the report include descriptions of corporate efforts to
reduce emissions, companies’ financial exposure and potential liability from operations that contribute to global warming, their direct or indirect efforts to promote the view that global warming is not a threat, and their goals in reducing
these emissions from their operations. Shareholder proponents argue that there is scientific proof that the burning of fossil fuels causes global warming, that future legislation may make companies financially liable for their contributions to
global warming, and that a report on the company’s role in global warming can be assembled at reasonable cost. </p> <p><font color="#1447dd"><b>Catholic Advisory

proponents point out that the majority of independent atmospheric scientists agree that global warming poses a serious problem to the health and welfare of our planet, citing the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Shareholder

of the March 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, when a consortium of investors, environmental groups, and religious organizations drafted what were originally named the Valdez Principles. Later named the Ceres Principles, and now branded the Ceres

engagement and disclosure. Signatories also pledge to build systems across a corporation’s value chain to enable ongoing improvements in three priority environmental and social impact areas (Climate Change, Natural Resources, and Human Rights).
</p> <p>The Equator Principles are the financial industry’s benchmark for determining, assessing and managing social and environmental risk in project financing.
First launched in June 2003, the Principles were ultimately adopted by over forty financial institutions over a three-year implementation period. Since its adoption, the Principles have undergone a number of revisions, expanding the use of

<p>Proposals asking for a report on oil sands operations in the Athabasca region of Alberta, Canada have appeared at a number of oil and gas companies. Alberta’s oil
sands contain a reserve largely thought to be one of the world’s largest potential energy sources. Rising oil sands production in Alberta has been paralleled with concerns from a variety of stakeholders—including environmental groups,
local residents, and shareholders—regarding the environmental impacts of the complicated extraction and upgrading processes required to convert oil sands into a synthetic crude oil. The high viscosity of bitumen makes its extraction a
challenging and resource-intensive process; the most common extraction technique involves pumping steam into the oil sands to lower the viscosity of bitumen in order to pump it to the surface. </p>
<p>One of the most prominent issues concerning oil sands is the large volume of greenhouse gases (GHG) associated with production. Oil sands are by far one of the most
energy-intensive forms of oil production, releasing three times more GHG emissions from production than conventional oil. </p> <p>Shareholders have kept up pressure on the
issue of potential long-term risks to companies posed by the environmental, social, and economic challenges associated with Canadian oil sands operations. Resolutions on the topic have focused on requesting greater transparency on the ramifications
of oil sands development projects. </p> <p><font color="#1c82ba"><b><a name="ca745737a_200"></a>Arctic National Wildlife Refuge </b></font></p>
<p>The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) is a federally protected wilderness along Alaska’s North Slope. In the past, legislation proposed in both the House and
Senate that, if passed, would allow a portion of this area to be leased to private companies for development and production of oil, has been witnessed. Oil companies have expressed an interest in bidding for these leases given the opportunity. In
response, shareholder activists have filed resolutions asking these companies to cancel any plans to drill in the ANWR and cease their lobbying efforts to open the area for drilling. Proponents of shareholder proposals on this issue argue that the
Coastal Plain section of the ANWR is the most environmentally sensitive area of the refuge, that the majority of Alaska’s North Slope that is not federally designated wilderness already provides the oil industry with sufficient resources for
oil production, and that advocates of drilling in ANWR overstate the benefit to be derived from opening the wilderness to oil production. Those in favor of opening the area up to drilling note that only a small portion of ANWR would be considered
for exploration, and if drilling were to take place, it would be on less than one percent of the entire area, that modern technology reduces the environmental impact of oil drilling on both the land and surrounding wildlife, and that oil production
in ANWR would have considerable benefit to company shareholders, Alaskans, and the United States as a whole. </p> <p><font color="#1447dd"><b>Catholic Advisory Services

<p>Shareholder proponents of charitable-contributions related resolutions may seek greater disclosure on a company’s charitable donations including dollar amounts,
sponsorships, and policies on corporate philanthropy. Catholic Advisory Services is generally supportive of increased transparency around corporate charitable giving. However, some resolutions extend beyond mere disclosure requests and attempt to
influence or restrict companies’ contributions to specific types of beneficiaries in a manner that furthers particular objectives supported by the proposal sponsors. Catholic Advisory Services believes that management is better positioned to
decide what criteria are appropriate for making corporate charitable contributions. Also, some of the proposals may require companies to poll their shareholders as part of the grant-making process. Since majority of companies generally have
thousands of shareholders, contacting, confirming, and processing each individual opinion and/or consent would be a burdensome and expensive exercise. </p> <p><font color="#1447dd"><b>Catholic Advisory Services Recommendation: </b></font></p> <p> </p>

<p>Predatory lending involves charging excessive fees to subprime borrowers without adequate disclosure. More specifically, predatory lending includes misleading subprime

<p>Proponents of these proposals feel that social and environmental criteria should be factored into the formulas used in determining executive compensation packages. The
shareholder sponsors of the resolutions look to companies to review current compensation practices and to include social or environmental performance criteria such as accounting for “poor corporate citizenship” and meeting environmental or
workplace safety objectives and metrics when evaluating executive compensation. Some of the <font>non-financial</font> criteria that proponents of these resolutions seek to be incorporated in compensation program design
include workplace safety, environmental stewardship, or diversity and customer/employee satisfaction – as part of a written policy used to align compensation with performance on <font>non-financial</font> factors
alongside financial criteria. </p> <p>Proponents believe that factors such as poor environmental performance, workplace lawsuits, etc. could have a significant adverse
impact on a company’s financial performance if not proactively and adequately addressed, and that these factors should be considered along with traditional financial considerations when determining executive pay. The significant stock price
declines and massive losses in shareholder value stemming from the BP Deepwater Horizon oil rig disaster and the tragic explosion at Massey Energy’s Upper Big Branch mine that killed 29 employees is a sobering reminder of the need to have the
right management incentives in place to ensure that social and environmental risks are actively managed and mitigated against. Given the proliferation of derivative lawsuits targeted at firms such as Halliburton, Transocean and Cameron International
that were suppliers to or partners with BP in a capacity that ignored safety considerations or that contributed to the economic and ecological disaster, investors are increasingly mindful of the <font>far-reaching</font>
implications that exposure to social or environmental risks could have on shareholder value at portfolio companies. </p> <p><font color="#1447dd"><b>Catholic Advisory

principles as a means of protecting and maximizing their investments, whilst generally aligning with issuers’ board recommendations for voting on environmental and social matters. </p>
<p>On matters of corporate governance, executive compensation, and corporate structure, the Global Board-Aligned Policy guidelines are focused on widely accepted good
standards of corporate governance and shareholder rights protection, and on the creation and preservation of economic value. On environmental or social matters, the Global Board-Aligned Policy will generally be in line with the board’s
recommendations, with support limited to circumstances where it is considered that greater disclosure will directly enhance or protect shareholder value and is reflective of a clearly established reporting standard in the market. Details are as
further described in these guidelines. </p>

Director Nominees in Uncontested Elections </b></font></p> <p>Four fundamental principles apply when determining votes on director nominees: </p>
<p><font color="#1c82ba"><b>Independence:</b></font><font> Boards should be sufficiently independent from management
(and significant shareholders) to ensure that they are able and motivated to effectively supervise management’s performance for the benefit of all shareholders, including in setting and monitoring the execution of corporate strategy, with
appropriate use of shareholder capital, and in setting and monitoring executive compensation programs that support that strategy. The chair of the board should ideally be an independent director, and all boards should have an independent leadership
position or a similar role in order to help provide appropriate counterbalance to executive management, as well as having sufficiently independent committees that focus on key governance concerns such as audit, compensation, and nomination of
directors. </font></p> <p><font color="#1c82ba"><b>Composition:</b></font><font> Companies should ensure that directors
add value to the board through their specific skills and expertise and by having sufficient time and commitment to serve effectively. Boards should be of a size appropriate to accommodate diversity, expertise, and independence, while
ensuring active and collaborative participation by all members. Boards should be sufficiently diverse to ensure consideration of a wide range of perspectives. </font></p>
<p><font color="#1c82ba"><b>Responsiveness:</b></font><font> Directors should respond to investor input, such as that
expressed through significant opposition to management proposals, significant support for shareholder proposals (whether binding or <font>non-binding),</font> and tender offers where a majority of shares are tendered.
</font></p> <p><font color="#1c82ba"><b>Accountability:</b></font><font> Boards should be sufficiently accountable to
shareholders, including through transparency of the company’s governance practices and regular board elections, by the provision of sufficient information for shareholders to be able to assess directors and board composition, and through the
ability of shareholders to remove directors. </font></p> <p><font color="#1447dd"><b>General Recommendation:</b></font><font> Generally vote for director nominees, except under the following circumstances (with new nominees<sup>1</sup> considered on <font><font>case-by-case</font></font> basis): </font></p> <p><font color="#595959"><b><a name="gl745737a_4"></a>Independence </b></font></p>

<p><sup>1</sup> A “new nominee” is a director who is being presented for election by shareholders for the first time.
Recommendations on new nominees who have served for less than one year are made on a <font><font>case-by-case</font></font> basis depending on the timing of their appointment and the problematic
governance issue in question. </p> <p><sup>2</sup> In general, companies with a plurality vote standard use “Withhold” as
the contrary vote option in director elections; companies with a majority vote standard use “Against”. However, it will vary by company and the proxy must be checked to determine the valid contrary vote option for the particular company.

<div>
<p><b>Footnotes: </b></p>
<p><i>1.</i> The definition of officer will generally follow that of a “Section 16 officer” (officers subject to
Section 16 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934) and includes the chief executive, operating, financial, legal, technology, and accounting officers of a company (including the president, treasurer, secretary, controller, or any vice
president in charge of a principal business unit, division, or policy function). Current interim officers are included in this category. For private companies, the equivalent positions are applicable. A
<font>non-employee</font> director serving as an officer due to statutory requirements (e.g. corporate secretary) will generally be classified as a <font>Non-Independent</font> <font>Non-Executive</font> Director under “Any material relationship with the company.” However, if the company provides explicit disclosure that the director is not receiving additional compensation exceeding $10,000
per year for serving in that capacity, then the director will be classified as an Independent Director. </p> <p><i>2.</i>
“Affiliate” includes a subsidiary, sibling company, or parent company. ISS uses 50 percent control ownership by the parent company as the standard for applying its affiliate designation. The manager/advisor of an externally managed
issuer (EMI) is considered an affiliate. </p> <p><i>3.</i> Includes any former CEO of the company prior to the company’s initial public
offering (IPO). </p> <p><i>4. </i>When there is a former CEO of a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) serving on the board of an
acquired company, ISS will generally classify such directors as independent unless determined otherwise taking into account the following factors: the applicable listing standards determination of such director’s independence; any operating
ties to the firm; and the existence of any other conflicting relationships or related party transactions. </p> <p><i>5.
</i><b><i></i></b>ISS will look at the terms of the interim officer’s employment contract to determine if it contains severance pay, long-term health and pension benefits, or other such standard provisions typically contained in contracts of
permanent, <font>non-temporary</font> CEOs. ISS will also consider if a formal search process was under way for a full-time officer at the time. </p>
<p><i>6. </i><b><i></i></b>“Immediate family member” follows the SEC’s definition of such and covers spouses, parents,
children, step-parents, step-children, siblings, <font>in-laws,</font> and any person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing the household of any director, nominee for director, executive officer, or significant
shareholder of the company. </p> <p><i>7. </i>Professional services can be characterized as advisory in nature, generally involve access to
sensitive company information or to strategic decision-making, and typically have a commission- or <font>fee-based</font> payment structure. Professional services generally include but are not limited to the following:
investment banking/financial advisory services, commercial banking (beyond deposit services), investment services, insurance services, accounting/audit services, consulting services, marketing services, legal services, property management services,
realtor services, lobbying services, executive search services, and IT consulting services. The following would generally be considered transactional relationships and not professional services: deposit services, IT tech support services,
educational services, and construction services. The case of participation in a banking syndicate by a <font>non-lead</font> bank should be considered a transactional (and hence subject to the associated materiality test)
rather than a professional relationship. “Of Counsel” relationships are only considered immaterial if the individual does not receive any form of compensation (in excess of $10,000 per year) from, or is a retired partner of, the firm
providing the professional service. The case of a company providing a professional service to one of its directors or to an entity with which one of its directors is affiliated, will be considered a transactional rather than a professional
relationship. Insurance services and marketing services are assumed to be professional services unless the company explains why such services are not advisory. </p>
<p><i>8. </i>A material transactional relationship, including grants to <font>non-profit</font> organizations,
exists if the company makes annual payments to, or receives annual payments from, another entity, exceeding the greater of: $200,000 or 5 percent of the recipient’s gross revenues, for a company that follows NASDAQ listing standards; or
the greater of $1,000,000 or 2 percent of the recipient’s gross revenues, for a company that follows NYSE listing standards. For a company that follows neither of the preceding standards, ISS will apply the NASDAQ-based materiality test.
(The recipient is the party receiving the financial proceeds from the transaction). </p> <p><i>9. </i>Dissident directors who are parties to
a voting agreement pursuant to a settlement or similar arrangement may be classified as Independent Directors if an analysis of the following factors indicates that the voting agreement does not compromise their alignment with all shareholders’
interests: the terms of the agreement; the duration of the standstill provision in the agreement; the limitations and requirements of actions that are agreed upon; if the dissident director nominee(s) is subject to the standstill; and if there any
conflicting relationships or related party transactions. </p>

and at least one serves on the other’s compensation or similar committees (or, in the absence of such a committee, on the board). </p>
<p><i>11. </i>The operating involvement of the founder with the company will be considered; if the founder was never employed by the
company, ISS may deem him or her an Independent Director. </p> <p><i>12. </i>For purposes of ISS’s director
independence classification, “material” will be defined as a standard of relationship (financial, personal, or otherwise) that a reasonable person might conclude could potentially influence one’s objectivity in the boardroom in a
manner that would have a meaningful impact on an individual’s ability to satisfy requisite fiduciary standards on behalf of shareholders. </p>

<table>
<tr>
<td><font color="#3d72ff">∎</font></td>
<td> </td>
<td> <p><i>Strategic rationale</i> - Does the deal make sense strategically? From where is the value derived? Cost and revenue
synergies should not be overly aggressive or optimistic, but reasonably achievable. Management should also have a favorable track record of successful integration of historical acquisitions. </p></td></tr></table>

<tr>
<td><font color="#3d72ff">∎</font></td>
<td> </td>
<td> <p><i>Negotiations and process</i> - Were the terms of the transaction negotiated at
<font>arm’s-length?</font> Was the process fair and equitable? A fair process helps to ensure the best price for shareholders. Significant negotiation “wins” can also signify the deal makers’
competency. The comprehensiveness of the sales process (e.g., full auction, partial auction, no auction) can also affect shareholder value. </p></td></tr></table>
<table>
<tr>
<td><font color="#3d72ff">∎</font></td>
<td> </td>
<td> <p><i>Conflicts of interest</i> - Are insiders benefiting from the transaction disproportionately and inappropriately as
compared to <font>non-insider</font> shareholders? As the result of potential conflicts, the directors and officers of the company may be more likely to vote to approve a merger than if they did not hold these interests.
Consider whether these interests may have influenced these directors and officers to support or recommend the merger. The CIC figure presented in the “ISS Transaction Summary” section of this report is an aggregate figure that can in
certain cases be a misleading indicator of the true value transfer from shareholders to insiders. Where such figure appears to be excessive, analyze the underlying assumptions to determine whether a potential conflict exists. </p></td></tr></table>
<table>
<tr>
<td><font color="#3d72ff">∎</font></td>
<td> </td>
<td> <p><i>Governance</i> - Will the combined company have a better or worse governance profile than the current governance
profiles of the respective parties to the transaction? If the governance profile is to change for the worse, the burden is on the company to prove that other issues (such as valuation) outweigh any deterioration in governance. </p></td></tr></table>

above). All award types are valued. For omnibus plans, unless limitations are placed on the most expensive types of awards (for example, full-value awards), the assumption is made that all awards to be granted will be the most expensive types. </p>
<p>For proposals that are not subject to the Equity Plan Scorecard evaluation, Shareholder Value Transfer is reasonable if it falls below a company-specific benchmark. The
benchmark is determined as follows: The top quartile performers in each industry group (using the Global Industry Classification Standard: GICS) are identified. Benchmark SVT levels for each industry are established based on these top
performers’ historic SVT. Regression analyses are run on each industry group to identify the variables most strongly correlated to SVT. The benchmark industry SVT level is then adjusted upwards or downwards for the specific company by plugging
the company-specific performance measures, size, and cash compensation into the industry cap equations to arrive at the company’s benchmark.<sup>21</sup> </p>
<p><b><a name="gl745737a_127"></a><font color="#1c82ba">Three-Year Value-Adjusted Burn Rate</font> </b></p>
<p>A “Value-Adjusted Burn Rate” is used for stock plan evaluations. Value-Adjusted Burn Rate benchmarks are calculated as the greater of: (1) an
industry-specific threshold based on three-year burn rates within the company’s GICS group segmented by S&amp;P 500, Russell 3000 index (less the S&amp;P 500) and <font>non-Russell</font> 3000 index; and (2) a
<i>de minimis</i> threshold established separately for each of the S&amp;P 500, the Russell 3000 index less the S&amp;P 500, and the <font>non-Russell</font> 3000 index. Year-over-year burn-rate benchmark changes will be
limited to a predetermined range above or below the prior year’s burn-rate benchmark. </p> <p>The Value-Adjusted Burn Rate is calculated as follows: </p>
<p>Value-Adjusted Burn Rate = ((# of options * option’s dollar value using a Black-Scholes model) + (# of full-value awards * stock price)) / (Weighted

proposals that seek information that exceeds a widely endorsed standard in the market or place any burden upon the company beyond a reasonable and clearly established reporting standard in the market, the Global Board-Aligned policy will generally

<p>ISS’ Social Advisory Services division recognizes that socially responsible investors have dual objectives: financial and social. Socially responsible investors
invest for economic gain, as do all investors, but they also require that the companies in which they invest conduct their business in a socially and environmentally responsible manner. </p>
<p>These dual objectives carry through to socially responsible investors’ proxy voting activity once the security selection process is completed. In voting their
shares, socially responsible institutional shareholders are concerned not only with sustainable economic returns to shareholders and good corporate governance but also with the ethical behavior of corporations and the social and environmental impact
of their actions. </p> <p>Social Advisory Services has, therefore, developed proxy voting guidelines that are consistent with the dual objectives of socially responsible
shareholders. On matters of social and environmental import, the guidelines seek to reflect a broad consensus of the socially responsible investing community. Generally, we take as our frame of reference policies that have been developed by groups
such as the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, the General Board of Pension and Health Benefits of the United Methodist Church, Domini Social Investments, and other leading church shareholders and socially responsible mutual fund
companies. Additionally, we incorporate the active ownership and investment philosophies of leading globally recognized initiatives such as the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI), the United Nations Principles for
Responsible Investment (UNPRI), the United Nations Global Compact, and environmental and social European Union Directives. </p> <p>On matters of corporate governance,
executive compensation, and corporate structure, Social Advisory Services guidelines are based on a commitment to create and preserve economic value and to advance principles of good corporate governance consistent with responsibilities to society
as a whole. </p> <p>The guidelines provide an overview of how Social Advisory Services recommends that its clients vote. We note that there may be cases in which the final
vote recommendation on a particular company varies from the vote guideline due to the fact that we closely examine the merits of each proposal and consider relevant information and company-specific circumstances in arriving at our decisions. Where
Social Advisory Services acts as voting agent for its clients, it follows each client’s voting policy, which may differ in some cases from the policies outlined in this document. Social Advisory Services updates its guidelines on an annual
basis to take into account emerging issues and trends on environmental, social, and corporate governance topics, in addition to evolving market standards, regulatory changes, and client feedback. </p>

<td><font color="#1c82ba"><b>Board of Directors </b></font></td></tr></table> <p>A corporation’s board of directors sits at the apogee of
the corporate governance system. Though they normally delegate responsibility for the management of the business to the senior executives they select and oversee, directors bear ultimate responsibility for the conduct of the corporation’s
business. The role of directors in publicly held corporations has undergone considerable change in recent years. Once derided as rubber stamps for management, directors of public corporations today are expected to serve as effective guardians of
shareholders’ interests. </p> <p>Voting on directors and board-related issues is the most important use of the shareholder franchise, not simply a routine proxy item.
Although uncontested director elections do not present alternative nominees from whom to choose, a high percentage of opposition votes is an expression of shareholder dissatisfaction and should be sufficient to elicit a meaningful response from
management. </p> <p>The role and responsibilities of directors has increasingly been the subject of much discussion and debate, given the current economic climate and the
difficulties many companies now face in their respective markets. Influential organizations, including the American Law Institute, the American Bar Association, the National Association of Corporate Directors, and the Business Roundtable have issued
reports and recommendations regarding the duties and accountability of corporate boards. Both mainstream and alternative media outlets have highlighted the numerous gaps within risk oversight of company boards and individual directors, and many
institutional investors, in response, have capitalized on their rights as stakeholders to prompt changes. Corporations have taken notice, implementing many of the reforms championed by their shareholders. </p>
<p>Although differences of opinion remain, a fairly strong consensus has emerged on a number of key issues. It is widely agreed that the board’s most important
responsibility is to ensure that the corporation is managed in the shareholders’ best long-term economic interest. This will often require boards to consider the impact of their actions on other constituencies, including employees, customers,
local communities, and the environment. </p> <p> </p>

<td> </td>
<td> <p>To nominate directors and otherwise ensure that the board functions effectively. </p></td></tr></table>
<p>Boards are expected to have a majority of directors independent of management. The independent directors are expected to organize much of the board’s work, even if
the chief executive officer also serves as Chairman of the board. Key committees of the board are expected to be entirely independent of management. It is expected that boards will engage in critical self-evaluation of themselves and of individual
members. Individual directors, in turn, are expected to devote significant amounts of time to their duties, to limit the number of directorships they accept, and to own a meaningful amount of stock in companies on whose boards they serve. Directors
are ultimately responsible to the corporation’s shareholders. The most direct expression of this responsibility is the requirement that directors be elected to their positions by the shareholders. Shareholders are also asked to vote on a number
of other matters regarding the role, structure, and composition of the board. Social Advisory Services classifies directors as either executive, <font>non-independent</font>
<font>non-executive,</font> or independent directors. </p> <p><font color="#6d5e56"><a name="sri745737a_3"></a>Uncontested Election of Directors

</p> <p> </p><div>
<p><b>Footnotes: </b></p>
<p><b><i><sup>i</sup></i></b> The definition of officer will generally follow that of a
“Section 16 officer” (officers subject to Section 16 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934) and includes: the chief executive, operating, financial, legal, technology, and accounting officers of a company (including the
president, treasurer, secretary, controller, or any vice president in charge of a principal business unit, division, or policy function). Current interim officers are included in this category. For private companies, the equivalent positions are
applicable. A <font>non-employee</font> director serving as an officer due to statutory requirements (e.g. corporate secretary) will generally be classified as a <font>Non-Independent</font> <font>Non-Executive</font> Director under “Any material relationship with the company.” However, if the company provides explicit disclosure that the director is not receiving additional compensation exceeding $10,000
per year for serving in that capacity, then the director will be classified as an Independent Director. </p> <p>ii “Affiliate”
includes a subsidiary, sibling company, or parent company. Social Advisory Services uses 50 percent control ownership by the parent company as the standard for applying its affiliate designation. The manager/advisor of an externally managed
issuer (EMI) is considered an affiliate. </p> <p><b><i><sup>iii</sup></i></b> Includes any former
CEO of the company prior to the company’s initial public offering (IPO). </p>
<p><b><i><sup>iv</sup></i></b> When there is a former CEO of a special purpose acquisition
company (SPAC) serving on the board of an acquired company, Social Advisory Services will generally classify such directors as independent unless determined otherwise taking into account the following factors: the applicable listing standards
determination of such director’s independence; any operating ties to the firm; and the existence of any other conflicting relationships or related party transactions. </p>
<p><b><i><sup>v </sup></i></b>Social Advisory Services will look at the terms of the interim
officer’s employment contract to determine if it contains severance pay, long-term health and pension benefits, or other such standard provisions typically contained in contracts of permanent,
<font>non-temporary</font> CEOs. Social Advisory Services will also consider if a formal search process was under way for a full-time officer at the time. </p>
<p><b><i><sup>vi </sup></i></b>“Immediate family member” follows the SEC’s
definition of such and covers spouses, parents, children, step-parents, step-children, siblings, <font>in-laws,</font> and any person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing the household of any director, nominee for
director, executive officer, or significant shareholder of the company. </p>
<p><b><i><sup>vii</sup></i></b> Professional services can be characterized as advisory in nature,
generally involve access to sensitive company information or to strategic decision-making, and typically have a commission- or <font>fee-based</font> payment structure. Professional services generally include, but are not
limited to the following: investment banking/financial advisory services; commercial banking (beyond deposit services); investment services; insurance services; accounting/audit services; consulting services; marketing services; legal services;
property management services; realtor services; lobbying services; executive search services; and IT consulting services. The following would generally be considered transactional relationships and not professional services: deposit services; IT
tech support services; educational services; and construction services. The case of participation in a banking syndicate by a <font>non-lead</font> bank should be considered a transactional (and hence subject to the
associated materiality test) rather than a professional relationship. “Of Counsel” relationships are only considered immaterial if the individual does not receive any form of compensation (in excess of $10,000 per year) from, or is a
retired partner of, the firm providing the professional service. The case of a company providing a professional service to one of its directors or to an entity with which one of its directors is affiliated, will be considered a transactional rather
than a professional relationship. Insurance services and marketing services are assumed to be professional services unless the company explains why such services are not advisory. </p>
<p><b><i><sup>viii</sup></i></b> A material transactional relationship, including grants to <font>non-profit</font> organizations, exists if the company makes annual payments to, or receives annual payments from, another entity exceeding the greater of $200,000 or 5 percent of the recipient’s gross revenues,
in the case of a company which follows NASDAQ listing standards; or the greater of $1,000,000 or 2 percent of the recipient’s gross revenues, in the case of a company which follows NYSE listing standards. In the case of a company which
follows neither of the preceding standards, Social Advisory Services will apply the NASDAQ-based materiality test. (The recipient is the party receiving the financial proceeds from the transaction). </p>
<p><b><i><sup>ix</sup></i></b> Dissident directors who are parties to a
voting agreement pursuant to a settlement or similar arrangement may be classified as independent directors if an analysis of the following factors indicates that the voting agreement does not compromise their alignment with all shareholders’
interests: the terms of the agreement; the duration of the standstill </p></div>

<p><b><i><sup>xi</sup></i></b> The operating involvement of the founder with the company will be
considered; if the founder was never employed by the company, Social Advisory Services may deem him or her an independent outsider. </p>
<p><b><i><sup>xii</sup></i></b> For purposes of Social Advisory
Services’ director independence classification, “material” will be defined as a standard of relationship (financial, personal or otherwise) that a reasonable person might conclude could potentially influence one’s objectivity in
the boardroom in a manner that would have a meaningful impact on an individual’s ability to satisfy requisite fiduciary standards on behalf of shareholders. </p></div>

<p><font color="#595959"><b><a name="sri745737a_17"></a>Classification/Declassification of the Board </b></font></p>
<p>Under a classified board structure only one class of directors would stand for election each year, and the directors in each class would generally serve three-year
terms. Although staggered boards can provide continuity for companies at the board level, there are also a number of downsides to the structure. First, a classified board can also be used to entrench management and effectively preclude most takeover
bids or proxy contests. Board classification forces dissidents and <font>would-be</font> acquirers to negotiate with the incumbent board, which has the authority to decide on offers without a shareholder vote. In addition,
when a board is classified, it is difficult to remove individual members for either poor attendance or poor performance; shareholders would only have the chance to vote on a given director every third year when he or she comes up for election. The
classified board structure can also limit shareholders’ ability to withhold votes from inside directors that sit on key board committee, or to withhold votes from an entire board slate to protest the lack of board diversity. According to
ISS’ 2012 Board Practices study, the number of S&amp;P 500 companies with classified boards has continued to fall. In 2015, only 17 percent of S&amp;P 500 companies maintained staggered boards, compared to 25 percent in 2014,
30 percent in 2013, and 39 percent in 2010. While we recognize that there are some advantages to classified boards, based on the latest studies on classified boards, the fact that classified boards can make it more difficult for
shareholders to remove individual directors, and the fact that classified boards can be used as an antitakeover device, Social Advisory Services recommends against the adoption of classified boards. </p>

is permitted to have one vote per share for each director to be elected. Shareholders are permitted to apportion those votes in any manner they wish among the director candidates. Shareholders have the opportunity to elect a minority representative
to a board through cumulative voting, thereby ensuring representation for all sizes of shareholders. For example, if there is a company with a <font>ten-member</font> board and 500 shares outstanding—the total number
of votes that may be cast is 5,000. In this case a shareholder with 51 shares (10.2 percent of the outstanding shares) would be guaranteed one board seat because all votes may be cast for one candidate. </p>

the size of the board, management can make it more difficult for dissidents to gain control of the board. Fixing the size of the board also prevents a reduction in the size of the board as a strategy to oust independent directors. Fixing board size

presented to shareholders for approval. If, however, the board of directors rejects the bid, the acquirer can make a tender offer for the shares directly to the targeted corporation’s shareholders. Such offers are referred to as hostile tender
bids. </p> <p>Not wishing to wait until they are subjects of hostile takeover attempts, many corporations have adopted antitakeover measures designed to deter unfriendly
bids or buy time. The most common defenses are the shareholders rights protection plan, also known as the poison pill, and charter amendments that create barriers to acceptance of hostile bids. In the U.S., poison pills do not require shareholder
approval. However, shareholders must approve charter amendments, such as classified boards or supermajority vote requirements. In brief, the very existence of defensive measures can foreclose the possibility of tenders and hence, opportunities to
premium prices for shareholders. </p> <p>Anti-takeover statutes generally increase management’s potential for insulating itself and warding off hostile takeovers that
may be beneficial to shareholders. While it may be true that some boards use such devices to obtain higher bids and to enhance shareholder value, it is more likely that such provisions are used to entrench management. The majority of historical
evidence on individual corporate anti-takeover measures indicates that heavily insulated companies generally realize lower returns than those having managements that are more accountable to shareholders and the market. The evidence also suggests
that when states adopt their own anti-takeover devices, or endorse those employed by firms, shareholder returns are harmed. Moreover, the body of evidence appears to indicate that companies in states with the strongest anti-takeover laws experience
lower returns than they would absent such statutes. </p> <p><font color="#6d5e56"><a name="sri745737a_44"></a>Takeover Defenses and Shareholder Rights-Related Management

<p>Poison pills are corporate-sponsored financial devices that, when triggered by potential acquirers, do one or more of the following: 1) dilute the acquirer’s
equity holdings in the target company; 2) dilute the acquirer’s voting interests in the target company; or 3) dilute the acquirer’s equity holdings in the post-merger company. Poison pills generally allow shareholders to purchase shares
from, or sell shares back to, the target company <font>(flip-in</font> pill) and/or the potential acquirer <font>(flip-out</font> pill) at a price far out of line with fair market value.
Depending on the type of pill, the triggering event can either transfer wealth from the target company or dilute the equity holdings of current shareholders. Poison pills insulate management from the threat of a change in control and provide the
target board with veto power over takeover bids. Because poison pills greatly alter the balance of power between shareholders and management, shareholders should be allowed to make their own evaluation of such plans. </p>

notice bylaws. These recent court decisions have encouraged companies to take a closer look at their bylaw provisions to ensure that broad language does not provide loopholes for activist investors. Specifically, companies are including language

<p>Confidential voting, or voting by secret ballot, is one of the key structural issues in the proxy system. It ensures that all votes are based on the merits of proposals
and cast in the best interests of fiduciary clients and pension plan beneficiaries. In a confidential voting system, only vote tabulators and inspectors of election may examine individual proxies and ballots; management and shareholders are given
only vote totals. In an open voting system, management can determine who has voted against its nominees or proposals and then <font>re-solicit</font> those votes before the final vote count. As a result, shareholders can
be pressured to vote with management at companies with which they maintain, or would like to establish, a business relationship. Confidential voting also protects employee shareholders from retaliation. Shares held by employee stock ownership plans,
for example, are important votes that are typically voted by employees. </p> <p><font color="#1447dd"><b>Social Advisory Services

them as negotiating tools to obtain a higher premium for shareholders. The opposing view maintains that managements afforded such protection are more likely to become entrenched than to actively pursue the best interests of shareholders. Such

</p> <p> </p> <p>that would incentivize excessive risk-taking by managements.
The financial crisis raised questions about the role of pay incentives in influencing executive behavior and motivating inappropriate or excessive risk-taking that could threaten a corporation‘s long-term viability. The safety lapses that led
to the disastrous explosions at BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil rig and Massey Energy’s Upper Big Branch mine, and the resulting unprecedented losses in shareholder value; a) underscore the importance of incorporating meaningful economic
incentives around social and environmental considerations in compensation program design, and b) exemplify the costly liabilities of failing to do so. </p> <p>Evolving
disclosure requirements have opened a wider window into compensation practices and processes, giving shareholders more opportunity and responsibility to ensure that pay is designed to create and sustain value. Companies in the U.S. are now required
to evaluate and discuss potential risks arising from misguided or misaligned compensation programs. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires advisory shareholder votes on executive compensation (management “say on
pay”), an advisory vote on the frequency of say on pay, as well as a shareholder advisory vote on golden parachute compensation. The advent of “say on pay” votes for shareholders in the U.S. has provided a new communication mechanism
and impetus for constructive engagement between shareholders and managers/directors on pay issues. </p> <p>The socially responsible investing community contends that
corporations should be held accountable for their actions and decisions, including those around executive compensation. Social Advisory Services believes that executive pay programs should be fair, competitive, reasonable, and create appropriate
incentives, and that pay for performance should be a central tenet in executive compensation philosophy. Most investors expect corporations to adhere to certain best practice pay considerations in designing and administering executive and director
compensation programs, including: </p> <p> </p>

<font><font>Say-on-Pay</font></font> Proposals </b></font></p> <p>The Dodd-Frank Act mandates advisory votes on
executive compensation (Say on Pay or “SOP”) for a proxy or consent or authorization for an annual or other meeting of the shareholders that includes required SEC compensation disclosures. This
<font>non-binding</font> shareholder vote on compensation must be included in a proxy or consent or authorization at least once every three years. </p>
<p>In general, the SOP ballot item is the primary focus of voting on executive pay practices – dissatisfaction with compensation practices can be expressed by voting
against the SOP proposal rather than voting against or withhold from the compensation committee. However, if there is no SOP on the ballot, then the negative vote will apply to members of the compensation committee. In addition, in egregious cases,
or if the board fails to respond to concerns raised by a prior SOP proposal, then Social Advisory Services will recommend a vote against or withhold votes from compensation committee members (or, if the full board is deemed accountable, all
directors). If the negative factors involve equity-based compensation, then a vote against an equity-based plan proposal presented for shareholder approval may be appropriate. In evaluating SOP proposals, Social Advisory Services will also assess to
what degree social and environmental considerations are incorporated into compensation programs and executive pay decision-making – to the extent that proxy statement Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&amp;A) disclosures permit. </p>

</p> <p> </p> <p>Social Advisory Services will recommend a vote for annual
advisory votes on compensation. The SOP is at its essence a communication vehicle, and communication is most useful when it is received in a consistent and timely manner. Social Advisory Services supports an annual SOP vote for many of the same
reasons it supports annual director elections rather than a classified board structure: because this provides the highest level of accountability and direct communication by enabling the MSOP vote to correspond to the majority of the information
presented in the accompanying proxy statement for the applicable shareholders’ meeting. Having SOP votes every two or three years, covering all actions occurring between the votes, would make it difficult to create the meaningful and coherent
communication that the votes are intended to provide. Under triennial elections, for example, a company would not know whether the shareholder vote references the compensation year being discussed or a previous year, making it more difficult to
understand the implications of the vote. </p> <p><font color="#1447dd"><b>Social Advisory Services Recommendation:</b></font><font> Vote for annual advisory votes on compensation, which provide the most consistent and clear communication channel for shareholder concerns about companies’ executive pay programs. </font></p>

</p> <p> </p> <p>Stock-based plans can transfer significant amounts of wealth
from shareholders to executives and directors and are among the most economically significant issues that shareholders are entitled to vote on. Rightly, the cost of these plans must be in line with the anticipated benefits to shareholders. Clearly,
reasonable limits must be set on dilution as well as administrative authority. In addition, shareholders must consider the necessity of the various pay programs and examine the appropriateness of award types. Consequently, the pros and cons of these
proposals necessitate a <font><font>case-by-case</font></font> evaluation. </p> <p>Factors that increase the cost (or
have the potential to increase the cost) of plans to shareholders include: excessive dilution, options awarded at below-market discounts, permissive policies on pyramiding, restricted stock giveaways that reward tenure rather than results, sales of
shares on concessionary terms, blank-check authority for administering committees, option repricing or option replacements, accelerated vesting of awards in the event of defined changes in corporate control, stand-alone stock appreciation rights,
loans or other forms of assistance, or evidence of improvident award policies. </p> <p>Positive plan features that can offset costly features include: plans with modest
dilution potential (i.e. appreciably below double-digit levels), bars to pyramiding and related safeguards for investor interests. Also favorable are performance programs with a duration of two or more years, bonus schemes that pay off in <font>non-dilutive,</font> fully deductible cash, 401K and other thrift or profit sharing plans, and <font>tax-favored</font> employee stock purchase plans.

<p>The cost of the equity plans is expressed as Shareholder Value Transfer (SVT), which is measured using a binomial option pricing model that assesses the amount of
shareholders’ equity flowing out of the company to employees and directors. SVT is expressed as both a dollar amount and as a percentage of market value, and includes the new shares proposed, shares available under existing plans, and shares
granted but unexercised (using two measures, in the case of plans subject to the Equity Plan Scorecard evaluation, as noted above). All award types are valued. For omnibus plans, unless limitations are placed on the most expensive types of awards
(for example, full value awards), the assumption is made that all awards to be granted will be the most expensive types. See discussion of specific types of awards. </p>
<p>Except for proposals subject to Equity Plan Scorecard evaluation, Shareholder Value Transfer is reasonable if it falls below a company-specific benchmark. The benchmark
is determined as follows: The top quartile performers in each industry group (using the Global Industry Classification Standard: GICS) are identified. Benchmark SVT levels for each industry are established based on these top performers’
historic SVT. Regression analyses are run on each industry group to identify the variables most strongly correlated to SVT. The benchmark industry SVT level is then adjusted upwards or downwards for the specific company by plugging the
company-specific performance measures, size and cash compensation into the industry cap equations to arrive at the company’s benchmark.<sup>21</sup> </p>

<p>A<font color="#1447dd"><b> </b></font><font>“Value-Adjusted Burn Rate” is used for stock plan evaluations.
Value-Adjusted Burn Rate benchmarks will be calculated as the greater of: (1) an industry-specific threshold based on three-year burn rates within the company’s GICS group segmented by S&amp;P 500, Russell 3000 index (less the S&amp;P 500)
and <font>non-Russell</font> 3000 index; and (2) a de minimis threshold established separately for each of the S&amp;P 500, the Russell 3000 index less the S&amp;P 500, and the
<font>non-Russell</font> 3000 index. Year-over-year burn-rate benchmark changes will be limited to a predetermined range above or below the prior year’s burn-rate benchmark. </font></p>
<p>The Value-Adjusted Burn Rate will be calculated as follows: </p> <p>Value-Adjusted Burn

<p>The board’s legal charge of fulfilling its fiduciary obligations of loyalty and care is put to the ultimate test through the task of the board setting its own
compensation. Directors themselves oversee the process for evaluating board performance and establishing pay packages for board members. </p> <p>Shareholders provide
limited oversight of directors by electing individuals who are primarily selected by the board, or a board nominating committee, and by voting on stock-based plans for directors designed by the board compensation committee. Additionally,
shareholders may submit and vote on their own resolutions seeking to limit or restructure director pay. While the cost of compensating <font>non-employee</font> directors is small in absolute terms, compared to the cost of
compensating executives, it is still a critical aspect of a company’s overall corporate governance structure. </p> <p>Overall, director pay levels are rising in part
because of the new forms of pay in use at many companies, as well as because of the increased responsibilities arising from the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act requirements. In addition to an annual retainer fee, many companies also pay fees for attending
board and committee meetings, fees for chairing a committee, or a retainer fee for chairing a committee. </p> <p>Director compensation packages should be designed to
provide value to directors for their contribution. Given that many directors are high-level executives whose personal income levels are generally high, cash compensation may hold little appeal. Stock-based incentives on the other hand reinforce the
directors’ role of protecting and enhancing shareholder value. The stock-based component of director compensation should be large enough to ensure that when faced with a situation in which the interests of shareholders and management differ,
the board will have a financial incentive to think as a shareholder. Additionally, many companies have instituted equity ownership programs for directors. Social Advisory Services recommends that directors receive stock grants equal to three times
of their annual retainer, as it is a reasonable starting point for companies of all sizes and industries. A vesting schedule for director grants helps directors to meet the stock ownership guidelines and maintains their long-term interests in the
firm. </p> <p>Director compensation packages should also be designed to attract and retain competent directors who are willing to risk becoming a defendant in a lawsuit
and suffer potentially adverse publicity if the company runs into financial difficulties or is mismanaged. </p>

<p>The SEC requires that companies disclose, in their proxy statements, the salaries of the top five corporate executives (who make at least $100,000 a year). Companies
also disclose their compensation practices and details of their stock-based compensation plans. While this level of disclosure is helpful, it does not always provide a comprehensive picture of the company’s compensation practices. For
shareholders to make informed decisions on compensation levels, they need to have clear, concise information at their disposal. Increased disclosure will help ensure that management: (1) has legitimate reasons for setting specific pay levels;
and (2) is held accountable for its actions. </p> <p><font color="#1447dd"><b>Social Advisory Services Recommendation:</b></font><font> Vote for shareholder proposals seeking increased disclosure on executive compensation issues including the preparation of a formal report on executive compensation practices and policies. </font></p>

<p>Proposals that seek to limit executive or director compensation usually focus on the absolute dollar figure of the compensation or focus on the ratio of compensation

ownership is a simple method to align the interests of directors with company shareholders. Nevertheless, many highly qualified individuals such as academics and clergy who can offer valuable perspectives in boardrooms may be unable to purchase
individual shares of stock. In such a circumstance, the preferred solution is to look at the board nominees individually and take stock ownership into consideration when voting on the merits of each candidate. </p>

<p>A cash balance plan is a defined benefit plan that treats an earned retirement benefit as if it was a credit from a defined contribution plan, but which provides a
stated benefit at the end of its term. Because employer contributions to these plans are credited evenly over the life of a plan, and not based on a seniority formula they may reduce payouts to long-term employees who are currently vested in plans.
</p> <p>Cash-balance pension conversions have undergone congressional and federal agency scrutiny following high-profile EEOC complaints on age discrimination and employee
anger at companies like IBM. While significant change is unlikely in the <font>short-tm,</font> business interests were concerned enough that the National Association of Manufacturers and other business lobbies formed a
Capitol Hill coalition to preserve the essential features of the plans and to overturn an IRS ruling. Driving the push behind conversions from traditional pension plans to cash-balance plans are the substantial savings that companies generate in the
process. Critics point out that these savings are gained at the expense of the most senior employees. Resolutions call on corporate boards to establish a committee of outside directors to prepare a report to shareholders on the potential impact of
pension-related proposals now being considered by national policymakers in reaction to the controversy spawned by the plans. </p> <p><font color="#1447dd"><b>Social

requires that the fair market value of the target is at least equal to 80 percent of net assets of the SPAC). Also, there may be sense of urgency by the management team of the SPAC to close the deal since its charter typically requires a

</p> <p> </p> <p>In general, Social Advisory Services supports proposals that
request the company to furnish information helpful to shareholders in evaluating the company’s operations. In order to be able to intelligently monitor their investments shareholders often need information best provided by the company in which
they have invested. Requests to report such information will merit support. Requests to establish special committees of the board to address broad corporate policy and provide forums for ongoing dialogue on issues including, but not limited to
shareholder relations, the environment, human rights, occupational health and safety, and executive compensation, will generally be supported, particularly when they appear to offer a potentially effective method for enhancing shareholder value. We
will closely evaluate proposals that ask the company to cease certain actions that the proponent believes are harmful to society or some segment of society with special attention to the company’s legal and ethical obligations, its ability to
remain profitable, and potential negative publicity if the company fails to honor the request. Social Advisory Services supports shareholder proposals that improve the company’s public image, and reduce exposure to liabilities. </p>

to advance the representation of underrepresented gender, ethnic, and racial identities in their workforce. The costs of violating federal laws that prohibit discrimination by corporations are high and can affect corporate earnings. The Equal
Opportunities Employment Commission does not release the companies’ filings to the public, unless it is involved in litigation and this information is difficult to obtain from other sources. Companies need to be sensitive to diverse workforce
employment issues as new generations of workers become increasingly diverse. This information can be provided with little cost to the company and does not create an unreasonable burden on management.</p>

<p>Investors, international human rights groups, and labor advocacy groups have long been making attempts to safeguard worker rights in the international marketplace. In
instances where companies themselves operate factories in developing countries for example, these advocates have asked that the companies adopt global corporate standards that guarantee sustainable wages and safe working conditions for their workers
abroad. Companies that contract out portions of their manufacturing operations to foreign companies have been asked to ensure that the products they receive from those contractors have not been made using forced labor, child labor, or other forms of
modern slavery. These companies are asked to adopt formal vendor standards that, among other things, include some sort of monitoring mechanisms. Globalization, relocation of production overseas, and widespread use of subcontractors and vendors;
often make it difficult to obtain a complete picture of a company’s labor practices in global markets. Deadly accidents at factories, most notably in Bangladesh and Pakistan, have continued to intensify these concerns. Many investors believe
that companies would benefit from adopting a human rights policy, based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization’s Core Labor Standards. Efforts that seek greater disclosure on a company’s
global labor practices, including its supply chain, and that seek to establish minimum standards for a company’s operations will be supported. In addition, requests for independent monitoring of overseas operations will be supported.</p>
<p>Social Advisory Services generally supports proposals that call for the adoption and/or enforcement of principles or codes relating to countries in which there are
systematic violations of human rights; such as the use of slave, child, or prison labor; a government that is illegitimate; or there is a call by human rights advocates, <font>pro-democracy</font> organizations, or
legitimately-elected representatives for economic sanctions. The use of child labor or forced labor is unethical and can damage corporate reputations. Poor labor practices can lead to litigation against the company, which can be costly and time
consuming.</p>

governments. The ILO’s general mandate is to promote a decent workplace for all individuals. The ILO sets international labor standards in the form of its conventions and then monitors compliance with the standards. The seven conventions of the
ILO fall under four broad categories: Right to organize and bargain collectively, Nondiscrimination in employment, Abolition of forced labor, and End of child labor. Each of the 187 member-nations of the ILO is bound to respect and promote these
rights to the best of their abilities. SA 8000 is a set of labor standards, based on the principles of the ILO conventions and other human rights conventions, and covers eight workplace conditions, including: child labor, forced labor, health and
safety, freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, discrimination, disciplinary practices, working hours and compensation. Companies have also turned to the United Nations “Guiding Principles on Business and Human
Rights,” - a set of guidelines that create a framework for states to protect human rights, corporations to respect human rights, and rights-holders to access remediation. </p>

<p>These resolutions have called for the adoption of the MacBride Principles for operations located in Northern Ireland. They request companies operating abroad to support
the equal employment opportunity policies that apply in facilities they operate domestically. The principles were established to address the sectarian hiring problems between Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland. It is well documented that
Northern Ireland’s Catholic community faced much higher unemployment figures than the Protestant community. In response to this problem, the U.K. government instituted the New Fair Employment Act of 1989 (and subsequent amendments) to address
the sectarian hiring problems. </p> <p>Many companies believe that the Act adequately addresses the problems and that further action, including adoption of the MacBride
Principles, only duplicates the efforts already underway. In evaluating a proposal to adopt the MacBride Principles, shareholders must decide whether the principles will cause companies to divest, and therefore worsen the unemployment problem, or
whether the principles will promote equal hiring practices. Proponents believe that the Fair Employment Act does not sufficiently address the sectarian hiring problems. They argue that the MacBride Principles serve to stabilize the situation and
promote further investment. </p>

are enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, which is part of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, as well as U.S. Customs and Border Patrol for sanctioned goods. However, these countries do not comprise an exhaustive list of countries
considered to be high-risk markets. </p> <p>Shareholder proponents have filed resolutions addressing a variety of concerns around how investments and operations in
high-risk regions may support, or be perceived to support, potentially oppressive governments. Proponents contend that operations in these countries may lead to potential reputational, regulatory, and/or supply chain risks as a result of operational
disruptions. Concerned shareholders have requested investment withdrawals or cessation of operations in high-risk markets as well as reports on operations in high-risk markets. Such reports may seek additional disclosure from companies on criteria
employed for investing in, continuing to operate in, and withdrawing from specific countries. </p> <p>Depending on the country’s human rights record, investors have
also asked companies to refrain from commencing new projects in the country of concern until improvements are made. In addition, investors have sought greater disclosure on the nature of a company’s involvement in the country and on the impact

<p>Information technology sector companies have been at the center of shareholder advocacy campaigns regarding concerns over Internet service companies and technology
providers’ alleged cooperation with potentially repressive regimes, notably the Chinese government. Shareholder proposals, submitted at various companies, advocated for companies to take steps to stop abetting repression and censorship of the
Internet and/or review their human rights policies taking this issue into consideration. Resolution sponsors generally argue that the Chinese government is using IT company technologies to track, monitor, identify, and, ultimately, suppress
political dissent. In the view of proponents, this process of surveillance and associated suppression violates internationally accepted norms outlined in the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights. </p>
<p>While early shareholder resolutions on Internet issues focused on censorship by repressive regimes and net neutrality, proponents have recently raised concerns
regarding privacy and data security in the wake of increased breaches that result in the misuse of personal information. On Oct. 13, 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a guidance document about the disclosure obligations
relating to cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents. In the document, the SEC references the negative consequences that are associated with cyber-attacks, such as: remediation costs, including those required to repair relationships with customers
and clients; increased cyber-security protection costs; lost revenues from unauthorized use of the information or missed opportunities to attract clients; litigation; and reputational damage. The document says that while the federal securities laws
do not explicitly require disclosure of cybersecurity risks and incidents, some disclosure requirements may impose an obligation on the company to disclose such information and provides scenarios where disclosure may be required. According to the
FBI’s 2021 Internet Crime report, potential losses from cybercrimes hit $6.9 billion, up 64% from 2018. </p>

</a>Environmental/Sustainability Reports </b></font></p> <p>Shareholders may request general environmental disclosures or reports on a specific location/operation, often
requesting that the company detail the environmental risks and potential liabilities of a specific project. Increasingly, companies have begun reporting on environmental and sustainability issues using the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)
standards. The GRI was established in 1997 with the mission of developing globally applicable guidelines for reporting on economic, environmental, and social performance. The GRI was developed by
<u><font color="#3d72ff">Ceres</font></u><font> (formerly known as the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies, CERES) in partnership with the United Nations Environment Programme
(UNEP). </font></p> <p>Ceres was formed in the wake of the March 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, when a consortium of investors, environmental groups, and religious
organizations drafted what were originally named the Valdez Principles. Later to be renamed the CERES Principles, and now branded as the Ceres Roadmap 2030, corporate signatories to the Ceres Roadmap 2030 pledge to publicly report on environmental
issues, including protection of the biosphere, sustainable use of natural resources, reduction and disposal of wastes, energy conservation, and employee and community risk reduction in a standardized form. </p>
<p>The Equator Principles are the financial industry’s benchmark for determining, assessing and managing social and environmental risk in project financing. The
Principles were first launched in June 2003 and were ultimately adopted by over forty financial institutions during a three year implementation period. The principles were subsequently revised in July 2006 to take into account the new performance
standards approved by the World Bank Group’s International Finance Corporation (IFC). The third iteration of the Principles was launched in June 2013 and it amplified the banks’ commitments to social responsibility, including human rights,
climate change, and transparency. Financial institutions adopt these principles to ensure that the projects they venture in are developed in a socially responsible manner and reflect sound environmental management practices. </p>

<p>Proposals asking for a report on oil sands operations in the Athabasca region of Alberta, Canada have appeared at a number of oil and gas companies. Alberta’s oil
sands contain a reserve largely thought to be one of the world’s largest potential energy sources. Rising oil sands production in Alberta has been paralleled with concerns from a variety of stakeholders—including environmental groups,
local residents, and shareholders—regarding the environmental impacts of the complicated extraction and upgrading processes required to convert oil sands into a synthetic crude oil. The high viscosity of bitumen makes its extraction a
challenging and resource-intensive process; the most common extraction technique involves pumping steam into the oil sands to lower the viscosity of bitumen in order to pump it to the surface. </p>
<p>One of the most prominent issues concerning oil sands is the large volume of greenhouse gases (GHG) associated with production. Oil sands are by far one of the most
energy-intensive forms of oil production, releasing three times more GHG emissions from production than conventional oil. </p>

<p>The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) is a federally protected wilderness along Alaska’s North Slope. In the past, legislation proposed in both the House and
Senate that, if passed, would allow a portion of this area to be leased to private companies for development and production of oil, has been witnessed. Oil companies have expressed an interest in bidding for these leases given the opportunity. In
response, shareholder activists have filed resolutions asking these companies to cancel any plans to drill in the ANWR and cease their lobbying efforts to open the area for drilling. Proponents of shareholder proposals on this issue argue that the
Coastal Plain section of the ANWR is the most environmentally sensitive area of the refuge, that the majority of Alaska’s North Slope that is not federally designated wilderness already provides the oil industry with sufficient resources for
oil production, and that advocates of drilling in ANWR overstate the benefit to be derived from opening the wilderness to oil production. Those in favor of opening the area up to drilling note that only a small portion of ANWR would be considered
for exploration, and if drilling were to take place, it would be on less than one percent of the entire area, that modern technology reduces the environmental impact of oil drilling on both the land and surrounding wildlife, and that oil production
in ANWR would have considerable benefit to company shareholders, Alaskans, and the United States as a whole. </p> <p><font color="#1447dd"><b>Social Advisory Services

<p>Proponents of these proposals feel that social and environmental criteria should be factored into the formulas used in determining executive compensation packages. The
shareholder sponsors of the resolutions look to companies to review current compensation practices and to include social or environmental performance criteria such as accounting for “poor corporate citizenship” and meeting environmental or
workplace safety objectives and metrics when evaluating executive compensation. Some of the <font>non-financial</font> criteria that proponents of these resolutions seek to be incorporated in compensation program design
include workplace safety, environmental stewardship, or diversity and customer/employee satisfaction – as part of a written policy used to align compensation with performance on <font>non-financial</font> factors
alongside financial criteria. </p> <p>Proponents believe that factors such as poor environmental performance, workplace lawsuits, etc. could have a significant adverse
impact on a company’s financial performance if not proactively and adequately addressed, and that these factors <i>should</i> be considered along with traditional financial considerations when determining executive pay. The significant stock
price declines and massive losses in shareholder value stemming from the BP Deepwater Horizon oil rig disaster and the tragic explosion at Massey Energy’s Upper Big Branch mine that killed 29 employees is a sobering reminder of the need to have
the right management incentives in place to ensure that social and environmental risks are actively managed and mitigated against. Given the proliferation of derivative lawsuits targeted at firms such as Halliburton, Transocean and Cameron
International that were suppliers to or partners with BP in a capacity that ignored safety considerations or that contributed to the economic and ecological disaster, investors are increasingly mindful of the
