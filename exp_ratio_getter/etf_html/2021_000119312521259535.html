<div>The iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (the
“Fund”) seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of U.S. Treasury bonds with remaining maturities of less than or equal to three months.</div>
<div>Fees and Expenses</div>
<div>The following table describes the fees and expenses that you
will incur if you buy, hold and sell shares of the Fund. The investment advisory agreement between iShares Trust (the “Trust”) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (“BFA”) (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) provides
that BFA will pay all operating expenses of the Fund, except the management fees, interest expenses, taxes, expenses incurred with respect to the acquisition and disposition of portfolio securities and the execution of portfolio transactions,
including brokerage commissions, distribution fees or expenses, litigation expenses and any extraordinary expenses. BFA, the investment adviser to the Fund, has contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fee so that the Fund’s
total annual fund operating expenses after the fee waiver will not exceed 0.03% through June 30, 2022. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to June 30, 2022 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA.</div>
<div>You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and other
fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the tables and examples below.</div> <div>

<div>Portfolio Turnover.<font> The Fund
may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are
held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance. From inception (May 26, 2020) to the most recent fiscal year end, the Fund's portfolio
turnover rate was 326% of the average value of its portfolio.</font></div>
<div>Principal Investment Strategies</div>
<div>The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the ICE<sup>®</sup> 0-3 Month US Treasury Securities Index (the “Underlying Index”), which measures the performance of public obligations of the U.S. Treasury
that have a remaining maturity of less than or equal to three months. As of February 28, 2021, there were 34 components in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is market value weighted based on amounts
outstanding of issuances consisting of publicly issued U.S. Treasury securities with a remaining term to final maturity of less than or equal to three months as of the rebalance date and have $1 billion or more of outstanding face value, excluding
amounts held by the Federal Reserve System Open Market Account. In addition, the securities in the Underlying Index must have a fixed coupon schedule and be denominated in U.S. dollars. Excluded from the Underlying Index are inflation-linked
securities, cash management bills and zero-coupon bonds that have been</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>stripped from coupon-paying bonds
(<font>e.g.</font>, Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities). However, the amounts outstanding of qualifying coupon securities in the Underlying Index are not reduced by any individual
components of such securities (<font>i.e.</font>, coupon or principal) that have been stripped after inclusion in the Underlying Index. The Underlying Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of each month.</div>
<div>The Underlying Index does not provide for the reinvestment of
cash flows from coupon payments or the proceeds of maturing component securities between rebalance dates. Consequently, the Fund may hold money market instruments.</div>
<div>BFA uses a “passive” or indexing approach to try to
achieve the Fund’s investment objective. Unlike many investment companies, the Fund does not try to “beat” the index it tracks and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued.</div>
<div>Indexing may eliminate the chance that the Fund will
substantially outperform the Underlying Index but also may reduce some of the risks of active management, such as poor security selection. Indexing seeks to achieve lower costs and better after-tax performance by aiming to keep portfolio turnover
low in comparison to actively managed investment companies.</div>
<div>BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage
the Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to that of an applicable underlying index. The
securities</div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics
(based on factors such as market value and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability, duration, maturity, credit ratings and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying index. The
Fund may or may not hold all of the securities in the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its assets in
the component securities of the Underlying Index and may invest up to 10% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its affiliates
(“BlackRock Cash Funds”), as well as in securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. From time to time when conditions warrant, however, the Fund may invest at
least 80% of its assets in the component securities of the Underlying Index and may invest up to 20% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, including shares of BlackRock Cash Funds, as well as in
securities not included in the Underlying Index, but which BFA believes will help the Fund track the Underlying Index. The Fund seeks to track the investment results of the Underlying Index before fees and expenses of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund may lend securities representing up to one-third of
the value of the Fund’s total assets (including the value of any collateral received).</div>
<div>The Underlying Index is sponsored by ICE Data Indices, LLC or
its affiliates (collectively, the “Index Provider” or</div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>“IDI”), which is independent of the Fund and BFA. The Index
Provider determines the composition and relative weightings of the securities in the Underlying Index and publishes information regarding the market value of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Summary of Principal Risks</div>
<div>As with any investment, you could lose all or part of your
investment in the Fund, and the Fund's performance could trail that of other investments. The Fund is subject to certain risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund's net asset value per share
(“NAV”), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>U.S. Treasury Obligations Risk. <font>U.S. Treasury obligations may differ from other securities in their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and other characteristics and may provide relatively lower returns than those of other
securities. Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial condition or credit rating of the U.S. government may cause the value of the Fund's U.S. Treasury obligations to decline.</font></div>
<div>Interest Rate Risk<font>.</font><font> During periods of very low or negative interest rates, the Fund may be unable to maintain positive returns or pay dividends to Fund shareholders. Very low or negative interest rates may magnify
interest rate risk. Changing interest rates, including rates that fall below zero, may have unpredictable effects on markets, result in heightened market volatility and detract from the Fund’s performance to the extent the Fund is exposed to
such interest rates. Additionally, under</font></div> </div> <div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>S-3</div> </div> </div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>certain market conditions in which interest rates are low and the market
prices for portfolio securities have increased, the Fund may have a very low or even negative yield. A low or negative yield would cause the Fund to lose money in certain conditions and over certain time periods. An increase in interest rates will
generally cause the value of securities held by the Fund to decline, may lead to heightened volatility in the fixed-income markets and may adversely affect the liquidity of certain fixed-income investments, including those held by the Fund. The
historically low interest rate environment heightens the risks associated with rising interest rates.</div>
<div>Income Risk.
<font>The Fund's income may decline if interest rates fall. This decline in income can occur because the Fund may subsequently invest in lower-yielding bonds as bonds in its portfolio mature, are near
maturity or are called, bonds in the Underlying Index are substituted, or the Fund otherwise needs to purchase additional bonds.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the
U.S<font>.</font><font> Certain changes in the U.S. economy, such as when the U.S. economy weakens or when its financial markets decline, may have an adverse effect on the
securities to which the Fund has exposure.</font></div> <div>Asset
Class Risk.<font> Securities in the Underlying Index or in the Fund's portfolio may underperform in comparison to the general financial markets, a particular financial market or other asset
classes.</font></div> <div>Assets Under Management (AUM) Risk<font>.</font><font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant (as defined in the </font><font>Creations and Redemptions</font><font> section of this prospectus (the “Prospectus”)), a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and
hold its investment for a specific period of time to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There<font> </font>can be no assurance that any such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund would be
maintained at such levels, which could negatively impact the Fund.</div>
<div>Authorized Participant Concentration Risk.<font> Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption
transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.,</font><font> on behalf of other
market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem,
Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's
investments are concentrated in the securities and/or other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector, market segment or asset class.</font></div>
<div>Cybersecurity Risk<font>.</font><font> Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, distributor, the Index Provider and other service</font></div> </div> <div> </div>

<div>providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of securities
in which the Fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions, negatively impact the Fund’s business operations and/or potentially result in financial losses to the Fund and its shareholders. While the Fund has established business
continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems of the Fund’s Index
Provider and other service providers, market makers, Authorized Participants or issuers of securities in which the Fund invests.</div>
<div>High Portfolio Turnover Risk.<font> High portfolio turnover (considered by the Fund to mean higher than 100% annually) may result in increased transaction costs to the Fund, including brokerage commissions, dealer mark-ups and other
transaction costs on the sale of the securities and on reinvestment in other securities.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk. <font>There is no guarantee that the Fund’s investment results will have a high degree of correlation to those of the Underlying Index or that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Market
disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the Underlying Index. Errors in index data, index computations or the construction of
the Underlying Index in accordance with its methodology may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the Index Provider for a period of time or at all, which may have an adverse impact on the Fund and its shareholders.
Unusual market</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>conditions may cause the Index Provider to postpone a scheduled rebalance,
which could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition.</div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk. <font>An outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus has resulted in travel restrictions, disruption of healthcare systems, prolonged quarantines, cancellations,
supply chain disruptions, lower consumer demand, layoffs, ratings downgrades, defaults and other significant economic impacts. Certain markets have experienced temporary closures, extreme volatility, severe losses, reduced liquidity and increased
trading costs. These events will have an impact on the Fund and its investments and could impact the Fund’s ability to purchase or sell securities or cause elevated tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV. Other
infectious illness outbreaks in the future may result in similar impacts.</font></div>
<div>Issuer Risk<font>.</font><font> The performance of the Fund depends on the performance of individual securities to which the Fund has exposure. The Fund may be adversely affected if an issuer of underlying securities held by the Fund
is unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk<font>.</font><font> As the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index, it is subject to the risk that BFA's investment strategy may not produce the intended results.</font></div>
<div>Market Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund could lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Local, regional or global events such as war, acts

<div>terrorism, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues,
recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV.</div>
<div>Market Trading Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruptions in
the creation/redemption process. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV.</font></div>
<div>Operational Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund’s service providers,
counterparties or other third-parties, failed or inadequate processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible
risk and may be inadequate to address significant operational risks.</font></div>
<div>Passive Investment Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund is not actively managed, and BFA generally does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk. <font>The Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return</font></div> </div>
<div type="Block">
<div>the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in
the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund.</div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk<font>.</font><font> The Fund may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the
securities held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included in the Underlying Index, pricing differences, transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the
valuation of distributions, the requirements to maintain pass-through tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, changes to the Underlying Index or
the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund
incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does not.</font></div>

<div>Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares</div>
<div>The Fund is an exchange-traded fund (commonly referred to as an
“ETF”). Individual shares of the Fund may only be bought and sold in the secondary market through a broker-dealer. Because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than at NAV, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or
less than NAV (a discount). An investor may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase shares of the Fund (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for shares of the Fund
(ask) when buying or selling shares in the secondary market (the “bid-ask spread”).<br/> </div> </div> <div type="Block">
<div>Tax Information</div>
<div>The Fund intends to make distributions that may be taxable to
you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or an individual retirement account (“IRA”), in which case, your distributions generally will be taxed when
withdrawn. Certain states and localities may exempt from tax distributions attributable to interest from U.S. federal government obligations. Please consult your personal tax advisor.</div>

Information About the Fund</div> <div>This Prospectus contains
important information about investing in the Fund. Please read this Prospectus carefully before you make any investment decisions. Additional information regarding the Fund is available at www.iShares.com.</div>
<div>BFA is the investment adviser to the Fund. Shares of the Fund
are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”). The market price for a share of the Fund may be different from the Fund’s most recent NAV.</div>
<div>ETFs are funds that trade like other publicly-traded
securities. The Fund is designed to track an index. Similar to shares of an index mutual fund, each share of the Fund represents an ownership interest in an underlying portfolio of securities and other instruments intended to track a market index.
Unlike shares of a mutual fund, which can be bought and redeemed from the issuing fund by all shareholders at a price based on NAV, shares of the Fund may be purchased or redeemed directly from the Fund at NAV solely by Authorized Participants and
only in aggregations of a specified number of shares (“Creation Units”). Also unlike shares of a mutual fund, shares of the Fund are listed on a national securities exchange and trade in the secondary market at market prices that change
throughout the day.</div> <div>The Fund invests in a particular
segment of the securities markets and seeks to track the performance of a securities index that is not representative of the market as a whole. The Fund is designed to be used as part of broader asset allocation strategies. Accordingly, an
investment in the Fund should not constitute a complete investment program.</div>
<div>An index is a financial calculation, based on a grouping of
financial instruments, and is not an investment product, while the Fund is an actual investment portfolio. The performance of the Fund and the Underlying Index may vary for a number of reasons, including transaction costs, non-U.S. currency
valuations, asset valuations, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin-offs), timing variances and differences between the Fund’s portfolio and the Underlying Index resulting from the Fund's use of representative sampling or from legal
restrictions (such as diversification requirements) that apply to the Fund but not to the Underlying Index. From time to time, the Index Provider may make changes to the methodology or other adjustments to the Underlying Index. Unless otherwise
determined by BFA, any such change or adjustment will be reflected in the calculation of the Underlying Index performance on a going-forward basis after the effective date of such change or adjustment. Therefore, the Underlying Index performance
shown for periods prior to the effective date of any such change or adjustment will generally not be recalculated or restated to reflect such change or adjustment.</div>
<div>“Tracking error” is the divergence of the Fund's
performance from that of the Underlying Index. Because the Fund uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, it can be expected to have a larger tracking error than if it used a replication indexing strategy. “Replication” is an
indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all</div> </div> <div type="Block"> </div> <div type="Block">

underlying index in approximately the same proportions as in the underlying index.</div>
<div>The Fund may borrow as a temporary measure for extraordinary or
emergency purposes, including to meet redemptions or to facilitate the settlement of securities or other transactions. The Fund does not intend to borrow money in order to leverage its portfolio.</div>
<div>An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and it is not
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, BFA or any of its affiliates.</div>
<div>The Fund's investment objective and the Underlying Index may be
changed without shareholder approval.</div> <div>A Further
Discussion of Principal Risks</div> <div>The Fund is subject to
various risks, including the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund’s NAV, trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment objective. You could lose all or part of your investment in the
Fund, and the Fund could underperform other investments. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>U.S. Treasury Obligations Risk.
<font>U.S. Treasury obligations may differ from other securities in their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and other characteristics. Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial condition or credit
rating of the U.S. government may cause the value of the Fund's U.S. Treasury obligations to decline. On August 5, 2011, S&amp;P Global Ratings downgraded U.S. Treasury securities from AAA rating to AA+ rating. A further downgrade of the ratings of
U.S. government debt obligations, which are often used as a benchmark for other borrowing arrangements, could result in higher interest rates for individual and corporate borrowers, cause disruptions in the international bond markets and have a
substantial negative effect on the U.S. economy. A downgrade of U.S. Treasury securities from another ratings agency or a further downgrade below AA+ rating by S&amp;P Global Ratings may cause the value of the Fund’s U.S. Treasury obligations
to decline.</font></div> <div>Interest Rate Risk.<font> If interest rates rise, the value of fixed-income securities or other instruments held by the Fund would likely decrease. A measure investors commonly use to determine this price sensitivity is called duration.
Fixed-income securities with longer durations tend to be more sensitive to interest rate changes, usually making their prices more volatile than those of securities with shorter durations. To the extent the Fund invests a substantial portion of its
assets in fixed-income securities with longer duration, rising interest rates may cause the value of the Fund's investments to decline significantly, which would adversely affect the value of the Fund. An increase in interest rates may lead to
heightened volatility in the fixed-income markets and adversely affect certain fixed-income investments, including those held by the Fund. In addition, decreases in fixed income dealer market-making capacity may lead to lower trading volume,
heightened volatility, wider bid-ask spreads and less transparent pricing in certain fixed-income markets.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>The
historically low interest rate environment was created in part by the world’s major central banks keeping their overnight policy interest rates at, near or below zero percent and implementing monetary policy facilities, such as asset purchase
programs, to anchor longer-term interest rates below historical levels. During periods of very low or negative interest rates, the Fund may be unable to maintain positive returns or pay dividends to Fund shareholders. Certain countries have recently
experienced negative interest rates on certain fixed-income instruments. Very low or negative interest rates may magnify interest rate risk. Changing interest rates, including rates that fall below zero, may have unpredictable effects on markets,
result in heightened market volatility and detract from the Fund’s performance to the extent the Fund is exposed to such interest rates. Additionally, under certain market conditions in which interest rates are set at low levels and the market
prices of portfolio securities have increased, the Fund may have a very low, or even negative yield. A low or negative yield would cause the Fund to lose money in certain conditions and over certain time periods. Central banks may increase their
short-term policy rates or begin phasing out, or “tapering,” accommodative monetary policy facilities in the future. The timing, coordination, magnitude and effect of such policy changes on various markets are uncertain, and such changes
in monetary policy may adversely affect the value of the Fund’s investments.</div>
<div>Income Risk.<font> The Fund’s
income may decline if interest rates fall. This decline in income can occur because the Fund may subsequently invest in lower-yielding bonds as bonds in its portfolio mature, are near maturity or are called, bonds in the Underlying Index are
substituted, or the Fund otherwise needs to purchase additional bonds. The Index Provider’s substitution of bonds in the Underlying Index may occur, for example, when the time to maturity for the bond no longer matches the Underlying
Index’s stated maturity guidelines.</font></div> <div>Risk of
Investing in the U.S.<font> A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations and/or an economic recession in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. economy and the securities listed on U.S.
exchanges. Proposed and adopted policy and legislative changes in the U.S. are changing many aspects of financial, commercial, public health, environmental, and other regulation and may have a significant effect on U.S. markets generally, as well as
on the value of certain securities. Governmental agencies project that the U.S. will continue to maintain elevated public debt levels for the foreseeable future. Although elevated debt levels do not necessarily indicate or cause economic problems,
elevated public debt service costs may constrain future economic growth.</font></div>
<div>The U.S. has developed increasingly strained relations with a
number of foreign countries. If relations with certain countries deteriorate, it could adversely affect U.S. issuers as well as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also experienced increased internal unrest and discord, as
well as significant challenges in managing and containing the outbreak of COVID-19. If these trends were to continue, it may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the issuers in which the Fund invests.</div>
<div>Asset Class Risk.<font> The
securities in the Underlying Index or in the Fund’s portfolio may underperform in comparison to other securities or indexes that track other countries,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

regions, industries, groups of industries, markets, market segments, asset classes or sectors. Various types of securities and indexes may experience cycles of outperformance and underperformance in comparison to the general financial markets.
This may cause the Fund to underperform other investment vehicles that invest in different asset classes.</div>
<div>Assets Under Management (AUM) Risk.<font> From time to time, an Authorized Participant, a third-party investor, the Fund’s adviser or an affiliate of the Fund’s adviser, or a fund may invest in the Fund and hold its investment for a specific period
of time to allow the Fund to achieve size or scale. There</font> <font>can be no assurance that any such entity would not redeem its investment or that the size of the Fund would be maintained at such levels, which could
negatively impact the Fund.</font></div> <div>Authorized Participant
Concentration Risk. <font>Only an Authorized Participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund, and none of those Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or
redemption transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, on behalf of
other market participants). To the extent that Authorized Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or
redeem Creation Units, Fund shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts or delisting.</font></div>
<div>Concentration Risk.<font> The Fund
may be susceptible to an increased risk of loss, including losses due to adverse events that affect the Fund’s investments more than the market as a whole, to the extent that the Fund's investments are concentrated in the securities and/or
other assets of a particular issuer or issuers, country, group of countries, region, market, industry, group of industries, sector, market segment or asset class. The Fund may be more adversely affected by the underperformance of those securities
and/or other assets, may experience increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting those securities and/or other assets than a fund that does not concentrate its
investments.</font></div> <div>Cybersecurity Risk.<font> With the increased use of technologies such as the internet to conduct business, the Fund, Authorized Participants, service providers and the relevant listing exchange are susceptible to operational, information
security and related “cyber” risks both directly and through their service providers. Similar types of cybersecurity risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the Fund invests, which could result in material adverse
consequences for such issuers and may cause the Fund’s investment in such issuers to lose value. Unlike many other types of risks faced by the Fund, these risks typically are not covered by insurance. In general, cyber incidents can result
from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber incidents include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems
(</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, through “hacking” or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data,
or causing operational disruption. Cyberattacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites

services unavailable to intended users). Recently, geopolitical tensions may have increased the scale and sophistication of deliberate attacks, particularly those from nation-states or from entities with nation-state backing.</div>
<div>Cybersecurity failures by, or breaches of, the systems of the
Fund’s adviser, distributor and other service providers (including, but not limited to, index and benchmark providers, fund accountants, custodians, transfer agents and administrators), market makers, Authorized Participants or the issuers of
securities in which the Fund invests, have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in: financial losses, interference with the Fund’s ability to calculate its NAV, disclosure of confidential
trading information, impediments to trading, submission of erroneous trades or erroneous creation or redemption orders, the inability of the Fund or its service providers to transact business, violations of applicable privacy and other laws,
regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, or additional compliance costs. In addition, cyberattacks may render records of Fund assets and transactions, shareholder ownership of Fund shares, and
other data integral to the functioning of the Fund inaccessible or inaccurate or incomplete. Substantial costs may be incurred by the Fund in order to resolve or prevent cyber incidents in the future. While the Fund has established business
continuity plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent, such cyber incidents, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems, including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified and that prevention and
remediation efforts will not be successful or that cyberattacks will go undetected. Furthermore, the Fund cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by service providers to the Fund, issuers in which the Fund invests, the Index
Provider, market makers or Authorized Participants. The Fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result.</div>
<div>High Portfolio Turnover Risk.
<font>High portfolio turnover (considered by the Fund to mean higher than 100% annually) may result in increased transaction costs to the Fund, including brokerage commissions, dealer mark-ups and other transaction costs
on the sale of the securities and on reinvestment in other securities. These effects of higher than normal portfolio turnover may adversely affect Fund performance.</font></div>
<div>Index-Related Risk.<font> The Fund
seeks to achieve a return that corresponds generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Underlying Index as published by the Index Provider. There is no assurance that the Index Provider or any agents that may act
on its behalf will compile the Underlying Index accurately, or that the Underlying Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While the Index Provider provides descriptions of what the Underlying Index is designed to achieve,
neither the Index Provider nor its agents provide any warranty or accept any liability in relation to the quality, accuracy or completeness of the Underlying Index or its related data, and they do not guarantee that the Underlying Index will be in
line with the Index Provider’s methodology. BFA’s mandate as described in this Prospectus is to manage the Fund consistently with the Underlying Index provided by the Index Provider to BFA. BFA does not provide any warranty or guarantee
against the Index Provider’s or any agent’s errors. Errors in respect of the quality, accuracy and completeness of the data used to compile the Underlying Index may occur from time to time and may not be identified and corrected by the
Index Provider for a period of time or at all,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

indices are less commonly used as benchmarks by funds or managers. Such errors may negatively or positively impact the Fund and its shareholders. For example, during a period where the Underlying Index contains incorrect constituents, the Fund would
have market exposure to such constituents and would be underexposed to the Underlying Index’s other constituents. Shareholders should understand that any gains from Index Provider errors will be kept by the Fund and its shareholders and any
losses or costs resulting from Index Provider errors will be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.</div>
<div>Unusual market conditions may cause the Index Provider to
postpone a scheduled rebalance to the Underlying Index, which could cause the Underlying Index to vary from its normal or expected composition. The postponement of a scheduled rebalance in a time of market volatility could mean that constituents of
the Underlying Index that would otherwise be removed at rebalance due to changes in market value, issuer credit ratings, or other reasons may remain, causing the performance and constituents of the Underlying Index to vary from those expected under
normal conditions. Apart from scheduled rebalances, the Index Provider or its agents may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Underlying Index due to reaching certain weighting constraints, unusual market conditions or corporate events or,
for example, to correct an error in the selection of index constituents. When the Underlying Index is rebalanced and the Fund in turn rebalances its portfolio to attempt to increase the correlation between the Fund’s portfolio and the
Underlying Index, any transaction costs and market exposure arising from such portfolio rebalancing will be borne directly by the Fund and its shareholders. Therefore, errors and additional ad hoc rebalances carried out by the Index Provider or its
agents to the Underlying Index may increase the costs to and the tracking error risk of the Fund.</div>
<div>Infectious Illness Risk. <font>An
outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus that was first detected in December 2019 has spread globally. The impact of this outbreak has adversely affected the economies of many nations and the global
economy, and may impact individual issuers and capital markets in ways that cannot be foreseen. The duration of the outbreak and its effects cannot be predicted with certainty. Any market or economic disruption can be expected to result in elevated
tracking error and increased premiums or discounts to the Fund's NAV.</font></div> <div>

<div>Other infectious illness outbreaks that may arise in the future

unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk. <font>Because BFA
uses a representative sampling indexing strategy, the Fund will not fully replicate the Underlying Index and may hold securities not included in the Underlying Index. As a result, the Fund is subject to the risk that BFA’s investment strategy,

<div>Market Risk.<font> The Fund could
lose money over short periods due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during more prolonged market downturns. Market risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future values of financial instruments and may be influenced by

issues, recessions, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments and could result in increased premiums or discounts to the Fund’s NAV. During a general market downturn, multiple asset classes may be
negatively affected. Fixed-income securities with short-term maturities are generally less sensitive to such changes than are fixed-income securities with longer-term maturities. Changes in market conditions and interest rates generally do not have
the same impact on all types of securities and instruments.</div>
<div>Market Trading Risk.</div>
<div>Absence of Active Market.<font>
Although shares of the Fund are listed for trading on one or more stock exchanges, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained by market makers or Authorized Participants.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Secondary Listings.
<font>The Fund's shares may be listed or traded on U.S. and non-U.S. stock exchanges other than the U.S. stock exchange where the Fund's primary listing is maintained, and may otherwise be made available to non-U.S.
investors through funds or structured investment vehicles similar to depositary receipts. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s shares will continue to trade on any such stock exchange or in any market or that the Fund’s shares will
continue to meet the requirements for listing or trading on any exchange or in any market. The Fund's shares may be less actively traded in certain markets than in others, and investors are subject to the execution and settlement risks and market
standards of the market where they or their broker direct their trades for execution. Certain information available to investors who trade Fund shares on a U.S. stock exchange during regular U.S. market hours may not be available to investors who
trade in other markets, which may result in secondary market prices in such markets being less efficient.</font></div>
<div>Secondary Market Trading Risk.<font>
Shares of the Fund may trade in the secondary market at times when the Fund does not accept orders to purchase or redeem shares. At such times, shares may trade in the secondary market with more significant premiums or discounts than might be
experienced at times when the Fund accepts purchase and redemption orders.</font></div>
<div>Secondary market trading in Fund shares may be halted by a
stock exchange because of market conditions or for other reasons. In addition, trading in Fund shares on a stock exchange or in any market may be subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to “circuit
breaker” rules on the stock exchange or market.</div>
<div>Shares of the Fund, similar to shares of other issuers listed
on a stock exchange, may be sold short and are therefore subject to the risk of increased volatility and price decreases associated with being sold short. In addition, trading activity in derivative</div> </div>

<div>Shares of the Fund May Trade at Prices Other Than NAV.<font> Shares of the Fund trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the Fund’s most recent NAV. The NAV of the Fund is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in the market value
of the Fund’s holdings. The trading price of the Fund's shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours based on both market supply of and demand for Fund shares and the underlying value of the Fund's portfolio holdings or NAV. As
a result, the trading prices of the Fund’s shares may deviate significantly from NAV during periods of market volatility, including during periods of significant redemption requests or other unusual market conditions. </font><font>ANY OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY LEAD TO THE FUND'S SHARES TRADING AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO NAV</font><font>. However, because shares can be created and redeemed in
Creation Units at NAV, BFA believes that large discounts or premiums to the NAV of the Fund are not likely to be sustained over the long term (unlike shares of many closed-end funds, which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from, and
sometimes at premiums to, their NAVs). While the creation/redemption feature is designed to make it more likely that the Fund’s shares normally will trade on stock exchanges at prices close to the Fund’s next calculated NAV, exchange
prices are not expected to correlate exactly with the Fund's NAV due to timing reasons, supply and demand imbalances and other factors. In addition, disruptions to creations and redemptions, including disruptions at market makers, Authorized
Participants, or other market participants, and during periods of significant market volatility, may result in trading prices for shares of the Fund that differ significantly from its NAV. Authorized Participants may be less willing to create or
redeem Fund shares if there is a lack of an active market for such shares or its underlying investments, which may contribute to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV.</font></div>
<div>Costs of Buying or Selling Fund Shares.<font> Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you will likely incur a brokerage commission
and other charges. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread”; that is, the difference between what investors are willing to pay for Fund shares (the “bid” price) and the price at which they are willing to sell Fund
shares (the “ask” price). The spread, which varies over time for shares of the Fund based on trading volume and market liquidity, is generally narrower if the Fund has more trading volume and market liquidity and wider if the Fund
has less trading volume and market liquidity. In addition, increased market volatility may cause wider spreads. There may also be regulatory and other charges that are incurred as a result of trading activity. Because of the costs inherent in buying
or selling Fund shares, frequent trading may detract significantly from investment results and an investment in Fund shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments through a brokerage
account.</font></div> <div>Operational Risk.<font> The Fund is exposed to operational risks arising from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, human error, processing and communication errors, errors of the Fund's service providers, counterparties or other
third-parties,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>failed or inadequate
processes and technology or systems failures. The Fund and BFA seek to reduce these operational risks through controls and procedures. However, these measures do not address every possible risk and may be inadequate to address significant
operational risks.</div> <div>Passive Investment Risk.<font> The Fund is not actively managed and may be affected by a general decline in market segments related to the Underlying Index. The Fund invests in securities included in, or representative of, the Underlying Index,
regardless of their investment merits. BFA generally does not attempt to invest the Fund's assets in defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets.</font></div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk.<font> The
Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that the Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at all. The Fund could also lose money in the
event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences for the Fund. BlackRock Institutional Trust
Company, N.A. (“BTC”), the Fund's securities lending agent, will take into account the tax impact to shareholders of substitute payments for dividends when managing the Fund's securities lending program.</font></div>
<div>Tracking Error Risk.<font> The Fund
may be subject to tracking error, which is the divergence of the Fund’s performance from that of the Underlying Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities held in the Fund’s portfolio and those included
in the Underlying Index, pricing differences, transaction costs incurred by the Fund, the Fund’s holding of uninvested cash, differences in timing of the accrual of or the valuation of distributions, the requirements to maintain pass-through
tax treatment, portfolio transactions carried out to minimize the distribution of capital gains to shareholders, acceptance of custom baskets, changes to the Underlying Index or the costs to the Fund of complying with various new or existing
regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the Underlying Index does
not.</font></div> <div>A Further Discussion of Other Risks</div>
<div>The Fund may also be subject to certain other risks associated
with its investments and investment strategies. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Borrowing Risk.<font> Borrowing may
exaggerate changes in the NAV of Fund shares and in the return on the Fund’s portfolio. Borrowing will cost the Fund interest expense and other fees. The costs of borrowing may reduce the Fund’s return. Borrowing may also cause the Fund
to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations.</font></div>
<div>Cash Management Risk.<font> To the
extent the Fund holds cash, the Fund will earn reduced income (if any) on the cash and will be subject to the credit risk of the depository institution holding the cash and any fees imposed on large cash balances. If a significant amount of the
Fund’s assets are invested in cash and cash equivalents,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>the Fund may underperform
other funds that do not similarly invest in cash and cash equivalents for investment purposes and/or to collateralize derivative instruments.</div>
<div>Close-Out Risk for Qualified Financial Contracts.<font> Regulations adopted by global prudential regulators require counterparties that are part of U.S. or foreign global systemically important banking organizations to include contractual restrictions on close-out and
cross-default in agreements relating to qualified financial contracts. Qualified financial contracts include agreements relating to swaps, currency forwards and other derivatives as well as repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements.
The restrictions prevent the Fund from closing out a qualified financial contract during a specified time period if the counterparty is subject to resolution proceedings and also prohibit the Fund from exercising default rights due to a receivership
or similar proceeding of an affiliate of the counterparty. These requirements may increase credit risk and other risks to the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Illiquid Investments Risk. <font>The
Fund may invest up to an aggregate amount of 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that the Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days
or less without significantly changing the market value of the investment. To the extent the Fund holds illiquid investments, the illiquid investments may reduce the returns of the Fund because the Fund may be unable to transact at advantageous
times or prices. An investment may be illiquid due to, among other things, the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a market in securities or instruments or the lack of an active market for such securities or
instruments. To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or instruments with substantial market and/or credit risk, the Fund will tend to have increased exposure to the risks associated with illiquid investments. Liquid investments may become
illiquid after purchase by the Fund, particularly during periods of market turmoil. There can be no assurance that a security or instrument that is deemed to be liquid when purchased will continue to be liquid for as long as it is held by the Fund,
and any security or instrument held by the Fund may be deemed an illiquid investment pursuant to the Fund’s liquidity risk management program. Illiquid investments may be harder to value, especially in changing markets. Although the Fund
primarily seeks to redeem shares of the Fund on an in-kind basis, if the Fund is forced to sell underlying investments at reduced prices or under unfavorable conditions to meet redemption requests or for other cash needs, the Fund may suffer a loss.
This may be magnified in a rising interest rate environment or other circumstances where redemptions from the Fund may be greater than normal. Other market participants may be attempting to liquidate holdings at the same time as the Fund, causing
increased supply of the Fund’s underlying investments in the market and contributing to illiquid investments risk and downward pricing pressure. During periods of market volatility, liquidity in the market for the Fund’s shares may be
impacted by the liquidity in the market for the underlying securities or instruments held by the Fund, which could lead to the Fund’s shares trading at a premium or discount to the Fund’s NAV.</font></div>
<div>Money Market Instruments Risk.<font>
The value of money market instruments may be affected by changing interest rates and by changes in the credit ratings of the investments. If a significant amount of the Fund's assets are invested in money market</font></div> </div>

more difficult for the Fund to achieve its investment objective. An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency. It is possible to lose money by investing in a money market fund. Money
market funds other than government money market funds or retail money market funds “float” their NAV instead of using a stable $1.00 per share price.</div>
<div>Threshold/Underinvestment Risk.<font>
If certain aggregate and/or fund-level ownership thresholds are reached through transactions undertaken by BFA, its affiliates or the Fund, or as a result of third-party transactions or actions by an issuer or regulator, the ability of BFA and its
affiliates on behalf of clients (including the Fund) to purchase or dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. The capacity of the Fund to make investments in
certain securities may be affected by the relevant threshold limits, and such limitations may have adverse effects on the liquidity and performance of the Fund’s portfolio holdings compared to the performance of the Underlying Index. This
may increase the risk of the Fund being underinvested to the Underlying Index and increase the risk of tracking error.</font></div>
<div>For example, in certain circumstances where the Fund invests in
securities issued by companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in certain emerging or international markets, is subject to corporate or regulatory ownership restrictions, or invests in certain futures or other derivative
transactions, there may be limits on the aggregate and/or fund-level amount invested or voted by BFA and its affiliates for their proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Fund) that may not be exceeded without the grant of a
license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if exceeded, may cause BFA and its affiliates, the Fund or other client accounts to suffer disadvantages or business restrictions.</div>
<div>Portfolio Holdings Information</div>
<div>A description of the Trust's policies and procedures with
respect to the disclosure of the Fund’s portfolio securities is available in the Fund's Statement of Additional Information (“SAI”). The Fund discloses its portfolio holdings daily at
<font>www.iShares.com.</font> Fund fact sheets provide information regarding the Fund's top holdings and may be requested by calling 1-800-iShares (1-800-474-2737).</div>
<div>Management</div>
<div>Investment Adviser.<font> As
investment adviser, BFA has overall responsibility for the general management and administration of the Fund. BFA provides an investment program for the Fund and manages the investment of the Fund’s assets. In managing the Fund, BFA may draw
upon the research and expertise of its asset management affiliates with respect to certain portfolio securities. In seeking to achieve the Fund's investment objective, BFA uses teams of portfolio managers, investment strategists and other investment
specialists. This team approach brings together many disciplines and leverages BFA’s extensive resources.</font></div>

<div>For its investment advisory services to the Fund, BFA is paid a
management fee from the Fund based on a percentage of the Fund’s average daily net assets, at the annual rate of 0.12%. Effective September 30, 2020, BFA has contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fee so that the
Fund’s total annual fund operating expenses after the fee waiver will not exceed 0.03% through June 30, 2022. The contractual waiver may be terminated prior to June 30, 2022 only upon written agreement of the Trust and BFA. Prior to September
30, 2020, BFA had contractually agreed to waive a portion of its management fee so that the Fund's total annual fund operating expenses after the fee waiver would not exceed 0.07%. The contractual waiver was discontinued as of September 30, 2020, by
written agreement of the Trust and BFA. In addition, BFA may from time to time voluntarily waive and/or reimburse fees or expenses in order to limit total annual fund operating expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, if any). Any such
voluntary waiver or reimbursement may be eliminated by BFA at any time.</div>
<div>BFA is located at 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.
It is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”). As of March 31, 2021, BFA and its affiliates provided investment advisory services for assets in excess of $9.01 trillion. BFA and its affiliates trade and
invest for their own accounts in the actual securities and types of securities in which the Fund may also invest, which may affect the price of such securities.</div>
<div>A discussion regarding the basis for the approval by the
Trust's Board of Trustees (the “Board”) of the Investment Advisory Agreement with BFA is available in the Fund's Semi-Annual Report for the period ended August 31.</div>
<div>Portfolio Managers.<font> James Mauro
and Karen Uyehara are primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund. Each Portfolio Manager is responsible for various functions related to portfolio management, including, but not limited to, investing cash inflows, coordinating
with members of his portfolio management team to focus on certain asset classes, implementing investment strategy, researching and reviewing investment strategy and overseeing members of his portfolio management team that have more limited
responsibilities.</font></div> <div>James Mauro has been employed by
BFA or its affiliates as a portfolio manager since 2011. Prior to that, Mr. Mauro was a Vice President at State Street Global Advisors. Mr. Mauro has been a Portfolio Manager of the Fund since 2020.</div>
<div>Karen Uyehara has been employed by BFA or its affiliates as a
senior portfolio manager since 2010. Prior to that, Ms. Uyehara was a portfolio manager at Western Asset Management Company (WAMCO). Ms. Uyehara has been a Portfolio Manager of the Fund since 2021.</div>

<div>Conflicts of Interest. <font>The
investment activities of BFA and its affiliates (including BlackRock and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Affiliates”)), and their respective directors, officers or employees, in the management of, or their interest in, their own
accounts and other accounts they manage, may present conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Fund and its shareholders. BFA and its Affiliates provide investment management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that
may follow investment programs similar to that of the Fund. BFA and its Affiliates are involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in
which their interests or the interests of their clients may conflict with those of the Fund. BFA or one or more Affiliates act, or may act, as an investor, research provider, investment manager, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor,
financier, underwriter, adviser, trader, lender, index provider, agent and/or principal, and have other direct and indirect interests in securities, currencies, commodities, derivatives and other instruments in which the Fund may directly or
indirectly invest. The Fund may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies with which an Affiliate has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. The Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured
notes) by entities for which an Affiliate provides and is compensated for cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of such issuances. The Fund also may invest in securities of, or engage in other transactions with, companies
for which an Affiliate provides or may in the future provide research coverage. An Affiliate may have business relationships with, and purchase or distribute or sell services or products from or to, distributors, consultants or others who recommend
the Fund or who engage in transactions with or for the Fund, and may receive compensation for such services. BFA or one or more Affiliates may engage in proprietary trading and advise accounts and funds that have investment objectives similar to
those of the Fund and/or that engage in and compete for transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the Fund. This may include transactions in securities issued by other open-end and closed-end investment
companies (which may include investment companies that are affiliated with the Fund and BFA, to the extent permitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”)). The trading activities of BFA and these
Affiliates are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly by the Fund and may result in BFA or an Affiliate having positions in certain securities that are senior or junior to, or have interests different from or adverse
to, the securities that are owned by the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Neither BlackRock nor any Affiliate is under any obligation to
share any investment opportunity, idea or strategy with the Fund. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with the Fund for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Fund's investment activities, therefore, may differ from those of an

transactions in which BFA or an Affiliate or its or their directors, officers, employees or clients have an adverse interest. Furthermore, transactions undertaken by clients advised or managed by BFA or its Affiliates may adversely impact the
Fund. Transactions by one or more clients or by BFA or its Affiliates or their directors, officers or employees may have the effect of diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the Fund.</div>
<div>The Fund's activities may be limited because of regulatory
restrictions applicable to BFA or one or more Affiliates and/or their internal policies designed to comply with such restrictions.</div>
<div>Under a securities lending program approved by the Board, the
Fund has retained BTC, an Affiliate of BFA, to serve as the securities lending agent for the Fund to the extent that the Fund participates in the securities lending program. For these services, the securities lending agent will receive a fee from
the Fund, including a fee based on the returns earned on the Fund’s investment of the cash received as collateral for the loaned securities. In addition, one or more Affiliates may be among the entities to which the Fund may lend its portfolio
securities under the securities lending program.</div> <div>It is
also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock and/or its advisory clients (including other funds and separately managed accounts) may, subject to compliance with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of the Fund. The price, availability,
liquidity, and (in some cases) expense ratio of the Fund may be impacted by purchases and sales of the Fund by BlackRock and/or its advisory clients.</div>
<div>The activities of BFA and its Affiliates and their respective

purchased on an exchange or otherwise in the secondary market. The Fund's shares trade under the ticker symbol “SGOV.”</div>
<div>Buying or selling Fund shares on an exchange or other secondary
market involves two types of costs that may apply to all securities transactions. When buying or selling shares of the Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission and other charges. The commission is frequently a fixed amount and may
be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell small amounts of shares. In addition, you may incur the cost of the “spread,” that is, any difference between the bid price and the ask price. The spread varies over
time for shares of the Fund based on the Fund’s trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if the Fund has high trading volume and market liquidity, and higher if the Fund has little trading volume and market liquidity (which
is often the case for funds that are newly launched or small in size). The Fund's spread may also be impacted by the liquidity or illiquidity of the underlying securities held by the Fund, particularly for newly launched or smaller funds or in
instances of significant volatility of the underlying securities.</div>
<div>The Board has adopted a policy of not monitoring for frequent
purchases and redemptions of Fund shares (“frequent trading”) that appear to attempt to take advantage of a potential arbitrage opportunity presented by a lag between a change in the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities after
the close of the primary markets for the Fund’s portfolio securities and the reflection of that change in the Fund’s NAV (“market timing”), because the Fund sells and redeems its shares directly through transactions that are
in-kind and/or for cash, subject to the conditions described below under <font>Creations and Redemptions</font>. The Board has not adopted a policy of monitoring for other frequent trading activity because shares of the
Fund are listed for trading on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>The national securities exchange on which the Fund's shares are
listed is open for trading Monday through Friday and is closed on weekends and the following holidays (or the days on which they are observed): New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day,
Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The Fund’s listing exchange is NYSE Arca.</div>
<div>Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act generally restricts
investments by investment companies, including foreign and unregistered investment companies, in the securities of other investment companies. For example, a registered investment company (the “Acquired Fund”), such as the Fund, may not
knowingly sell or otherwise dispose of any security issued by the Acquired Fund to any investment company (the “Acquiring Fund”) or any company or companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund if, immediately after such sale or disposition:
(i) more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of the Acquired Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and any company or companies controlled by the Acquiring Fund, or (ii) more than 10% of the total outstanding voting stock of the Acquired
Fund is owned by the Acquiring Fund and other investment companies and companies controlled by them. However, registered investment companies are permitted to invest in the Fund beyond the limits set forth in Section 12(d)(1), subject to certain
terms and conditions set forth in SEC rules or in an SEC exemptive order issued to the Trust (when available). In order for a registered investment company to invest in shares of the Fund beyond the limitations of Section</div> </div>

<div>Book Entry.<font> Shares of the Fund
are held in book-entry form, which means that no stock certificates are issued. The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee is the record owner of, and holds legal title to, all outstanding shares of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Investors owning shares of the Fund are beneficial owners as
shown on the records of DTC or its participants. DTC serves as the securities depository for shares of the Fund. DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and other institutions that
directly or indirectly maintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of shares, you are not entitled to receive physical delivery of stock certificates or to have shares registered in your name, and you are not considered a
registered owner of shares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an owner of shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its participants. These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other securities that you hold in book-entry
or “street name” form.</div> <div>Share Prices.<font> The trading prices of the Fund’s shares in the secondary market generally differ from the Fund’s daily NAV and are affected by market forces such as the supply of and demand for ETF shares and underlying
securities held by the Fund, economic conditions and other factors.</font></div>
<div>Determination of Net Asset Value. <font>The NAV of the Fund normally is determined twice daily Monday through Friday, generally as of 12:00 p.m., Eastern time and as of the close of regular trading hours of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”)
(normally 4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on each day that the NYSE is open for trading, based on prices at the time of closing, provided that any Fund assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S.
dollars at the prevailing market rates on the date of valuation as quoted by one or more data service providers. The NAV of the Fund is calculated by dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, the value of its total assets less total liabilities) by the total number of outstanding shares of the Fund, generally rounded to the nearest
cent.</font></div> <div>The value of the securities and other assets
and liabilities held by the Fund are determined pursuant to valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board.</div>
<div>The Fund values fixed-income portfolio securities using last
available bid prices or current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated prices) supplied by the Fund's approved independent third-party pricing services, each in accordance with valuation policies and procedures approved
by the Board. Pricing services may use matrix pricing or valuation models that utilize certain inputs and assumptions to derive values. Pricing services generally value fixed-income securities assuming orderly transactions of an institutional round
lot size, but the Fund may hold or transact in such securities in smaller odd lot sizes. Odd lots often trade at lower prices than institutional round lots. An amortized cost method of valuation may be</div> </div>

instruments is substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of business on the NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the NAV of the Fund are determined as of such times.</div>
<div>When market quotations are not readily available or are
believed by BlackRock to be unreliable, the Fund’s investments are valued at fair value. Fair value determinations are made by BlackRock in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board. BlackRock may conclude that a market
quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source due to its lack of trading or other reasons, if a market quotation differs significantly from recent price quotations or
otherwise no longer appears to reflect fair value, where the security or other asset or liability is thinly traded, when there is a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation, or if the trading market on which a security is
listed is suspended or closed and no appropriate alternative trading market is available. A “significant event” is deemed to occur if BlackRock determines, in its reasonable business judgment prior to or at the time of pricing the
Fund’s assets or liabilities, that the event is likely to cause a material change to the closing market price of one or more assets held by, or liabilities of, the Fund.</div>
<div>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value
of an asset or liability. The fair value of an asset or liability held by the Fund is the amount the Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or the cost to extinguish that liability in an arm’s-length
transaction. Valuing the Fund’s investments using fair value pricing will result in prices that may differ from current market valuations and that may not be the prices at which those investments could have been sold during the period in which
the particular fair values were used. Use of fair value prices and certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate the Fund’s NAV and the prices used by the Underlying Index, which, in turn,
could result in a difference between the Fund’s performance and the performance of the Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Dividends and Distributions</div>
<div>General Policies.<font> Dividends
from net investment income, if any, generally are declared and paid at least once a year by the Fund. Distributions of net realized securities gains, if any, generally are declared and paid once a year, but the Trust may make distributions on a more
frequent basis for the Fund. The Trust reserves the right to declare special distributions if, in its reasonable discretion, such action is necessary or advisable to preserve its status as a regulated investment company or to avoid imposition of
income or excise taxes on undistributed income or realized gains.</font></div>
<div>Dividends and other distributions on shares of the Fund are
distributed on a <font>pro rata</font> basis to beneficial owners of such shares. Dividend payments are made through DTC participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners then of record with proceeds received
from the Fund.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

Reinvestment Service.<font> No dividend reinvestment service is provided by the Trust. Broker-dealers may make available the DTC book-entry Dividend Reinvestment Service for use by beneficial owners of the Fund for
reinvestment of their dividend distributions. Beneficial owners should contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation therein. Brokers may require beneficial owners to adhere to specific
procedures and timetables. If this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the Fund purchased in the secondary market.</font></div>
<div>Taxes.<font> As with any investment,
you should consider how your investment in shares of the Fund will be taxed. The tax information in this Prospectus is provided as general information, based on current law. There is no guarantee that shares of the Fund will receive certain
regulatory or accounting treatment. You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Unless your investment in Fund shares is made through a
tax-exempt entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an IRA, in which case your distributions generally will be taxable when withdrawn, you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when the Fund makes distributions or you sell Fund
shares.</div> <div>Taxes on Distributions.<font> Distributions from the Fund’s net investment income, including distributions of income from securities lending and distributions out of the Fund's net short-term capital gains, if any, are taxable to you as
ordinary income. The Fund's distributions of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses are taxable as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the shares. Long-term capital gains are
eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts. Distributions from the Fund are subject to a 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax on
“net investment income,” for individuals with incomes exceeding $200,000 ($250,000 if married and filing jointly) and of estates and trusts. In general, your distributions are subject to U.S. federal income tax for the year when they are
paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid on December 31 of the prior year. Certain states and localities may exempt from tax distributions attributable to interest from U.S. federal government obligations. Consult
your personal tax advisor.</font></div> <div>If the Fund's
distributions exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits, all or a portion of the distributions made in the taxable year may be recharacterized as a return of capital to shareholders. Distributions in excess of the Fund’s minimum
distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital. A return of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will
reduce the shareholder's cost basis and will result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a shareholder's cost basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be
treated as capital gain, if the shareholder holds shares of the Fund as capital assets.</div>

you are a non-U.S. entity (other than a pass-through entity to the extent owned by U.S. persons), the Fund’s</div> </div> <div type="Block">

(which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) will generally be subject to a 30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate applies provided that withholding tax will generally not apply to any gain or income realized
by a non-U.S. shareholder in respect of any distributions of long-term capital gains or upon the sale or other disposition of shares of the Fund.</div>
<div>Separately, a 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on
U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items paid to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) information
regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will need
to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders; comply with due diligence procedures
with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts; report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained, agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account holders
who fail to provide the required information; and determine certain other information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local
revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities may need to report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership,
unless certain exceptions apply.</div> <div>If you are a resident or
a citizen of the U.S., by law, backup withholding at a 24% rate will apply to your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number and made other required certifications.</div>
<div>Taxes When Shares are Sold.<font>
Currently, any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares is generally treated as a long-term gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year. Any capital gain or loss realized upon a sale of Fund shares held for one
year or less is generally treated as short-term gain or loss, except that any capital loss on the sale of shares held for six months or less is treated as long-term capital loss to the extent that capital gain dividends were paid with respect to
such shares. Any such capital gains, including from sales of Fund shares or from capital gain dividends, are included in “net investment income” for purposes of the 3.8% U.S. federal Medicare contribution tax mentioned
above.</font></div> <div>The foregoing discussion summarizes some of
the consequences under current U.S. federal tax law of an investment in the Fund. It is not a substitute for personal tax advice. You may also be subject to state and local taxation on Fund distributions and sales of shares. Certain states and
localities may exempt from tax distributions attributable to interest from U.S. federal government obligations. Consult your personal tax advisor about the potential tax consequences of an investment in shares of the Fund under all applicable tax
laws.</div> <div>Creations and Redemptions.<font> Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the Fund are “created” at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in</font></div> </div>

or multiples thereof. Each “creator” or authorized participant (an “Authorized Participant”) has entered into an agreement with the Fund's distributor, BlackRock Investments, LLC (the “Distributor”), an affiliate
of BFA. An Authorized Participant is a member or participant of a clearing agency registered with the SEC, which has a written agreement with the Fund or one of its service providers that allows such member or participant to place orders for the
purchase and redemption of Creation Units.</div> <div>A creation
transaction, which is subject to acceptance by the Distributor and the Fund, generally takes place when an Authorized Participant deposits into the Fund a designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a “creation
basket”), and an amount of cash (including any cash representing the value of substituted securities, assets or other positions), if any, which together approximate the holdings of the Fund in exchange for a specified number of Creation Units.
Similarly, shares can be redeemed only in Creation Units, generally for a designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (a “redemption basket”) held by the Fund and an amount of cash (including any portion of such
securities for which cash may be substituted). The Fund may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units partially or solely for cash. Except when aggregated in Creation Units, shares are not redeemable by the Fund. Creation and redemption
baskets may differ and the Fund will accept “custom baskets.” More information regarding custom baskets is contained in the Fund's SAI.</div>
<div>The prices at which creations and redemptions occur are based
on the next calculation of NAV after a creation or redemption order is received in an acceptable form under the authorized participant agreement.</div>
<div>Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation
Units with the Fund. Authorized Participants may create or redeem Creation Units for their own accounts or for customers, including, without limitation, affiliates of the Fund.</div>
<div>In the event of a system failure or other interruption,
including disruptions at market makers or Authorized Participants, orders to purchase or redeem Creation Units either may not be executed according to the Fund's instructions or may not be executed at all, or the Fund may not be able to place or
change orders.</div> <div>To the extent the Fund engages in in-kind
transactions, the Fund intends to comply with the U.S. federal securities laws in accepting securities for deposit and satisfying redemptions with redemption securities by, among other means, assuring that any securities accepted for deposit and any
securities used to satisfy redemption requests will be sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”). Further, an Authorized Participant that is not a
“qualified institutional buyer,” as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, will not be able to receive restricted securities eligible for resale under Rule 144A.</div>
<div>Creations and redemptions must be made through a firm that is
either a member of the Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation or a DTC participant that has executed an agreement with the Distributor with respect to creations and redemptions of Creation Unit aggregations.

<div>Because new shares may be created and issued on an ongoing
basis, at any point during the life of the Fund a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may be occurring. Broker-dealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the
circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the 1933 Act. Any determination of whether one is an
underwriter must take into account all the relevant facts and circumstances of each particular case.</div>
<div>Broker-dealers should also note that dealers who are not
“underwriters” but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary transactions), and thus dealing with shares that are part of an “unsold allotment” within the meaning of Section 4(a)(3)(C) of the
1933 Act, would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by Section 4(a)(3) of the 1933 Act. For delivery of prospectuses to exchange members, the prospectus delivery mechanism of Rule 153 under the 1933 Act is
available only with respect to transactions on a national securities exchange.</div>
<div>Householding.<font> Householding is
an option available to certain Fund investors. Householding is a method of delivery, based on the preference of the individual investor, in which a single copy of certain shareholder documents can be delivered to investors who share the same
address, even if their accounts are registered under different names. Please contact your broker-dealer if you are interested in enrolling in householding and receiving a single copy of prospectuses and other shareholder documents, or if you are
currently enrolled in householding and wish to change your householding status.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Distribution</div>
<div>The Distributor or its agent distributes Creation Units for the
Fund on an agency basis. The Distributor does not maintain a secondary market in shares of the Fund. The Distributor has no role in determining the policies of the Fund or the securities that are purchased or sold by the Fund. The
Distributor’s principal address is 1 University Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</div>
<div>BFA or its affiliates make payments to broker-dealers,
registered investment advisers, banks or other intermediaries (together, “intermediaries”) related to marketing activities and presentations, educational training programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and
reporting systems, data provision services, or their making shares of the Fund and certain other iShares funds available to their customers generally and in certain investment programs. Such payments, which may be significant to the intermediary,
are not made by the Fund. Rather, such payments are made by BFA or its affiliates from their own resources, which come directly or indirectly in part from fees paid by the iShares funds complex. Payments of this type are sometimes referred to as
revenue-sharing payments. A financial intermediary may make decisions about which investment options it recommends or makes available, or the level of services provided, to its customers based on the payments or other financial incentives it is
eligible to receive. Therefore, such payments or other financial incentives offered or made to an intermediary create conflicts of interest between the intermediary and its customers and may cause the intermediary to recommend the Fund or other
iShares funds over another investment. More information regarding these payments is contained in the Fund's SAI. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information regarding any such
payments his or her firm may receive from BFA or its affiliates.</font></div>

<div>The financial highlights table is intended to help investors
understand the Fund’s financial performance since inception. Certain information reflects financial results for a single share of the Fund. The total return in the table represents the rate that an investor would have earned (or lost) on an
investment in the Fund, assuming reinvestment of all dividends and distributions. This information has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, whose report is included, along with the Fund's financial statements, in the Fund's Annual Report

<div>The ICE AMT-Free US Municipal Index Series</div>
<div>ICE AMT-Free US Municipal Index series includes indexes that
track the performance of U.S. dollar denominated investment grade tax-exempt debt publicly issued in the U.S. domestic market by U.S. states and their respective political subdivisions. Qualifying securities must be exempt from Federal income taxes
and must not be subject to alternative minimum tax. In addition, qualifying securities must have at least one month remaining term to final maturity, a fixed coupon schedule (including zero coupon and step-up or stepdown bonds) and an investment
grade rating (based on lowest rating of Moody’s, S&amp;P and Fitch). Once a bond is removed from an index due to a downgrade it is not eligible to re-enter for six months. Unrated pre-refunded and escrowed-to-maturity securities qualify for
inclusion provided they or their original security met the rating criterion at the point of pre-refunding or escrow. Remarketed mandatory put/tender securities are included in the index.</div>
<div>The ICE AMT-Free US Municipal Index series <font>excludes</font> the following instruments:</div> <div>

</td></tr></table> </div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>After
applying the caps in step 1, the index is segmented into a large cap group, consisting of issuers with index weights greater than or equal to 5%, and a small cap group consisting of issuers with less than 5% weight in the index. </td></tr></table>
</div> <div>

greater than 50% of the index, the weight of the group is reduced to 50%, with the weights of all issuers in the group reduced on a pro rata basis, provided no issuer is reduced below 5%. </td></tr></table> </div> <div>

small cap issuers reach the 4.5% cap, any remaining excess weight is redistributed across all index issuers on a pro rata basis. </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>For purposes of applying the above caps, issuers are defined
as issuing entities except for conduit debt, in which case the underlying issuer is used. In addition, an issuing entity’s general obligation debt is considered to be issued by a separate,</div> </div> </div>
<div> </div> <hr/> <div></div> <p>  </p>
<p>
<hr size="3"/>
<div> <div type="Block">
<div>distinct issuer from revenue bonds issued by the same entity. Pre-refunded
securities are not included in issuer weights and are not subject to any issuer caps, nor do they receive redistributions of any excess weights.</div>
<div>Accrued interest is calculated assuming next-day settlement.
Cash flows from bond payments, including interest coupons and principal repayments of maturing or called bonds that are received during the month, are retained in the index until the end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing.
Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the index. Information concerning constituent bond prices, timing and conventions and index governance and administration is provided in the ICE Bond Index Methodologies, which can be
accessed on ICE’s public website (https://indices.theice.com), or by sending a request to iceindices@theice.com.</div>
<div>Each index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the
month, based on information available up to and including the third business day before the last business day of the month. New issues must settle on or before the following calendar month end rebalancing date in order to qualify for the coming
month (e.g., an issue must settle on or before November 30 in order to be included in the index on October 31). No changes are made to constituent holdings other than on month end rebalancing dates.</div>

<div>Each Fund is managed by BlackRock Fund Advisors
(“BFA”), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc., and generally seeks to track the investment results of the specific benchmark index identified in the applicable Prospectus for that Fund (each, an “Underlying
Index”).</div> <div>Each Fund offers and issues shares at
their net asset value per share (“NAV”) only in aggregations of a specified number of shares (each, a “Creation Unit”), generally in exchange for a designated portfolio of securities, assets or other positions (including any
portion of such securities for which cash may be substituted) included in its Underlying Index (the “Deposit Securities” or “Creation Basket”), together with the deposit of a specified cash payment (the “Cash
Component”). Shares of the Funds are listed for trading on national securities exchanges such as Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (“Cboe BZX”), The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) or NYSE Arca, Inc. (“NYSE Arca”)
(each a “Listing Exchange”). Shares of each Fund are traded in the secondary market and elsewhere at market prices that may be at, above or below the Fund's NAV. Shares are redeemable only in Creation Units by Authorized Participants (as
defined in the <font>Creation and Redemption of Creation Units-Role of the Authorized Participant</font> section of this SAI), and, generally, in exchange for portfolio securities and a Cash Amount (as defined in the <font>Redemption of Creation Units</font> section of this SAI). Creation Units typically are a specified number of shares, generally ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 shares or multiples thereof.</div>
<div>The Trust reserves the right to permit or require that
creations and redemptions of shares are effected fully or partially in cash and reserves the right to permit or require the substitution of Deposit Securities in lieu of cash. Shares may be issued in advance of receipt of Deposit Securities, subject
to various conditions, including a requirement that the Authorized Participant maintain with the Trust collateral as set forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants. The Trust may use such collateral at any time to purchase Deposit Securities.
See the <font>Creation and Redemption of Creation Units</font> section of this SAI. Transaction fees and other costs associated with creations or redemptions that include a cash portion may be higher than the transaction
fees and other costs associated with in-kind creations or redemptions. In all cases, conditions with respect to creations and redemptions of shares and fees will be limited in accordance with the requirements of SEC rules and regulations applicable
to management investment companies offering redeemable securities.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

Listing and Trading</div> <div>A discussion of exchange listing and
trading matters associated with an investment in each Fund is contained in the <font>Shareholder Information</font> section of each Fund's Prospectus. The discussion below supplements, and should be read in conjunction
with, that section of the applicable Prospectus.</div> <div>Shares
of each Fund are listed for trading, and trade throughout the day, on the applicable Listing Exchange and in other secondary markets. Shares of certain Funds may also be listed on certain non-U.S. exchanges. There can be no assurance that the
requirements of the Listing Exchange necessary to maintain the listing of shares of any Fund will continue to be met. The Listing Exchange may, but is not required to, remove the shares of a Fund from listing if, among other things: (i) following
the initial 12-month period beginning upon the commencement of trading of Fund shares, there are fewer than 50 record and/or beneficial owners of shares of the Fund for 30 or more consecutive trading days; (ii) a Fund is no longer eligible to
operate in reliance on Rule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act; (iii) any of the other listing requirements are not continuously maintained; or (iv) any event shall occur or condition shall exist that, in the opinion of the Listing Exchange,
makes further dealings on the Listing Exchange inadvisable. The Listing Exchange will also remove shares of a Fund from listing and trading upon termination of such Fund.</div>
<div>As in the case of other publicly-traded securities, when you
buy or sell shares of a Fund through a broker, you may incur a brokerage commission determined by that broker, as well as other charges.</div>

<div>Each Fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing
primarily in both fixed-income securities that comprise its relevant Underlying Index and in investments that provide substantially similar exposure to securities in the Underlying Index. The Underlying Indexes for the iShares High Yield Bond Factor
ETF and iShares Investment Grade Bond Factor ETF are based on a proprietary methodology created and sponsored by BlackRock Index Services, LLC (the “Index Provider”). The Index Provider is an affiliated person of the iShares High Yield
Bond Factor ETF and iShares Investment Grade Bond Factor ETF and of BFA. Each Fund operates as an index fund and is not actively managed. Adverse performance of a security in a Fund’s portfolio will ordinarily not result in the elimination of
the security from the Fund’s portfolio.</div> <div>Each Fund
engages in representative sampling, which is investing in a sample of securities selected by BFA to have a collective investment profile similar to that of the Fund's Underlying Index. Securities selected have aggregate investment characteristics
(based on market value and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as yield, credit rating, maturity and duration) and liquidity measures similar to those of the Fund’s Underlying Index. A fund that uses representative sampling
generally does not hold all of the securities that are in its underlying index.</div>
<div>Although the Funds do not seek leveraged returns, certain
instruments used by the Funds may have a leveraging effect as described below.</div>
<div>Each of the iShares 1-3 Year Treasury Bond ETF, iShares 3-7
Year Treasury Bond ETF, iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF, iShares 10-20 Year Treasury Bond ETF, iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF and iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF (the “Treasury Bond Funds”) generally invests at least 90% of its
assets in the bonds of its Underlying Index and at least 95% of its assets in U.S. government bonds. Each Treasury Bond Fund may invest up to 10% of its assets in U.S. government bonds not included in its Underlying Index, but which BFA believes
will help the Treasury Bond Fund track its Underlying Index. For example, a Treasury Bond Fund may invest in bonds not included in its Underlying Index in order to reflect changes in the relevant Underlying Index (such as reconstitutions, additions
and deletions). Each Treasury Bond Fund also may invest up to 5% of its assets in repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government obligations and in cash and cash equivalents, including shares of money market funds advised by BFA or its
affiliates (“BlackRock Cash Funds”).</div> <div>Each of

the iShares California Muni Bond ETF and iShares New York Muni Bond ETF generally holds municipal bond securities issued by its respective state and local municipalities whose interest payments are exempt from U.S. federal and state income tax and
the federal alternative minimum tax (“AMT”). Each of the iShares National Muni Bond ETF and iShares Short-Term National Muni Bond ETF will generally hold municipal bond securities issued by state and local municipalities whose interest
payments are exempt from U.S. federal income tax and the federal AMT. As of the date of this SAI, interest that is exempt from U.S. federal income tax is also exempt from the federal Medicare contribution tax of 3.8% on “net investment
income.” In addition, each Municipal Bond Fund intends to invest any cash assets in one or more affiliated municipal money market funds, which may be advised by BFA or its affiliates.</div>
<div>Asset-Backed Securities Risk.<font>
 Asset-backed securities (“ABS”) represent interests in “pools” of assets, including consumer loans or receivables held in trust. ABS are “pass-through” securities, meaning that principal and interest
payments, net of expenses, made by the borrower on the underlying assets are passed through to the Fund. ABS, like traditional fixed-income securities, are subject to credit, interest rate, call, prepayment, extension, valuation and illiquidity
risk. Because of call, prepayment, and extension risk, however, ABS react differently to changes in interest rates than other bonds. Small movements in interest rates (both increases and decreases) may quickly and significantly reduce the value of
certain ABS. The price paid by the Fund for its ABS, the yield the Fund expects to receive from such securities and the average life of such securities are based on a number of factors, including the anticipated rate of prepayment of the underlying
assets. During periods of difficulty in the credit markets, ABS may decline in value and become less liquid, more volatile, and more difficult to value.</font></div>
<div>The nature of the assets and the servicing of those assets may
subject ABS to additional risks in comparison to mortgage-backed securities. For instance, certain ABS generally do not have the benefit of a security interest in collateral that is</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>comparable in quality to
mortgage-backed assets. The value of the collateral may also be insufficient to cover the principal amount of the obligation. Other ABS, such as those backed by credit card receivables, do not have the benefit of a security interest in collateral at
all. Moreover, the values of ABS may be substantially dependent on the servicing of the underlying asset pools, and are therefore subject to risks associated with the negligence or malfeasance by their servicers and to the credit risk of their
servicers.</div> <div>ABS are often not backed by the full faith
and credit of the U.S. government and are subject to risk of default on the underlying asset, particularly during periods of economic downturn.</div>
<div>Bonds.<font>   Each Fund
invests a substantial portion of its assets in U.S. dollar-denominated bonds. A bond is an interest-bearing security issued by a U.S. or non-U.S. company, or U.S. or non-U.S. governmental unit. The issuer of a bond has a contractual obligation to
pay interest at a stated rate on specific dates and to repay principal (the bond’s face value) periodically or on a specified maturity date. Bonds generally are used by issuers to borrow money from investors.</font></div>
<div>An issuer may have the right to redeem or “call” a
bond before maturity, in which case the Fund may have to reinvest the proceeds at lower market rates. Similarly, a fund may have to reinvest interest income or payments received when bonds mature, sometimes at lower market rates. Most bonds
bear interest income at a “coupon” rate that is fixed for the life of the bond. The value of a fixed-rate bond usually rises when market interest rates fall, and falls when market interest rates rise. Accordingly, a fixed-rate
bond’s yield (income as a percent of the bond’s current value) may differ from its coupon rate as its value rises or falls. When an investor purchases a fixed-rate bond at a price that is greater than its face value, the investor is
purchasing the bond at a premium. Conversely, when an investor purchases a fixed-rate bond at a price that is less than its face value, the investor is purchasing the bond at a discount. Fixed-rate bonds that are purchased at a discount pay less
current income than securities with comparable yields that are purchased at face value, with the result that prices for such fixed-rate securities can be more volatile than prices for such securities that are purchased at face value. Other types of
bonds bear interest at an interest rate that is adjusted periodically. Interest rates on “floating rate” or “variable rate” bonds may be higher or lower than current market rates for fixed-rate bonds of comparable quality
with similar final maturities. Because of their adjustable interest rates, the value of “floating rate” or “variable rate” bonds fluctuates much less in response to market interest rate movements than the value of fixed-rate
bonds, but their value may decline if their interest rates do not rise as much, or as quickly, as interest rates in general. Each Fund may treat some of these bonds as having a shorter maturity for purposes of calculating the weighted average
maturity of its investment portfolio. Generally, prices of higher quality issues tend to fluctuate less with changes in market interest rates than prices of lower quality issues and prices of longer maturity issues tend to fluctuate more than prices
of shorter maturity issues. Bonds may be senior or subordinated obligations. Senior obligations generally have the first claim on an issuer’s earnings and assets and, in the event of liquidation, are paid before subordinated obligations. Bonds
may be unsecured (backed only by the issuer’s general creditworthiness) or secured (backed by specified collateral).</div>
<div>Borrowing. <font> Each Fund may
borrow for temporary or emergency purposes, including to meet payments due from redemptions or to facilitate the settlement of securities or other transactions. The iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF and iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF, along with
certain other iShares funds, have entered into a syndicated line of credit with the Bank of New York Mellon (“BNY”), which serves as administrative agent for itself and the other banks. The syndicated line of credit may be used for
temporary or emergency purposes, including redemption, settlement of trades and rebalancing of portfolio holdings.</font></div>
<div>Interest rates related to the syndicated line of credit may be
based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a spread. In 2017, the head of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority announced a desire to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. On March 5, 2021, the
administrator of LIBOR, ICE Benchmark Administration Limited, announced its intention to cease publishing two USD LIBOR settings immediately after publication on December 31, 2021, with the majority of the USD LIBOR settings to end immediately after
publication on June 30, 2023. Pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement, if LIBOR ceases to be published or representative before the termination of the credit agreement, LIBOR would be replaced under the terms of the credit agreement by a
variable rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.</div>
<div>The purchase of securities while borrowings are outstanding
may have the effect of leveraging a Fund. The incurrence of leverage increases a Fund’s exposure to risk, and borrowed funds are subject to interest costs that will reduce net income. Purchasing securities while borrowings are outstanding
creates special risks, such as the potential for greater volatility in the NAV of Fund shares and in the yield on a Fund’s portfolio. In addition, the interest expenses from borrowings may exceed the income generated by a Fund’s
portfolio and, therefore, the amount available (if any) for distribution to shareholders as</div> </div> <div type="Block">

BFA may determine to maintain outstanding borrowings if it expects that the benefits to a Fund’s shareholders will outweigh the current reduced return.</div>
<div>Certain types of borrowings by a Fund must be made from a bank
or may result in a Fund being subject to covenants in credit agreements relating to asset coverage, portfolio composition requirements and other matters. It is not anticipated that observance of such covenants would impede BFA’s management of
a Fund’s portfolio in accordance with a Fund’s investment objectives and policies. However, a breach of any such covenants not cured within the specified cure period may result in acceleration of outstanding indebtedness and require a
Fund to dispose of portfolio investments at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so.</div>

bonds have been issued since 1989. In light of the history of defaults of countries issuing Brady bonds on their commercial bank loans, investments in Brady bonds may be viewed as speculative and subject to the same risks as emerging market
securities. Brady bonds may be fully or partially collateralized or uncollateralized, are issued in U.S. dollars and are actively traded in over-the-counter (“OTC”) secondary markets. Incomplete collateralization of interest or principal
payment obligations results in increased credit risk. U.S. dollar-denominated collateralized Brady bonds, which may be either fixed-rate or floating rate bonds, are generally collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities.</font></div>
<div>Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities Risk. <font> The commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) in which the Fund invests may be issued by entities, such as banks, mortgage lenders or other institutions. These entities are not backed by the full
faith and credit of the U.S. government, and there can be no assurance that the U.S. government would provide financial support to its agencies or instrumentalities where it is not obligated to do so.</font></div>
<div>CMBS depend on cash flows generated by underlying commercial
real-estate loans, receivables or other assets, and can be significantly affected by changes in interest rates, the availability of information concerning the underlying assets and their structure, and the creditworthiness of the originators of the
underlying assets.</div> <div>Due to the nature of the loans they
represent, CMBS are subject to a greater degree of prepayment and extension risk than many other forms of fixed-income securities. Small movements in interest rates (both increases and decreases) may quickly and significantly reduce the value of
certain CMBS. Certain CMBS are issued in several classes with different levels of yield and credit protection. The Fund’s investments in CMBS with several classes may be in the lower classes that have greater risks than the higher classes,
including greater interest rate, credit, prepayment and extension risks.</div>
<div>In addition, the value of CMBS may be adversely affected by
regulatory or tax changes. CMBS issued by non-government entities may offer higher yields than those issued by government entities, but also may be subject to greater volatility than government issues. In the recent past, the market for CMBS has
experienced volatility and reduced liquidity.</div> <div>Corporate
Bonds.<font>  Each Fund (other than the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF, iShares 25+ Year Treasury STRIPS Bond ETF, iShares ESG Advanced Total USD Bond Market ETF, Treasury Bond Funds and the Municipal Bond
Funds) may invest in investment-grade and/or high yield corporate bonds. High yield corporate bonds may be deemed speculative and more volatile than higher rated securities of similar maturity. The investment return of corporate bonds reflects
interest earned on the security and changes in the market value of the security. The market value of a corporate bond may be affected by changes in the market rate of interest, the credit rating of the issuer, the issuer’s performance and
perceptions of the issuer in the marketplace. There is a risk that the issuers of the securities may not be able to meet their obligations on interest or principal payments at the time called for by an instrument.</font></div>

<div>A fund classified as “diversified” under the 1940
Act may not purchase securities of an issuer (other than (i) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities and (ii) securities of other investment companies) if, with respect to 75% of its total assets,
(a) more than 5% of the fund’s total assets would be invested in securities of that issuer or (b) the fund would hold more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of that issuer. With respect to the remaining 25% of its total assets, the
fund may invest more than 5% of its assets in one issuer. Under the 1940 Act, a fund cannot change its classification from diversified to non-diversified without shareholder approval.</div>
<div> A “non-diversified” fund is a fund that is
not limited by the 1940 Act with regard to the percentage of its assets that may be invested in the securities of a single issuer. The securities of a particular issuer (or securities of issuers in particular industries) may constitute a significant
percentage of the underlying index of such a fund and, consequently, the fund’s investment portfolio. This may adversely affect a fund’s performance or subject the fund’s shares to greater price volatility than that experienced by
more diversified investment companies.</div> <div>Each Fund
(whether diversified or non-diversified) intends to maintain the required level of diversification and otherwise conduct its operations so as to qualify as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) for purposes of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”), and to relieve the Fund of any liability for U.S. federal income tax to the extent that its earnings are distributed to shareholders, provided that the Fund satisfies a minimum

with the diversification requirements of the Internal Revenue Code may limit the investment flexibility of certain Funds and may make it less likely that the Funds will meet their respective investment objectives.</div>
<div>Futures, Options on Futures and Securities Options.<font>  Futures contracts, options on futures and securities options may be used by a Fund to simulate investment in its Underlying Index, to facilitate trading or to reduce transaction costs. Each Fund may enter into
futures contracts and options on futures that are traded on a U.S. or non-U.S. futures exchange. Each Fund will not use futures, options on futures or securities options for speculative purposes. Each Fund intends to use futures and options on
futures in accordance with Rule 4.5 of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) promulgated under the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”). BFA, with respect to certain Funds, has claimed an exclusion from the
definition of the term “commodity pool operator” in accordance with Rule 4.5 so that BFA, with respect to such Funds, is not subject to registration or regulation as a commodity pool operator under the CEA. See the </font><font>Regulation Regarding Derivatives </font><font>section of this SAI for more information.</font></div>
<div>Futures contracts provide for the future sale by one party and
purchase by another party of a specified amount of a specific instrument or index at a specified future time and at a specified price. Stock index contracts are based on investments that reflect the market value of common stock of the firms included
in the investments. Each Fund may enter into futures contracts to purchase securities indexes when BFA anticipates purchasing the underlying securities and believes prices will rise before the purchase will be made. Upon entering into a futures
contract, a Fund will be required to deposit with the broker an amount of cash or cash equivalents known as “initial margin,” which is similar to a performance bond or good faith deposit on the contract and is returned to the Fund upon
termination of the futures contract if all contractual obligations have been satisfied. Subsequent payments, known as “variation margin,” will be made to and from the broker daily as the price of the instrument or index underlying the
futures contract fluctuates, making the long and short positions in the futures contract more or less valuable, a process known as “marking-to-market.” At any time prior to the expiration of a futures contract, each Fund may elect to
close the position by taking an opposite position, which will operate to terminate the Fund’s existing position in the contract. To the extent required by law, each Fund will segregate liquid assets in an amount equal to its delivery
obligations under the futures contracts. An option on a futures contract, as contrasted with a direct investment in such a contract, gives the purchaser the right, but no obligation, in return for the premium paid, to assume a position in the
underlying futures contract at a specified exercise price at any time prior to the expiration date of the option. Upon exercise of an option, the delivery of the futures position by the writer of the option to the holder of the option will be
accompanied by delivery of the accumulated balance in the writer’s futures margin account that represents the amount by which the market price of the futures contract exceeds (in the case of a call) or is less than (in the case of a put) the
exercise price of the option on the futures contract.</div>
<div>The potential for loss related to the purchase of an option on
a futures contract is limited to the premium paid for the option plus transaction costs. Because the value of the option is fixed at the point of sale, there are no daily cash payments by the purchaser to reflect changes in the value of the
underlying contract; however, the value of the option changes daily and that change would be reflected in the NAV of each Fund. The potential for loss related to writing call options is unlimited. The potential for loss related to writing put
options is limited to the agreed-upon price per share, also known as the “strike price,” less the premium received from writing the put. Certain of the Funds may purchase and write put and call options on futures contracts that are
traded on an exchange as a hedge against changes in value of their portfolio securities or in anticipation of the purchase of securities, and may enter into closing transactions with respect to such options to terminate existing positions. There is
no guarantee that such closing transactions can be effected.</div>
<div>Securities options may be used by a Fund to obtain access to
securities in its Underlying Index or to dispose of securities in its Underlying Index at favorable prices, to invest cash in a securities index that offers similar exposure to that provided by its Underlying Index or otherwise to achieve the
Fund’s objective of tracking its Underlying Index. A call option gives a holder the right to purchase a specific security at a specified price (“exercise price”) within a specified period of time. A put option gives a holder
the right to sell a specific security at an exercise price within a specified period of time. The initial purchaser of a call option pays the “writer” a premium, which is paid at the time of purchase and is retained by the writer whether
or not such option is exercised. Each Fund may purchase put options to hedge its portfolio against the risk of a decline in the market value of securities held and may purchase call options to hedge against an increase in the price of securities it
is committed to purchase. Each Fund may write put and call options along with a long position in options to increase its ability to hedge against a change in the market value of the securities it holds or is committed to purchase. Each Fund may
purchase or sell securities options on a U.S. or non-U.S. securities exchange or in the OTC market through a transaction with a dealer. Options on a securities index are typically settled on a net basis based on the appreciation or depreciation of
the index level over the strike price. Options on single name securities may be cash- or physically-settled, depending upon the market in which they</div> </div> <div type="Block">

structured so as to be exercisable only on certain dates or on a daily basis. Options may also be structured to have conditions to exercise (<font>i.e.</font>, “Knock-in Events”) or conditions that trigger
termination (<font>i.e.</font>, “Knock-out Events”).</div>
<div>Investments in futures contracts and other investments that
contain leverage may require each Fund to maintain liquid assets in an amount equal to its delivery obligations under these contracts and other investments. Generally, each Fund maintains an amount of liquid assets equal to its obligations relative
to the position involved, adjusted daily on a marked-to-market basis. With respect to futures contracts that are contractually required to “cash-settle,” each Fund maintains liquid assets in an amount at least equal to the Fund’s
daily marked-to-market obligation (<font>i.e.</font>, each Fund’s daily net liability, if any), rather than the contracts’ notional value (<font>i.e.</font>, the value of the
underlying asset). By maintaining assets equal to its net obligation under cash-settled futures contracts, each Fund may employ leverage to a greater extent than if the Fund were required to set aside assets equal to the futures contracts’
full notional value. Each Fund bases its asset maintenance policies on methods permitted by the SEC and its staff and may modify these policies in the future to comply with any changes in the guidance articulated from time to time by the SEC or its
staff. Changes in SEC guidance regarding the use of derivatives by registered investment companies may adversely impact a Fund’s ability to invest in futures, options or other derivatives or make investments in such instruments more
expensive.</div> <div>High Yield Securities.<font>  Certain Funds may invest in non-investment grade securities. Non-investment grade or “high yield” fixed-income or convertible securities, commonly known to investors as “junk bonds” or
“high yield bonds,” are generally debt securities that are rated below investment grade by one or more of the major rating agencies or are unrated securities that BFA believes are of comparable quality. While generally providing greater
income and opportunity for gain, non-investment grade debt securities may be subject to greater risks than securities that have higher credit ratings, including a high risk of default, and their yields will fluctuate over time. High yield securities
will generally be in the lower rating categories of recognized rating agencies (rated below Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody's”) or below BBB- by Standard &amp; Poor's<sup>®</sup> Global Ratings, a subsidiary of S&amp;P Global (“S&amp;P Global Ratings”) or Fitch Ratings, Inc. (“Fitch”)) or be unrated. The
credit rating of a high yield security does not necessarily address its market value risk, and ratings may from time to time change, positively or negatively, to reflect developments regarding the issuer’s financial condition. High yield
securities are considered to be speculative with respect to the capacity of the issuer to timely repay principal and pay interest in accordance with the terms of the obligation and may have more credit risk than higher rated securities.</font></div>
<div>The major risks of high yield bond investments include the
following:</div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>High yield bonds may be
issued by less creditworthy issuers. These securities are vulnerable to adverse changes in the issuer’s industry or to general economic conditions. Issuers of high yield bonds may be unable to meet their interest or principal payment
obligations because of an economic downturn, specific issuer developments or the unavailability of additional financing. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>The issuers of high yield
bonds may have a larger amount of outstanding debt relative to their assets than issuers of investment grade bonds. If the issuer experiences financial stress, it may be unable to meet its debt obligations. The issuer’s ability to pay its debt
obligations also may be lessened by specific issuer developments, or the unavailability of additional financing. Issuers of high yield securities are often in the growth stage of their development and/or involved in a reorganization or takeover.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>High yield bonds are
frequently ranked junior to claims by other creditors. If the issuer cannot meet its obligations, the senior obligations are generally paid off before the junior obligations, which will potentially limit a Fund’s ability to fully recover
principal, to receive interest payments when senior securities are in default or to receive restructuring benefits paid to holders of more senior classes of debt. Thus, investors in high yield securities frequently have a lower degree of protection
with respect to principal and interest payments than do investors in higher rated securities. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>High yield bonds frequently
have redemption features that permit an issuer to repurchase the security from a Fund before it matures. If an issuer redeems the high yield bonds, a Fund may have to invest the proceeds in bonds with lower yields and may lose income. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Prices of high yield bonds
are subject to extreme fluctuations. Negative economic developments may have a greater impact on the prices of high yield bonds than on those of other higher rated fixed-income securities. </td></tr>

<td>Under
certain economic and/or market conditions, a Fund may have difficulty disposing of certain high yield securities due to the limited number of investors in that sector of the market. There are fewer dealers in the high yield bond market, and there

<td>The secondary markets for
high yield securities are not as liquid as the secondary markets for higher rated securities. The secondary markets for high yield securities are concentrated in relatively few market makers and, participants in the markets are mostly institutional
investors, including insurance companies, banks, other financial institutions and mutual funds. In addition, the trading volume for high yield securities is generally lower than that for higher rated securities and the secondary markets could
contract under adverse market or economic conditions independent of any specific adverse changes in the condition of a particular issuer. Under certain economic and/or market conditions, a Fund may have difficulty disposing of certain high yield
securities due to the limited number of investors in that sector of the market. An illiquid secondary market may adversely affect the market price of the high yield security, which may result in increased difficulty selling the particular issue and
obtaining accurate market quotations on the issue when valuing a Fund's assets. Market quotations on high yield securities are available only from a limited number of dealers, and such quotations may not be the actual prices available for a purchase
or sale. When the secondary market for high yield securities becomes more illiquid, or in the absence of readily available market quotations for such securities, the relative lack of reliable objective data makes it more difficult to value such
securities, and judgment plays a more important role in determining such valuations. </td></tr>

<td>The high
yield bond markets may react strongly to adverse news about an issuer or the economy, or to the perception or expectation of adverse news, whether or not it is based on fundamental analysis. Additionally, prices for high yield securities may be
affected by legislative and regulatory developments. These developments could adversely affect a Fund’s NAV and investment practices, the secondary market for high yield securities, the financial condition of issuers of these securities and
the value and liquidity of outstanding high yield securities, especially in a thinly traded market. For example, federal legislation requiring the divestiture by federally insured savings and loan associations of their investments in high yield
bonds and limiting the deductibility of interest by certain corporate issuers of high yield bonds adversely affected the market in the past. </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>Lending Portfolio Securities.<font>
 Each Fund may lend portfolio securities to certain borrowers that BFA determines to be creditworthy, including borrowers affiliated with BFA. The borrowers provide collateral that is maintained in an amount at least equal to the current market
value of the securities loaned. No securities loan shall be made on behalf of a Fund if, as a result, the aggregate value of all securities loaned by the particular Fund exceeds one-third of the value of such Fund's total assets (including the value
of the collateral received). A Fund may terminate a loan at any time and obtain the return of the securities loaned. Each Fund receives, by way of substitute payment, the value of any interest or cash or non-cash distributions paid on the loaned
securities that it would have received if the securities were not on loan.</font></div>
<div>With respect to loans that are collateralized by cash, the
borrower may be entitled to receive a fee based on the amount of cash collateral. The Funds are typically compensated by the difference between the amount earned on the reinvestment of cash collateral and the fee paid to the borrower. In the case of
collateral other than cash, a Fund is typically compensated by a fee paid by the borrower equal to a percentage of the market value of the loaned securities. Any cash collateral may be reinvested in certain short-term instruments either directly on
behalf of each Fund or through one or more joint accounts or money market funds, including those affiliated with BFA; such investments are subject to investment risk.</div>
<div>Each Fund conducts its securities lending pursuant to an
exemptive order from the SEC permitting it to lend portfolio securities to borrowers affiliated with the Fund and to retain an affiliate of the Fund to act as securities lending agent. To the extent that a Fund engages in securities lending,
BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) acts as securities lending agent for the Fund, subject to the overall supervision of BFA. BTC administers the lending program in accordance with guidelines approved by the Trust's Board
of Trustees (the “Board,” the trustees of which are the “Trustees”).</div>
<div>Securities lending involves exposure to certain risks,
including operational risk (<font>i.e.,</font> the risk of losses resulting from problems in the settlement and accounting process), “gap” risk (<font>i.e.,</font> the risk of a
mismatch between the return on cash collateral reinvestments and the fees a Fund has agreed to pay a borrower), and credit, legal, counterparty and market risk. If a securities lending counterparty were to default, a Fund would be subject to the
risk of a possible delay in receiving collateral or in recovering the loaned securities, or to a possible loss of rights in the collateral. In the event a borrower does not return a Fund’s securities as agreed, the Fund may experience losses
if the proceeds received from liquidating the collateral do not at least equal the value of the loaned security at the time the collateral is liquidated, plus the transaction costs incurred in</div> </div>

securities. This event could trigger adverse tax consequences for a Fund. A Fund could lose money if its short-term investment of the collateral declines in value over the period of the loan. Substitute payments received by a Fund representing
dividends paid on securities loaned out by the Fund will not be considered qualified dividend income. BTC will take into account the tax effects on shareholders caused by this difference in connection with a Fund’s securities lending program.
Substitute payments received on tax-exempt securities loaned out will not be tax-exempt income.</div>
<div>Liquidity Risk Management.<font>
 Rule 22e-4 under the Investment Company Act (the “Liquidity Rule”) requires open-end funds, including exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) such as the Funds, to establish a liquidity risk management program (the
“Liquidity Program”) and enhance disclosures regarding fund liquidity. As required by the Liquidity Rule, the Funds have implemented a Liquidity Program, and the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees of the Trust, has
appointed BFA as the administrator of the Liquidity Program. Under the Liquidity Program, BFA assesses, manages, and periodically reviews each Fund’s liquidity risk and classifies each investment held by a Fund as a “highly liquid
investment,”</font><font> “moderately liquid investment,”</font><font> “less liquid investment” or “illiquid investment.” The Liquidity Rule defines
“liquidity risk” as the risk that a Fund could not meet requests to redeem shares issued by a Fund without significant dilution of the remaining investors’ interest in a Fund. The liquidity of a Fund's portfolio investments is
determined based on relevant market, trading and investment-specific considerations under the Liquidity Program. There are exclusions from certain portions of the liquidity risk management program requirements for “in-kind” ETFs, as
defined in the Liquidity Rule. To the extent that an investment is deemed to be an illiquid investment or a less liquid investment, a Fund can expect to be exposed to greater liquidity risk.</font></div>
<div>Municipal Insurance. <font> A
municipal security may be covered by insurance that guarantees the bond’s scheduled payment of interest and repayment of principal. This type of insurance may be obtained by either (i) the issuer at the time the bond is issued (primary market
insurance), or (ii) another party after the bond has been issued (secondary market insurance).</font></div>
<div>Both primary and secondary market insurance guarantee timely
and scheduled repayment of all principal and payment of all interest on a municipal security in the event of default by the issuer, and cover a municipal security to its maturity, enhancing its credit quality and value.</div>
<div>Municipal security insurance does not insure against market
fluctuations or fluctuations in each of the Municipal Bond Funds' share price. In addition, a municipal security insurance policy will not cover: (i) repayment of a municipal security before maturity (redemption), (ii) nonpayment of principal or
interest caused by negligence or bankruptcy of the paying agent, or (iii) prepayment or payment of an acceleration premium (except for a mandatory sinking fund redemption) or any other provision of a bond indenture that advances the maturity of the
bond. A mandatory sinking fund redemption may be a provision of a municipal security issue whereby part of the municipal security issue may be retired before maturity.</div>
<div>Because a significant portion of the municipal securities
issued and outstanding are insured by a small number of insurance companies, an event involving one or more of these insurance companies could have a significant adverse effect on the value of the securities insured by that insurance company and on
the municipal markets as a whole.</div> <div>Certain significant
providers of insurance for municipal securities have recently incurred significant losses as a result of exposure to sub-prime mortgages and other lower credit quality investments that have experienced recent defaults or otherwise suffered extreme
credit deterioration. As a result, such losses have reduced the insurers’ capital and called into question their continued ability to perform their obligations under such insurance if they are called upon to do so in the future. While an
insured municipal security will typically be deemed to have the rating of its insurer, if the insurer of a municipal security suffers a downgrade in its credit rating or if the market discounts the value of the insurance provided by the insurer, the
value of the municipal security would be more, if not entirely, dependent on the rating of the municipal security independent of insurance.</div>
<div>Municipal Securities.
<font> Certain of the Funds invest in securities issued in the U.S. market by U.S. states and territories, municipalities and other political subdivisions, agencies, authorities and instrumentalities of states and
multi-state agencies or authorities (“municipal securities”), the interest payments of which are not subject to U.S. federal income tax. The municipal securities which such Funds may purchase include general obligation bonds and limited
obligation bonds (or “Revenue Bonds”), including industrial development bonds issued pursuant to former U.S. federal tax law.</font></div>
<div>General obligation bonds are obligations involving the credit
of an issuer possessing taxing power and are payable from such issuer’s general revenues and not from any particular source. Revenue Bonds are payable only from the revenues derived from a particular facility or class of facilities or, in some
cases, from the proceeds of a special excise or other specific revenue</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>source. Revenue Bonds that
are issued to finance a particular project often depend on revenues from that project to make principal and interest payments. Adverse conditions and developments affecting a particular project can result in lower revenues to the issuer of the
municipal securities. Additionally, the market values of Revenue Bonds may decline in times of higher inflation to the extent that revenues are fixed income streams. In other instances, the prices that certain Revenue Bond issuers are able to charge
users of their assets may be linked to inflation, whether by government regulation, contractual arrangement or other factors. In this case, changes in the rate of inflation may affect the issuer’s revenues. Additionally, rising interest rates
could result in higher costs of capital for issuers of both general obligation bonds and Revenue Bonds, which could negatively impact their ability to meet payment obligations.</div>
<div>The market for municipal bonds may be less liquid than for
taxable bonds. This means that it may be harder to buy and sell municipal securities, especially on short notice, than non-municipal securities. In addition, the municipal securities market is generally characterized as a buy and hold investment
strategy. As a result, the accessibility of municipal securities in the market is generally greater closer to the original date of issue of the securities and lessens as the securities move further away from such issuance date.</div>
<div>Some longer-term municipal securities give the investor the
right to “put” or sell the security at par (face value) within a specified number of days following the investor’s request - usually one to seven days. This demand feature enhances a security’s liquidity by shortening its
effective maturity and enables it to trade at a price equal to or very close to par. If a demand feature terminates prior to being exercised, a Fund would hold the longer-term security, which could experience substantially more volatility.</div>
<div>Municipal securities are subject to credit and market risk.
Generally, prices of higher quality issues tend to fluctuate more with changes in market interest rates than prices of lower quality issues and prices of longer maturity issues tend to fluctuate more than prices of shorter maturity issues.</div>
<div>Prices and yields on municipal securities are dependent on a
variety of factors, including general money-market conditions, the financial condition of the issuer, general conditions of the municipal security market, the size of a particular offering, the maturity of the obligation and the rating of the issue.
A number of these factors, including the ratings of particular issues, are subject to change from time to time. Information about the financial condition of an issuer of municipal securities may not be as extensive as that which is made available by
corporations whose securities are publicly-traded. As a result, municipal securities may be more difficult to value than securities of public corporations.</div>
<div>Obligations of issuers of municipal securities are subject to
insolvency concerns and, unlike obligations of corporate issuers, may not be subject to resolution in the event of insolvency or default through a bankruptcy proceeding. The U.S. Congress or state legislatures may seek to extend the time for payment
of principal or interest, or both, or to impose other constraints upon enforcement of such obligations. In addition, municipal securities are subject to the risk that their tax treatment could be changed, thereby affecting the value of outstanding
municipal securities. There is also the possibility that as a result of litigation or other conditions, such as passing of a referendum, the power or ability of issuers to meet their obligations for the payment of interest and principal on their
municipal securities may be materially affected or their obligations may be found to be invalid or unenforceable. Such litigation or conditions may from time to time have the effect of introducing uncertainties in the market for municipal securities
or certain segments thereof, or of materially affecting the credit risk with respect to particular bonds. Adverse economic, business, legal or political developments might affect all or a substantial portion of a Fund’s municipal securities in
the same manner.</div> <div>Additionally, certain municipal
securities are issued by entities dependent on revenue from a particular sector and thus are subject to the specific risks associated with that sector. These sectors are described in more detail below.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Health Care-Related Municipal Securities.
<font>Changes to state or federal policy tied to health care services could adversely affect the value of municipal securities backed by revenue from public hospitals and other health care facilities. Regulatory changes
that govern cost reimbursements to health care providers under government-funded programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, including policies that award exclusive contracts to certain hospitals, may adversely affect the revenue streams backing certain
municipal securities. Additionally, the expansion of healthcare facilities by some issuers may be subject to “determinations of need” by various regulators or other authorities. This process not only generally increases the time and
expenses such expansions entail, but also makes expansion plans uncertain, thus potentially limiting the revenue and growth of healthcare facility operators. Moreover, local, state and federal governmental bodies are under increasing pressure to
reduce medical spending and control healthcare costs, which could both adversely affect regulatory processes and public funding available for healthcare services and facilities. The value of healthcare-related municipal</font></div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>securities could also be
affected by a variety of other factors that impact the underlying healthcare facilities including demand for services, the ability of the health care facility to provide the services required, competition with other facilities, and expenses (such as
malpractice insurance premiums).</div> <div>Risk of Investing in
Infrastructure-Related Municipal Securities.<font> Entities that issue municipal securities related to infrastructure (“infrastructure issuers”) may be subject to a variety of factors that could adversely
affect their capacity to make principal and interest payments, such as high interest costs in connection with capital construction programs, high degrees of leverage, costs associated with governmental, environmental and other regulations, the
effects of economic slowdowns, increased competition from other providers of services, uncertainties concerning costs, the level of government spending on infrastructure projects, and other factors. Such issuers may be adversely affected by
commodity price volatility, changes in exchange rates, import controls, depletion of resources, technological developments, and labor relations. Infrastructure issuers can be significantly affected by government spending policies.</font></div>
<div>Leverage Risk.<font> Infrastructure issuers can be highly indebted, which increases investment risk and other risks normally associated with debt financing, which could adversely affect such an issuer’s operations and the market value
of related municipal securities in periods of rising interest rates.</font></div>
<div>Operations Risk.<font> The failure of an infrastructure issuer to carry adequate insurance or to operate its assets appropriately could lead to significant losses. Infrastructure may be adversely affected by environmental clean-up costs and
catastrophic events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts.</font></div>
<div>Regulatory Risk.<font> Infrastructure projects may be subject to significant regulation by various governmental authorities and also may be affected by regulation of rates charged to customers, service interruption due to environmental,
operational or other events, the imposition of special tariffs and changes in tax laws, regulatory policies and accounting standards.</font></div>
<div>Strategic Asset Risk.<font> Infrastructure issuers may control significant strategic assets (e.g., major pipelines or highways), which are assets that have a national or regional profile, and may have monopolistic characteristics. Given their
national or regional profile or irreplaceable nature, strategic assets could generate additional risk not common in other industry sectors and they may be targeted for terrorist acts or adverse political actions.</font></div>
<div>User Risk.<font>
Infrastructure issuers can be dependent upon a narrow user base. If these users do not patronize infrastructure projects as expected, significant revenues could be lost and may not be replaceable, in which case infrastructure issuers may fail to pay
their obligations.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in Municipal
Securities Issued By School Districts.<font> School districts rely, in part, on funding appropriations from, among others, the federal government and state governments. As a result, municipal securities issued by school
districts may be adversely affected by political and economic changes at the state or federal levels, such as decreased tax or other revenues, spending reductions or changes in appropriations. Investors in these securities, similar to investors in
municipal securities generally, face heightened risk of loss upon insolvency of the school district issuers because there is often no ready source of funding to pay the bonds other than the local tax base, which a bankruptcy court or administrator
does not control.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in
Transportation Infrastructure-Related Municipal Securities.<font> The transportation infrastructure industry may be adversely affected by economic changes, increases in fuel and other operating costs, labor relations,
insurance costs, and, in many jurisdictions, the effects of regulatory changes or other government decisions. Municipal securities that are issued to finance a particular transportation project (e.g., toll roads) often depend on revenues from that
project to make principal and interest payments.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Utility-Related Municipal Securities.<font> Certain municipal securities are issued by public bodies, including state and municipal utility authorities, to, among other things, finance the operation or expansion of utility entities. Various future economic and
other conditions may adversely affect utility entities, including inflation, increases in financing requirements, increases in raw material costs and other operating costs, changes in demand for services and the effects of environmental and other
governmental regulations. Certain utilities are subject to specific risks. For example, gas utilities are subject to risks of supply conditions and increased competition from other providers of utility services. In addition, gas utilities are
affected by gas prices, which may be magnified to the extent that a gas utility enters into long-term contracts for the purchase or sale of gas at a fixed price, since such prices may change significantly and to the disadvantage of the gas
utility.</font></div> <div>The types of municipal securities in
which the Funds may invest include, but are not limited, to the following:</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Industrial
Development Bonds</div> <div>Industrial development bonds generally
are also Revenue Bonds and thus are not payable from the issuer’s general revenues. The credit and quality of industrial development bonds are usually related to the credit of the corporate user of the facilities. Payment of interest on and
repayment of principal of such bonds is the responsibility of the corporate user (and/or any guarantor).</div>
<div>Private Activity Bonds</div>
<div>Certain of the Funds may invest in private activity bonds,
which are bonds issued by or on behalf of public authorities to obtain funds to provide privately operated housing facilities, airport, mass transit or port facilities, sewage disposal, solid waste disposal or hazardous waste treatment or disposal
facilities and certain local facilities for water supply, gas or electricity. Other types of private activity bonds, the proceeds of which are used for the construction, equipment, repair or improvement of privately operated industrial or commercial
facilities, may constitute municipal securities, although the current U.S. federal tax laws place substantial limitations on the size of such issues.</div>
<div>Municipal Lease Obligations</div>
<div>The Funds may invest in municipal lease obligations, including
certificates of participation (“COPs”) issued by government authorities or entities to finance the acquisition or construction of equipment, land and/or facilities. The COPs represent participations in a lease, an installment purchase
contract, or a conditional sales contract relating to equipment, land or facilities. As a result of their structure, COPs are generally not subject to constitutional debt limitations or other statutory requirements that may apply to other municipal
securities. Municipal governments may not be obligated to make lease or installment purchase payments in connection with COPs, and, in such circumstances, the COP will be secured only by the leased property. If the issuer of a COP does not fulfill
its payment obligation, it may be difficult to sell the property and the proceeds of a sale may not cover the Fund’s loss. Municipal lease obligations may be less liquid than conventional municipal bonds, but otherwise have the same general
risk characteristics as other municipal securities.</div>
<div>Tender Option Bonds</div>
<div>Tender option bonds are synthetic floating rate or variable
rate securities issued when long-term bonds are purchased in the primary or secondary market and then deposited into a trust. Custodial receipts are then issued to investors in these securities evidencing ownership interests in the trust. The
remarketing agent for the trust sets a floating or variable rate on typically a weekly basis. The sponsor of a highly leveraged tender option bond trust generally will retain a liquidity provider to purchase the short-term floating rate interests at
their original purchase price upon the occurrence of certain specified events. However, the liquidity provider may not be required to purchase the floating rate interests upon the occurrence of certain other events, for example, the downgrading of
the municipal bonds owned by the tender option bond trust below investment-grade or certain events that indicate the issuer of the bonds may be entering bankruptcy. The general effect of these provisions is to pass to the holders of the floating
rate interests the most severe credit risks associated with the municipal bonds owned by the tender option bond trust and to leave with the liquidity provider the interest rate risk (subject to a cap) and certain other risks associated with the
municipal bonds. Tender option bonds may be considered derivatives, and may expose the Funds to the same risks as investments in derivatives, as well as risks associated with leverage, especially the risk of increased volatility. To the extent the
Funds invest in tender option bonds, they also are exposed to credit risk associated with the liquidity provider retained by the sponsor of a tender bond option trust.</div>
<div>Variable Rate Demand Obligations</div>
<div>Variable rate demand obligations (“VRDOs”) are
tax-exempt obligations that contain a floating or variable interest rate adjustment formula and a right of demand on the part of the holder thereof to receive payment of the unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest upon a short notice period
not to exceed seven days. There is the possibility that because of default or insolvency the demand feature of VRDOs may not be honored. The interest rates are adjustable at intervals (ranging from daily to up to one year) to some prevailing market
rate for similar investments, such adjustment formula being calculated to maintain the market rate of the VRDOs at approximately the par value of the VRDOs on the adjustment date. The adjustments typically are based upon the Public Securities
Association Index or some other appropriate interest rate adjustment index.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Because of
the interest rate adjustment formula, VRDOs are not comparable to fixed-rate securities. During periods of declining interest rates, a Fund’s yield on a VRDO will decrease and its shareholders will forego the opportunity for capital
appreciation. During periods of rising interest rates, however, a Fund’s yield on a VRDO will increase and its shareholders will have a reduced risk of capital depreciation.</div>
<div>Municipal Notes</div>
<div>Municipal notes (also known as municipal commercial paper) are
shorter-term municipal debt obligations. They may provide interim financing in anticipation of tax collection, receipt of grants, bond sales or revenue receipts. If there is a shortfall in the anticipated proceeds, repayment on a municipal note may
be delayed or the note may not be fully repaid, and the Funds may lose money.</div>
<div>Municipal commercial paper is generally unsecured and issued
to meet short-term financing needs. The lack of security presents some risk of loss to the Funds since, in the event of an issuer’s bankruptcy, unsecured creditors are repaid only out of the assets, if any, that remain after secured creditors
are repaid.</div> <div>Non-U.S. Securities. <font> Certain obligations or securities of non-U.S. issuers may be deemed to be located in a particular country if: (i) the principal trading market for the security is in such country, (ii) the issuer is organized under
the laws of such country, (iii) the issuer derives at least 50% of its revenues or profits from such country or has at least 50% of its assets situated in such country or, (iv) the issuer is the government of the particular country.</font></div>
<div>Privately Issued Securities.<font>
  The iShares Core 5-10 Year USD Bond ETF and iShares Core 10+ Year USD Bond ETF may not invest in private placements, but may invest in certain bonds registered with the SEC or exempt from registration at the time of issuance, or offered
pursuant to Rule 144A under the 1933 Act with or without registration rights (“Rule 144A Bonds”).The iShares 1-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares 5-10 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares 10+ Year Investment
Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares Broad USD Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares Core 5-10 Year USD Bond ETF, iShares Core 10+ Year USD Bond ETF, iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF, iShares Government/Credit Bond ETF, iShares iBoxx $ High
Yield Corporate Bond ETF, iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF and iShares Intermediate Government/Credit Bond ETF may invest in privately issued securities, including those that may be resold only in accordance with Rule 144A or
Regulation S under the 1933 Act (“Restricted Securities”). Rule 144A Bonds and Restricted Securities are not publicly-traded and are subject to a variety of restrictions, which limit a purchaser's ability to acquire or resell such
securities. Accordingly, the liquidity of the market for specific Rule 144A Bonds and Restricted Securities may vary. Delay or difficulty in selling such securities may result in a loss to a Fund.</font></div>
<div>Ratings. <font> An
investment-grade rating generally means the security or issuer is rated investment-grade by one or more of Moody’s, S&amp;P Global Ratings, Fitch, or another credit rating agency designated as a nationally recognized statistical rating
organization (“NRSRO”) by the SEC, or is unrated but considered to be of equivalent quality by BFA. Generally, bonds rated Baa3 or above by Moody’s or BBB- or above by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch are considered
“investment-grade” securities, bonds rated Baa are considered medium grade obligations subject to moderate credit risk and may possess certain speculative characteristics, while bonds rated BBB are regarded as having adequate capacity to
meet financial commitments.</font></div> <div>Subsequent to
purchase by a Fund, a rated security may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below an investment-grade rating. Bonds rated below Baa3 by Moody’s or below BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings or Fitch are considered below investment-grade
quality and are obligations of issuers that are generally considered predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal according to the terms of the obligation and, therefore, carry greater
investment risk, including the possibility of issuer default and bankruptcy and increased market price volatility. Such lower-rated securities are commonly referred to as “junk bonds” and are subject to a substantial degree of credit
risk. Please see Appendix B of this SAI for a description of each rating category of Moody's, S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch and BFA's treatment of investments that are not rated by any of the rating agencies.</div>
<div>Regulation Regarding Derivatives.<font>  The CFTC subjects advisers to registered investment companies to regulation by the CFTC if a fund that is advised by the adviser either (i) invests, directly or indirectly, more than a prescribed level of its
liquidation value in CFTC-regulated futures, options and swaps (“CFTC Derivatives”) or (ii) markets itself as providing investment exposure to such instruments. The CFTC also subjects advisers to registered investment companies to
regulation by the CFTC if the registered investment company invests in one or more commodity pools. To the extent a Fund uses CFTC Derivatives, it intends to do so below such prescribed levels and intends not to market itself as a “commodity
pool” or a vehicle for trading such instruments.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>BFA has
claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term “commodity pool operator” under the CEA pursuant to Rule 4.5 under the CEA with respect to each of the Funds. BFA is not, therefore, subject to registration or regulation as a
“commodity pool operator” under the CEA with respect to the Funds.</div>
<div>Derivative contracts, including, without limitation, swaps,
currency forwards, and non-deliverable forwards, are subject to regulation under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) in the U.S. and under comparable regimes in Europe, Asia and other non-U.S.
jurisdictions. Swaps, non-deliverable forwards and certain other derivatives traded in the OTC market are subject to variation margin requirements, and initial margining requirements will be phased in through September 1, 2022. Implementation of the
margining and other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding clearing, mandatory trading, reporting and documentation of swaps and other derivatives have impacted and may continue to impact the costs to a Fund of trading these instruments and, as
a result, may affect returns to investors in a Fund.</div> <div>As
a result of regulatory requirements under the 1940 Act, each Fund is currently required to maintain an amount of liquid assets, accrued on a daily basis, having an aggregate value at least equal to the value of a Fund’s obligations under the
applicable derivatives contract. To the extent that derivatives contracts are settled on a physical basis, a Fund will generally be required to maintain an amount of liquid assets equal to the notional value of the contract. On the other hand, in
connection with derivatives contracts that are performed on a net basis, a Fund will generally be required to maintain liquid assets, accrued daily, equal only to the accrued excess, if any, of a Fund’s obligations over those of its
counterparty under the contract. Accordingly, reliance by a Fund on physically-settled derivatives contracts may adversely impact investors by requiring a Fund to set aside a greater amount of liquid assets than would generally be required if a Fund
were relying on cash-settled derivatives contracts.</div> <div>On
October 28, 2020, the SEC adopted new regulations governing the use of derivatives by registered investment companies (“Rule 18f-4”). The Funds will be required to implement and comply with Rule 18f-4 by August 19, 2022. Once
implemented, Rule 18f-4 will impose limits on the amount of derivatives a fund can enter into, eliminate the asset segregation framework currently used by funds to comply with Section 18 of the 1940 Act, treat derivatives as senior securities and
require funds whose use of derivatives is more than a limited specified exposure amount to establish and maintain a comprehensive derivatives risk management program and appoint a derivatives risk manager.</div>

iShares 5-10 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares Core 5-10 Year USD Bond ETF, iShares Core 10+ Year USD Bond ETF, iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF, iShares ESG Advanced Total USD Bond Market ETF, iShares ESG Aware U.S. Aggregate
Bond ETF, iShares ESG Aware USD Corporate Bond ETF, iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF and iShares MBS ETF (the “No-Action Letter Funds”) may also have investments in “underlying funds” (and such underlying funds

real estate investment trusts (“REITs”), business development companies and, investment companies that may invest in CFTC Derivatives or in any of the foregoing), and therefore may be viewed by the CFTC as commodity pools. BFA may not
have transparency into the holdings of these underlying funds because they are not advised by BFA. To address this issue of lack of transparency, the CFTC staff issued a no-action letter on November 29, 2012 permitting the adviser of a fund that
invests in such underlying funds and that would otherwise have filed a claim of exclusion pursuant to CFTC Rule 4.5 to delay registration as a “commodity pool operator” until six months from the date on which the CFTC issues additional
guidance on the treatment of CFTC Derivatives held by underlying funds. BFA, the adviser of the No-Action Letter Funds, has filed a claim with the CFTC for the Funds to rely on this no-action relief. Accordingly, BFA is not currently subject to
registration or regulation as a “commodity pool operator” under the CEA in respect of the Funds.</div>
<div>Repurchase Agreements.<font>  A
repurchase agreement is an instrument under which the purchaser (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, a Fund) acquires a security and the seller agrees, at the time of the sale, to
repurchase the security at a mutually agreed-upon time and price, thereby determining the yield during the purchaser’s holding period. Repurchase agreements may be construed to be collateralized loans by the purchaser to the seller secured by
the securities transferred to the purchaser. If a repurchase agreement is construed to be a collateralized loan, the underlying securities will not be considered to be owned by a Fund but only to constitute collateral for the seller’s
obligation to pay the repurchase price, and, in the event of a default by the seller, the Fund may suffer time delays and incur costs or losses in connection with the disposition of the collateral.</font></div>
<div>In any repurchase transaction, the collateral for a repurchase
agreement may include: (i) cash items; (ii) obligations issued by the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities; or (iii) obligations that, at the time the repurchase agreement is</div> </div>

determined to (A) have exceptionally strong capacity to meet their financial obligations and (B) are sufficiently liquid such that they can be sold at approximately their carrying value in the ordinary course of business within seven days.</div>
<div>Repurchase agreements pose certain risks for a Fund that
utilizes them. Such risks are not unique to the Funds, but are inherent in repurchase agreements. The Funds seek to minimize such risks, but because of the inherent legal uncertainties involved in repurchase agreements, such risks cannot be
eliminated. Lower quality collateral and collateral with a longer maturity may be subject to greater price fluctuations than higher quality collateral and collateral with a shorter maturity. If the repurchase agreement counterparty were to default,
lower quality collateral may be more difficult to liquidate than higher quality collateral. Should the counterparty default and the amount of collateral not be sufficient to cover the counterparty’s repurchase obligation, a Fund would likely
retain the status of an unsecured creditor of the counterparty (<font>i.e.</font>, the position a Fund would normally be in if it were to hold, pursuant to its investment policies, other unsecured debt securities of the
defaulting counterparty) with respect to the amount of the shortfall. As an unsecured creditor, a Fund would be at risk of losing some or all of the principal and income involved in the transaction.</div>
<div>Reverse Repurchase Agreements.<font>
 Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities with an agreement to repurchase the securities at an agreed-upon price, date and interest payment and have the characteristics of borrowing. Generally, the effect of such
transactions is that a Fund can recover all or most of the cash invested in the portfolio securities involved during the term of the reverse repurchase agreement, while in many cases the Fund is able to keep some of the interest income associated
with those securities. Such transactions are advantageous only if a Fund has an opportunity to earn a rate of interest on the cash derived from these transactions that is greater than the interest cost of obtaining the same amount of cash.
Opportunities to realize earnings from the use of the proceeds equal to or greater than the interest required to be paid may not always be available, and a Fund intends to use the reverse repurchase technique only when BFA believes it will be
advantageous to the Fund. The use of reverse repurchase agreements may exaggerate any increase or decrease in the value of a Fund’s assets. A Fund's exposure to reverse repurchase agreements will be covered by liquid assets having a value
equal to or greater than the Fund's obligations under such commitments. The use of reverse repurchase agreements is a form of leverage, and the proceeds obtained by a Fund through reverse repurchase agreements may be invested in additional
securities.</font></div> <div>Securities of Investment Companies. <font> Each Fund may invest in the securities of other investment companies (including money market funds) to the extent permitted by law, regulation, exemptive order or SEC staff guidance. Under the 1940 Act, a
fund’s investment in investment companies is limited to, subject to certain exceptions, (i) 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of any one investment company, (ii) 5% of the fund’s total assets with respect to any one investment
company, and (iii) 10% of the fund’s total assets with respect to investment companies in the aggregate. To the extent allowed by law or regulation, the Funds intend from time to time to invest their assets in securities of investment
companies, including, but not limited to, money market funds, including those advised by BFA or otherwise affiliated with BFA, in excess of the limits discussed above. Other investment companies in which a Fund invests can be expected to incur fees
and expenses for operations, such as investment advisory and administration fees, which would be in addition to those incurred by a Fund. Pursuant to guidance issued by the SEC staff, fees and expenses of money market funds used for cash collateral
received in connection with loans of securities are not treated as acquired fund fees and expenses, which reflect a Fund's </font><font>pro rata </font><font>share of the fees
and expenses incurred by investing in other investment companies (as disclosed in the Prospectus, as applicable).  The iShares National Muni Bond ETF may invest in shares of other iShares funds that provide substantially similar exposure
to the securities in its Underlying Index. BFA will not charge advisory fees on that portion of the iShares National Muni Bond ETF’s assets invested in shares of other iShares funds. The iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF may invest in
shares of other registered investment companies advised by BFA, or its affiliates that provide substantially similar exposure to the securities in its Underlying Index. BFA will not charge advisory fees on that portion of the iShares Core U.S.
Aggregate Bond ETF's assets invested in shares of other registered investment companies advised by BFA, or its affiliates.</font></div>
<div>Short-Term Instruments and Temporary Investments.<font>   Each Fund may invest in short-term instruments, including variable rate demand notes, short-term municipal securities, short-term municipal money market funds and money market instruments, on an ongoing basis to
provide liquidity or for other reasons. Money market instruments are generally short-term investments that may include, but are not limited to: (i) shares of money market funds (including those advised by BFA or otherwise affiliated with BFA); (ii)
obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities (including government-sponsored enterprises); (iii) negotiable certificates of deposit, bankers’ acceptances, fixed-time deposits and other obligations
of U.S. and non-U.S. banks (including non-U.S. branches) and similar institutions; (iv) commercial paper rated, at the date of purchase, “Prime-1” by Moody's, “F-1” by Fitch or “A-1” by S&amp;P Global Ratings,

quality as determined by BFA; (v) non-convertible corporate debt securities (<font>e.g.</font>, bonds and debentures) with remaining maturities at the date of purchase of not more than 397 days and that have been
determined to present minimal credit risks, in accordance with the requirements set forth in Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act; (vi) repurchase agreements; and (vii) short-term U.S. dollar-denominated obligations of non-U.S. banks (including U.S.
branches) that, in the opinion of BFA, are of comparable quality to obligations of U.S. banks that may be purchased by a Fund. Any of these instruments may be purchased on a current or forward-settled basis. Time deposits are non-negotiable deposits
maintained in banking institutions for specified periods of time at stated interest rates. Bankers’ acceptances are time drafts drawn on commercial banks by borrowers, usually in connection with international transactions.</div>
<div>Sovereign and Quasi-Sovereign Obligations. <font> Certain of the Funds may invest in sovereign and quasi-sovereign obligations. An investment in sovereign debt obligations involves special risks not present in corporate debt obligations. Sovereign debt includes
securities issued or guaranteed by a foreign sovereign government. Quasi-sovereign debt includes securities issued or guaranteed by an entity affiliated with or backed by a sovereign government. Quasi-sovereign debt obligations are typically less
liquid and less standardized than sovereign debt obligations. The issuer of the sovereign debt that controls the repayment of the debt may be unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due, and a Fund may have limited recourse in the
event of a default. Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial condition or credit rating of a non-U.S. government may cause the value of a sovereign debt to decline. During periods of economic uncertainty, the market prices of sovereign
debt obligations may be more volatile than prices of U.S. debt obligations, which may affect a Fund's NAV. In the past, certain emerging market countries have encountered difficulties in servicing their debt obligations, withheld payments of
principal and interest and declared moratoria on the payment of principal and interest on their sovereign debts. Several sovereign issuers have experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about rising government debt levels, including
Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. In the past, sovereign issuers have also defaulted on their debt obligations, including Russia, Argentina, Indonesia and Uruguay.</font></div>
<div>A sovereign debtor's willingness or ability to repay principal
and pay interest in a timely manner may be affected by, among other factors, its cash flow situation, the extent of its non-U.S. currency reserves, the availability of sufficient foreign exchange, the relative size of the debt service burden, the
sovereign debtor's policy toward principal international lenders and local political constraints. Sovereign debtors may also be dependent on expected disbursements from foreign governments, multilateral agencies and other entities to reduce
principal and interest arrears on their debt. The failure of a sovereign debtor to implement economic reforms, achieve specified levels of economic performance or repay principal or interest when due may result in the cancellation of third-party
commitments to lend funds to the sovereign debtor, which may further impair such debtor's ability or willingness to service its debts. Quasi-sovereign debt obligations are typically less liquid and less standardized than government debt.</div>
<div>Swap Agreements.<font>  Swap
agreements are contracts between parties in which one party agrees to make periodic payments to the other party based on a pre-determined underlying investment or notional amount. In return, the other party agrees to make periodic payments to the
first party based on the return (or a differential in rate of return) earned or realized on the underlying investment or notional amount. Swap agreements will usually be performed on a net basis, with a Fund receiving or paying only the net amount
of the two payments. The net amount of the excess, if any, of a Fund’s obligations over its entitlements with respect to each swap is accrued on a daily basis, and an amount of liquid assets having an aggregate value at least equal to the
accrued excess will be maintained by the Fund.</font></div>
<div>Certain of the Funds may enter into swap agreements, including
currency swaps, interest rate swaps and index swaps. The use of swaps is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio security transactions. These transactions
generally do not involve the delivery of securities or other underlying assets.</div>
<div>U.S. Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities Risk.<font>  Certain of the Funds invest in securities backed by pools of mortgages issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or one of its agencies or sponsored entities, including Government National Mortgage Association
(“Ginnie Mae”), Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”), and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”). The market for mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) has been
adversely affected by the value of those MBS held and/or issued by these agencies and sponsored entities. If a U.S. government agency or sponsored entity issues securities in which certain of the Funds invest and such issuer is unable to meet its
obligations or ceases to exist, and no plan is made for the repayment of securities, the performance of certain of the Funds will be adversely impacted.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Ginnie Mae<font>. Established in 1968, Ginnie Mae is a wholly owned U.S. government corporation within the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Ginnie Mae is authorized to guarantee, with the backing of the full faith and
credit of the U.S. government, the timely payment of principal and interest on securities issued by the institutions approved by Ginnie Mae (such as savings and loan institutions, commercial banks and mortgage banks), and backed by pools of
mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Ginnie Mae securities also are supported by the authority of Ginnie Mae to borrow funds from the U.S. Treasury Department to make
payments under its guarantee. Any actual or potential disruption to Ginnie Mae, or the financial condition or credit of the U.S. government, could cause the value of Ginnie Mae securities to decline. In 2011, S&amp;P Global Ratings downgraded U.S.
Treasury securities from AAA rating to AA+ rating. A further downgrade of the ratings of U.S. government debt obligations, which are often used as a benchmark for other borrowing arrangements, could result in higher interest rates for individual and
corporate borrowers, cause disruptions in the international bond markets and have a substantial negative effect on the U.S. economy. A downgrade of U.S. Treasury securities from another ratings agency or a further downgrade below AA+ rating by
S&amp;P Global Ratings may cause the value of Ginnie Mae securities to decline.</font></div>
<div>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac<font>.
Fannie Mae was established as a federal agency in 1938 and in 1968 was chartered by Congress as a private shareholder-owned company. Securities issued by Fannie Mae are guaranteed as to timely payment of principal and interest by Fannie Mae. The
securities are not backed by or entitled to the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, but are supported by the right of Fannie Mae to borrow from the U.S. Treasury Department.</font></div>
<div>Freddie Mac is a stockholder-owned corporation chartered by
Congress in 1970. Securities issued by Freddie Mac entitle the holder to timely payment of interests, which is guaranteed by Freddie Mac. Freddie Mac also guarantees either ultimate collection or timely payment of all principal payments. Freddie Mac
may remit the amount due on account of its guarantee of ultimate payment of principal at any time after default on an underlying mortgage, but in no event later than one year after it becomes payable. The securities are not backed by or entitled to
the full faith and credit of the U.S. government or by any Federal Home Loan Banks, but are supported by the right of Freddie Mac to borrow from the U.S. Treasury Department.</div>
<div>In 2008, the Federal Housing Finance Agency placed each of
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into government conservatorship in an effort to provide stability in the financial markets and put the government-sponsored entities in sound and solvent condition. In addition, the U.S. Treasury Department agreed to
provide Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac up to $100 billion of capital each on an as needed basis to ensure that they continue to provide liquidity to the housing and mortgage markets.</div>
<div>Mortgage-Backed Securities<font>.
MBS issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or one of its agencies or sponsored entities, such as Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac, represent interests in pools of mortgages in which payments of both principal and interest on the
securities are generally made monthly, in effect “passing through” the payments made by borrowers on the mortgage loans that underlie the securities (net of any fees paid to the issuer or guarantor of the securities). MBS differ from
other forms of debt securities, which normally provide for periodic payment of interest in fixed amounts with principal payments at maturity or specified call dates, while a MBS payments provide a combination of interest and principal throughout the
a bond’s term. As further described below, MBS may be structured as pass-through securities or collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”).</font></div>
<div>MBS are subject to the general risks associated with investing
in real estate securities; that is, they may lose value if the value of the underlying real estate to which a pool of mortgages relates declines. In addition, investments in MBS involve certain specific risks. These risks include the failure of a
party to meet its commitments under the related operative documents, adverse interest rate changes and the effects of prepayments on mortgage cash flows. The value of MBS, like that of traditional fixed-income securities, typically increases when
interest rates fall and decreases when interest rates rise. However, MBS differ from traditional fixed-income securities because of their potential for prepayment without penalty. The price paid by a Fund for its MBS, the yield a Fund expects to
receive from such securities and the weighted average life of the securities are based on a number of factors, including the anticipated rate of prepayment of the underlying mortgages. In a period of declining interest rates, borrowers may prepay
the underlying mortgages more quickly than anticipated, thereby reducing the yield to maturity and the average life of the MBS. Moreover, when a Fund reinvests the proceeds of a prepayment in these circumstances, it will likely receive a rate of
interest that is lower than the rate on the security that was prepaid.</div>
<div>To the extent that a Fund purchases MBS at a premium, mortgage
foreclosures and principal prepayments may result in a loss to the extent of the premium paid. If a Fund buys such securities at a discount, both scheduled payments of principal and unscheduled prepayments will increase current and total returns and
will accelerate the recognition of income, which,</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>when distributed to
shareholders, will be taxable as ordinary income. In a period of rising interest rates, prepayments of the underlying mortgages may occur at a slower than expected rate, creating maturity extension risk. This particular risk may effectively change a
security that was considered short- or intermediate-term at the time of purchase into a long-term security. Since the value of long-term securities generally fluctuates more widely in response to changes in interest rates than that of shorter-term
securities, maturity extension risk could increase the inherent volatility of a Fund. Under certain interest rate and prepayment scenarios, a Fund may fail to recoup fully its investment in MBS notwithstanding any direct or indirect U.S.
governmental or agency guarantee.</div> <div>Mortgage Pass-Through
Securities<font>. Some MBS, such as U.S. agency mortgage pass-through securities, represent a right to receive principal and interest payments collected on a pool of mortgages, which are passed through to security holders.
In the basic mortgage pass-through structure, mortgages with similar issuer, term and coupon characteristics are collected and aggregated into a “pool” consisting of multiple mortgage loans. The pool is assigned a CUSIP number and
undivided interests in the pool are traded and sold as pass-through securities. The holder of the security is entitled to a pro rata share of principal and interest payments (including unscheduled prepayments) from the pool of mortgage
loans.</font></div> <div>An investment in a specific pool of
mortgage pass-through securities requires an analysis of the specific prepayment risk of mortgages within the covered pool (since mortgagors typically have the option to prepay their loans). The level of prepayments on a pool of MBS is difficult to
predict and can impact the subsequent cash flows, value and yield of the mortgage pool. In addition, when trading specific mortgage pools, precise execution, delivery and settlement arrangements must be negotiated for each transaction.</div>
<div>To-Be-Announced Securities<font>. A
Fund may seek to gain exposure to U.S. agency mortgage pass-through securities by investing in TBA securities. “TBAs” refer to a commonly used mechanism for the forward settlement of U.S. agency MBS, and not to a separate type of MBS.
Most transactions in fixed-rate MBS occur through the use of TBA transactions. TBA transactions generally are conducted in accordance with widely-accepted guidelines which establish commonly observed terms and conditions for execution, settlement,
and delivery. In a TBA transaction, the buyer and seller decide on general trade parameters, such as the issuing agency, settlement date, par amount, and price. The actual mortgage pools delivered generally are determined two days prior to
settlement date. Certain of the Funds may regularly enter into TBA agreements and “roll over” such agreements prior to the settlement date stipulated in such agreements. This type of TBA transaction is sometimes known as a “TBA
roll.” In a TBA roll, such Funds generally will sell the obligation to purchase the pools stipulated in the TBA agreement prior to the stipulated settlement date and will enter into a new TBA agreement for future delivery of pools of MBS. In
addition, certain of the Funds may enter into TBA agreements and settle such transactions on the stipulated settlement date by accepting actual receipt or delivery of the pools of MBS stipulated in the TBA agreement.</font></div>
<div>Certain of the Funds may invest cash pending settlement of TBA
transactions in money market instruments, repurchase agreements, or other high quality, liquid short-term instruments, including money market funds advised by BFA. Each such Fund will pay its <font>pro rata</font> share of
fees and expenses of any money market fund that it may invest in, in addition to such Fund’s own fees and expenses.</div>
<div>Collateralized Mortgage Obligations<font>. U.S. agency MBS may also be structured in the form of CMOs. CMOs are created by dividing the principal and interest payments collected on a pool of mortgages into several revenue streams (“tranches”) with
different priority rights to portions of the underlying mortgage payments. Certain CMO tranches may represent a right to receive interest only, principal only, or an amount that remains after floating-rate tranches are paid (an “inverse
floater”). These securities are frequently referred to as “mortgage derivatives” and may be extremely sensitive to changes in interest rates. Interest rates on inverse floaters, for example, vary inversely with a short-term
floating rate (which may be reset periodically). Interest rates on inverse floaters will decrease when short-term rates increase and will increase when short-term rates decrease. These securities have the effect of providing a degree of investment
leverage. In response to changes in market interest rates or other market conditions, the value of an inverse floater may increase or decrease at a multiple of the increase or decrease in the value of the underlying securities. If a Fund invests in
CMO tranches issued by U.S. government agencies or sponsored entities and interest rates move in a manner not anticipated by Fund management, it is possible that such a Fund could lose all or substantially all of its investment. Certain CMOs in
which certain of the Funds may invest may also provide a degree of investment leverage, which could cause such a Fund to lose all or substantially all of its investment.</font></div>
<div>U.S. Government Obligations.
<font> Certain of the Funds may invest in various types of U.S. government obligations. U.S. government obligations are a type of bond and include securities issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the
U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities. Payment of principal and interest on U.S. government obligations (i) may be</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

and credit of the U.S. or (ii) may be backed solely by the issuing or guaranteeing agency or instrumentality itself (as with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Federal Home Loan Bank notes). In the latter case, each Fund must look principally to the agency
or instrumentality issuing or guaranteeing the obligation for ultimate repayment, which agency or instrumentality may be privately owned. There can be no assurance that the U.S. government would provide financial support to its agencies or
instrumentalities where it is not obligated to do so. As a general matter, the value of debt instruments, including U.S. government obligations, declines when market interest rates increase and rises when market interest rates decrease. Certain
types of U.S. government obligations are subject to fluctuations in yield or value due to their structure or contract terms.</div>
<div>Some government agencies, including Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac, purchase and guarantee residential mortgages and form MBS that they issue to the market. These agencies also hold their own MBS as well as those of other institutions with funding from the agency debentures they issue.</div>
<div>U.S.-Registered and Restricted Securities of Non-U.S. Issuers.<font>  The Funds (other than the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF, iShares 25+ Year Treasury STRIPS Bond ETF, iShares Agency Bond ETF, iShares MBS ETF, Municipal Bond Funds and Treasury Bond Funds) may invest in
U.S.-registered, U.S. dollar-denominated bonds of non-U.S. governments, agencies, supranational entities and corporate issuers. The iShares 1-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares 5-10 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares

Corporate Bond ETF, iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, iShares Intermediate Government/Credit Bond ETF and iShares Investment Grade Bond Factor ETF may invest in Restricted Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers. Investing in
U.S.-registered, U.S. dollar-denominated bonds or Restricted Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers involves some risks and considerations not typically associated with investing in U.S. issuers. These include differences in accounting, auditing and
financial reporting standards; the possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation; adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations; political instability, which could affect U.S. investments in foreign countries; and potential
restrictions of the flow of international capital. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject to less governmental regulation than U.S. issuers. In addition, the risk that the issuer may fail to meet its obligations on these securities may be affected by
fluctuations in non-U.S. currency exchange rates between the issuer's local currency and the U.S. dollar. Moreover, individual non-U.S. economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy in such respects as growth of gross domestic
product (“GDP”), rate of inflation, capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency and balance of payment positions.</font></div>
<div>Future Developments.<font>  The
Board may, in the future, authorize each Fund to invest in securities contracts and investments other than those listed in this SAI and in the applicable Prospectus, provided they are consistent with each Fund's investment objective and do not
violate any investment restrictions or policies.</font></div>
<div>General Considerations and Risks</div>
<div>A discussion of some of the principal risks associated with an
investment in a Fund is contained in each Fund's Prospectus. An investment in a Fund should be made with an understanding that the value of the Fund’s portfolio securities may fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of
the issuers of the portfolio securities, the value of bonds in general, and other factors that affect the market. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor.</div>
<div>Borrowing Risk.
<font> Borrowing may exaggerate changes in the NAV of Fund shares and in the return on a Fund’s portfolio. Borrowing will cause a Fund to incur interest expense and other fees. The costs of borrowing may reduce
a Fund’s return. Borrowing may cause a Fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations.</font></div>
<div>Call Risk. <font> During
periods of falling interest rates, an issuer of a callable bond held by certain Funds may “call” or repay the security before its stated maturity, and a Fund may have to reinvest the proceeds in securities with lower yields, which would
result in a decline in the Fund's income, or in securities with greater risks or with other less favorable features.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Custody Risk.
<font> Custody risk refers to the risks inherent in the process of clearing and settling trades and to the holding of securities, cash and other assets by local banks, agents and depositories. Low trading volumes and
volatile prices in less developed markets make trades harder to complete and settle, and governments or trade groups may compel local agents to hold securities in designated depositories that may not be subject to independent evaluation. Local
agents are held only to the standards of care of their local markets, and thus may be subject to limited or no government oversight. Communications between the U.S. and emerging market countries may be unreliable, increasing the risk of delayed
settlements or losses of security certificates. In general, the less developed a country’s securities market is, the greater the likelihood of custody problems. Practices in relation to the settlement of securities transactions in emerging
markets involve higher risks than those in developed markets, in part because of the use of brokers and counterparties that are often less well capitalized, and custody and registration of assets in some countries may be unreliable. The possibility
of fraud, negligence or undue influence being exerted by the issuer or refusal to recognize ownership exists in some emerging markets, and, along with other factors, could result in ownership registration being lost. In addition, the laws of certain
countries may put limits on a Fund’s ability to recover its assets if a foreign bank or depository or issuer of a security or an agent of any of the foregoing goes bankrupt. A Fund would absorb any loss resulting from such custody problems and
may have no successful claim for compensation.</font></div>
<div>Extension Risk. <font> During
periods of rising interest rates, certain debt obligations may be paid off substantially more slowly than originally anticipated and the value of those securities may fall sharply, resulting in a decline in a Fund’s income and potentially in
the value of a Fund’s investments.</font></div> <div>Illiquid
Investments Risk.<font>  Each Fund may invest up to an aggregate amount of 15% of its net assets in illiquid investments. An illiquid investment is any investment that a Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or
disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less without significantly changing the market value of the investment. The liquidity of an investment will be determined based on relevant market, trading and investment specific
considerations as set out in the Liquidity Program as required by the Liquidity Rule. Illiquid investments may trade at a discount to comparable, more liquid investments and a Fund may not be able to dispose of illiquid investments in a timely
fashion or at their expected prices. If illiquid investments exceed 15% of a Fund’s net assets, the Liquidity Rule and the Liquidity Program will require that certain remedial actions be taken.</font></div>
<div>Issuer Insolvency Risk.<font>
 Each Fund's potential exposure to financially or operationally troubled issuers involves a high degree of credit and market risk, which may be heightened during an economic downturn or recession. Should an issuer of securities held by a Fund
become involved in a bankruptcy proceeding, reorganization or financial restructuring, a wide variety of considerations make an evaluation of the outcome of a Fund’s exposure to the issuer uncertain.</font></div>
<div>During the period of a bankruptcy proceeding, reorganization
or financial restructuring, it is unlikely that each Fund will receive any interest payments on the securities of the issuer. Each Fund will be subject to significant uncertainty as to whether the reorganization or restructuring will be completed,
and each Fund may bear certain extraordinary expenses to protect and recover its investment. Each Fund will also be subject to significant uncertainty as to when and in what manner and for what value the obligations evidenced by the securities of
the issuer held by a Fund will eventually be satisfied. Even if a plan of reorganization or restructuring is adopted with respect to the securities of the issuer held by each Fund, there can be no assurance that the securities or other assets
received by a Fund in connection with such plan of reorganization or restructuring will not have a lower value or income potential than may have been anticipated or no value. A Fund may be unable to enforce its claims or rights in any collateral or
may have its claims or security interest in any collateral challenged, disallowed or subordinated to the claims or security interests of other creditors. In addition, amendments to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or other relevant laws could alter the
expected outcome or introduce greater uncertainty regarding the outcome of each Fund's securities holdings in the issuer. In a bankruptcy proceeding, a reorganization or restructuring, the securities of the issuer held by a Fund could be
re-characterized or each Fund may receive different securities or other assets, including equity securities. These types of equity securities include, but are not limited to: common stock; preferred stock (including convertible preferred stock);
bonds, notes and debentures convertible into common or preferred stock; stock purchase warrants and rights; equity interests in trusts; and depositary receipts. Equity securities are subject to changes in value, and their value may be more volatile
than those of other asset classes. Holders of equity securities are subject to more risk than holders of debt securities because the status of equity holders is subordinate to debtholders in an issuer's capital structure. The value of equity
securities received by each Fund could decline if the financial condition of the issuer deteriorates or if overall market and economic conditions, or conditions within the issuer’s region or industry, deteriorate. Equity securities received by
a Fund through a bankruptcy proceeding, reorganization or restructuring of an issuer would not be component securities of a Fund’s Underlying Index, which could subject a Fund to additional tracking error risk.</div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>To the
extent that a Fund receives other assets in connection with a bankruptcy proceeding, reorganization or financial restructuring, a Fund may also be subject to additional risks associated with the assets received. One example of assets that a Fund
could receive is an interest in one or more loans made to the issuer as part of a workout agreed to by a consortium of lienholders and creditors of the issuer. A Fund may receive such interests in loans to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act.</div>
<div>Securities or other assets received in a reorganization or
restructuring typically entail a higher degree of risk than investments in securities of issuers that have not undergone a reorganization or restructuring and may be subject to heavy selling or downward pricing pressure after completion of the
reorganization or restructuring. The post-reorganization/restructuring assets and securities may also be illiquid and difficult to sell or value. If a Fund participates in negotiations with respect to a plan of reorganization or restructuring with
respect to securities of the issuer held by a Fund, each Fund also may be restricted from disposing such securities for a period of time. If a Fund becomes involved in such proceedings, each Fund may have more active participation in the affairs of
the issuer than that assumed generally by an investor.</div>
<div>LIBOR Risk. <font> A Fund may
be exposed to financial instruments that are tied to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) to determine payment obligations, financing terms, hedging strategies or investment value. A Fund’s investments may pay interest at
floating rates based on LIBOR or may be subject to interest caps or floors based on LIBOR. A Fund may also obtain financing at floating rates based on LIBOR. Derivative instruments utilized by a Fund may also reference LIBOR.</font></div>
<div>LIBOR Replacement Risk.
<font> In 2017, the head of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority announced a desire to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. On March 5, 2021, the administrator of LIBOR, ICE Benchmark
Administration Limited, announced its intention to cease publishing two USD LIBOR settings immediately after publication on December 31, 2021, with the majority of the USD LIBOR settings to end immediately after publication on June 30, 2023. A Fund
may have investments linked to other interbank offered rates, such as the Euro Overnight Index Average (“EONIA”), which may also cease to be published. Various financial industry groups have begun planning for the transition away from
LIBOR, but there are challenges to converting certain securities and transactions to a new reference rate, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), which is intended to replace USD LIBOR.</font></div>
<div>In June 2017, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, which
includes various private-market participants working with the Federal Reserve, announced its selection of the new SOFR, which is intended to be a broad measure of secured overnight U.S. Treasury repo rates, as its recommendation for an appropriate
replacement for USD LIBOR. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing SOFR in 2018, and it has been used increasingly on a voluntary basis in new instruments and transactions. At times, SOFR has proven to be more volatile than the 3-month
USD LIBOR. Working groups and regulators in other countries have suggested other alternatives for their markets, including the Sterling Overnight Interbank Average Rate (“SONIA”) in England.</div>
<div>Neither the effect of the LIBOR transition process nor its
ultimate success can yet be known. The transition process might lead to increased volatility and illiquidity in markets for, and reduce the effectiveness of, new hedges placed against, instruments whose terms currently include LIBOR. While some
existing LIBOR-based instruments may contemplate a scenario where LIBOR is no longer available by providing for an alternative rate-setting methodology, there may be significant uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of any such alternative
methodologies to replicate LIBOR. Not all existing LIBOR-based instruments may have alternative rate-setting provisions and there remains uncertainty regarding the willingness and ability of issuers to add alternative rate-setting provisions in
certain existing instruments. In addition, a liquid market for newly-issued instruments that use a reference rate other than LIBOR still may be developing. Instruments with fallback provisions (<font>i.e.</font>,
contractual provisions specifying the trigger events for a transition to a replacement rate) to facilitate the transition from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate may also include adjustments that do not adequately compensate the holder for the
different characteristics of the alternative reference rate. As a result, the fallback provision causes a value transfer from one party to the instrument to the counterparty. Because the usefulness of LIBOR as a benchmark could decline during the
transition period, these and related adverse effects could occur prior to the end of 2021 with respect to certain LIBOR settings or mid-2023 for the remaining LIBOR settings. There may also be challenges for a Fund to enter into hedging transactions
against such newly-issued instruments until a market for such hedging transactions develops. The effect of any changes to, or discontinuation of, LIBOR on a Fund will vary based on, among other things, (1) existing fallback or termination provisions
in individual contracts and the potential renegotiation of existing contracts and (2) whether, how, and when industry participants develop and adopt new reference rates and fallbacks for both legacy and new products and instruments. A Fund's
investments may also be tied to other interbank offered rates and currencies, which may face similar issues. In many cases, if an instrument falls back to an alternative reference rate, including SOFR, the alternative reference rate will not perform
the same as LIBOR because the alternative reference rate does not include a credit-sensitive component</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>in the rate calculation.
Alternative reference rates generally reflect the performance of the market for U.S. Treasury securities, which are secured by the U.S. Treasury, and not the interbank lending markets. Therefore, in the event of a credit crisis, floating rate
instruments using certain alternative reference rates could perform differently than those instruments using a rate indexed to the interbank lending market. In addition, pending legislation may affect the transition of LIBOR-based instruments by
permitting trustees and calculation agents to transition instruments with no LIBOR transition language to an alternative reference rate selected by such agents. These legislative proposals include safe harbors from liability, meaning that a Fund may
have limited recourse if the alternative reference rate does not fully compensate a Fund for the transition of an instrument from LIBOR. It is unclear whether such legislative proposals will be signed into law. All of the aforementioned may
adversely affect a Fund’s performance or NAV.</div>
<div>Municipal Market Disruption Risk. <font> The value of municipal securities may be affected by uncertainties in the municipal market related to legislation or litigation involving the taxation of municipal securities or the rights of municipal securities
holders in the event of a bankruptcy. Proposals to restrict or eliminate the U.S. federal income tax exemption for interest on municipal securities are introduced before the U.S. Congress from time to time. Proposals also may be introduced before
state legislatures that would affect the state tax treatment of a municipal fund’s distributions. If such proposals were enacted, the availability of municipal securities and the value of a Municipal Bond Fund’s holdings would be
affected, and the Trustees would reevaluate the Fund’s investment objective and policies. Municipal bankruptcies are relatively rare, and certain provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code governing such bankruptcies are unclear and remain
untested. Further, the application of state law to municipal issuers could produce varying results among the states or among municipal securities issuers within a state. These legal uncertainties could affect the municipal securities market
generally, certain specific segments of the market, or the relative credit quality of particular securities. Any of these effects could have a significant impact on the prices of some or all of the municipal securities held by a Municipal Bond
Fund.</font></div> <div>Operational Risk.<font>  BFA and a Fund's other service providers may experience disruptions or operating errors such as processing errors or human errors, inadequate or failed internal or external processes, or systems or technology
failures, that could negatively impact the Funds. While service providers are required to have appropriate operational risk management policies and procedures, their methods of operational risk management may differ from a Fund’s in the
setting of priorities, the personnel and resources available or the effectiveness of relevant controls. BFA, through its monitoring and oversight of service providers, seeks to ensure that service providers take appropriate precautions to avoid and
mitigate risks that could lead to disruptions and operating errors. However, it is not possible for BFA or the other Fund service providers to identify all of the operational risks that may affect a Fund or to develop processes and controls to
completely eliminate or mitigate their occurrence or effects.</font></div>
<div>Prepayment Risk. <font> During
periods of falling interest rates, issuers of certain debt obligations may repay principal prior to the security’s maturity, which may cause a Fund to have to reinvest in securities with lower yields or higher risk of default, resulting in a
decline in the Fund’s income or return potential. Also, if a security subject to prepayment had been purchased at a premium, the value of the premium would be lost in the event of prepayment.</font></div>
<div>Repurchase Agreement Risk.
<font> A repurchase agreement is an instrument under which the purchaser (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, a Fund) acquires a security and the
seller agrees, at the time of the sale, to repurchase the security at a mutually agreed upon time and price. Repurchase agreements may be construed to be collateralized loans by the purchaser to the seller secured by the securities transferred to
the purchaser. If a repurchase agreement is construed to be a collateralized loan, the underlying securities will not be considered to be owned by a Fund but only to constitute collateral for the seller’s obligation to pay the repurchase
price. If the seller defaults on its obligation under the agreement, a Fund may suffer delays and incur costs or lose money in exercising its rights under the agreement. If the seller fails to repurchase the security and the market value of the
security declines, a Fund may lose money.</font></div> <div>Risk of
Derivatives. <font> A derivative is a financial contract, the value of which depends on, or is derived from, the value of an underlying asset, such as a security, a commodity (such as gold or silver), a currency or
an index (a measure of value or rates, such as the S&amp;P 500 or the prime lending rate). Each Fund may invest in variable rate demand notes and obligations, and tender option bonds, which may be considered derivatives. Compared to securities,
derivatives can be more sensitive to changes in interest rates or to sudden fluctuations in market prices and thus a Fund's losses may be greater if it invests in derivatives than if it invests only in conventional securities. Derivatives are also
subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligations. Derivatives generally involve the incurrence of</font></div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>leverage. To address such
leverage and to prevent a Fund from being deemed to have issued senior securities as a result of an investment in derivatives, such Fund will segregate liquid assets equal to its obligations under the derivatives throughout the life of the
investment.</div> <div>When a derivative is used as a hedge against
a position that a Fund holds or is committed to purchase, any loss generated by the derivative generally should be substantially offset by gains on the hedged investment, and vice versa. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also
reduce or eliminate gains, and in some cases, hedging can cause losses that are not offset by gains, and the Fund will recognize losses on both the investment and the hedge. Hedges are sometimes subject to imperfect matching between the derivative
and the underlying security, and there can be no assurance that a Fund’s hedging transactions, which entail additional transaction costs, will be effective.</div>
<div>Risk of Futures and Options on Futures Transactions.<font>  There are several risks accompanying the utilization of futures contracts and options on futures contracts. A position in futures contracts and options on futures contracts may be closed only on the exchange on
which the contract was made (or a linked exchange). While each Fund plans to utilize futures contracts only if an active market exists for such contracts, there is no guarantee that a liquid market will exist for the contract at a specified time.
Furthermore, because, by definition, futures contracts project price levels in the future and not current levels of valuation, market circumstances may result in a discrepancy between the price of the bond index future and the movement in the
relevant Underlying Index. In the event of adverse price movements, a Fund would continue to be required to make daily cash payments to maintain its required margin. In such situations, if a Fund has insufficient cash, it may have to sell portfolio
securities to meet daily margin requirements at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. In addition, a Fund may be required to deliver the instruments underlying the futures contracts it has sold.</font></div>
<div>The risk of loss in trading futures contracts or uncovered
call options in some strategies (<font>e.g.</font>, selling uncovered bond index futures contracts) is potentially unlimited. Each Fund does not plan to use futures and options contracts in this way. The risk of a futures
position may still be large as traditionally measured due to the low margin deposits required. In many cases, a relatively small price movement in a futures contract may result in immediate and substantial loss or gain to the investor relative to
the size of a required margin deposit. Each Fund, however, intends to utilize futures and options contracts in a manner designed to limit its risk exposure to levels comparable to a direct investment in the types of bonds in which it invests.</div>
<div>Utilization of futures and options on futures by a Fund
involves the risk of imperfect or even negative correlation to its Underlying Index if the index underlying the futures contract differs from the Underlying Index. There is also the risk of loss by a Fund of margin deposits in the event of
bankruptcy of a broker with whom a Fund has an open position in the futures contract or option. The purchase of put or call options will be based upon predictions by BFA as to anticipated trends, which predictions could prove to be incorrect.</div>
<div>Because the futures market generally imposes less burdensome
margin requirements than the securities market, an increased amount of participation by speculators in the futures market could result in price fluctuations. Certain financial futures exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures
contract prices during a single trading day. The daily limit establishes the maximum amount by which the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day's settlement price at the end of a trading session. Once the daily
limit has been reached in a particular type of contract, no trades may be made on that day at a price beyond that limit. It is possible that futures contract prices could move to the daily limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no
trading, thereby preventing prompt liquidation of futures positions and subjecting each Fund to substantial losses. In the event of adverse price movements, each Fund would be required to make daily cash payments of variation margin.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Non-U.S. Agency Debt Securities. <font> Uncollateralized bonds issued by agencies, subdivisions or instrumentalities of foreign governments are generally backed only by the creditworthiness and reputation of the entities issuing the bonds and may not be
backed by the full faith and credit of the foreign government. Moreover, a foreign government that explicitly provides its full faith and credit to a particular entity may be, due to changed circumstances, unable or unwilling to actually provide
that support. If a non-U.S. agency is unable to meet its obligations, the performance of a Fund will be adversely impacted. A non-U.S. agency’s operations and financial condition are influenced by the foreign government’s economic and
other policies. Changes to the financial condition or credit rating of a foreign government may cause the value of debt issued by that particular foreign government’s agencies, subdivisions or instrumentalities to decline. During periods of
economic uncertainty, the trading of non-U.S. agency bonds may be less liquid while market prices may be</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

of U.S. agency bonds. Additional risks associated with non-U.S. agency investing include differences in accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards, adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations, political instability,
which could affect U.S. investments in foreign countries and cause restrictions on the flow of international capital.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Non-U.S. Debt Securities. <font> Non-U.S. debt securities are traded on foreign exchanges and OTC in the respective countries covered by a Fund. The risks of investing in non-U.S. debt securities typically include market fluctuations caused by
such factors as economic and political developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in bond prices. Investing in a fund whose portfolio contains securities of non-U.S. issuers involves certain risks and considerations not typically
associated with investing in the securities of U.S. issuers. These risks include securities markets that may lack sufficient liquidity or may be less efficient; generally greater price volatility; less publicly available information about issuers;
the imposition of withholding or other taxes; the imposition of restrictions on the expatriation of funds or other assets of a Fund; higher transaction and custody costs; delays and risks attendant in settlement procedures; difficulties in enforcing
contractual obligations; lower liquidity and significantly smaller market capitalization of most non-U.S. securities markets; different accounting and disclosure standards; lower levels of regulation of the securities markets; more substantial
government interference with the economy; higher rates of inflation; greater social, economic, and political uncertainty; the risk of nationalization or expropriation of assets; and different bankruptcy and insolvency regimes which may stay or
prevent recovery in the event of an issuer’s default.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Swap Agreements.<font>
 The risk of loss with respect to swaps is generally limited to the net amount of payments that a Fund is contractually obligated to make. Swap agreements are subject to the risk that the swap counterparty will default on its obligations. If
such a default occurs, a Fund will have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the transaction. However, such remedies may be subject to bankruptcy and insolvency laws, which could affect such Fund’s rights as a creditor
(</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, a Fund may not receive the net amount of payments that it is contractually entitled to receive).</font></div>
<div>A Fund is required to post and collect variation margin
(comprised of specified liquid securities subject to haircuts) in connection with trading of OTC swaps. Initial margin requirements are in the process of being phased in, and a Fund may be subject to such requirements as early as September 2021.
These requirements may raise the costs for a Fund’s investment in swaps.</div>
<div>Securities Lending Risk.
<font> A Fund may engage in securities lending. Securities lending involves the risk that a Fund may lose money because the borrower of the loaned securities fails to return the securities in a timely manner or at
all. A Fund could also lose money in the event of a decline in the value of collateral provided for loaned securities or a decline in the value of any investments made with cash collateral. These events could also trigger adverse tax consequences
for a Fund.</font></div> <div>Special Considerations Regarding
Investments in California Municipal Securities</div> <div>Following
is a brief summary of some of the factors that may affect the financial condition of the State of California (referred to herein as the “State” or “California”) and its political subdivisions. The summary is neither a
complete nor a comprehensive description of these factors nor an analysis of financial conditions and may not be indicative of the financial condition of issuers of obligations or any particular projects financed with the proceeds of such
obligations. Many factors not included in the summary, such as the ongoing and evolving economic and health-related impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the State, local and national economies, the uncertain impact of federal and State financial
assistance available to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in federal policies related to trade, health care and immigration, social and environmental policies and conditions, the national and international markets for products
produced in California, developments in municipal bankruptcies and significant unfunded pension liabilities, could have an adverse impact on the financial condition of California and its political subdivisions. The Fund is unable to predict whether
or to what extent such factors or other factors may affect the issuers of the municipal securities, the market value or marketability of the municipal securities or the ability of the respective issuers of the municipal securities acquired by the
Fund to pay interest on or principal of the municipal securities.</div>
<div>The Fund invests a high proportion of its assets in California
municipal securities. The payment of interest on and preservation of principal in these securities are dependent upon the continuing ability of California issuers and/or obligors of state, municipal and public authority debt obligations to meet
their obligations thereunder. In addition to general economic pressures, certain California constitutional amendments, legislative measures, executive orders, administrative regulations and voter initiatives could adversely affect a California
issuer’s ability to raise revenues to meet its financial obligations.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Overview; COVID-19 Pandemic</div>
<div>The State’s fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on
June 30 of the following year. The annual State budget is proposed by the Governor by January 10 of each year for the next fiscal year (the “Governor’s Budget”). The Governor submitted his initial budget proposal for fiscal year
2021-22 on January 8, 2021 (the “2021-22 Governor’s Budget”). State law also requires the Governor to update the Governor’s Budget projections and budgetary proposals by May 14 of each year. The Governor released his May
Revision to the 2021-22 Governor’s Budget on May 14, 2021 (the “May Revision”). The Governor is required to sign the budget by the start of the fiscal year on July 1. The LAO releases analysis of the Governor’s various budget
proposals throughout the year.</div> <div><font>COVID-19 Pandemic</font><font>-</font><font>General Impact</font><font>. The outbreak of COVID-19,
a new strain of coronavirus that can result in severe respiratory disease, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (the “COVID-19 pandemic”) in March 2020. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the State, like other
state and local government authorities, implemented, and revised from time to time, restrictions on mass gatherings that resulted in widespread closings and modifications of businesses, universities and schools. The severe drop in economic activity
in spring 2020 caused by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a recession that ended the nation’s record-long economic expansion in February 2020. These efforts initially resulted in declines in State and local revenues from recent levels, as
well as increased expenditures by the State and local governments required to manage and mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact. The State and the State Treasury General Fund (the “General Fund”), as well as local governments
throughout the State, were initially adversely impacted by the health-related and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted large sectors of the State economy and remains a risk to the State’s finances as well as the finances
of local governments.</font></div> <div>The COVID-19 pandemic had
an immediate impact on the State’s unemployment rate; however, the impact has lessened since the early days of the pandemic. California’s unemployment rate improved to 8.3% in March 2021, down from a high of 16% in April 2020, which was
higher than the highest rate of unemployment during the last national recession (the “Great Recession”) of 12.3% in the fourth quarter of 2010. The COVID-19 pandemic also exacerbated underemployment in the State, which averaged 17.1% in
2020, over twice as high as the 2019 annual average rate of 8.3%. The labor force participation rate in the State normally stays fairly constant. However, during this recession, the percentage of the working age population in the State labor force
decreased from 62.3% in the first quarter of 2020 to 59.8% in the second quarter. However, as noted above, as of March 2021, the State’s unemployment rate had dropped to 8.3%, which was 2.3% higher than the national unemployment rate of
6.0%.</div> <div>The high unemployment rates increased expenditures
for unemployment benefits. Although unemployment insurance benefits are primarily supported by federal funding and employer taxes, the State expects to continue to borrow from the federal government to pay its share of unemployment benefits. The
State’s unemployment fund deficit funded through federal loans was $21.5 billion as of the end of calendar year 2020; in April 2021, the State projected the deficit would grow to $48.3 billion by the end of calendar year 2021. This would
surpass the amount of borrowing during the Great Recession when the State owed $11 billion at its highest point and paid $1.4 billion in interest. This amount was not repaid until 2018.</div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>However, repayment of the
principal of this federal loan to cover the unemployment fund deficit is an employer responsibility and not a liability of the State’s General Fund.</div>
<div>The immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the
State’s economy was profound. However, since the release of the 2020-21 Budget in June 2020, the economic outlook and revenue forecast for the State have improved dramatically relative to the 2020-21 Budget projections. General Fund revenue is
higher than 2020-21 Budget projections by nearly $71 billion from fiscal year 2019-20 through fiscal year 2021-22. In the 2020-21 Budget, the State projected a drop in overall General Fund revenues and transfers to $137.7 billion from the $153.4
billion originally projected for fiscal year 2020-21 in the 2020-21 Governor’s Budget in January 2020. However, the May Revision included a revenue estimate of $187.0 billion for fiscal year 2020-21, which is higher than the projections for
the fiscal year made in the 2020-21 Governor’s Budget prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and an increase of $49.3 billion from the projections in the 2020-21 Budget. Compared to a projected budget deficit of $54 billion at the time of the 2020-21
Budget, as of the May Revision, the State is projecting a $75.7 billion surplus that does not include over $25 billion in available federal relief. See “Recent Financial Results” below. Overall, the May Revision noted that the State and
its economy will benefit from over $600 billion provided through the six federal COVID-19 relief bills, including approximately $276 billion of funding provided to or through the State and approximately $337 billion provided in direct payments to
individuals, families, colleges, businesses and local governments.</div>
<div>The May Revision does not project any structural deficits;
however, it does caution that risks to the economic forecast remain, including new coronavirus variants, vaccine hesitancy, higher inflation if disrupted supply chains cannot support increased consumer demand and a stock market decline that would
impact State revenues. Furthermore, the May Revision projects that the appropriations limit for the State for fiscal years 2020-21 and 2021-22 will be exceeded by $16.2 billion. Any funds above this limit are constitutionally required to be
allocated evenly between schools and a tax refund. See “Appropriations Limits.” This would be only the second time the State has exceeded the appropriations limit since its passage in 1979. This estimate will continue to be revised until
May 2023; however, the May Revision allocates $16.2 billion to comply with the limit, including tax refunds and additional allocations to K-12 public schools and community college districts (collectively, “K-14 schools”). Multi-year
economic projections do not assume additional payments for exceeding the appropriations limit in future years due to the variability of calculating the appropriations limit in future years.</div>
<div>The May Revision also included a forecast for the largest
three sources (personal income tax, sales tax and corporation tax) of General Fund revenues from fiscal year 2019-20 through fiscal year 2024-25. Development of the forecast for the major General Fund revenues begins with a forecast of national
economic activity prepared by an independent economic forecasting firm. After finalizing the forecasts of major national and California economic indicators, revenue estimates are generated using revenue forecasting models developed and maintained by
the State Department of Finance. With each forecast, adjustments are made for any legislative, judicial, or administrative changes, as well as for recent cash flow results. The economic forecast reflects economic growth after 2020 with real GDP
averaging 2.8% through 2024. The forecasts included in the 2021-22 Governor’s Budget were revised in the May Revision to account for the effects of the faster-than-expected deployment of COVID-19 vaccines and the late December federal COVID-19
relief bill as well as any other federal legislation passed prior to the May Revision economic forecast, which is generally completed in April.</div>
<div>The long-term General Fund revenue forecast table below shows
the State’s forecast for its main General Fund revenue sources as of the May Revision for fiscal years 2019-20 through 2024-25. Total General Fund revenues from these largest three sources are expected to rise steadily from $139.1 billion in
fiscal year 2019-20 to $181.3 billion in fiscal year 2024-25. Generally, these three sources constitute over 90% of all General Fund revenues. See also, “Recent Financial Results” below.</div>

personal income tax forecast has been significantly upgraded since the forecast included in the 2020-21 Budget due to a more optimistic economic outlook, but particularly wages, proprietorship income and capital gains. The personal income tax is the
State’s largest revenue source and is expected to comprise 70% of all General Fund revenues in fiscal year 2021-22. From fiscal year 2019-20 through 2024-25, annual growth in personal income tax revenue is projected to be around 6%. In
comparison, personal income tax revenue fell by 3.3% during the Great Recession (from “peak to trough”). The forecast assumes that there will not be a significant change in migration patterns between California and other states with net
outflows continuing. As described herein, the State has a very progressive income tax structure with the top one% of taxpayers generally paying more than 40% of all personal income tax. See “Recent Financial Results.” Starting in 2018,
net domestic out-migration began to outpace net international immigration, leaving natural increases as the only source of population growth, which declined with slowing births and increased deaths in calendar year 2020. However, the State projects
that positive population growth will resume in 2022.</div> <div>The
severity of the COVID-19 pandemic’s effects on taxable spending and sales tax revenues has also been smaller than expected due in part to a shift in spending from services to goods, which are more likely to have sales tax levied on them than
services. The State has also benefitted from legislation passed in the wake of the <font>South Dakota vs. Wayfair, Inc.</font> case, which has allowed the State to capture taxes on sales that have shifted online due to the
COVID-19 pandemic. Increases in revenue forecasts for corporation tax as compared to the 2020-21 Budget reflect an improved forecast for C-corporation profits as large businesses that pay the significant majority of the state corporate taxes have,
in large part, been able to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic.</div>
<div><font>Financial Condition
of the State General Fund</font><font>. The State entered fiscal year 2020-21 with a General Fund positive cash balance at June 30, 2020 of $5.7 billion, which included an outstanding internal loan balance of $20 billion.
The State’s cash flow for fiscal year 2019-20 indicated that internal resources were sufficient and available to meet the normal peaks and valleys of the State’s cash needs, while maintaining a cushion of at least $2.5 billion at all
times. The State did not issue any revenue anticipation notes in fiscal year 2019-20, the fifth consecutive year in which external borrowing was not required. In April 2021, the State disclosed that the 2021-22 Governor’s Budget cash flow
projections show an estimated cash cushion of unused internal borrowable resources of at least $26 billion at the end of each month through the end of fiscal year 2020-21 and through fiscal year 2021-22. Due to the unprecedented nature of the
COVID-19 pandemic, and the volatile and adverse impacts of COVID-19 on the global, national and State economies, there can be no assurances that actual results will not materially adversely vary from these projections. In the event that the State
does not have sufficient available cash and internal borrowable resources as a result of increased expenses and/or reduced revenues from the amounts assumed, the State can implement a variety of cash management tools. See “Cash
Management” below.</font></div> <div><font>Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Obligations of Local Governments</font><font>. Local governments in the State also initially experienced material adverse effects to their finances as a
result of COVID-19 pandemic effects on local revenue sources as well as temporarily reduced distributions from the State. However, after issuing negative views for all public finance sectors in April 2020, S&amp;P has now revised all public finance
sector views back to stable (with the exception of higher education (including community colleges and student housing)) and not-for-profit health care, which remain negative. A negative sector view indicates that there will likely be more negative
ratings actions in a sector than positive ratings actions. S&amp;P cited marked improvement in economic conditions as well as the receipt of federal stimulus money from the federal American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which was passed in March 2021 and
provides financial support for the operation of local governments and acts to offset revenue declines. See “Bond Ratings” and “Obligations of Other Issuers” herein.</font></div>
<div>While it is impossible to describe in detail the impact on
specific local bond issuances, the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to affect or impair the credit quality of a variety of local California issuances, including airport and port revenue bonds, toll road revenue bonds, bonds
supported by hotel or occupancy use taxes, sales tax revenue bonds,</div> </div> <div type="Block">

secured by incremental tax revenue, and bonds supported directly or indirectly by convention center, stadium or arena revenue depending on the specific effects on specific local governments. In addition, local governments that have general funds
largely supported by sales tax, hotel or occupancy taxes or similar revenues may continue to be affected. The ability of local governments to address any budget shortfalls are constrained by constitutional limitations, included limited taxing and
borrowing powers and balanced budget requirements, among other factors. Unfunded pension and other post-retirement liabilities also weigh heavily upon many local governments and have been the principal cause of several well-publicized municipal
bankruptcy filings.</div> <div>Economic Factors</div>
<div>California is by far the most populous state in the nation;
indeed, California is almost 40% larger than Texas, the second-ranked state, according to the most recent population estimates released by the United States Census Bureau. The January 2021 preliminary estimate of the State’s population is 39.5
million, which represents approximately 12% of the total United States population. California’s population decreased by 0.46% between January 2020 and January 2021, marking the first time the State has measured a 12-month population decline.
Three factors explain this 12-month drop in population: continuing declines in natural increase (births minus deaths); continuing declines in foreign immigration; and increased deaths in 2020 associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In long-term
projections, last updated in March 2021 and using data from 2019, the State’s population was projected to continue to grow over the long term and reach 44 million residents by 2060. See, however, “Other Factors – Federal
Census” below.</div> <div>California’s economy, the
largest among the 50 states, has major components in high technology, trade, entertainment, agriculture, manufacturing, government, tourism, construction and services. The relative proportion of the various components of the California economy
closely resembles the make-up of the national economy. California’s economy accounted for 14.8% of the U.S. gross domestic product (“GDP”) through the first three quarters of 2020. California remained the fifth largest economy in
the world in 2019, with a GDP of $3.1 trillion in current dollars. California’s real GDP contracted by a record 31.5% in the second quarter of 2020, after falling by 4.3% in the first quarter of 2020, and bringing it back to first quarter of
2017 levels. California real GDP then grew by 31.2% in the third quarter of 2020, bringing it to first quarter 2019 levels.</div>
<div>The expiration of temporary sales tax increases and increased
percentages diverted to local governments due to realignment have reduced the amount of sales tax available to the State’s General Fund. See “The State Budget — Proposition 30 and Proposition 55” and “Local Governments
— Realigning Services to Local Governments” below. Nevertheless, sales and use taxes remain a principal source of General Fund revenues. See “Recent Financial Results” below for a discussion of the percentage of State General
Fund revenues that are derived from sales and use taxes. Total taxable transactions for the State were estimated at $746 billion for 2019 by the State Department of Finance, an increase of 5.5% over the prior year. According to estimates in the May
Revision, taxable sales are expected to increase by 8.1% in 2020-21 and a further 5.7% in fiscal year 2021-22, resulting in increases in the sales tax forecast of $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2020-21 and $3.1 billion in fiscal year 2021-22. In the
2021-22 Governor’s Budget, taxable sales were expected to grow 4.1% in 2020-21 and decline by 0.8% in 2021-22.</div>
<div>In March 2021, the statewide median home price reached a
record high of $758,990, an increase of 30.9% from February 2020. Residential building permitting, which suffered a long, steady decline from calendar years 2005 through 2009, increased steadily, from 36,421 in 2009 (approximately $12 billion
valuation) to 116,000 on a seasonally-adjusted annualized rate in February 2021, down from 136,000 in January 2021 but above the 2020 average of 105,000 units. Multi-family units fell from 71,000 in January 2021 to 41,000 in February 2021 while
single-family units increased to 75,000 in February from 66,000 in January. The May Revision to the 2021-22 Governor’s Budget projects total permits for new construction to have declined by 4.7% to around 105,000 units in 2020, a smaller
decline than the drop of 4.9% in 2019, as long-term issues of permitting and housing supply constraints predate the recession. Permitted housing units are projected to increase by 10.2% to 116,000 units in 2021 and to reach 135,000 units by
2024.</div> <div>California continues to face a critical housing
shortage that has been decades in the making. However, the COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated the statewide housing shortage and impacted housing affordability. With fewer permits issued, the unprecedented increase in unemployment and potential
for subsequent evictions along with the reluctance of builders to build homes during an economic downturn have worsened the housing shortage. In April 2021, the State disclosed that given its structural housing supply constraints and shortage,
lower-income populations will be especially vulnerable to evictions. The State further disclosed that this may negatively impact the State as Californians will face</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>After slowing sharply in 2009, nonresidential construction in
the State had increased steadily from a total valuation of approximately $10.9 billion in 2009 to $33.6 billion in 2018 before dropping slightly to $31.4 billion in 2019. Preliminary estimates show a drop to a $22.1 billion valuation in 2020.</div>
<div>Constitutional Limitations on Taxes, Other Charges,
Appropriations and General Fund Revenues</div> <div>Over the years,
a number of constitutional amendments have been enacted, often through voter initiatives, that have increased the difficulty of raising State taxes or restricted the use of General Fund revenues. Some of the most significant of these approved
constitutional amendments are described below. Because of the complex nature of these initiatives and the ambiguities and possible inconsistencies in their terms, it is not possible to predict with certainty the impact on California debt obligations
or on the ability of the State or local governments to pay debt service on such California debt obligations. Further initiatives or legislative changes in laws or the California Constitution may also affect the ability of the State or local
governments to repay their obligations.</div> <div>Limitation on
Property Taxes.<font> Certain California debt obligations may be obligations of local government issuers that rely in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, on
</font><font>ad valorem</font><font> property taxes as a source of revenue. The taxing powers of California local governments are limited by Article XIIIA of the California
Constitution (“Article XIIIA”), enacted by the voters in 1978 and commonly known as “Proposition 13.” Briefly, Article XIIIA limits the rate of </font><font>ad valorem</font><font> property taxes to 1% of the full cash value of real property and generally restricts the reassessment of property to 2% per year, except upon new construction or change of ownership (subject to a
number of exemptions). Local government taxing entities, however, may raise </font><font>ad valorem</font><font> taxes above the 1% limit to pay debt service on voter-approved
bonded indebtedness. See “Obligations of Other Issuers” herein.</font></div>
<div>Under Article XIIIA, the basic 1% <font>ad valorem</font> tax levy is applied against the assessed value of property as of the owner’s date of acquisition (or as of March 1, 1975, if acquired earlier), subject to certain adjustments. This system has
resulted in widely varying amounts of tax on similarly situated properties. Several lawsuits were filed challenging the acquisition-based assessment system of Proposition 13, but it was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1992.</div>
<div>For further discussion on Proposition 13, see “Local
Governments — Constitutional and Statutory Limitations on Local Government” below. For further discussion on voter approval requirements under Article XIIIA, see “— Voter Requirements for Taxes and Fees” below.</div>
<div>Limitations on Other Taxes, Fees and Charges.<font> In 1996, the voters of the State approved Proposition 218, called the “Right to Vote on Taxes Act.” Proposition 218 added Article XIIIC (“Article XIIIC”) and Article XIIID
(“Article XIIID”) to the State Constitution, each of which contains a number of provisions affecting the ability of local governments to levy and collect both existing and future taxes, assessments, fees and charges.</font></div>
<div>Article XIIIC requires that all new or increased local taxes
be submitted to the voters before they become effective. Proposition 26, discussed below under the caption entitled “— Voter Requirements for Taxes and Fees,” amended Article XIIIC by adding an expansive definition of
“taxes” to include many regulatory fees currently imposed by the State and its municipalities. Taxes for general governmental purposes require a majority vote and taxes for specific purposes require a two-thirds vote.</div>
<div>Article XIIID contains several provisions making it generally
more difficult for local governments to levy and maintain “assessments” for municipal services and programs. Article XIIID also contains several provisions affecting “fees” and “charges,” defined for purposes of
Article XIIID to mean “any levy other than an <font>ad valorem</font> tax, a special tax, or an assessment, imposed by a local government upon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property ownership, including
a user fee or charge for a property related service.” All new and existing property-related fees and charges must conform to requirements prohibiting, among other things, fees and charges that generate revenues exceeding the funds that are
required to provide the property-related service or are used for unrelated purposes. Article XIIID imposes notice, hearing and protest procedures for levying or increasing property-related fees and charges, and, except for fees or charges for sewer,
water and refuse collection services (or fees for electrical and gas service, which are not treated as “property related” for purposes of Article XIIID), no property-related fee or charge may be imposed or increased without majority
approval by the</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>In addition to the provisions described above, Article XIIIC
removes limitations on the initiative power in matters of local taxes, assessments, fees and charges. Consequently, local voters, by future initiative, could repeal, reduce or prohibit the future imposition or increase of any local tax, assessment,
fee or charge. It is unclear how this right of local initiative may be used in cases where taxes or charges have been or will be specifically pledged to secure debt issues.</div>
<div>Limitations on the State’s Ability to Transfer Funds from
Local Governments.<font> In 2010, voters in the State approved Proposition 22, a constitutional initiative. Proposition 22, known as the “Local Taxpayer, Public Safety, and Transportation
Protection Act of 2010,” eliminated or reduced the State’s authority to (i) temporarily shift property taxes from cities, counties and special districts to schools, (ii) use vehicle license fee revenues to reimburse local governments for
State-mandated costs (i.e., the State will have to use other revenues to reimburse local governments), (iii) redirect property tax increment from redevelopment agencies (which have since been dissolved, see “Obligations of Other Issuers
— Tax Increment and the Dissolution of Redevelopment Agencies” below) to any other local government, (iv) use State fuel tax revenues to pay debt service on State transportation bonds, or (v) borrow or change the distribution of State
fuel tax revenues.</font></div> <div>Voter Requirements for Taxes and
Fees.<font> Proposition 26, known as the “Supermajority Vote to Pass New Taxes and Fees Act” was approved by State voters in 2010. Proposition 26 amended provisions of Article XIIIA and
Article XIIIC governing the imposition of taxes. Proposition 26 requires a two-thirds supermajority vote in the California State Legislature (the “State Legislature”) prior to the imposition of any change in State statute that results in
any taxpayer paying a higher tax. This requirement eliminated the prior practice that allowed, via majority vote, one tax to be increased if another tax is lowered by an equivalent amount. Furthermore, any increase in a fee beyond the amount needed
to provide the specific service or benefit is deemed a “tax” and thus would require two-thirds vote of any governmental units for passage. As noted, Proposition 26 requires taxes for general governmental purposes to be approved by a
majority vote and taxes for specific purposes to be approved by a two-thirds vote. Proposition 26 applied retroactively to any measures passed on or after January 1, 2010.</font></div>
<div>Appropriations Limits.<font> The State and its local governments are subject to an annual “appropriations limit” imposed by Article XIIIB of the California Constitution (“Article XIIIB”), enacted by the
voters in 1979 and significantly amended by Propositions 98 and 111 in 1988 and 1990, respectively. Article XIIIB prohibits the State or any covered local government from spending “appropriations subject to limitation” in excess of the
appropriations limit imposed. “Appropriations subject to limitation” are authorizations to spend “proceeds of taxes,” which consist of tax revenues and certain other funds, including proceeds from regulatory licenses, user
charges or other fees, to the extent that such proceeds exceed the cost of providing the product or service, but “proceeds of taxes” exclude most State subventions to local governments. No limit is imposed on appropriations of funds that
are not “proceeds of taxes,” such as reasonable user charges or fees and certain other non-tax funds, including bond proceeds.</font></div>
<div>Among the expenditures not included in the Article XIIIB
appropriations limit are (i) the debt service cost of bonds issued or authorized prior to January 1, 1979, or subsequently authorized by the voters, (ii) appropriations to comply with mandates of courts or the federal government, (iii)
appropriations for certain capital outlay projects, (iv) appropriations by the State of post-1989 increases in gasoline taxes and vehicle weight fees, and (v) appropriations made in certain cases of emergency.</div>
<div>The appropriations limit for each year is adjusted annually to
reflect changes in cost of living and population and any transfers of service responsibilities between government units. “Excess” revenues are measured over a two-year cycle. Local governments must return any excess to taxpayers by rate
reductions. The State must refund 50% of any excess to taxpayers, with the other 50% paid to schools and community colleges. With more liberal annual adjustment factors since 1988, few local governments have been operating near their spending
limits, but this condition may change over time. Local governments may by majority voter approval exceed their spending limits for up to four years.</div>
<div>The State has rarely exceeded its appropriations limit. In
recent years, however, State appropriations have trended closer to the limit. In fiscal year 2018-19, total spending exceeded the limit by $1.9 billion and is currently expected to exceed the limit in fiscal year 2020-21. Strong revenue growth,
coupled with more moderate growth in the appropriations limit, served to shrink the room under the limit. Any excess of the aggregate “proceeds of taxes” received over such two-year period above the combined appropriations limits for
those two years is divided equally between transfers to K-14 education districts and refunds to taxpayers. As noted above, the State reported that it is currently estimating that it will be approximately $16.2</div> </div>

appropriations limit for fiscal years 2020-21 and 2021-22, which could result in required transfers of the excess to K-14 education and refunds to taxpayers.</div>
<div>Dedication of General Fund Revenues to Schools.<font> The single largest portion of the State budget is support for K-14 schools. In 1988, the voters of the State approved Proposition 98, a combined initiative constitutional amendment and statute, which
(subject to suspension by a two-thirds vote of the State Legislature and the Governor) guarantees local school districts and community college districts a minimum share of General Fund revenues (the “Proposition 98 Guarantee”) with the
balance of school funding provided by a share of local property taxes. Proposition 98 is extremely complex and results in significant fiscal problems when General Fund revenues fall short of the projections on which the original appropriations to
schools were made. In the 2020-21 Budget, the State committed to a supplemental payment on top of the Proposition 98 Guarantee because funding for schools had significantly declined due to declining revenues for the State. The May Revision’s
improved revenue estimates have resulted in not only significantly more funding for schools but also the highest funding level ever, and the State is no longer planning to provide additional one-time funds to schools for additional costs associated
with the COVID-19 pandemic. For further discussion regarding Proposition 98, see “Proposition 98 and K-14 Funding” below.</font></div>
<div>Obligations of the State</div>
<div>The State has always paid when due the principal of and
interest on its general obligation bonds, general obligation commercial paper notes, lease revenue obligations and short-term obligations, including revenue anticipation notes and revenue anticipation warrants. The State Constitution prohibits the
creation of general obligation indebtedness of the State unless a bond measure is approved by a majority of the electorate voting at a general election or a direct primary.</div>
<div>Capital Facilities Financing.<font> The State builds and acquires capital facilities primarily through the use of general obligation bonds and lease-purchase borrowing. Under the State Constitution, debt service on outstanding general
obligation bonds is the second charge to the General Fund after support of the public school system and public institutions of higher education. New general obligation bonds, lease revenue bonds and other General Fund-supported debt are authorized
by the voters and/or the State Legislature with lease revenue bonds generally authorized by the State Legislature. As of April 1, 2021, the State had approximately $70.4 billion of outstanding general obligation bonds payable principally from the
State’s General Fund and approximately $33.6 billion of authorized and unissued General Fund-supported general obligation bonds. As of April 1, 2021, the State had approximately $8.1 billion in outstanding lease revenue bonds payable from
lease payments paid from the operating budget of the respective lessees, the operating budgets of which are primarily, but not exclusively, derived from the General Fund. As of January 1, 2021, the State had $7.6 billion of authorized but unissued
lease revenue bonds.</font></div> <div>As of April 2021, debt
service on General Fund-supported general obligation bonds and lease revenue debt was estimated to equal approximately 4.9% of General Fund revenues in fiscal year 2020-21 and 5.1% of General Fund revenues in fiscal year 2021-22. This debt service
cost is calculated based on the amount of debt service to be paid without adjusting for reimbursement from various special funds and subsidy payments from the federal government for taxable “Build America Bonds.” Including those
estimated offsets would reduce debt service on General Fund-supported general obligation bonds and lease revenue debt to approximately 3.6% of General Fund revenues in fiscal year 2020-21 and 4.0% of General Fund revenues in fiscal year 2021-22.
These amounts fluctuate as assumptions for future debt issuance and revenue projections are updated from time to time.</div>
<div>Future Bond Issuance Plans.<font> The amount of outstanding General Fund-supported debt, primarily general obligation bonds, may increase in coming years given the amount of authorized and unissued General Fund-supported bonds the
State can issue. See “— Capital Facilities Financing” above. Based on estimates from the Department of Finance in April 2021, approximately $3.1 billion of new money general obligation bonds (some of which may initially be in the
form of commercial paper notes) and approximately $695 million of new money lease revenue bonds are expected to be issued in fiscal year 2020-21. As of April 2021, the Department of Finance estimated issuance in fiscal year 2021-22 of approximately
$4.5 billion of new money general obligation bonds (some of which may initially be in the form of commercial paper notes) and approximately $2.0 billion in lease revenue bonds. However, the exact amount that may be issued will depend on overall
budget constraints, market conditions and other factors including updated information provided to the Department of Finance by other departments in the State. The State also issues refunding bonds as markets warrant.</font></div>
<div>Cash Management.<font> As part of its cash management program, the State has regularly issued short-term obligations to meet cash flow needs. External borrowing is typically done with revenue anticipation notes that are
payable later in the fiscal year in which they are issued. However, the State has not issued revenue anticipation notes since fiscal year 2014-15. In April 2021, the State observed that, even with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the State is
not expected to issue revenue</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

fiscal year 2020-21 or fiscal year 2021-22. In April 2021, the State estimated a cash cushion of unused internal borrowable resources of at least $26 billion at the end of each month through the end of fiscal year 2021-22.</div>
<div>The State is also authorized under certain circumstances to
issue revenue anticipation warrants that are payable in the succeeding fiscal year, as well as registered refunding warrants issued to refund revenue anticipation warrants. The State has issued revenue anticipation warrants to bridge short-term cash
flow shortages in five years since 1992. In April 2020, the Governor authorized the State Controller to open and transfer funds to the General Cash Revolving Fund during the period beginning April 1, 2020, and until revoked in writing, from any
special funds and other State accounts containing moneys that may lawfully be transferred therefrom. Although the State does not currently expect to issue revenue anticipation warrants, these actions will allow for the issuance of revenue
anticipation warrants, if necessary. From time to time, the State Legislature has deferred various payments due under State statute in order to more closely align the State’s revenues with its expenditures. This technique has been used in past
budgets in order to reduce the State’s need for external borrowing to bridge any cash flow deficit. Further, State law gives the State Controller some flexibility to delay payments to various payees, including State vendors, when the State
Controller foresees a relatively short-term cash flow shortage. In addition, the State issued IOUs in lieu of cash payments in July and August 2009, the second such issuance since the 1930s.</div>
<div>Obligations of State Agencies</div>
<div>A number of State agencies and authorities issue obligations
secured or payable from specified revenue streams. These obligations are not payable from the General Fund and carry different ratings than the State’s general obligation bonds. None of these revenue bonds are backed by the State’s faith
and credit or taxing power. As of December 31, 2020, the various State revenue bond financing programs had approximately $38.6 billion in outstanding bonds, and the various State financing authorities had approximately $32.0 billion of outstanding
revenue bonds. The Regents of the University of California has been one of the largest issuers of revenue bonds in recent years, with approximately $23.7 billion of outstanding revenue bonds secured by certain revenues of the University of
California as of December 31, 2020. Other State agencies and authorities with significant bond programs include the California State University system, with approximately $7.9 billion of outstanding revenue bonds secured by certain revenues of the
California State University; the State Department of Water Resources, which had approximately $2.9 billion of outstanding revenue bonds secured by power and water users; the California Health Facilities Financing Authority, which had $15.6 billion
in outstanding revenue bonds secured primarily by revenues of various health facilities; and the California Education Facilities Authority, which had approximately $4.3 billion of outstanding revenue bonds secured primarily by revenues of various
educational facilities, as of December 31, 2020.</div> <div>Recent
Financial Results</div> <div>Historically, the principal sources of
General Fund revenues are personal income tax, sales and use tax and corporation tax. The May Revision revised the personal income tax revenues up by approximately $38 billion; sales tax receipts, up by $4.5 billion; and corporation tax revenues, up
by almost $4.6 billion. The May Revision projects that personal income tax, sales and use tax and corporation tax will contribute 70.1%, 16.5% and 10.3%, respectively, of total General Fund revenues and transfers in fiscal year 2021-22, for a
cumulative estimated total of 92.6% of General Fund revenues after accounting for $3.4 billion in transfers out of the General Fund in fiscal year 2021-22.</div>
<div>The State’s personal income tax structure is highly
progressive, with rates ranging from 1% to 12.3%. For example, for the 2018 tax year, the State reported that the top one% of income earners paid over 46% of personal income taxes. This percentage has been greater than 40% in every year since 2004,
except for 2009. The personal income tax was made even more progressive with the passage of Proposition 30 (defined below), which imposed additional taxes on earnings over $250,000, resulting in an income tax of 12.3% on earnings over $1 million. In
November 2016, the voters in the State approved an extension of this portion of Proposition 30 through the end of calendar year 2030. A large portion of personal income tax receipts is derived from capital gains realizations and stock option income.
These revenue sources can be particularly volatile. For example, over the last 10 years, capital gains tax receipts accounted for over 10% of General Fund revenues and transfers in fiscal year 2016-17 but were less than 5% in fiscal year 2010-11.
However, because the economic hardship of the COVID-19 pandemic largely impacted low-income taxpayers, the State’s progressive tax structure resulted in only a moderate slowdown of personal income tax revenue during the pandemic.</div>
<div>During the Great Recession, capital gains tax receipts dropped
from nearly $9 billion in fiscal year 2007-08 to just under $3 billion in fiscal year 2009-10, a 67% decline. The 2020-21 Budget projected that capital gains would account for approximately 10.9% of General Fund revenues and transfers in fiscal year
2018-19, declining to 10.5% in fiscal year 2019-20 and 7.2% in fiscal year 2020-21. However, the strong recent stock market performance means that capital gains, which</div> </div> <div type="Block">

high-income households, are likely to show growth in 2020 and 2021 and account for over 11% of General Fund revenues in fiscal years 2020-21 and 2021-22. The State has observed that forecasting revenues associated with capital gains is subject to
significant uncertainty because realizations are heavily dependent upon stock market performance and when taxpayers choose to buy or sell stock. The volatility in the percentage of General Fund revenues and transfers attributable to capital gains
tax receipts is primarily due to an underlying volatility in the level of capital gains tax revenues, rather than to volatility in other General Fund revenues and transfers. Proposition 2 (defined below) mitigates some of the capital gains
volatility by requiring spikes in capital gains tax revenue to be used to repay the State’s debts and liabilities and to be deposited in the Budget Stabilization Account (“BSA).</div>
<div>The State is required to maintain the Special Fund for
Economic Uncertainties (“SFEU”), derived from General Fund revenues, as a reserve to meet cash needs of the General Fund, but the SFEU is required to be replenished as soon as sufficient revenues are available. Year-end balances in the
SFEU are included for financial reporting purposes in the General Fund balance. On March 25, 2020, the Department of Finance transferred the entire $1.3 billion available in the SFEU to the Disaster Response-Emergency Operations Account, a
subaccount of the SFEU, to procure items necessary to support the State’s efforts to protect public health and safety and reduce the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. As a result, the 2020-21 Budget projected that the State would end fiscal
year 2019-20 with a shortfall of $1.2 billion in the SFEU. However, that balance has been replenished and the State now projects a balance in the SFEU of $24.2 billion at the end of fiscal year 2020-21.</div>
<div>Proposition 98 and K-14 Funding</div>
<div>Throughout the 1980s, State spending increased rapidly as the
State population and economy also grew rapidly. Such spending included increased spending for many assistance programs to local governments, which were constrained by Proposition 13 and other laws. The largest State assistance program is to local
public school districts. In 1988, the voters of the State approved Proposition 98, a combined initiative constitutional amendment and statute, which provides for the Proposition 98 Guarantee. The Proposition 98 Guarantee is calculated each fiscal
year using one of three tests that apply under varying fiscal and economic conditions. Test 1 earmarks a minimum portion of State revenue for K-14 education, and Test 2 and Test 3 are based on prior-year Proposition 98 funding adjusted for key
factors including changes in student enrollment, as measured by K-12 average daily attendance. Test 2 further adjusts for the change in inflation. The test that provides the highest level of funding applies. Test 2 and Test 3 are generally used in
times of economic distress although the State also has the ability to suspend the Proposition 98 funding mechanism. In fiscal year 2010-11, the State suspended the Proposition 98 funding mechanism as it emerged from the Great Recession.</div>
<div>The COVID-19 pandemic initially had a significant negative
impact on the economy and the State's General Fund revenues. This had an equally significant initial negative impact on the Proposition 98 Guarantee for fiscal year 2020-21. The 2020-21 Budget estimated that the Proposition 98 Guarantee payable from
the General Fund in fiscal year 2020-21 would decline by approximately $12.8 billion to $35.1 billion from the revised $47.9 billion in fiscal year 2019-20. However, due to improved revenue estimates including the significant growth in capital
gains, the May Revision now projects that the portion of the Proposition 98 Guarantee payable from the General Fund will be $70.0 billion in fiscal year 2021-22. For further information on the limitations on General Fund revenues imposed by
Proposition 98, see “Constitutional Limitations on Taxes, Other Charges, Appropriations and General Fund Revenues — Dedication of General Fund Revenues to Schools” above. In addition, the federal government allocated $17.3 billion
in relief to K-14 schools in the State, and schools may be eligible for approximately $8 billion in additional funds in fiscal year 2022-23 as a result of the State potentially exceeding its appropriations limit. See “Appropriations
Limits” above.</div> <div>State and Local Pension and
Post-Retirement Liabilities</div> <div>State. <font>The financial condition of the State and its localities is also subject to pension and other post-retirement benefit risks.</font></div>
<div><font>Pension</font><font>. The pension funds managed by the State’s retirement systems, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (“CalPERS”) and the California State Teachers’ Retirement System
(“CalSTRS”), sustained significant investment losses during the Great Recession and currently have substantial unfunded liabilities that may be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. These unfunded liabilities will require increased
contributions from the General Fund in future years. In April 2021, the State noted that its actuarially determined fiscal year 2020-21 General Fund contributions to CalPERS and CalSTRS were projected to be approximately $3.1 billion and $3.4
billion, respectively. In the May Revision, the State noted that its actuarially determined fiscal year 2021-22 General Fund contributions to CalPERS and CalSTRS were projected to be approximately $3.2 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. In
addition to these required payments, the May Revision includes proposals for</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

payments to CalPERS and CalSTRS. See also “The State Budget — Balanced Budget Amendment (Proposition 58 and Proposition 2)” below.</div>
<div>The Great Recession called into question the reliability of
assumed rates of return used to determine actuarial unfunded pension liabilities. For actuarial valuations prior to June 30, 2011, CalPERS and CalSTRS had used an assumed 7.75% rate of return to calculate their respective unfunded liabilities. The
investment earnings assumptions were lowered to 7.50% for both funds commencing for actuarial valuations dated June 30, 2011. These assumption changes resulted in significant increases in unfunded liability. The assumption changes for CalPERS also
increased retirement contributions for many local governments that contract with CalPERS to manage their pension programs. In December 2016, the CalPERS Board voted to lower the investment earnings assumptions for 2017-18 to 7.375%, for 2018-19 to
7.25% and for 2019-20 to 7.0%. In February 2017, the CalSTRS Board lowered its investment return assumption to 7.25% for fiscal year 2017-18 and 7.0% for fiscal year 2018-19. These assumption changes will result in additional increases of unfunded
liabilities for the systems. In February 2018, CalPERS adopted revisions to its actuarial authorization policy that are applied to amortizations of gains, losses and actuarial surplus experienced after June 30, 2019 and affect contributions starting
in fiscal year 2020-21. At the present time, neither CalPERS nor CalSTRS has indicated that there will be further changes to their assumed rates of return.</div>
<div>The most recent CalPERS and CalSTRS investment returns have
varied widely, and their respective 10-year time weighted average returns are below even the lower assumed rates of return adopted by their Boards. CalPERS and CalSTRS generally report their investment returns for the prior fiscal year (ending June
30) in July of each year. The most recent reported investment results for both CalPERS and CalSTRS (based on market value) are set forth below.</div> <div>

the 12 months ended June 30, 2020, CalPERS estimated 5-year, 10-year and 20-year time weighted average returns of 6.3, 8.5 and 5.5%, respectively. In 2019, CalPERS publicly indicated that it expected actual investment returns in the following
10-year period to be less than the actuarially assumed 7% rate of return. Actual investment returns lower than the actuarially assumed level will result in decreased funding status and increased actuarially required contribution. As of June 30,
2020, CalSTRS reported 5-year, 10-year and 20-year time weighted average returns of 6.8, 9.3 and 5.8%, respectively. CalSTRS 3-year, 5-year and 20-year rates of return are below the 7.00% rate of return, CalSTRS’ actuarially assumed rate of
return for fiscal year 2019-20.</div> <div>The CalPERS Board

value of assets (“AVA”) basis. This represents a funded ratio of 70.6%. CalSTRS reported the unfunded accrued actuarial liability of its Defined Benefit Plan as of June 30, 2019 at $102.6 billion on an MVA basis. This represents a funded
ratio of 67%.</div> <div>In April 2013, CalPERS approved new

current 30-year rolling amortization method). CalPERS delayed the implementation of the new policy until fiscal year 2015-16 for the State, schools and all public agencies. In February 2014, the CalPERS Board approved new demographic assumptions
that take into account increased life expectancies (2.1 years for men; 1.6 years for women). All of these policies have increased or are projected to increase required State and local contributions to CalPERS. See “— Local” below
for a discussion of steps taken to eliminate the current CalSTRS unfunded liability.</div>
<div><font>OPEB</font><font>. The State also provides other post-employment health care and dental benefits to its employees and certain of their spouses and dependents (hereinafter referred to as “OPEB”), which benefits utilize a
“pay-as-you-go” funding policy. As of April 2021, General Fund contributions to OPEB were estimated to be approximately $2.7 billion (or 1.7%) of total General Fund expenditures for fiscal year 2020-21 and approximately $3.7 billion (or
2.3%) of total General Fund expenditures for fiscal year 2021-22. The amount for 2021-22 includes a one-time prefunding contribution of $616 million.</font></div>
<div>The State’s most recent OPEB actuarial accrued liability
report estimated approximately $93.5 billion of total OPEB actuarial accrued liability as of June 30, 2019 (compared to $86.5 billion estimated as of June 30, 2018), of which $91.9 billion was unfunded as of June 30, 2019. Government Accounting
Standards Board (“GASB”) Statements 74 and 75, each of which affects OPEB financial reporting, were issued in June 2015. As a result, there is an increased focus on OPEB liability as GASB Statement No. 74 became effective for fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2016 and GASB Statement No. 75 became effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2017. In January 2016, the State Controller noted that, if OPEB funding is left unchanged, the OPEB actuarial accrued liability
could rise to more than $100 billion by fiscal year 2020-21 and to more than $300 billion by fiscal year 2047-48. Statutory language passed as part of the 2015-16 Budget Act, which proposed prefunding the entire unfunded liability by fiscal year
2044-45, contained the framework designed to support the elimination of the unfunded OPEB actuarial accrued liability through the use of a prefunding trust fund to pay for future retiree health benefits. The State currently has more than $3.8
billion set aside in the prefunding trust fund to pay for future retiree health benefits. By the end of fiscal year 2021-22, the trust fund balance is projected to approach $5.7 billion in assets.</div>
<div><font>General</font><font>. In the future, the State may be forced to significantly increase its pension fund and post-retirement benefit contributions, reducing discretionary funds available for other State programs. In addition, the
State’s credit ratings may be adversely affected if the State does not reduce or manage these unfunded liabilities. See “Bond Ratings” below.</font></div>
<div>Local. <font>Many
local governments in the State, many of which are current members of CalPERS, face similar and, in many cases, more severe issues relating to unfunded pension and OPEB liabilities. The credit ratings, and even the solvency, of these local
governments may be at risk in the future if these liabilities are not appropriately addressed through wage concessions and restructuring of benefits. Cities are particularly at risk because one of their primary missions is safety, and safety
personnel labor and retirement benefit costs are significantly greater than labor and retirement costs of general municipal employees. Three cities – Vallejo, Stockton and San Bernardino – entered bankruptcy under Chapter 9 of the
Federal bankruptcy code, largely as a result of escalating labor costs and unfunded pension and other post-retirement liabilities. All three of these cities have agreements with CalPERS to administer their pension obligations, and their respective
obligations to CalPERS were a significant reason for their insolvency. Other cities (including some that contract with CalPERS) and counties have expressed public concerns about their ability to meet their unfunded pension and other post-retirement
liabilities, and a willingness to entertain bankruptcy as an option to resolve their fiscal problems. One federal bankruptcy judge stated that obligations to CalPERS could be adjusted in federal bankruptcy proceedings; however, the plan of
adjustment in those proceedings was confirmed without reducing such obligations to CalPERS. Any definitive ruling that allowed obligations to CalPERS to be adjusted downward might encourage other financially stressed municipalities to explore a
Chapter 9 bankruptcy. The fiscal stress and cash pressures facing the State’s localities prior to the COVID-19 pandemic may be exacerbated as a result of the pandemic for certain local governments depending on the makeup of their economy or
revenue sources as well as the overall makeup of their outstanding debt. See “Obligations of Other Issuers.”</font></div>
<div>School districts in the State are required to make
contributions to CalSTRS for their teachers and staff. Chapter 47, Statutes of 2014 (“AB 1469”) increased statutorily required contributions to CalSTRS from the State, school districts, and teachers beginning July 1, 2014. The AB 1469
funding plan included additional increases in contribution rates for the State, school districts, and teachers in order to eliminate the current CalSTRS unfunded liability by 2045-46.</div>
<div>State Law Regarding Pensions and Pension Reform. <font>California courts have been largely supportive of the vested or earned pension rights of State and local employees. Thus, pension reform efforts have been focused largely on limitations on future
benefits for new employees, bringing limited, if any, immediate financial relief. Both constitutional initiatives and State legislation have been circulated or proposed attempting to reform the State’s pension systems on a State and local
basis.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

September 2012, the Governor signed into law a comprehensive pension reform package affecting State and local governments known as the California Public Employees’ Pension Reform Act of 2013 (“PEPRA”), which became effective
January 1, 2013. PEPRA implements lower defined-benefit formulas with higher retirement ages for new State employees hired on or after January 1, 2013, and includes provisions to increase employee contributions. As noted above, AB 1469 increased
required State contributions to CalSTRS beginning in July 2014. OPEB costs were not addressed in PEPRA; however, the State has disclosed that the higher retirement ages included in PEPRA will reduce OPEB liabilities in the long term and has taken
other actions to address OPEB liabilities. See “State and Local Pension and Post-Retirement Liabilities – State – OPEB” above.</div>
<div>The State Budget</div>
<div>Overview<font>. </font><font>The State’s fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30 of the following year. The annual budget is proposed by the Governor by January 10 of each year for the next fiscal year. Under State
law, the Governor’s Budget cannot provide for projected expenditures in excess of projected revenues for the ensuing fiscal year. State law also requires the Governor to update the Governor’s Budget projections and budgetary proposals in
the May Revision by May 14 of each year. The May Revision is generally the basis for final negotiations between the Governor and the State Legislature to reach agreement on appropriations and other legislation to fund State government and thus
finalize the Budget Act for upcoming fiscal year. The budget must be balanced, as required by Proposition 58 (discussed below). Pursuant to Proposition 25, which was enacted in 2010, the budget must be approved by a majority (instead of two-thirds,
under prior law) of each house of the State Legislature. State law requires the Governor to sign the budget by the start of the fiscal year on July 1, a requirement that, prior to Proposition 25’s enactment, had been met only 12 times in the
preceding three decades. In every year since the enactment of Proposition 25, the Legislature has approved and the Governor has signed Budget Acts before the start of each such fiscal year. See “Status of State General Fund; May Revision to
the 2021-22 Governor’s Budget”</font><font> </font><font>below.</font></div>
<div>Constraints on the Budget Process. <font>Recent State constitutional amendments approved by State voters have affected the budget process. Several such amendments are described below.</font></div>
<div>Balanced Budget Amendment (Proposition 58 and Proposition
2).</div> <div><font>Proposition
58</font>. <font>In 2004, voters approved Proposition 58, a constitutional amendment called the “Balanced Budget Amendment,” which requires the State to enact a balanced budget and establish a special reserve
and restricts future borrowing to cover fiscal year-end deficits. As a result of the provisions requiring the enactment of a balanced budget and restricting borrowing, the State would in some cases have to take more immediate actions to correct
budgetary shortfalls. Proposition 58 requires the State Legislature to pass a balanced budget and provides for mid-year adjustments in the event that the budget falls out of balance and the Governor calls a special legislative session to address the
shortfall. The balanced budget determination is made by subtracting expenditures from all available resources, including prior-year balances.</font></div>
<div>Under Proposition 58, if the Governor determines that the
State is facing substantial revenue shortfalls or spending increases, the Governor is authorized to declare a fiscal emergency. The Governor would then be required to propose legislation to address the emergency and call the State Legislature into
special session for that purpose. If the State Legislature fails to pass and send to the Governor legislation to address the fiscal emergency within 45 days, the State Legislature would be prohibited from acting on any other bills or adjourning in
joint recess until such legislation is passed. Although no fiscal emergency has been declared as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the State initially projected transfers out of the BSA, which was established by Proposition 58, for several fiscal
years.</div> <div>The BSA is a special reserve account funded by
annual transfers of specified amounts from the General Fund, unless suspended or reduced by the Governor or until a specified maximum amount has been deposited. Until the 2014-15 Budget Act, the Governor had suspended the annual transfer of money
from the General Fund to the BSA every year since 2007. Proposition 2 intended to strengthen the BSA by, among other things, basing deposits on when capital gains revenues rise above 8%, creating a Proposition 98 reserve and doubling the maximum
size of the BSA from 5% to 10% of General Fund revenues. Funding for the BSA is estimated by the May Revision to the 2021-22 Governor’s Budget to be approximately $12.5 billion as of June 30, 2021 and approximately $15.9 billion as of June 30,
2022. Certain other provisions of Proposition 58 relating to the BSA were replaced by the provisions of Proposition 2. See “—Proposition 2” below.</div>
<div>Proposition 58 also prohibits certain future borrowing to
cover fiscal year-end deficits. This restriction applies to general obligation bonds, revenue bonds, and certain other forms of long-term borrowing. The restriction does not apply to certain other types of borrowing, such as short-term borrowing to
cover cash shortfalls in the General Fund (including revenue</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div><font>Proposition 2</font><font>. In addition to the provisions described above, other provisions of Proposition 58 relating to the BSA were replaced by the provisions of Proposition 2 (“Proposition 2”). Proposition 2 requires that 1.5% of
annual General Fund revenues be deposited each year into the BSA until the BSA balance reaches an amount equal to 10% of General Fund revenues. Proposition 2 also requires that half of the revenues that otherwise would have been deposited into the
BSA through fiscal year 2030-31 be used for supplemental payments to pay down long-term liabilities. After fiscal year 2030-31, the revenues that otherwise would have been deposited into the BSA may be used for either supplemental debt payments or
savings. Proposition 2 further requires that withdrawal of funds from the BSA be only for a disaster or if spending remains at or below the highest level of spending from the prior three years. Proposition 2 limits the maximum amount that could be
withdrawn in the first year of a recession to half of the BSA’s balance. It also requires the State to provide a multiyear budget forecast to help better manage the State’s longer-term finances and to create a Proposition 98 reserve,
whereby spikes in funding are to be saved for future years to smooth school spending and minimize future cuts. The State expected to withdraw a portion of the balance in the BSA during fiscal year 2020-21 before largely replenishing the fund by the
end of fiscal year 2021-22.</font></div> <div><font>State-Local Fiscal Relations</font>.<font> </font><font>The enactment of Proposition 1A in November 2004 (“Proposition 1A of 2004”) and Proposition
22, or the “Local Taxpayer, Public Safety, and Transportation Protection Act of 2010”, in November 2010 (“Proposition 22”), significantly changed the fiscal relationship between the State and local governments by severely
limiting the State’s access to local funding sources.</font></div>
<div>Specifically, Proposition 1A of 2004 amended the State
Constitution to, among other things, reduce the State’s access to property tax, sales tax and vehicle license fee revenues raised by local governments. Proposition 1A of 2004 also prohibits the State from mandating activities on cities,
counties or special districts without providing funding to comply with the mandates. If the State does not provide funding for the mandated activity, the requirement to abide by the mandate is suspended.</div>
<div>In addition, Proposition 22 prohibits the State Legislature
from, among other things, (i) taking or reallocating money raised by local governments for local purposes, (ii) making changes in the allocation of property taxes among local governments designed to aid State finances, (iii) using State fuel tax
revenues to pay debt service on State transportation bonds, (iv) borrowing or changing the distribution of State fuel tax revenues, and (v) using vehicle licensing fee revenues to reimburse local governments for State-mandated costs. The inability
of the State to borrow or redirect funds from these sources, as it did during the Great Recession in fiscal years 2008-09 and 2009-10, will reduce the State’s flexibility in reaching budget solutions in the future. On the other hand, both
Proposition 1A of 2004 and Proposition 22 made the allocation of revenues to local jurisdictions more predictable.</div>
<div><font>Proposition 30 and
Proposition 55</font>. <font>In 2012, voters approved “The Schools and Local Public Safety Protection Act of 2012” (“Proposition 30”), which provided temporary increases in personal income tax rates
for high-income taxpayers and a temporary increase in the State’s sales tax rate. A portion of the tax increases has been and will be used to pay for the State’s Proposition 98 school funding obligations. See “Proposition 98 and
K-14 Funding” above. The sales tax portion of Proposition 30 expired on December 31, 2016. In November 2016, voters approved Proposition 55 (“Proposition 55”), which extended the personal income tax portion of Proposition 30 until
December 31, 2030. The May Revision to the 2021-22 Governor’s Budget projected the revenue from these additional tax brackets to be $11.1 billion in fiscal year 2020-21 and $9.5 billion in fiscal year 2021-22, which was an increase of $1.6
billion for fiscal year 2020-21 from the amount estimated in the 2021-22 Governor’s Budget.</font></div>
<div>Health Care Services. <font>Medi-Cal, California’s Medicaid program, is a health care entitlement program for qualified low-income individuals and families who receive public assistance or otherwise lack health care coverage
and is one of the State’s largest expenditures. Medi-Cal serves approximately one-third of all Californians. Medi-Cal caseload and expenditures increased starting in fiscal year 2014-15, largely due to the implementation of federal health care
reform. Caseload reached an average monthly peak of 13.5 million in fiscal year 2016-17 and slowly declined through fiscal year 2019-20. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the May Revision estimates that the Medi-Cal caseload will continue to
increase, and it is projected to cover approximately 14.5 million people (or over one-third of the State’s population) in fiscal year 2021-22. The increase is driven primarily by the continuous coverage requirement in the federal COVID-19
relief bill, which requires continuous</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

beneficiaries through the duration of the federal public health emergency as a condition for receiving additional federal funds.</div>
<div>The May Revision to the 2021-22 Governor’s Budget
includes $115.6 billion ($21.5 billion General Fund) in fiscal year 2020-21 and $123.8 billion ($27.6 billion General Fund) in fiscal year 2021-22 for the Medi-Cal program. This represents a $3.5 billion General Fund decrease in the Medi-Cal program
in fiscal year 2020-21 compared to the 2020-21 Budget, primarily attributable to a lower projected COVID-19 caseload in fiscal year 2020-21 and lower estimated federal repayments. The $8.2 billion ($6.1 billion General Fund) year-over-year increase
in fiscal year 2021-22 is largely due to costs associated with increased caseload projections, underlying program cost growth and assumed termination of certain federal programs related to COVID-19 relief in December 2021.</div>
<div>The overall Medi-Cal budget may significantly change over
time, including within a single fiscal year, due to its size, financial complexity, federal requirements, and the fact that Medi-Cal operates on a cash, rather than an accrual, basis of accounting, which means that the timing of transactions can
significantly disrupt fiscal year budgetary estimates. In addition, the federal administration and leaders in Congress continue to consider and propose numerous changes to health and human services programs. Many of the proposals could have
far-reaching impacts on health care in California and significant impacts to Medicaid (Medi-Cal in California).</div>
<div>The State’s implementation of the Affordable Care Act
(“ACA”) included the mandatory and optional Medi-Cal expansions. The mandatory Medi-Cal expansion simplified eligibility, enrollment, and retention rules that make it easier to enroll in and stay on Medi-Cal. The optional expansion of
Medi-Cal extended eligibility to adults without children, and to parents and caretaker relatives with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level. With implementation of the ACA, the federal government took responsibility for 100% of costs for
the optional expansion population, with the State share increasing thereafter. Beginning January 1, 2020, California is responsible for 10% of the costs for this population. As such, 2020-21 is the first full fiscal year with the 10% state
share.</div> <div>In addition, because the federal government
provides a significant share of funding for health care programs in the State, the State must comply with various federal laws and regulations to receive those funds. Recently, the federal government has modified its interpretation of, and has
proposed changes to, existing law and regulations. The State has noted that such actions, if successful, could cost the General Fund tens of billions of dollars annually.</div>
<div>The Covered California marketplace has provided individual
health insurance through private plans supported by federally funded tax subsidies and products for individuals and small businesses since 2014. It is a self-sustaining entity funded through fees assessed on the participating health plans. The
federal tax reform bill passed in December 2017 eliminated penalties for the individual mandate starting in 2019, which was expected to put fiscal pressure on Covered California. However, the 2019-20 Budget included a statewide requirement for State
residents to obtain comprehensive health care coverage or pay a penalty consistent with the federal penalties and mandate exemptions originally outlined under ACA beginning January 1, 2020. The 2019-20 Budget also included premium assistance
subsidies to individuals with household incomes below certain federal poverty levels beginning January 1, 2020. For fiscal years 2020-21 and 2021-22, federal COVID-19 relief funding provides more generous subsidies than the current State subsidy
program, which has effectively eliminated the need for those State subsidies in fiscal years 2020-21 and 2021-22, resulting in a savings of $732.7 million for the General Fund. This State subsidy program is not an entitlement and is set to sunset on
January 1, 2023.</div> <div>The net impact of health care costs on
the General Fund continues to depend on a variety of factors, including the nature and extent of any repeal or replacement of ACA or associated interpretations of existing federal law or regulations, levels of individual and employer participation,
changes in insurance premiums, and the approval or enactment of solutions by the State to address health care costs.</div>
<div>Status of State General Fund; May Revision to the 2021-22
Governor’s Budget</div> <div>On January 8, 2021, the Governor
proposed a state budget for fiscal year 2021-22 and on May 14, 2021 released the May Revision to the 2021-22 Governor’s Budget. The 2021-22 Governor’s Budget projected total general fund revenues and transfers of $158.4 billion for
fiscal year 2021-22, authorized expenditures of $164.5 billion for fiscal year 2021-22, and projected that the State will end the 2021-22 fiscal year with total available general fund reserves of $21.9 billion, including $2.9 billion in the SFEU,
$15.6 billion in the BSA, $450 million in the Safety Net Reserve Fund and $3 billion in the Public School System Stabilization Account. In contrast, the May Revision projected total general fund revenues and transfers of $175.9 billion for fiscal

<div>LAO Overview of the May Revision to the 2021-22 Budget<font>. In its report on the May Revision to the 2021-22 Governor’s Budget, the LAO estimates that the State has $38 billion in discretionary state funds to allocate in the 2021-22 budget process, which differs from the
Governor’s estimate of $76 billion. The Governor’s estimate includes constitutionally required spending on schools and community colleges, reserves, and debt payments. The LAO does not consider these spending amounts part of the surplus
because they must be allocated to specified purposes. The LAO also observed that the May Revision includes roughly 400 new spending proposals. The LAO noted that the surplus, in combination with federal fiscal recovery funds, represents resources
equal to about half of annual pre-COVID-19 pandemic General Fund budgets. Departments’ capacity to allocate this funding in a timely and effective manner likely will be significantly constrained. More importantly, the Legislature’s time
to deliberate over choices made in the May Revision is extremely limited. The LAO recommended that the Legislature delay some spending decisions so that they could be better implemented.</font></div>
<div>Future Budgets</div>
<div>The State’s ability to balance its budget going forward
may be affected by short- and long-term budget pressures, including particularly the ongoing and evolving economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, potential significant increases in required State contributions to pension funds or other
post-employment benefits, health care costs, the impact of federal tax legislation and other federal policies, increased debt service payments and potential adverse decisions in litigation.</div>
<div>Pending Litigation</div>
<div>There are currently numerous legal proceedings pending against
the State that, if determined adversely against the State, could affect the State’s expenditures and, in some cases, its revenues and cash flow. Information regarding some of the more significant litigation pending against the State would
ordinarily be included in various public documents issued by the State, such as the official statements prepared in connection with the issuance of general obligation bonds of California. See “Additional Information” below for

<div>Periodic reports on revenues and/or expenditures during the
fiscal year are issued by the Administration, the State Controller’s Office and the LAO. The Department of Finance issues a monthly bulletin, which reports the most recent revenue receipts as reported by State departments, comparing those
receipts to budget projections. The State Controller issues a monthly report on General Fund cash receipts and disbursements. These reports are normally released on the 10<sup>th</sup> day of every calendar month for the period ended on the last day of the prior month. The Administration also formally updates its budget projections three
times during each fiscal year — in January, May and at the time of budget enactment. Currently, many of these bulletins and reports are available on the State’s investor relations website
(<font>www.buycaliforniabonds.com</font>) or on websites maintained by the applicable agencies and by contacting the agencies at their offices in Sacramento, California. Investors are cautioned that interim financial
information is not necessarily indicative of results for a fiscal year.</div>

primary units of local government in California are the 58 counties, which range in population from approximately 1,200 in Alpine County to approximately 10 million in Los Angeles County.</font></div>
<div>Counties are responsible for the provision of many basic
services, including indigent health care, welfare, jails, and public safety in unincorporated areas. As of July 1, 2011, the California League of Cities reported that there are 482 incorporated cities in California and thousands of special districts
formed for education, utilities, and other services.</div> <div>To
the extent the State is constrained by its obligation to schools under Proposition 98 or other fiscal considerations, the absolute level (or the rate of growth) of State assistance to local governments may be affected. Any such reductions in State
aid could compound the serious fiscal constraints already experienced by many local governments, particularly counties and</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>schools. As a result of
the COVID-19 pandemic, the level of funding that the State is required to provide to schools under Proposition 98 was temporarily reduced. See “Proposition 98 and K-14 Funding.” Schools may also face increased costs related to physical
plant and staffing costs associated with social distancing protocols. School districts generally maintain some level of operating reserves; however, for certain school districts this may not be sufficient to address any drop in revenue available to
schools due to reductions in the Proposition 98 Guarantee, other revenue losses and increased costs associated with responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. See “Proposition 98 and K-14 Funding” above.</div>
<div>Initial economic and tax revenue losses associated with the
COVID-19 pandemic were stark and immediate for local governments in the State; however, many of these projected revenue losses have subsequently turned out to be smaller than expected and expected reductions in State aid have largely been reversed.
In addition, the six federal COVID-19 relief bills have provided billions of dollars in additional revenue to local governments as well as economic support through direct payments to individuals, families, colleges and businesses. However, local
governments that have continued to be affected by declining revenues and increased expenses due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other local factors are limited in their ability to levy and raise property taxes and other forms of taxes, fees or
assessments, due to State constitutional as well as (in some cases) local initiatives. Local governments are also constrained by balanced budget requirements and prohibitions on long-term borrowing for operating costs. As a consequence of these
factors, local governments may increasingly be forced to cut local services to address budget shortfalls or to take even more drastic actions, such as a bankruptcy filing.</div>
<div>Many local governments are also facing substantial increases
in pension liabilities and health care costs for retirees. Any declines in the U.S. and global stock markets could have a material impact on the investments in the State pension trusts, which could materially increase the unfunded actuarial accrued
liability for CalPERS and CalSTRS, which, in turn, could result in material changes to required contribution rates for local governments in future fiscal years. In the case of school districts, contributions to CalSTRS are determined by the State
legislature, and the State had previously enacted legislation to increase required contributions to pay rising pension costs. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the State has proposed delays in these increased contributions and taken other steps to
reduce local government contributions in the short term. However, to the extent such required contributions exceed available funding, local government finances will continue to be adversely affected. For more information regarding pension
liabilities, see “State and Local Pension and Post-Retirement Liabilities” above.</div>
<div>Constitutional and Statutory Limitations on Local Government.<font> The fiscal condition of local governments was changed when Proposition 13, which added Article XIIIA to the State Constitution, was approved by California voters in 1978. Proposition 13 reduced and
limited the future growth of property taxes and limited the ability of local governments to impose “special taxes” (i.e., those devoted to a specific purpose) without two-thirds voter approval. Although Proposition 13 limited property
tax growth rates, it also has had a smoothing effect on property tax revenues, ensuring greater stability in annual revenues than existed before Proposition 13 passed. For further information on Proposition 13, see “Constitutional Limitations
on Taxes, Other Charges, Appropriations and General Fund Revenues — Limitation on Property Taxes” above.</font></div>
<div>Proposition 218, a constitutional amendment enacted by
initiative in 1996, further limited the ability of local governments to raise taxes, fees, and other exactions. See “Constitutional Limitations on Taxes, Other Charges, Appropriations and General Fund Revenues — Limitations on Other
Taxes, Fees and Charges” above. Proposition 62, a statutory initiative adopted by the voters in 1986, includes limitations on the ability of local governments to raise taxes that are similar to those included in the later constitutional
amendments of Proposition 218.</div> <div>In the aftermath of
Proposition 13, the State provided aid to local governments from the General Fund to make up some of the loss of property tax moneys, including assuming principal responsibility for funding K-12 schools and community colleges. During the recession
of the early 1990s, the State Legislature reduced the post-Proposition 13 aid to local government entities other than K-12 schools and community colleges by requiring cities and counties to transfer some of their property tax revenues to school
districts. However, the State Legislature also provided additional funding sources, such as sales taxes, and reduced certain mandates for local services funded by cities and counties.</div>
<div>Beginning in 2000, and in part caused by the “internet
bubble,” the State was faced with increasing financial stress and began to divert local revenue resources, including sales tax, vehicle license fees and redevelopment moneys, to the State coffers. The 2004-05 Budget Act, related legislation
and the enactment of Proposition 1A of 2004 and Proposition 22 dramatically changed the State-local fiscal relationship.</div>
<div>Proposition 1A of 2004 amended the State Constitution to,
among other things, reduce the State Legislature’s authority over local government revenue sources by placing restrictions on the State’s access to local governments’ property, sales, and</div> </div>

revenues as of November 3, 2004. Proposition 22, which supersedes Proposition 1A of 2004, completely prohibits any future borrowing by the State from local government funds and generally prohibits the State Legislature from making changes in local
government funding sources. For further discussion regarding Proposition 22 and Proposition 1A of 2004, see “The State Budget — Balanced Budget Amendment (Proposition 58 and Proposition 2) — State-Local Fiscal Relations”
above.</div> <div>Realigning Services to Local Governments.<font> Commencing with the 2011-12 Budget, the State implemented a realignment plan to shift certain State program costs to counties and provided a comparable amount of funds to support these new county
commitments. Under the realignment plan, ongoing funds for such programs after fiscal year 2010-11 are required to be provided to counties for court security, corrections and public safety, mental health services, substance abuse treatment, child
welfare programs, adult protective services, and CalWORKs. However, State transfers do not cover all the costs of such programs. Consequently, local governments, particularly counties, have borne an increased part of the financial burden of
providing program services, including the risks of cost overruns, revenue declines and insufficient revenue growth. Nevertheless, the May Revision projects that revenue available to local governments under realignment will continue to grow from $7.8
billion in fiscal year 2019-20 to $8.5 billion in fiscal year 2020-21 and $8.8 billion in fiscal year 2021-22.</font></div>
<div>Obligations of Other Issuers</div>
<div>Other Issuers of California Debt Obligations.<font> There are a number of State agencies, instrumentalities and political subdivisions of the State that issue municipal obligations, some of which may be conduit revenue obligations payable from payments
from private borrowers. These entities are subject to various economic risks and uncertainties, and the credit quality of the securities issued by them may vary considerably from the credit quality of obligations backed by the full faith and credit
of the State. See “Local Governments — General” above. For example, assessment bonds may be adversely affected by a general decline in real estate values or a slowdown in real estate sales activity. As a result of the COVID-19
pandemic, bonds backed solely by sales taxes, hotel and other tourism-related taxes, senior housing and other health care facility revenue and payments from private borrowers may be particularly susceptible to payment default.</font></div>
<div>California Long-Term Lease Obligations.<font> Based on a series of court decisions, certain long-term lease obligations, though typically payable from the General Fund or a municipality, are not considered “indebtedness” requiring
voter approval. Such leases, however, are subject to “abatement” in the event the facility being leased is unavailable for beneficial use and occupancy by the municipality during the term of the lease. Abatement is not a default, and
there may be no remedies available to the holders of the certificates evidencing the lease obligation in the event abatement occurs. The most common cases of abatement are failure to complete construction of the facility before the end of the period
during which lease payments have been capitalized and uninsured casualty losses to the facility (e.g., due to earthquake). In the event abatement occurs with respect to a lease obligation, lease payments may be interrupted (if all available
insurance proceeds and reserves are exhausted) and the certificates may not be paid when due. Further, lease obligations may represent executory contracts that could be rejected in a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 9 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code. In recent bankruptcy proceedings involving the City of Stockton, the confirmed plan of adjustment included the discharge of lease obligations at significant discounts from their face value.</font></div>
<div>Statutory Lien Securing General Obligation Bonds<font>. Certain local governments, particularly school districts, issue general obligation bonds secured by </font><font>ad valorem</font><font> property taxes. Effective January 1, 2016, provisions were added to the California Education Code and the California Government Code to provide that general obligation bonds issued and sold by local
governments in California are secured by a statutory lien on the </font><font>ad valorem</font><font> property taxes levied and collected to pay the principal and interest on
such general obligation bonds. A statutory lien provides bondholders with a security interest in </font><font>ad valorem</font><font> property taxes intended to survive a
bankruptcy of the local government. It is unclear whether these provisions apply to bonds issued prior to the effective date.</font></div>
<div>Tax Increment and the Dissolution of Redevelopment Agencies.<font> Until 2011, local redevelopment agencies throughout the State issued “tax allocation” bonds or similar obligations secured by the increase in assessed valuation of a redevelopment project
area after the start of redevelopment activity. Throughout the years, redevelopment agencies issued billions of dollars of tax allocation bonds. In addition, the State regularly borrowed or appropriated redevelopment tax increments to address its
budget shortfalls.</font></div> <div>In December 2011, the State
Supreme Court upheld the validity of legislation, enacted earlier in 2011, that eliminated redevelopment agencies (as well as the issuance of tax allocation bonds) in the State. On February 1, 2012, all redevelopment agencies in California were
dissolved and the process of unwinding their financial affairs began.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

legislation dissolving redevelopment agencies preserved the pledge of tax increment revenues to the payment of tax allocation bonds or tax allocation supported obligations. Over time, the elimination of redevelopment agencies and the redirection of
tax increment revenues to local governments will provide additional discretionary revenues to the State as well as local governments.</div>
<div>Other Considerations.<font> The repayment of industrial development securities or single-family mortgage revenue bonds secured by real property may be affected by California laws limiting foreclosure rights of creditors. Under
California law, mortgage loans secured by single-family homes can be prepaid at any time without penalty, except in the first five years of the loan, and are subject to limits on the size of the penalty. Such prepayments may affect the ability of
the issuer of single-family mortgage bonds to repay the bonds. Securities backed by health care and hospital revenues may be affected by changes in State regulations governing cost reimbursements to health care providers under Medi-Cal (the
State’s Medicaid program), including risks related to the policy of awarding exclusive contracts to certain hospitals. See “Obligations of State Agencies” and “Obligations of Other Issuers — Other Issuers of California
Debt Obligations” above.</font></div> <div>Other Factors</div>
<div>Earthquake Risk.<font> Substantially all of California is within an active geologic region subject to major seismic activity. Northern California in 1989 and Southern California in 1994 experienced major earthquakes causing
billions of dollars in damages. The federal government provided more than $13 billion in aid for both earthquakes, and neither event has had any long-term negative economic impact. Any obligation of a local government in the State could be affected
by an interruption of revenues because of damaged facilities or, consequently, income tax deductions for casualty losses or property tax assessment reductions. Compensatory financial assistance could be constrained by the inability of (i) an issuer
to have obtained earthquake insurance coverage; (ii) an insurer to perform on its contracts of insurance in the event of widespread losses; or (iii) the federal or State government to appropriate sufficient funds within their respective budget
limitations.</font></div> <div>Global Relations and Trade. <font>Given increased globalization and interconnectedness of physical and financial world markets, disruptions in large markets due to economic slowdowns in other countries or regions (such as the slowdown
in many European countries or economic crises in emerging markets), geopolitical tensions and deteriorating international trade relations (for example, Brexit), or the global impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic (such as travel restrictions) may have
significant negative impacts on the nation’s economy, including the State.</font></div>
<div>The COVID-19 pandemic created supply chain disruptions that
impacted domestic manufacturing and transportation logistics and reduced trade volumes for the nation and the State. From January through November 2020, exports of goods from the State were 11.2% lower than in the same period in 2019. State imports
of goods from January to November 2020 were 4.1% lower than the same period in 2019. Continued uncertainty surrounding the stability of global supply chains and the unknown duration of the COVID-19 pandemic present ongoing risks to trade by the U.S.
and the State.</div> <div>A material change in or imposition of
tariffs by the federal government on the State’s trading partners could directly and indirectly impact the State’s economy. In 2019, the U.S. imposed tariffs of up to 25% on $250 billion worth of Chinese products, equivalent to half of
the nation’s imports from China. These tariffs triggered Chinese retaliatory tariffs of 25% on over $50 billion worth of U.S. exports. Because California is a transport hub, and China is the State’s largest trading partner, by total
trade value of goods (based on 2019 annual average data), a trade war could have negative effects on the State’s economy. In 2019, merchandise imports from China entering through California totaled 31.7% of the State’s total imports,
down 19.8% from the 2018 pre-tariff level and the largest year-over-year decline since the 9.6% drop in 2009, during the Great Recession. California’s merchandise exports to China accounted for 9.1% of the State’s total exports in 2019,
down 3.2% from 2018.</div> <div>The persistence of trade barriers
exacerbates the supply chain issues triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing the costs of imports purchased from abroad and leading to decreased revenues for companies. These effects potentially impact wages and employment in the short run and
could trigger a change in the business model of companies that until now have made significant investment decisions based on a system of free global trade.</div>
<div>Health Care Costs. <font>Medi-Cal is one of the state’s largest expenditures. The State also provides health benefits to its own employees and retirees. General Fund spending on health care costs is thus heavily dependent
upon the rate of health care cost inflation. If this inflation rises faster than expected, annual General Fund spending could quickly rise by hundreds of millions of dollars. The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic may also significantly increase
General Fund health care costs. See “The State Budget – Health Care Services.”</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Housing
Constraints. <font>The State continues to face a critical housing shortage. Residential housing units authorized by building permits in the State in the first three quarters of 2020 averaged 9.8% lower
than in the same period in 2019. Multi-family units were down by 18.9% in the first three quarters of 2020 relative to the same period in 2019, whereas single-family units were down by only 0.7%. With fewer permits issued, the unprecedented increase
in unemployment and potential for subsequent evictions along with the reluctance of builders to build homes during an economic downturn may worsen the housing shortage. In April 2021, the State disclosed that given its structural housing supply
constraints and shortage, lower-income populations will be especially vulnerable to evictions. The State further disclosed that this may negatively impact the State as Californians will face increasing affordability issues, which may affect their
decisions about where to live. Businesses may subsequently leave as they base their location decisions on the ability of their employees and customers to live nearby.</font></div>
<div>Climate Change. <font>The State historically has been susceptible to wildfires and hydrologic variability. However, as greenhouse gas emissions continue to accumulate, climate change will intensify and increase the frequency
of extreme weather events, such as coastal storm surges, drought, wildfires, floods and heat waves, and raise sea levels along the coast. Over the past several years, the State has already experienced the impacts of climate change through
unprecedented wildfires and a multi-year drought. In 2020, over 4 million acres burned in the State, more than twice the previous record of over 2 million acres in 2018. Wildfires may increase health care costs for Californians. Destruction of
housing also increases the demand for construction resources from rebuilding and worsens the State’s housing imbalances. The future fiscal impact of climate change on the State budget is difficult to predict, but it could be significant.
However, the State is in the process of implementing various resilience measures to reduce the impacts of climate change, including significant investments in wildfire prevention and water infrastructure projects.</font></div>
<div>Flooding and Subsidence. <font>California’s water management infrastructure consists of a complex system of dams, reservoirs, canals, pipes, and pumping facilities. As of 2018, the American Society of Civil Engineers Report
Card for California Infrastructure identified 678 of California’s 1,476 regulated dams as “high-hazard”, meaning that their failure or mis-operation will probably cause loss of human life and significant economic losses. Long-term
subsidence, or sinking, poses serious and challenging concerns for California’s water managers, putting water management and flood control infrastructure, including aqueducts, levees, bridges and roads, at risk. Vast sections of the San
Joaquin Valley have subsided as much as 28 feet since the 1920s. The failure of high hazard dams or other critical flood control infrastructure could materially impact the operations or finances of the State or its local governments.</font></div>
<div>Cybersecurity Risks<font>. The State, like many other large public and private entities, relies on a large and complex technology environment to conduct its operations. The State’s reliance on this environment has
increased due to higher rates of telework as mandated by public health measures. As a recipient and provider of personal, private or sensitive information, the State is subject to multiple cyber threats including, but not limited to, hacking,
viruses, malware and other attacks on computer and other sensitive digital networks and systems.</font></div>
<div>Entities or individuals may attempt to gain unauthorized
access to the State’s digital systems for the purposes of misappropriating assets or information or causing operational disruption and damage. In 2017 the State established a statewide security operations center to protect against malicious
activity targeting critical technology infrastructure. Local governments in the State have experienced similar threats and taken similar measures; however, no assurances can be given that the efforts to manage cyber threats and attacks will be
successful or that any such attack will not materially impact the operations or finances of the State or its local governments.</div>
<div>Federal Census<font>. An undercount in the 2020 Census could particularly disadvantage the state for the next decade when federal funds and legislative seats are apportioned. The State has a significant share of the
population designated “hard-to-count” by the Census Bureau including the foreign-born, children under 5, the non-white population, and renters. While the State accounts for 12% of the U.S. population, it has nearly 22% of the
hard-to-count national population. Although the State implemented a campaign to mitigate the risk of undercount, the COVID-19 pandemic increased the risk of an undercount, particularly when considering mass movement of college-age populations. Data
from the 2020 Census will become the new State benchmark starting with July 2021 estimates to be released in December 2021 and new population projections released in mid-2022.</font></div>

is based primarily upon the most recent publicly available offering statements relating to debt offerings of state and local issuers and other financial and demographic information, as of March 10, 2021 with respect to the City and March 9, 2021
with respect to the State, and it does not reflect recent developments since the dates of such offering statements and other information. Neither the Fund nor its legal counsel has independently verified this information.</div>
<div>The State, some of its agencies, instrumentalities and public
authorities and certain of its municipalities have sometimes faced serious financial difficulties that could have an adverse effect on the sources of payment for, or the market value of, the New York municipal bonds in which the Fund invests.</div>
<div>New York City</div>
<div>General<font>. The City, with an
estimated population of approximately 8.3 million, is an international center of business and culture. Its non-manufacturing economy is broadly based, with the banking, securities, insurance, technology, information, publishing, fashion, design,
retailing, education and health care industries accounting for a significant portion of the City’s total employment earnings. Additionally, the City is a leading tourist destination. Manufacturing activity in the City is conducted primarily in
apparel and printing.</font></div> <div>For each of the 1981
through 2020 fiscal years, the City’s General Fund had an operating surplus, before discretionary and other transfers, and achieved balanced operating results as reported in accordance with then-applicable generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”), after discretionary and other transfers and except for the application of Governmental Accounting Standards Board (“GASB”) Statement No. 49 (“GASB 49”) and without regard to changes in certain
fund balances described in GML Section 25 (as defined below), as described below. City fiscal years end on June 30 and are referred to by the calendar year in which they end. The City has been required to close substantial gaps between forecast
revenues and forecast expenditures in order to maintain balanced operating results. There can be no assurance that the City will continue to maintain balanced operating results as required by State law without proposed tax or other revenue increases
or reductions in City services or entitlement programs, which could adversely affect the City’s economic base.</div>
<div>As required by the New York State Financial Emergency Act For
The City of New York (the “Financial Emergency Act”) and the New York City Charter (the “City Charter”), the City prepares a four-year annual financial plan, which is reviewed and revised on a quarterly basis and which
includes the City’s capital, revenue and expense projections and outlines proposed gap-closing programs for years with projected budget gaps. The City’s current financial plan projects budget balance in the 2021 and 2022 fiscal years in
accordance with GAAP, except for the application of GASB 49 and without regard to changes in certain fund balances pursuant to GML Section 25 (as defined below). In 2010, the Financial Emergency Act was amended to waive the budgetary impact of GASB
49 by enabling the City to continue to finance with bond proceeds certain pollution remediation costs. In 2019, Section 25 of the State General Municipal Law (“GML Section 25”) was amended to address the application to the City of GASB
Statement No. 84, which contained updated requirements for fiduciary funds of state and local governments. Pursuant to GML Section 25, the City may, without violating Expense Budget (as defined below) balance requirements, carry forward to a
subsequent fiscal year unspent fund balances that are restricted as to their use by requirements of State or federal law or regulation or by requirements of private or other governmental parties. The City may also continue to carry forward unspent
balances held in its Health Stabilization Fund, School Crossing Guards Health Insurance Fund and Management Benefits Fund. The City’s current financial plan projects budget gaps for the 2023 through 2025 fiscal years. A pattern of current year
balance and projected future year budget gaps has been consistent through the entire period since 1982, during which the City has achieved an excess of revenues over expenditures, before discretionary transfers, for each fiscal year. The City is
required to submit its financial plans to the New York State Financial Control Board (the “Control Board”).</div>
<div>For its normal operations, the City depends on aid from the
State both to enable the City to balance its budget and to meet its cash requirements. There can be no assurance that there will not be delays or reductions in State aid to the City from amounts currently projected; that State budgets for future
State fiscal years will be adopted by the April 1 statutory deadline, or interim appropriations will be enacted; or that any such reductions or delays will not have adverse effects on the City’s cash flow or expenditures. In addition, the City
has made various assumptions with respect to federal aid. Future federal actions or inactions could have adverse effects on the City, both directly and indirectly through reductions in State aid to localities that will need to be taken in the
absence of additional federal aid to the State.</div> <div>The
Mayor is responsible under the City Charter for preparing the City’s annual expense and capital budgets (as adopted, the “Expense Budget” and the “Capital Budget,” respectively, and collectively, the
“Budgets”) and for submitting the Budgets to the City Council for its review and adoption. The Expense Budget covers the City’s annual operating expenditures for</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>municipal services, while
the Capital Budget covers expenditures for capital projects, as defined in the City Charter. Operations under the Expense Budget must reflect the aggregate expenditure limitations contained in financial plans.</div>
<div>The Mayor is also responsible for preparing the City’s
financial plan, which relates to the City and certain entities that receive funds from the City. The financial plan is modified quarterly. The projections set forth in the financial plan are based on various assumptions and contingencies that are
uncertain and that may not materialize. Such assumptions and contingencies include the condition of the international, national, regional and local economies, the provision of State and federal aid, the impact on City revenues and expenditures of
any future federal or State legislation and policies affecting the City and the costs of pension structures and healthcare.</div>
<div>Implementation of the financial plan is dependent on the
City’s ability to market successfully its bonds and notes. Implementation of the financial plan is also dependent upon the ability to market the securities of other financing entities including the New York City Municipal Water Finance
Authority (the “Water Authority”) and the New York City Transitional Finance Authority (“TFA”). The success of projected public sales of City, Water Authority, TFA and other bonds and notes is subject to prevailing market
conditions. Future developments in the financial markets generally, as well as future developments concerning the City, and public discussion of such developments, may affect the market for outstanding City general obligation bonds and notes.</div>
<div>The City Comptroller and other agencies and public officials,
from time to time, issue reports and make public statements that, among other things, state that projected revenues and expenditures may be different from those forecast in the City’s financial plans.</div>
<div>City Financial Plan<font>. For the
2020 fiscal year, the City’s General Fund had a total surplus of $3.8 billion, before discretionary and other transfers, and achieved balanced operating results in accordance with GAAP, except for the application of GASB 49 and without regard
to changes in certain fund balances pursuant to GML Section 25, as described above, after discretionary and other transfers. The 2020 fiscal year is the 40th consecutive year that the City has achieved balanced operating results when reported in
accordance with GAAP, except for the application of GASB 49 and without regard to changes in certain fund balances pursuant to GML Section 25, as described above.</font></div>
<div>COVID-19</div>
<div>The City has been severely affected by the coronavirus
disease, referred to herein as “COVID-19.” The Governor declared a state of emergency in the State on March 7, 2020, and the Mayor declared a state of emergency in the City on March 12, 2020, each of which remains in effect. During the
pandemic, many businesses in the City have been ordered to close, public schools have operated at various levels of remote and in-person learning, and limitations have been imposed on large gatherings.</div>
<div>The City experienced a surge in cases and deaths during the
spring of 2020. Although cases and deaths declined during the late spring and summer of 2020, they increased again in the fall and winter of 2020-2021. As of February 15, 2021, the City reported a cumulative total of 571,336 COVID-19 cases and
28,341 deaths, including those that were confirmed and those that were probably related to COVID-19, representing approximately 2.1% of COVID-19 cases in the U.S., 5.8% of deaths in the U.S., and 1.2% of deaths globally, with communities of color
suffering disproportionately. COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and death rates will likely fluctuate in the future, and there can be no assurance that COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the City will not increase above current levels or
that business closures and other restrictions will not be expanded during the course of the pandemic.</div>
<div>In December 2020, the United States Food and Drug
Administration issued emergency use authorizations for COVID-19 vaccines developed by two manufacturers. Through February 15, 2021, 925,204 individuals have received at least one dose (of the two recommended doses) of a COVID-19 vaccine in the City,
based on eligibility criteria established by the State.</div>
<div>As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, unemployment
applications throughout the State increased substantially, with approximately 2.4 million in the City between mid-March 2020 and mid-February 2021, as compared to approximately 300,000 for the same period in 2019 and 2020. Following a period of
historically low unemployment in late 2019 and the first two months of 2020, the City’s unemployment rate reached 20.4% in June 2020 and was 11.0% as of December 2020, compared to 3.9% in June 2019 and 3.1% in December 2019. The sudden
cessation of business activity, travel and tourism resulting from the pandemic, and the government’s response to it, has had a devastating impact on the retail, cultural, hospitality and entertainment sectors in the City.</div> </div>

City’s hotel occupancy rate declined by approximately 80% at the end of March and beginning of April 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. For the month of December 2020, the City’s hotel occupancy rate declined approximately 58.3%
compared to December 2019. International arrivals to City airports declined 99% in both April and May 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, and declined 86% in October 2020, the most recent month for which such data is available, compared to the
same period in 2019.</div> <div>Higher unemployment as well as
increased numbers of employees working from home due to the pandemic have stressed the City’s office market. Strict COVID-19 prevention mandates, as well as an essential shutdown of tourism activity, have reduced income for retail stores and
hotels. Residential rent delinquencies significantly higher than average have been reported. Residential sales in the City were down approximately 37% in April through December 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The City’s property tax
revenue projections have declined, as further described below. The longer-term impact on commercial real estate will depend on decisions of major office tenants regarding density, remote work and relocation of operations out of the City.</div>
<div>The COVID-19 pandemic and economic disruption resulting from
measures to contain it have resulted in reductions in the City’s fiscal year 2020 revenues and projected revenues. Total revenues from City funds are projected to be $4.6 billion (6.5%), $5.7 billion (7.8%), $5.1 billion (6.8%) and $4.86
billion (6.8%) lower in fiscal years 2021 through 2024, respectively, than projected in the financial plan in January 2020. Such reductions include projected reductions in property tax revenues of $324 million (1%), $2.9 billion (9%), $3.2 billion
(9.7%) and $3.5 billion (10.2%) in fiscal years 2021 through 2025, respectively, from amounts projected in the financial plan in January 2020. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the amount and timing of collections of City revenues
cannot be determined at this time. Further reductions in property tax revenues may occur. Additional changes in employment and earnings subject to the personal income tax, as well as reductions in economic activity subject to the sales tax, may also
occur, including, but not limited to, reductions in personal income tax revenues due to changes in residency status resulting from remote work outside the City and other employment-related changes. No assurance can be provided that the COVID-19
pandemic and resulting economic disruption will not result in revenues to the City that are lower than projected herein.</div>
<div>As a result of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021
(“American Rescue Plan”), signed into law by President Biden on March 11, 2021, the City expects to receive additional federal stimulus aid of approximately $2.9 billion in each of fiscal years 2021 and 2022. Such federal aid is expected
to be available for purposes related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including replacing reduced tax revenues, and is not currently assumed in the Financial Plan.</div>
<div>2021-2025 Financial Plan</div>
<div>On June 30, 2020, the City submitted to the Control Board the
financial plan for the 2021 through 2024 fiscal years (the “June Financial Plan”), which was consistent with the City’s capital and expense budgets as adopted for the 2020 fiscal year. On November 23, 2020, the City submitted to
the Control Board a modification to the June Financial Plan (as so modified, the “November Financial Plan”). On January 14, 2021, the Mayor released his preliminary budget for the 2022 fiscal year and the City submitted to the Control
Board a modification to the financial plan for the 2021 through 2025 fiscal years (as so modified, the “Financial Plan”).</div>
<div>The Financial Plan projects revenues and expenses for the 2021
and 2022 fiscal years balanced in accordance with GAAP, except for the application of GASB 49 and without regard to changes in certain fund balances pursuant to GML Section 25, and projects gaps of approximately $4.31 billion, $4.19 billion and
$4.28 billion in fiscal years 2023 through 2025, respectively. The June Financial Plan had projected revenues and expenses for the 2021 fiscal year balanced in accordance with GAAP, except for the application of GASB 49 and without regard to changes
in certain fund balances pursuant to GML Section 25, and had projected gaps of approximately $4.18 billion, $3.04 billion and $3.18 billion in fiscal years 2022 through 2024, respectively.</div>
<div>The Financial Plan reflects, since the June Financial Plan, an
increase in projected net revenues of $2.50 billion in fiscal year 2021 and decreases in projected net revenues of $1.58 billion, $1.88 billion and $1.22 billion in fiscal years 2022 through 2024, respectively. Changes in projected revenues include:
(i) decreases in real property tax revenues of $2.50 billion, $2.70 billion and $2.64 billion in fiscal years 2022 through 2024, respectively; (ii) increases in personal income tax revenues of $1.07 billion, $531 million, $528 million and $506

include: (i) increases in agency expenses of $1.53 billion, $140 million, $81 million and $92 million in fiscal years 2021 through 2024, respectively; (ii) decreases in various expenses included in the Citywide Savings Program of $424 million, $1.24
billion, $585 million and $592 million in fiscal years 2021 through 2024, respectively (including savings of $57.2 million and $292.1 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2022, respectively, related to a hiring plan that allows for the hiring of only
one employee for every three departures); (iii) decreases in debt service of $900 million, $625 million, $206 million and $301 million in fiscal years 2021 through 2024, respectively, primarily as a result of lower interest rates and debt
refinancing; (iv) a decrease of $100 million in reimbursement of the prior year’s Medicaid expenses in fiscal year 2021; (v) decreases in pension contributions of $430 million and $220 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2022, respectively, and
increases in pension contributions of $94 million and $590 million in fiscal years 2023 and 2024, respectively, primarily as a result of the net impact of changes in assumptions and methods proposed by the City Actuary and subject to adoption by the
respective pension boards, whereby gains from investments (fiscal year 2019 and prior) are recognized immediately instead of over a six-year period and the costs of a phased-in reduction over four years of the actuarial interest rate assumption from
7% (which is expiring) to 6.8%, subject to State legislative approval; (vi) decreases in the general reserve of $50 million and $900 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2022, respectively; (vii) a decrease in the capital stabilization reserve of $250
million in fiscal year 2022; and (viii) a decrease of $421 million in fiscal year 2021 reflecting a re-estimate of prior years’ expenses and receivables.</div>
<div>The Financial Plan reflects, since the June Financial Plan,
provision for $3.36 billion for the prepayment in fiscal year 2021 of fiscal year 2022 expenses and an expenditure reduction of $3.36 billion in fiscal year 2022.</div>
<div>The Financial Plan reflects the deferral of $691 million in
fiscal year 2021 labor costs into fiscal year 2022 as agreed to with various municipal unions through voluntary agreements or arbitration decisions. This includes the United Federation of Teachers (“UFT”), the District Council 37 of
AFSME (“DC 37”), and Council of School Supervisors &amp; Administrators. The Financial Plan also recognizes approximately $60 million in labor savings in fiscal year 2021 for costs that were to be paid by the City that are now being
funded by NYCHH. In addition, the Financial Plan continues to recognize an additional $290 million of as yet to be identified labor savings in fiscal year 2021.</div>
<div>The Financial Plan reflects total federal aid of $11.87
billion, $7.01 billion, $6.95 billion, $6.93 billion and $6.92 billion in fiscal years 2021 through 2025, respectively, including $3.54 billion of federal aid in fiscal year 2021 relating to the outbreak of COVID-19, all of which has been
authorized. Although the City is seeking additional federal aid to address the impact of COVID-19, such additional aid is not reflected in the Financial Plan. Although the City previously sought State legislation authorizing the issuance of bonds to
finance costs arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, it is not seeking such legislation at this time.</div>
<div>The Financial Plan reflects $41 million in fiscal year 2021
and $53 million in fiscal year 2022 for the cost of the Fair Fares Program, which provides reduced fares to low-income subway and bus riders, but does not reflect funding beyond fiscal year 2022. It is expected that funding sources for the
continuation of the program will be identified in coordination with the City Council.</div>
<div>The Financial Plan reflects the intercept by the State of $250
million and $150 million in sales taxes in fiscal years 2021 and 2022, respectively, otherwise payable to the City, to provide assistance to distressed hospitals and nursing homes.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

Financial Plan assumes the continued sale of real property tax liens through the lien sale program in each fiscal year, with the exception of fiscal year 2021, for which no lien sale is assumed. The Financial Plan reflects revenues in fiscal year
2021 from the lien sale program of $16 million from trusts established in connection with prior lien sales, along with a deferral of $96 million until fiscal year 2022. The Financial Plan further assumes that, due to COVID-19, real property tax
delinquencies as a percentage of property tax levy will change from 1.8% in fiscal year 2020 to 2.6%, 2.5%, 1.6% 1.5% and 1.4% in fiscal years 2021 through 2025, respectively. The authorization to sell real property tax liens expired on December 31,
2020. On January 28, 2021, the City Council passed a bill extending the City’s lien sale authorization through March 1, 2022. In the event that the program is not re-authorized beyond such date, real property tax delinquencies could increase
beyond the rates assumed in the Financial Plan. Each 1% increase in delinquencies would reduce property tax revenues by $318 million in fiscal year 2022, $323 million in fiscal year 2023, $328 million in fiscal year 2024 and $332 million in fiscal
year 2025.</div> <div>The Financial Plan does not reflect the
potential impact of proposals contained in the Governor’s Executive Budget, which was released on January 19, 2021 (the “Governor’s Executive Budget”). Such proposals, if enacted, are projected to have a total cost to the
City of $310 million and $309 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2022, respectively, and $251 million in each of fiscal years 2023 through 2025. Such costs include (i) elimination of charter school facilities aid of $150 million in fiscal year 2021
and $100 million in each of fiscal years 2022 through 2025; (ii) no reimbursement from the State for $92 million in transportation expenses incurred during school closures due to COVID-19 in fiscal year 2021; (iii) a reduction in the charter school
per-pupil tuition rate of $29 million in fiscal year 2021; (iv) reduction of reimbursement for public health services of approximately $35 million in each of fiscal years 2022 through 2025; (v) a 5% across the board reduction in Office of Children
and Family Services and the Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance funding, which would result in combined payments to the City of $28.3 million in fiscal year 2021 and $43.75 million in each of fiscal years 2022 through 2025 lower than
assumed in the Financial Plan; (vi) a reduction of annual State funding that offsets the City’s subsidies for MTA Bus and the Staten Island Ferry, which would reduce payments to the City by $6.35 million in fiscal year 2021, and $25.38 million
each of fiscal years 2022 through 2025. The Financial Plan also does not reflect the Governor’s proposal to require employers to provide eight hours of paid time off for COVID-19 vaccinations, which is one additional hour beyond the
City’s proposal and would cost $10 million in fiscal year 2021 and $20 million in fiscal year 2022 beyond the amounts assumed in the Financial Plan. The Governor’s Executive Budget also includes proposed legislation that would enable to
State to discontinue its annual payments covering debt service on STAR Corp. bonds if such bonds were refinanced with State supported debt.</div>
<div>State legislation authorizes the State Budget Director to make
periodic adjustments to nearly all State spending, including State aid, in the event that actual State revenues come in below 99% of estimates or if actual disbursements exceed 101% of estimates. Specifically, the legislation provides that the State
Budget Director will determine whether the State 2021 Budget is balanced during three “measurement periods”: April 1 to April 30, May 1 to June 30, and July 1 to December 31. According to the legislation, if a State General Fund
imbalance has occurred during any measurement period, the State Budget Director will be empowered to adjust or reduce any general fund and/or State special revenue fund appropriation and related cash disbursement by any amount needed to maintain a
balanced budget. The legislation further provides that, prior to making any adjustments or reductions, the State Budget Director must notify the Legislature in writing and the Legislature has 10 days following receipt of such notice to prepare and
approve its own plan. If the Legislature fails to approve its own plan, the State Budget Director’s reductions will take effect automatically. Additionally, the State Budget Director may withhold State aid in the event there is a budgetary
imbalance and such withholdings are necessary to address the financial, economic, and social effects of COVID-19. A budgetary imbalance is defined as actual State revenues being below 99% of estimates or if actual disbursements exceed 101% of
estimates, for any period during the State fiscal year. Withholdings made under this authorization require notification to the Legislature, but the Legislature does not have an opportunity to approve any alternative withholding plan. On April 25,
2020, the State projected a $13.3 billion shortfall as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in October 2020 increased the projected shortfall to $14.9 billion. To address budget gaps, the State has delayed payments of at least $800 million to
the City in fiscal year 2021. However, the Governor announced that 75% of such withholdings will be restored by March 2021. Additionally, the Governor’s Executive Budget contains authorization for the New York State Division of the Budget to
withhold appropriations in the State’s 2021-2022 fiscal year if the State does not receive at least $3 billion in unrestricted federal aid by August 31, 2021. Reductions or continued delays in the payment of State aid as described above could
adversely affect the financial condition of the City.</div>
<div>The Financial Plan does not reflect (i) estimated school aid
that is at least $721 million, $827 million, $497 million, and $152 million lower than assumed in the Financial Plan in fiscal years 2022 through 2025, respectively; (ii) the potential impact on the City of a State initiative to redesign its
Medicaid program to achieve $2.5 billion in savings statewide, which is unknown at this time; and (iii) $2.8 billion of the $3 billion the City is required to contribute to the MTA 2020-2024 capital plan, on a schedule concurrent with the
State’s $3 billion contribution to be set by the State Budget Director. The Financial Plan also</div> </div> <div type="Block">

impact, in fiscal years 2022 through 2024, respectively, of a requirement that the City increase its funding of the MTA’s net paratransit operating deficit from 33% to 50%. The Financial Plan reflects $238 million in fiscal year 2021 and $175
million in each of fiscal years 2022 through 2024 to cover the City’s contributions for paratransit services, compared to MTA’s estimate of such costs of $201 million, $256 million, $285 million and $304 million in such fiscal
years.</div> <div>The Financial Plan does not reflect future
increases in the charter school per-pupil tuition rate, which, if not offset by changes to State education aid to the City that occur each year during the State budget process, are preliminarily estimated to cost the City $154 million in fiscal year
2022, $282 million in fiscal year 2023, $433 million in fiscal year 2024 and $625 million in fiscal year 2025. These figures are based on preliminary data. Final figures that would determine the actual costs to the City will not be finalized until
the time of the State budget process for the applicable year. The Financial Plan also does not reflect approximately $70 million in increased charter school costs in fiscal year 2021 attributable to an increase in enrollment for such year.</div>
<div>The Financial Plan does not reflect funding to cover projected
increases in the annual operating deficit of the MTA Bus Company, which the City is obligated to fund. The Financial Plan reflects $456 million in each of fiscal years 2021 through 2024, compared to MTA’s estimate of such costs of $588
million, $726 million, $701 million and $693 million in such fiscal years, based on the MTA’s financial plan released in November 2020.</div>
<div>The Financial Plan does not reflect: (i) the restoration of
Fair Student Funding, which provides direct funding to support schools, at a cost of $150 million in fiscal year 2022; (ii) the restoration of the expansion for the 3K pre-school program at a cost of approximately $44 million in fiscal year 2022;
and (iii) funding for a tax rebate for certain one-to-three family homes currently estimated to be up to $90 million in fiscal year 2022, each of which was proposed by the Mayor after the release of the Financial Plan.</div>
<div>State legislation provides for congestion tolling for vehicles
entering a designated congestion zone in Manhattan below 60th Street, the revenues from which will be directed to the MTA for transit improvements. Details of the plan, including pricing and the start date, have yet to be determined. The start date
could be delayed until 2023 due to a delay in receiving guidance from the federal government on an environmental assessment.</div>
<div>The Financial Plan reflects no wage increases for two years
following the expiration of the current labor contracts covering the 2017-2021 round of collective bargaining, followed by annual 1% wage increases.</div>
<div>The Financial Plan assumes that the City’s direct costs
(including costs of NYCHH and NYCHA) as a result of Superstorm Sandy (“Sandy”) will largely be paid from non-City sources, primarily the federal government. In addition to such direct costs, the City is delivering Sandy-related disaster
recovery assistance services, benefiting impacted communities, businesses, homeowners and renters (“Community Costs”). The City anticipates that funding for Community Costs will be primarily reimbursed with federal funds. However, the
City is responsible for $134 million of such Community Costs, which are reflected in the Financial Plan. The City may also be responsible for up to approximately $150 million of additional Community Costs, which are not currently reflected in the
Financial Plan.</div> <div>On January 31, 2019, the New York City
Housing Authority (“NYCHA”), the City and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) entered into an agreement relating to lead-based paint and other health and safety concerns in NYCHA’s properties.
Pursuant to this agreement, a federal monitor has been appointed to oversee NYCHA’s compliance with the terms of the agreement and federal regulations, and the City will provide additional funding. Pursuant to the agreement, the City’s
five-year capital commitment plan for fiscal years 2021 through 2025, which covers the current fiscal year and the four-year capital plan for fiscal years 2022 through 2025 (the “2021-2025 Capital Commitment Plan”), reflects $1.2 billion
in additional City capital funds, with an additional $1 billion in City capital funds reflected in the remaining years of the Ten-Year Capital Strategy for fiscal years 2020 through 2029. NYCHA has announced that it may be out of compliance with
federal requirements beyond the regulations concerning lead-based paint and other health and safety concerns that were the subject of such agreement. NYCHA’s 2017 Physical Needs Assessment estimated its projected capital costs at approximately
$32 billion over the next five years. In January 2020, NYCHA’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer stated that such costs were $40 billion. In July 2020, NYCHA announced a plan to carry out capital improvements to approximately 110,000 public
housing units through a federal disposition process that would utilize a newly created public entity, the creation of which would require State legislative approval. The plan seeks to generate funds by borrowing against pooled federal Tenant
Protection Vouchers, which are federal rental vouchers with a higher value than the Section 9 operating subsidy that NYCHA currently receives. The plan does not explicitly require City investment or directly impact the Financial Plan.</div> </div>

2018, the Mayor and the Speaker of the City Council established the New York City Advisory Commission on Property Tax Reform (the “Commission”) to consider changes to the City’s property taxation system, without reducing property
tax revenues to the City. On January 31, 2020, the Commission released its preliminary report and recommendations which, among other things, would align the taxable value of certain properties more closely with market value. The Commission is
expected to hold public hearings to solicit public input on its preliminary report. The implementation of a new property tax system would require State legislation.</div>
<div>On February 11, 2021, the Mayor signed an Executive Order
establishing a Revenue Stabilization Account, which had been previously authorized by an amendment to the City Charter and the enactment of enabling State legislation. The initial deposit into such Revenue Stabilization Account consists of
approximately $493 million, representing accumulated surpluses from prior fiscal years.</div>
<div>Section 1518 of the City Charter provides that tax warrants
authorizing the imposition of property taxes by the City are to be signed by the Public Advocate and counter-signed by the City Clerk. On July 1, 2020, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams announced he would not sign tax warrants for City property taxes
due on January 1, 2021 and April 1, 2021 for policy reasons related to the City budget but unrelated to the imposition of property taxes and, to the date of the Financial Plan, has not signed the tax warrants. The City issued bills for property
taxes due on January 1, 2021 and April 1, 2021 and intends to collect payments on all such bills. On March 8, 2021, the Public Advocate filed an Article 78 petition in New York State Supreme Court in New York County asking the Court to issue an
order prohibiting the City from filing borough property tax assessment rolls and warrants or issuing adjusted property tax bills and quarterly statements unless the related tax warrants have been signed by the Public Advocate and countersigned by
the City Clerk. The City maintains that the City Charter requirement that the Public Advocate sign the tax warrants is ministerial in nature and that the property taxes were properly imposed. The City intends to vigorously challenge the Public
Advocate’s petition.</div> <div>The City’s Preliminary
Ten-Year Capital Strategy for fiscal years 2022 through 2031 (the “Preliminary Ten-Year Capital Strategy”) reflects approximately $1.6 billion for reconstruction work on the Brooklyn Queens Expressway Triple Cantilever. The ultimate cost
and scope of such reconstruction are uncertain at this time, but costs could be significantly higher than currently provided in the City’s Capital Budget.</div>
<div>From time to time, the City Comptroller, the Control Board
staff, the Office of the State Deputy Comptroller for the City of New York (“OSDC”), the Independent Budget Office (“IBO”) and others issue reports and make public statements regarding the City’s financial condition,
commenting on, among other matters, the City’s financial plans, projected revenues and expenditures and actions by the City to eliminate projected operating deficits. It is reasonable to expect that reports and statements will continue to be
issued and may contain different perspectives on the City’s budget and economy and may engender public comment. For information on reports issued on the November Financial Plan and the Financial Plan by the City Comptroller and others
reviewing, commenting on and identifying various risks therein, see “Certain Reports.”</div>
<div>Job Growth<font>. The City is a
leading center for the banking and securities industry, life insurance, communications, fashion design, health care, education, technology, information services, hospitality and retail fields. Over the past two decades, the City has experienced a
number of business cycles. From 1992 to 2000, the City added 456,500 private sector jobs (growth of 17%). From 2000 to 2003, the City lost 173,200 private sector jobs (decline of 5%). From 2003 to 2008, the City added 257,600 private sector jobs
(growth of 9%). From 2008 to 2009, the City lost 103,100 private sector jobs (decline of 3%). From 2009 to 2019, the City added 918,800 private sector jobs (growth of 29%). All such changes are based on average annual employment levels through and
including the years referenced.</font></div> <div>As of December
2020, total employment in the City was 4,161,800 compared to 4,739,800 in December 2019, a decrease of approximately 12.2% based on data provided by the New York State Department of Labor, which is not seasonally adjusted. Following the onset of the
COVID-19 pandemic and the City and State actions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, the City has seen a large increase in initial claims for unemployment. Since the week ending March 14, 2020 through the week ending February 6, 2021, there have
been 2,379,605 initial claims for unemployment insurance in New York City, compared to 299,522 over the same period in 2019.</div>
<div>Assumptions. <font>The Financial
Plan is based on numerous assumptions, including the condition of the City’s and the region’s economies and the concomitant receipt of economically sensitive tax revenues in the amounts projected. The Financial Plan is subject to various
other uncertainties and contingencies relating to, among other factors, the extent, if any, to which wage increases for City employees exceed the annual wage costs assumed; realization of projected earnings for pension fund assets and current
assumptions with respect to wages for City employees affecting the City’s required pension fund</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

willingness and ability of the State to provide the aid contemplated by the Financial Plan and to take various other actions to assist the City; the ability of NYCHH and other such entities to maintain balanced budgets; the willingness of the
federal government to provide the amount of federal aid contemplated in the Financial Plan; the impact on City revenues and expenditures of federal and State legislation affecting Medicare or other entitlement programs; adoption of the City’s
budgets by the City Council in substantially the forms submitted by the Mayor; the ability of the City to implement cost reduction initiatives, and the success with which the City controls expenditures; the impact of conditions in the real estate
market on real estate tax revenues; the ability of the City and other financing entities to market their securities successfully in the public credit markets; the impact of the outbreak of COVID-19; and the extension of the authorization to sell
real property tax liens. Certain of these assumptions are reviewed in reports issued by the City Comptroller and other public officials. See “Certain Reports” herein.</div>
<div>The projections and assumptions contained in the Financial
Plan are subject to revision, which may be substantial. No assurance can be given that these estimates and projections, which include actions the City expects will be taken but are not within the City’s control, will be realized.</div>
<div>Real Estate Tax<font>. Projections
of real estate tax revenues are based on a number of assumptions, including, among others, assumptions relating to the tax rate, the assessed valuation of the City’s taxable real estate, the delinquency rate, debt service needs, a reserve for
uncollectible taxes and the operating limit.</font></div>
<div>Projections of real estate tax revenues include net revenues
from the sale of real property tax liens of $16 million in fiscal year 2021, $128 million in fiscal year 2022 and $80 million in each of fiscal years 2023 through 2025. Projections of real estate tax revenues include the effects of the STAR Program,
which will reduce the real estate tax revenues by an estimated $154 million in fiscal year 2021 and $152 million, $150 million, $148 million and $146 million in fiscal years 2022 through 2025, respectively. Projections of real estate tax revenues
reflect the estimated cost of extending the current tax reduction for owners of cooperative and condominium apartments amounting to $667 million, $614 million, $624 million, $632 million and $639 million in fiscal years 2021 through 2025,
respectively.</div> <div>The delinquency rate was 1.4% in fiscal
year 2016, 1.3% in fiscal year 2017, 1.2% in fiscal year 2018, 1.2% in fiscal year 2019 and 1.8% in fiscal year 2020. The Financial Plan projects delinquency rates of 2.6% in fiscal year 2021, 2.5% in fiscal year 2022, 1.6% in fiscal year 2023, 1.5%
in fiscal year 2024 and 1.4% in fiscal year 2025.</div> <div>On
April 24, 2017, a lawsuit was filed challenging the City’s real property tax system and valuation methodology. The action alleges that the City’s real property tax system violates the State and federal constitutions as well as the Fair
Housing Act. The action further alleges the valuation methodology as mandated by certain provisions of the State Real Property Tax Law results in a disparity and inequality in the amount of taxes paid by Black and Hispanic Class 1 property owners
and renters. In a decision dated February 27, 2020, the Appellate Division, First Department granted the City’s motion to dismiss and dismissed all claims against the City. On September 15, 2020, the New York Court of Appeals dismissed a
motion for the plaintiffs’ purported appeal as of right of the First Department rulings. Plaintiff has indicated that it intends to explore its appellate options. The City plans to mount a vigorous defense against all claims made in the
action.</div> <div>Other Taxes<font>. The
Financial Plan reflects the following assumptions regarding projected baseline revenues from other Taxes: (i) with respect to the personal income tax, a steep drop in fiscal year 2021 revenues triggered by both a lower forecast for total wages and
lower non-wage sources attributable to the continued effects of COVID-19, moderate to strong growth in fiscal year 2022 revenues, as total wages are expected to recover, and continued moderate growth on average in fiscal years 2023 through 2025;
(ii) with respect to the business corporation tax, a steep decline in fiscal year 2021 reflecting the losses both Main Street and Wall Street businesses face due to the worsening economy resulting from COVID-19, strong growth in fiscal year 2022 as
the impact of COVID-19 wanes, and moderate to slightly negative changes in fiscal years 2023 through 2025; (iii) with respect to the unincorporated business income tax, a small decline in growth for fiscal year 2021 following the prior year’s
decline, reflecting a drop in tax payments due to the impact of COVID-19 on many industry sectors such as hospitality, entertainment, food and beverage and general retail, a return to more average growth in fiscal year 2022 reflecting an improved
economic situation in the City, and a return to moderate growth in fiscal years 2023 through 2025 reflecting the control of the pandemic and, consequently, economic growth; (iv) with respect to the sales tax, a decline in growth in fiscal year 2021
following the prior year’s decline, reflecting that consumer spending due to the pandemic will remain constrained through most of fiscal year 2021 as economic uncertainty and job loss will influence individuals to save and spend mainly on
essentials, with tourism, hospitality and entertainment spending remaining severely hampered due to COVID-19, a rebound in growth in fiscal years 2022 and 2023 from increased consumer spending due to pent-up demand</font></div> </div>

reflecting a drop in the number of transactions due to the impact of COVID-19 as well as weakness in high end residential transactions that existed before the COVID-19 shut-down, strong growth in fiscal years 2022 and 2023 as the City’s
economy rebounds and steady trend growth in fiscal years 2024 and 2025 reflecting steady economic growth; (vi) with respect to the mortgage recording tax, a decline in fiscal year 2021 mirroring weakness in transaction activity, a strong rebound in

normal operations, the City depends on aid from the State both to enable the City to balance its budget and to meet its cash requirements. There can be no assurance that there will not be delays or reductions in State aid to the City from amounts
currently projected; that State budgets for future State fiscal years will be adopted by the April 1 statutory deadline, or interim appropriations will be enacted; or that any such reductions or delays will not have adverse effects on the
City’s cash flow or expenditures. In addition, the City and the State have made various assumptions with respect to federal aid. Future federal actions or inactions could have adverse effects on the City, both directly and indirectly through
reductions in State aid to localities that will need to be taken in the absence of additional federal aid to the State.</font></div>
<div>Personal Service Costs and Other Post-Employment Benefits<font>. The Financial Plan projects that the authorized number of City-funded full-time and full-time equivalent employees will decrease from an estimated level of 270,999 as of June 30, 2021 to an estimated level of 270,512
by June 30, 2025.</font></div> <div>Other fringe benefits includes
$2.751 billion, $3.075 billion, $3.219 billion, $3.426 billion and $3.592 billion in fiscal years 2021 through 2025, respectively, for post-employment benefits other than pensions (“OPEB”) expenditures for current retirees, which costs
are currently paid by the City on a pay-as-you-go basis.</div>
<div>The Financial Plan reflects contract settlements with DC 37
and the UFT and others (which, together, represent nearly 84% of the City’s unionized workforce) and the application of the pattern increases established in those settlements to the entire workforce over a 43-month contract period. The pattern
framework provides for a 2% wage increase on the first month of the contract, a 2.25% wage increase on the 13th month, and a 3% wage increase on the 26th month. The pattern also provides funding equivalent to 0.5% of wages to be used to fund benefit
items. The DC 37 settlement covers the period from September 26, 2017 through May 25, 2021. The UFT settlement covers the period from February 14, 2019 through September 13, 2022. Such settlements also include health insurance savings as part of a
new Municipal Labor Committee (“MLC”) agreement (the “2018 MLC Agreement”), in addition to those previously agreed upon.</div>
<div>In December 2019, the Uniformed Officers Coalition, consisting
of eight uniformed unions, reached a settlement with the City. The settlement set the pattern for uniformed force employees in the 2017-2021 round of collective bargaining over a 36-month period, with increases of 2.25% effective the first day, 2.5%
as of the 13th month, and 3% as of the 25th month. The cost of the uniformed pattern settlement is reflected in the reserve for collective bargaining in the Financial Plan. Contracts with the five remaining uniformed unions remain unsettled. One of
the unsettled unions, the Police Benevolent Association, has filed for arbitration over new contract terms. Arbitration proceedings are currently on hold as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.</div>
<div>The amounts in the Financial Plan reflect the offsets from
health insurance savings of $600 million in fiscal year 2021 and thereafter. These savings are pursuant to the 2018 MLC Agreement. The City has the right to enforce the agreement through a binding arbitration process. If total health insurance
savings in fiscal year 2021 are greater than $600 million, the first $68 million of such additional savings will be used by the City to make a $100 per member per year increase to welfare funds effective July 1, 2021. If a savings amount over $600
million but less than $668 million is achieved, the $100 per member per year increase will be prorated. Any savings thereafter are to be divided equally between the City and the unions. These savings are in addition to the $3.4 billion of health
insurance savings the City achieved in fiscal years 2015 through 2018, $1.3 billion of which are recurring, which were negotiated pursuant to a previous MLC agreement.</div>
<div>The Financial Plan reflects no wage increases for two years
following the expiration of the current labor contracts covering the 2017-2021 round of collective bargaining, followed by annual 1% wage increases. The Financial Plan further reflects decreases in labor expenses of $1 billion in each of fiscal
years 2021 through 2025. The Financial Plan reflects the deferral of $691 million in fiscal year 2021 labor costs into fiscal year 2022 as agreed to with various municipal unions through voluntary</div> </div>

decisions. This includes the UFT, DC 37, and Council of School Supervisors &amp; Administrators. The Financial Plan also recognizes approximately $20 million in savings from more than 9,000 unrepresented employees being furloughed for five days
between October 2020 and March 2021. The Financial Plan also reflects savings of $57.2 million, $292.1 million, $351.0 million, $357.4 million and $363.8 million in fiscal years 2021 through 2025, respectively, related to a hiring plan that allows
for the hiring of one only employee for every three departures. In fiscal year 2022, the hiring plan is expected to reduce City headcount by approximately 5,000 positions. In addition, the Financial Plan continues to recognize an additional $290
million of as yet to be identified labor savings in fiscal year 2021. The unions covered by the deferrals are covered by a no-layoff pledge that expires on June 30, 2021 unless the City receives federal stimulus or borrowing authority totaling $5
billion, in which case the no-layoff pledge would be extended to June 30, 2022. Employees not represented by those groups are not covered by the no-layoff pledge.</div>
<div>Administrative Other Than Personal Services <font>(“</font>OTPS<font>”)</font> and Energy Costs<font>. The Financial Plan contains estimates of the City’s administrative OTPS expenditures for
general supplies and materials, equipment and selected contractual services, and the impact of agency gap-closing actions relating to such expenditures in the 2021 fiscal year. Thereafter, to account for inflation, administrative OTPS expenditures
are projected to rise by 2.5% annually in fiscal years 2021 through 2025. Energy costs for each of the 2021 through 2025 fiscal years are assumed to vary annually, with total energy expenditures projected at $884 million in fiscal year 2021 and
increasing to $1.1 billion by fiscal year 2025.</font></div>
<div>Public Assistance<font>. Of total
cash assistance expenditures in the City, the City-funded portion is projected to be $845 million in fiscal year 2021 and $890 million in each of fiscal years 2022 through 2025.</font></div>
<div>Medical Assistance<font>. Medical
assistance payments projected in the Financial Plan consist of payments to voluntary hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, intermediate care facilities, home care providers, pharmacies, managed care organizations, physicians and other medical
practitioners. The City-funded portion of medical assistance payments is estimated at $5.5 billion for the 2021 fiscal year and is expected to be $5.8 billion in each of fiscal years 2022 through 2025. Such payments include the City’s capped
share of local Medicaid expenditures as well as Supplemental Medicaid payments to NYCHH.</font></div>
<div>New York City Health and Hospitals<font>. NYCHH, which provides essential services to over 1.1 million New Yorkers annually, faces near- and long-term financial challenges resulting from, among other things, changes in hospital reimbursement under the
Affordable Care Act and the statewide transition to managed care. On April 26, 2016, the City released “One New York: Health Care for Our Neighborhoods,” a report outlining the City’s plan to address NYCHH’s financial
shortfall.</font></div> <div>In February 2021, NYCHH released a
cash-based financial plan, which projected City-funded expenditures of $1.9 billion and $1.5 billion in fiscal years 2021 and 2022, respectively, and $1.3 billion in each of fiscal years 2023 through 2025, in addition to the forgiveness of debt
service in fiscal years 2022 through 2025 and the City’s contribution to supplemental Medicaid payments, which is consistent with the City’s Financial Plan. NYCHH’s financial plan projected total receipts of $11.0 billion, $8.8
billion, $9.0 billion, $8.5 billion and $8.4 billion, and total disbursements of $11.1 billion, $9.1 billion, $8.8 billion, $8.7 billion and $8.6 billion in fiscal years 2021 through 2025, respectively.</div>
<div>NYCHH relies on significant projected revenue from Medicaid,
Medicare and other third-party payor programs. Future changes to such programs could have adverse impacts on NYCHH’s financial condition.</div>
<div>Other<font>. The projections set
forth in the Financial Plan for OTPS-Other include the City’s contributions to New York City Transit (“NYCT”), NYCHA, City University of New York (“CUNY”) and subsidies to libraries and various cultural institutions.
They also include projections for the cost of future judgments and claims, which are discussed below under “Judgments and Claims.” In the past, the City has provided additional assistance to certain State governmental agencies, public
authorities or public benefit corporations which receive or may receive monies from the City directly, indirectly or contingently (“Covered Organizations”) that had exhausted their financial resources prior to the end of the fiscal year.
No assurance can be given that similar additional assistance will not be required in the future.</font></div>
<div>New York City Transit. <font>NYCT
operates under its own section of the Financial Plan as a Covered Organization. A financial plan for NYCT covering its 2021 through 2024 fiscal years was published in November 2020 (the “2021 NYCT Financial Plan”). An updated NYCT
financial plan was released on February 18, 2021 and is currently under review by OMB. The statement below presents information from the 2021 NYCT Financial Plan released in November 2020. The NYCT fiscal year coincides with the calendar year. The
2021 NYCT Financial Plan reflects the impacts of the outbreak of COVID-19 on MTA costs and the resulting ridership decline. The 2021 NYCT Financial Plan reflects City assistance to the NYCT operating budget of $366.8. million in 2020, increasing to
$536.3 million in 2024. In addition, the 2021 NYCT Financial Plan projects real estate transfer tax revenue</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

$384.3 million in 2020, increasing to $438.2 million in 2024. The 2021 NYCT Financial Plan includes decreased expected fare box revenue based on projected lower ridership and reflects funding for MTA’s COVID-19 relief efforts. Based on OMB
review and analysis, the NYCT accrual-based financial plan reflects $9.0 billion in revenues and $14.3 billion in expenses for 2020, leaving a budget gap of $5.3 billion. After accounting for accrual adjustments and cash carried over from 2019,
operating budget gaps of $1.6 billion in 2020, $6.5 billion in 2021, $9.2 billion in 2021, $11.1 billion in 2023 and $13.1 billion in 2024 are projected.</div>
<div>In 2009, a Payroll Mobility Tax (“PMT”) was
enacted into State law to provide $0.34 for every $100 of payroll in the MTA’s 12-county service area. The PMT is currently expected to generate revenues for the MTA of $637.0 million in 2020, increasing to $851.7 million in 2024.</div>
<div>The MTA faces serious budget shortfalls from historic declines
in fare, toll, and tax revenues as a result of the outbreak of COVID-19. City-subsidized services such as Paratransit, the MTA Bus Company, and Staten Island Rapid Transit Operating Authority have been negatively impacted by COVID-19. While funding
from the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) has offset shortfalls in revenues and helped to pay for additional cleaning costs, the impact on the City’s payments to the MTA is dependent on
future uncertainties such as additional federal funding, ridership trends, ongoing cleaning costs, and service adjustments. The MTA expects to receive an additional $4 billion from the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, signed into law by
President Trump on December 27, 2020. After the new federal aid is applied in 2021, the MTA anticipates a remaining $8 billion cumulative operating deficit through 2024 based on the financial plan published in November 2020.</div>
<div>The 2015-2019 Capital Program currently includes $33.9 billion
for all MTA agencies, including $16.7 billion to be invested in the NYCT core system and $1.7 billion for NYCT network expansion. The State has agreed to contribute $9.1 billion towards the 2015-2019 Capital Program. The City has agreed to
contribute $2.656 billion. Of the City’s contribution, $2.056 billion has been reflected in the City’s 2021-2025 Capital Commitment Plan, including $164.0 million for the Subway Action Plan. The remaining $600 million will come from
joint ventures, such as development deals, which will not flow through the City budget.</div>
<div>On September 19, 2019, the MTA released its 2020-2024 Capital
Program, which took effect by default in January 2020. The program includes $54.8 billion for all MTA agencies, including $37.3 billion to be invested in subways and $3.5 billion for buses. The entire 2020-2024 Capital Program is on hold
indefinitely as the MTA seeks emergency federal funding.</div>
<div>Legislation adopted in 2019 includes the enactment of
congestion tolling for vehicles entering a designated congestion zone in Manhattan below 60th Street, with a start date no earlier than December 31, 2020, the revenues from which will be directed to the MTA for transit improvements. Details of the
plan, including pricing and the start date, have yet to be determined. The December 31, 2020 start date was not achieved given federal government inaction on providing guidance on environmental assessment, and the program could be delayed until
2023.</div> <div>In addition, the State budget for State fiscal
year 2020 (the “State 2020 Budget”) included legislation authorizing the imposition of sales tax on certain additional internet sales and providing that City sales tax revenues of $127.5 million in State fiscal year 2020 (reflecting the
portion of the year in which it is effective) and $170 million in State fiscal year 2021, and thereafter increasing by one percent per year, will be directed to the MTA for transit improvements. Revenues from such additional sales tax are currently
estimated to be approximately $170 million per year and are in addition to existing sales taxes attributable to certain other internet transactions. Additionally, such legislation provides that State sales tax revenues of $112.5 million in State
fiscal year 2020 and $150 million in State fiscal year 2021, and thereafter increasing by one percent per year, will be directed to the MTA for transit improvements. The State 2020 Budget also includes legislation increasing real estate transfer
taxes on properties valued at more than $2 million, which will also be directed to the MTA for transit improvements.</div>
<div>The State 2021 Budget requires the City to contribute $3
billion towards the 2020-2024 Capital Program, concurrent with the State’s $3 billion contribution. Neither the City nor the State can use operating funds dedicated to the MTA to supplant their capital commitment and must pay on a schedule
determined by the State Budget Director. $2.8 billion of the City’s $3 billion contribution has not yet been appropriated. OMB does not anticipate the appropriations will be needed within the current City fiscal year.</div>
<div>The State 2021 Budget included a requirement that the City
increase its funding of the MTA’s net paratransit operating deficit from 33% to 50%. The Financial Plan reflects $238 million in fiscal year 2021 and $175 million in each of fiscal years 2022</div> </div>

City’s contributions for paratransit services, compared to MTA’s estimate of such costs of $201 million, $256 million, $285 million and $304 million in fiscal years 2021 through 2024. Spending on paratransit is significantly impacted by
ridership levels, and it is unknown what the long-term impacts of COVID-19 will be on use. The City will continue to monitor the anticipated paratransit costs for future years.</div>
<div>Department of Education<font>. State
law requires the City to provide City funds for the Department of Education (“DOE”) each year in an amount not less than the amount appropriated for the preceding fiscal year, excluding amounts for debt service and pensions for the DOE.
Such City funding must be maintained, unless total City funds for the fiscal year are estimated to be lower than in the preceding fiscal year, in which case the mandated City funding for the DOE may be reduced by an amount up to the percentage
reduction in total City funds.</font></div> <div>Judgments and Claims<font>. In the fiscal year ended on June 30, 2020, the City expended $709.0 million for judgments and claims. The Financial Plan includes provisions for judgments and claims of $727.1 million, $742.3 million, $758.2 million,
$774.6 million and $791.2 million for the 2021 through 2025 fiscal years, respectively. These projections incorporate a substantial amount of claims costs attributed to NYCHH, estimated to be $140 million in each year of the Financial Plan, for
which NYCHH reimburses the City unless otherwise forgiven by the City, which was the case in fiscal years 2013 and 2016. The City is a party to numerous lawsuits and is the subject of numerous claims and investigations. The City has estimated that
its potential future liability on account of outstanding claims against it as of June 30, 2020 amounted to approximately $7.1 billion. This estimate was made by categorizing the various claims and applying a statistical model, based primarily on
actual settlements by type of claim during the preceding ten fiscal years, and by supplementing the estimated liability with information supplied by the City’s Corporation Counsel.</font></div>
<div>In addition to the above claims, numerous real estate tax
certiorari proceedings involving allegations of inequality of assessment, illegality and overvaluation are currently pending against the City. The City’s Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 include an estimate that the
City’s liability in the certiorari proceedings, as of June 30, 2020, could amount to approximately $1.124 billion. Provision has been made in the Financial Plan for estimated refunds of $400 million in each of fiscal years 2021 through
2025.</div> <div>Certain Reports.
<font>Set forth below are summaries of the most recent reports of the City Comptroller, OSDC and the staff of the Control Board. These summaries do not purport to be comprehensive or definitive.</font></div>
<div>On March 2, 2021, the City Comptroller released a report
titled “Comments on New York City’s Preliminary Budget for Fiscal Year 2022 and Financial Plan for Fiscal Years 2021-2025.” The report notes that, since the November Financial Plan, there have been several positive developments
with implications for the City’s recovery and fiscal outlook, including Congressional approval of stimulus payments, the extension of unemployment benefits and the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination efforts. However, the report also notes
that challenges to a full economic recovery remain. Seasonally adjusted December private employment in the City is more than 600,000 jobs below the pre-pandemic peak and declined by over 31,000 in the last two months of 2020.</div>
<div>The report notes that the City’s preliminary budget for
fiscal year 2022 is balanced and closes the $3.75 billion gap projected in the November Financial Plan. Overall, tax revenues in fiscal year 2022 are $1.58 billion less than projected in the November Financial Plan. While the City has benefited from
stronger income and business tax receipts than previously anticipated, the impact of the pandemic on property values was greater than expected, resulting in a reduction of property tax revenues by about $2.5 billion annually beginning in fiscal year
2022. A decline from the November Financial Plan in City-funds expenditures offset the drop in tax revenue and balanced the budget. More than half of the reduction in City-funds spending is from an increase of $2.75 billion in the fiscal year 2021
budget stabilization account for the prepayment of fiscal year 2022 debt service.</div>
<div>In the report, the City Comptroller projects additional
resources of $396 million in fiscal year 2021 and net risks of $1.43 billion, $2.13 billion, $2.29 billion and $2.61 billion in fiscal years 2022 through 2025, respectively, which, when added to the results projected in the Financial Plan, would
result in a surplus of $396 million in fiscal year 2021 and gaps of approximately $1.43 billion, $6.44 billion, $6.48 billion and $6.89 billion in fiscal years 2022 through 2025, respectively.</div>
<div>The differences from the Financial Plan projections result in
part from the City Comptroller’s net expenditure projections, which are higher than the Financial Plan projections by $472 million, $1.50 billion, $1.73 billion, $1.90 billion and $2.09 billion in fiscal years 2021 through 2025, respectively,
as a result of: (i) additional overtime expenditures of $287 million and $107 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2022, respectively, and $130 million in each of fiscal years 2023 through 2025; (ii) increased</div> </div>

respectively.</div> <div>The report also projects: (i) decreased
expenditures associated with pre-K special education of $50 million in each of fiscal years 2021 through 2025; (ii) anticipated debt service savings from low interest rates on variable rate bonds of $25 million in fiscal year 2021 and $100 million
in each of fiscal years 2022 through 2025; and (iii) anticipated savings in the general reserve of $50 million in fiscal year 2021.</div>
<div>The differences from the Financial Plan projections also
result from the City Comptroller’s net revenue projections, which are higher than the Financial Plan projections by $868 million and $70 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2022, and lower than the Financial Plan projections by $400 million, $387
million and $527 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2025, respectively. The report projects that: (i) personal income tax revenues will be higher by $495 million and $29 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2022, respectively; (ii) business tax
revenue will be higher by $350 million in fiscal year 2021; (iii) sales tax revenue will be higher by $24 million, $66 million, $89 million, $142 million and $131 million in fiscal years 2021 through 2025, respectively; (iv) real-estate-related tax
revenues will be higher by $15 million in fiscal year 2022; and (v) revenues from audit collections will be higher by $200 million in each of fiscal years 2023 through 2025.</div>
<div>The report also identifies certain risks to projected revenues
that result in the following differences from the Financial Plan: (i) personal income revenues will be lower by $237 million, $77 million and $51 million in fiscal years 2023 through 2025, respectively; (ii) business tax revenues will be lower by
$40 million, $178 million, $187 million and $173 million in fiscal years 2022 through 2025, respectively; and (iii) real estate-related tax revenues will be lower by $1 million in fiscal year 2021 and $274 million, $465 million and $634 million in
fiscal years 2023 through 2025, respectively.</div> <div>The report
notes that the Financial Plan does not reflect potential federal budget relief from actions taken by the Biden administration, although it does assume FEMA reimbursement for 75 percent of eligible expenditures, which has since been increased to 100
percent of eligible COVID-19 related spending. This additional reimbursement is estimated to provide an additional $1 billion of FEMA funding to the City and will allow the City to rescind or reduce some of the service reductions in the Financial
Plan and use the balance towards budget relief. In addition, a federal $1.9 trillion stimulus bill was enacted in March 2021 that is not included in the Financial Plan but includes $5.9 billion for the City. However, the report notes that the
Governor’s Executive Budget includes provisions to shift costs to the City, including the use of STAR Program reimbursement to offset some of the federal relief. Since many of these cost shifts extend beyond the expiration of federal COVID-19
relief, the Governor’s Executive Budget, if adopted as proposed, would have a negative impact on the City in the long term.</div>
<div>On February 23, 2021, the OSDC released a review of the
Financial Plan. The report notes that the City was able to balance the fiscal year 2021 budget by one-shot actions, noting the use of retiree health reserves, spending cuts, $1 billion in unidentified labor savings and federal pandemic relief funds.
While the gross city product is expected to decline by only 0.6% in 2020, due to the limited impact of COVID-19 on higher-income workers who are able to rely on telework, the City’s unemployment rate is well behind the national rate as demand
for leisure and accommodations services remains low. At the same time, there is increased demand for social safety net services with significant increases in unemployment compensation, Medicaid and cash assistance rolls.</div>
<div>The report notes that the City should be able to generate a
surplus of nearly $3.4 billion for fiscal year 2021 due to better than projected revenues from income and corporate taxes, front-loaded debt service savings from refinancings and deferred labor costs. The City’s outlook for Financial Plan
years beyond 2021 has worsened as the City expects declines in property tax collections in fiscal year 2022 and not returning to pre-pandemic levels until fiscal year 2025. The report states that the City needs to close projected outyear budget gaps
but has few good options for doing so. The report recommends that the best short-term option is savvy management of federal relief to enable recovery.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

report quantifies certain risks to the Financial Plan. The report identifies net risks of $384 million, $1.99 billion, $4.25 billion, $3.57 billion and $2.58 billion in fiscal years 2021 through 2025, respectively. When combined with the results
projected in the Financial Plan, the report estimates budget gaps of $384 million, $1.99 billion, $8.56 billion, $7.76 billion and $6.86 billion in fiscal years 2021 through 2025, respectively. These estimates include reductions to planned local
assistance appropriations as proposed in the Governor’s Executive Budget of $94 million in fiscal year 2021 and $333 million in each of fiscal years 2023 through 2025, as well as additional appropriations of $378 million in fiscal year
2022.</div> <div>The risks to the Financial Plan identified in the
report include: (i) reductions in tax revenues of $816 million, $726 million and $436 million in fiscal years 2022 through 2024, respectively; (ii) reductions in labor savings of $290 million in fiscal year 2021 and $1.00 billion in each of fiscal
years 2022 through 2025; (iii) increased expenditures associated with education funding of $380 million, $1.88 billion, $1.47 billion and $980 million in fiscal years 2022 through 2025, respectively; (iv) increased uniform services overtime costs of
$100 million in fiscal year 2021 and $200 million in each of fiscal years 2022 through 2025; and (v) increased cost of providing MTA paratransit funding of $81 million and $110 million in fiscal years 2022 and 2023, respectively, and $129 million in
each of fiscal years 2024 and 2025. The report also identifies (i) additional tax revenues of $100 million and $61 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2025, respectively, and (ii) additional debt service savings of $100 million in fiscal year
2022.</div> <div>On December 30, 2020, the staff of the Control
Board issued a report reviewing the November Financial Plan. The report states that COVID-19 and the resulting containment efforts continue to negatively impact the City’s economy and revenues. The report also notes that while the November
Financial Plan recognized some improvement to non-property tax collections and a budget surplus in fiscal year 2021, the City has yet to develop either material recurring actions to constrain agency spending over the years of the November Financial
Plan or a larger surplus in fiscal year 2021 that can be applied to subsequent years.</div>
<div>The report finds the City’s plan to deal with the
COVID-19 crisis to be deficient in several areas. It states that the City has relied on employee payment deferment, furlough, debt service savings and the use of reserves early in the budget process to keep fiscal year 2021 in balance with only the
statutorily required amount maintained in the general reserve. There are large risks surrounding future proposed labor savings, and the deferment of employee payments reduces expenditures in fiscal year 2021 while simultaneously increasing the
fiscal year 2022 budget gap. Additionally, projected agency savings are composed primarily of debt service reductions, vacancy reductions in headcount and re-estimates of personal and other than personal services expenditures, with few initiatives
of recurring value. The report finds that the City is relying on good budget practice to create debt service savings, but is not proactively managing agency spending in the operating budget. Given the uncertainty surrounding State and federal aid
and tax revenue growth, the report suggests that it is in the City’s best interest to develop a plan with recurring savings to deal with the projected budget deficits in fiscal years 2022 through 2024.</div>
<div>The report identifies net risks to the November Financial Plan
of $304 million and $1.68 billion in fiscal years 2021 and 2022, respectively, and $1.56 billion in each of fiscal years 2023 and 2024. When combined with the gaps estimated in the November Financial Plan, the total estimated gaps are $304 million,
$5.44 billion, $4.53 billion and $4.66 billion in fiscal years 2021 through 2024, respectively. Such net risks and offsets result from: (i) an increase in tax revenues of $200 million in fiscal years 2021, followed by a reduction in tax revenues of
$300 million in fiscal year 2022 and $200 million in each of fiscal years 2023 and 2024; (ii) a reduction in miscellaneous revenue of $25 million in each of fiscal years 2021 and 2022; (iii) increased uniform services overtime expenses of $137
million in fiscal year 2021; (iv) increased expenses due to reductions in State education aid of $360 million in each of fiscal years 2022 through 2024; and (v) uncertainty with respect to the implementation of unspecified labor savings of $342
million in fiscal year 2021 and $1 billion in each of fiscal years 2022 through 2024. The report also notes that the risks could be higher if there are additional State aid cuts due to the lack of federal assistance.</div>
<div>Outstanding General Obligation Indebtedness<font>. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $37.59 billion of City general obligation bonds were outstanding.</font></div>
<div>Currently, the Hudson Yards Infrastructure Corporation
(“HYIC”) has outstanding $2.72 billion aggregate principal amount of bonds. In addition, HYIC has entered into a term loan facility with Bank of America, N.A. pursuant to which HYIC may draw up to an aggregate amount of $200 million,
approximately $1 million of which has been drawn. The bonds financed the extension of the Number 7 subway line and other public improvements in the Hudson Yards area, and the term loan will be used to finance any remaining costs of completion of the
original project and the expansion of the park in the Hudson Yards</div> </div> <div type="Block">

and, on a subordinate basis, draws under the term loan facility are secured by and payable from payments in lieu of taxes and other revenues generated by development in the Hudson Yards area. However, HYIC expects to repay amounts drawn under the
term loan facility with the proceeds of its long-term bonds prior to maturity on June 30, 2022. To the extent payments in lieu of taxes and other HYIC revenues are insufficient to pay interest on the HYIC bonds or the term loan, the City has agreed
to pay the amount of any shortfall in interest, subject to appropriation. The Financial Plan does not reflect the need for such interest support payments. The City has no obligation to pay the principal of such bonds or of such term loan.</div>
<div>Water and Sewer<font>. The
City’s financing program includes the issuance of water and sewer revenue bonds by the Water Authority, which is authorized to issue bonds to finance capital investment in the City’s water and sewer system. Pursuant to State law, debt
service on Water Authority indebtedness is secured by water and sewer fees paid by users of the water and sewer system. Such fees are revenues of the Water Board, which holds a lease interest in the City’s water and sewer system. After
providing for debt service on obligations of the Water Authority and certain incidental costs, the revenues of the Water Board are paid to the City to cover the City’s costs of operating the water and sewer system and as rental for the system.
In fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019, the City did not request the rental payment due to the City from the Water Board. In fiscal year 2020, on account of the outbreak of COVID-19, the City requested a rental payment of $128 million. The Financial
Plan further reflects the City requesting a rental payment of $137 million in fiscal year 2021, with no additional rental payment requests for fiscal years 2022 through 2025. The City’s Preliminary Ten-Year Capital Strategy applicable to the
City’s water and sewer system covering fiscal years 2022 through 2031 projects City-funded water and sewer investment (which is expected to be financed with proceeds of Water Authority debt) at approximately $23.1 billion. The 2021-2025
Capital Commitment Plan reflects total anticipated City-funded water and sewer commitments of $12.4 billion, which are expected to be financed with the proceeds of Water Authority debt.</font></div>
<div>New York City Transitional Finance Authority<font>. The TFA is authorized to have outstanding $13.5 billion of Future Tax Secured Bonds (excluding Recovery Bonds). The TFA may have outstanding Future Tax Secured Bonds in excess of $13.5 billion provided that the amount
of the Future Tax Secured Bonds, together with the amount of indebtedness contracted by the City, do not exceed the debt limit of the City. Future Tax Secured Bonds are issued for general City capital purposes and are secured by the City’s
personal income tax revenues and, to the extent such revenues do not satisfy specified debt ratios, sales tax revenues. In addition, the TFA is authorized to have outstanding $9.4 billion of Building Aid Revenue Bonds to pay for a portion of the
City’s five-year educational facilities capital plan. Building Aid Revenue Bonds are secured by State building aid, which the Mayor has assigned to the TFA. The Financial Plan reflects the issuance of $200 million, $194 million, $197 million,
$204 million and $186 million of Building Aid Revenue Bonds by TFA in fiscal years 2021 through 2025.</font></div>
<div>Implementation of the financing program is dependent upon the
ability of the City and other financing entities to market their securities successfully in the public credit markets, which will be subject to prevailing market conditions at the times of sale. No assurance can be given that the credit markets will
absorb the projected amounts of public bond sales. A significant portion of bond financing is used to reimburse the City’s General Fund for capital expenditures already incurred. If the City and such other entities are unable to sell such
amounts of bonds, it would have an adverse effect on the City’s cash position. In addition, the need of the City to fund future debt service costs from current operations may also limit the City’s capital program. The Preliminary
Ten-Year Capital Strategy for fiscal years 2022 through 2031 totals $118.8 billion, of which approximately 95% is to be financed with funds borrowed by the City and such other entities. Congressional developments affecting federal taxation generally
could reduce the market value of tax-favored investments and increase the debt-service costs of carrying out the major portion of the City’s capital plan, which is currently eligible for tax-exempt financing.</div>
<div>New York State</div>
<div>New York is the fourth most populous state in the nation,
after California, Texas, and Florida, and has a relatively high level of personal wealth. The State’s economy is diverse, with a comparatively large share of the nation’s financial activities, information, education, and health services
employment, and a small share of the nation’s farming and mining activity. The State’s location and its air transport facilities and natural harbors have made it an important hub for international commerce. Travel and tourism constitute
an important part of the economy. Like the rest of the nation, New York has a declining proportion of its workforce engaged in manufacturing and an increasing proportion engaged in service industries.</div>
<div>Manufacturing employment continues to decline as a share of
total State employment, as in most other states, and as a result New York’s economy is less reliant on this sector than in the past. However, it remains an important sector of the State economy, particularly for the upstate region, which hosts
high concentrations of manufacturers. As defined under the North</div> </div> <div type="Block">

Classification System (NAICS), the trade, transportation, and utilities supersector accounts for the second largest component of State nonfarm employment, but only the fifth largest when measured by wage share. This sector accounts for
proportionally less employment and wages for the State than for the nation. New York City is the nation’s leading center of banking and finance, and hence this is a far more important sector for the State than for the nation. Although this
sector accounts for less than one-tenth of all nonfarm jobs in the State, it contributes about one-fifth of total wages. The remaining service-producing sectors include information, professional and business services, private education and
healthcare, leisure and hospitality services, and other services. Combined, these industries account for half of all nonfarm jobs in New York. Information, education and health, and other services account for a higher proportion of total State
employment than for the nation. Farming is an important part of the State’s rural economy, although it constitutes only about 0.2 percent of total State GDP. Principal agricultural products of the State include dairy products, greenhouse and
nursery products, fruits, and vegetables.</div> <div>Federal,

last public estimates before the pandemic struck. A modest increase in tax receipts estimates since the Mid-Year Update to the Financial Plan in October 2020 has not fundamentally altered the State’s fiscal challenges. The projected aggregate

<div>Updated “Base” Budget Gaps</div>
<div>The Mid-Year Update to the Financial Plan showed a balanced
budget in FY 2021 and a budget gap of $8.7 billion in FY 2022. The estimates in the Mid-Year Update were predicated on the assumption that DOB would execute $8.2 billion in mid-year cuts in local assistance programs to maintain a balanced budget in
FY 2021. At the time, the cuts were expected to be needed to bridge the estimated difference between $79.1 billion in General Fund disbursements (prior to the execution of mid-year cuts) and $70.9 billion in General Fund resources. It was further
anticipated that the FY 2022 Executive Budget would propose making the FY 2021 local assistance cuts permanent. The mid-year budget gaps without the reductions were thus $8.2 billion in FY 2021 and $16.7 billion in FY 2022, a two-year gap of $24.9
billion.</div> <div>Tax receipts showed sustained improvement
through December 2020 and into the important first week of collections in January 2021. Personal income tax (“PIT”) collections, the largest source of State tax receipts, were $2.25 billion above the estimate in the Enacted Budget
Financial Plan through the first three quarters of FY 2021. The improvement continued through January 2021, prompting the revisions to PIT receipts summarized herein.</div>
<div>Sales and use tax (“SUT”) collections through the
same period were $515 million higher than expected. At the same time, business tax collections, principally related to audits, were weaker than expected, which partially offset the significant improvements in PIT and sales tax collections.</div>
<div>Based on collections to the date of the Financial Plan and an
updated economic forecast, DOB increased the annual estimates for General Fund tax receipts by $4.9 billion in FY 2021 and $7.9 billion in FY 2022, exclusive of debt service revisions and proposed tax law changes in the Executive Budget, as
described below. Changes in the PIT net collection estimates account for $11.6 billion of the increased tax receipts estimate over the two years (FY 2021, $4.0 billion; FY 2022, $7.6 billion), reflecting strength in both the withholding and
estimated components of the tax, as well as a downward revision in estimated refunds. SUT collections have been revised upward by $1.5 billion in FY 2021 and $537 million in FY 2022, reflecting strength in consumer purchasing. A reduction of $868
million to the annual estimates over two years for business taxes partially offsets these changes. A minor increase to non-tax receipts was also made. The improved receipts forecast, net of the growth in Medicaid enrollment costs, reduced the budget
gap by $5.0 billion in the current year and $7.2 billion in FY 2022, leaving a combined gap of $12.7 billion. The outyear gaps after forecast revisions are projected at $9.3 billion in FY 2023, $9.2 billion in FY 2024, and $10.7 billion in FY
2025.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

changes, estimated General Fund receipts in FY 2021 and FY 2022 are still $18.1 billion below the pre-pandemic February 2020 Financial Plan (FY 2021,-$9.9 billion; FY 2022, -$8.2 billion). On a year-over-year basis, FY 2021 all fund tax receipts are
expected to decline by 4.3 percent from FY 2020. These downward shocks to tax receipts, along with the then lack of new federal aid, drive the need for the spending reductions and tax increases proposed in the Executive Budget.</div>

<div><font>Receipts.</font><font> </font>General Fund receipts, including transfers from other funds, are estimated to total $73 billion in FY 2021, a decrease of $6.2 billion (7.8 percent) from FY 2020 results, due mainly to the shock to the economy from
the global pandemic.</div> <div>General Fund PIT receipts and
miscellaneous receipts are affected by the PIT note liquidity financings that the State entered into to manage the budgetary impact on monthly cash flows of the deferral of the April 15, 2020 tax payments to July 15, 2020. The note proceeds are
recorded as miscellaneous receipts, while the repayment results in a reduction of PIT receipts. PIT receipts are further affected by planned prepayments, in FY 2021 and FY 2022, of PIT debt service due in FY 2023 through FY 2025. These transactions
reduce reported PIT receipts in the fiscal year in which the prepayments are made and increase PIT receipts in the fiscal years in which the debt service was originally scheduled to be paid. Such transactions are expected to reduce reported General
Fund PIT receipts by $1.6 billion in FY 2021 and $676 million in FY 2022, and to increase reported PIT receipts by $759 million annually in FY 2023 through FY 2025.</div>
<div>PIT receipts, including transfers after payment of debt
service on State PIT Revenue Bonds, are estimated to drop from $50.5 billion in FY 2020 to $42.6 billion in FY 2021, a decrease of $7.9 billion (15.7 percent). The decrease reflects declines in both bonus and non-bonus wages impacting withholding
and estimated payments. In addition, refunds are expected to decline as a result of a steep decline in advance credit payments related to tax year 2020, due to the expired Property Tax Relief Credit program, as well as a decrease in the
administrative cap on the amount of refunds paid from January to March 2021. In addition, General Fund PIT receipts in FY 2021 are estimated to be reduced by the repayment in March 2021 of the remaining $3.5 billion outstanding of PIT notes issued
earlier in FY 2021.</div> <div>Consumption/use tax receipts,
including transfers after payment of debt service on Local Government Assistance Corporation and Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, are estimated to total over $12.5 billion in FY 2021, a drop of $1.7 billion (11.8 percent) from FY 2020. The drop reflects an
estimated decline in the sales tax base of 13.1 percent due to the impact of the pandemic. This is partly offset by the full-year impact of the new requirements that online marketplace providers must collect SUT on sales that they facilitate and
that energy service companies are subject to sales tax.</div>
<div>Business tax receipts are estimated at $5.9 billion in FY
2021, a decrease of $449 million (7.0 percent) from FY 2020. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decline in corporate franchise tax (“CFT”) receipts, driven by lower gross and audit receipts.</div>
<div>Other tax receipts, including transfers after payment of debt
service on Clean Water/Clean Air Bonds, are expected to total $2.0 billion in FY 2021, a decrease of $83 million (4.1 percent) from FY 2020, primarily due to an estimated decrease in real estate transfer tax receipts resulting from a large estimated
decline in housing starts stemming from the impact of COVID-19. This decline is partly offset by an increase in estate tax receipts, primarily due to the receipt of multiple extraordinary payments through the early part of 2021.</div>
<div>Non-tax receipts and transfers are estimated at $10.1 billion
in FY 2021, an increase of nearly $4 billion from FY 2020. This increase reflects $4.5 billion in proceeds from liquidity financing offset by a reduction in new extraordinary monetary settlements (e.g., from financial institutions) from FY 2020 to
FY 2021, and the use of certain resources available in FY 2020 that either do not recur or recur at a lower amount in FY 2021.</div>
<div><font>Disbursements.</font><font> </font>General Fund disbursements, including transfers to other funds, are expected to total $74.7 billion in FY 2021, a decrease of $2.7 billion (3.5 percent) from FY 2020. Spending in FY 2021 is reduced by the movement
of roughly $3 billion of certain health and public safety payroll costs to the Common Retirement Fund (“CRF”).</div>
<div>Local assistance spending is estimated at $52 billion in FY
2021, an increase of $148 million (0.3 percent) from FY 2020. The modest increase is due to projected growth that is almost entirely offset by $2.2 billion in spending reductions to close the current year budget gap. General Fund spending for
education and health care represents 75 percent of total local assistance spending. General Fund support for these programs is affected by the level of financing sources (i.e., Health Care Reform Act</div> </div>

<div>General Fund agency operations costs, including fringe
benefits, are expected to total $16.7 billion in FY 2021, a decrease of $2.8 billion (14.4 percent) from FY 2020. The decrease mainly reflects the movement of $3 billion of certain health and public safety payroll costs to the CRF, the interest-free
deferral of the employer’s share of Social Security taxes through December 2020, and savings from the planned 10 percent reduction to agency budgets compared to the amounts authorized in the Enacted Budget beginning in FY 2021. These
reductions are partly offset by costs incurred in responding to the pandemic that are expected to be reimbursed through FEMA, as well as projected growth in pension and health insurance costs for State employees and retirees.</div>

$6 billion in FY 2021, a decrease of $61 million from FY 2020. The decline in transfers to support debt service costs is attributable to the prepayment of FY 2021 debt at the end of FY 2020. The need for hard dollar resources to fund capital
projects is expected to decline in FY 2021 mainly due to a slowdown in projects brought on by the pandemic and the timing of bond reimbursements for projects previously funded by the General Fund. Transfers for other purposes are projected to
increase, primarily to support school aid as a result of lower video lottery and commercial gaming revenues.</div>
<div><font>FY 2021 Closing
Balance.</font><font> </font>The State’s liquidity position is dependent on the performance of tax receipts, the management of cash disbursements, and the execution of reductions in aid-to-localities programs and
State agency operations. All of these actions are subject to risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, designated reserves are not used to help close the FY 2021 budget gap, but instead are held to preserve liquidity.</div>
<div>DOB projects the State will end FY 2021 with a General Fund
cash balance of $7.2 billion, a decrease of $1.7 billion from FY 2020. The balance declines for two reasons. First, the State deferred $1.3 billion in planned payments at the end of FY 2020 as a cash preservation measure at the start of the COVID-19
pandemic. The payments were later made in FY 2021, reducing the temporary balance that occurred at the end of FY 2020. In addition, the FY 2020 Enacted Budget programmed the use of surplus balances over two years, FY 2021 and FY 2022. This includes
the use of $1.9 billion in available cash at the end of FY 2020 to fund payments not made at the close of FY 2020 that are expected to be made in FY 2021 ($1.3 billion) and to reduce the budget gap in FY 2021 ($553 million). In addition, the
expected use of extraordinary monetary settlements for initiatives approved in prior budgets reduces the balance in the General Fund by $425 million in FY 2021. The State also received a total of $600 million in extraordinary monetary settlements
that has been set aside in the reserve for economic uncertainties.</div>
<div>FY 2022 Detailed Gap Closing Plan</div>
<div><font>General Fund Gap
Closing Plan. </font>The proposed General Fund gap closing plan, if adopted and executed as proposed, would eliminate the $12.7 billion two-year budget gap and reduce the outyear gaps by $31.1 billion, from $41.9 billion to $10.8 billion. A brief
summary of the significant actions and revisions with an emphasis on the savings projected in FYs 2021 and 2022 follows.</div>
<div>Receipts</div>
<div>The Executive Budget proposes the following tax actions:</div>
<div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>PIT
High-Income Rate.<font> The current top PIT rate is 8.82 percent for married taxpayers with a taxable income above $2.155 million. Taxpayers with incomes over $5 million will have the option to pre-pay two years of excess
liability based on five new tax brackets. A new deduction will return the prepayment to affected taxpayers between 2024 and 2025.</font> </td></tr>
<tr>

<td>Middle-Class PIT
 Cut Phase-in.<font> The Executive Budget pauses the phase-in of the middle-class tax cut, which began in 2018 and was scheduled to fully phase in by 2025. Tax year 2020 rates will remain in effect for an additional
year.</font> </td></tr>
<tr>

<td>Local
 District Funding Adjustment.<font> The Executive Budget includes a local district funding adjustment that reduces reimbursements to school districts by $1.35 billion in FY 2022. This reduction would not exceed any school
district’s federal CRRSAA allocation.<sup>2</sup> The adjustment recurs in the outyears.</font> </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>In addition, the Executive Budget closes
the Enhanced STAR Exemption Program to new entrants, who will be required to access the enhanced benefits through the credit program, improves the administration of STAR benefits to mobile homeowners and moves forward the date to voluntarily switch
from a STAR exemption to a STAR credit from June 15 to May 1 in 2021, which has no impact on benefits to taxpayers while making the program easier to administer for assessors.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div><font>Federal Aid.</font>
The Executive Budget includes $6 billion in new direct federal aid that, if received, will be utilized to offset the budget gaps evenly over the next two years.</div>
<div><font>Debt Service
Transfers.</font> Debt service spending estimates are revised to reflect bond sale results to the date of the Executive Budget, refunding savings, and the adjustment of debt issuances to align with projected bond-financed capital spending. The
spending changes are offset in FY 2021 and FY 2022 by prepayments of debt service due in FY 2023 through FY 2025, as described earlier.</div>
<div><font>Non-Tax
Transfers.</font> Excess balances created by spending reductions in various programs and activities funded outside the General Fund are expected to be transferred to the General Fund, and include transit, gaming, social services, public safety and
regulatory activities. In addition, a voluntary contribution of $110 million to the State associated with the managed care organization acquisition of Affinity by Molina is expected to be received in FY 2022 and will be used to offset State-only
costs funded under the Medicaid Global Cap (i.e., the 10-year rolling average of the medical component of the Consumer Price Index).</div>
<div>Disbursements</div>
<div><font>Local
Assistance.</font> Targeted actions, continuation of prior-year cost containment, revisions to estimated costs, and the extension of eFMAP are expected to generate roughly $5.3 billion in General Fund local assistance savings in FYs 2021 and 2022
compared to the current services estimate. The Executive Budget includes the following proposed actions:</div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>eFMAP
Extension.<font> On January 7, 2021, the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services issued an extension to the public health emergency declaration through April 21, 2021, which would span two additional quarters through
June 2021. The Executive Budget includes the assured extension from January 1 through March 30, 2021, as well as the then-likely extension of an additional quarter (from April 1 through June 30, 2021). The enhanced rate at which the federal
government reimburses eligible State Medicaid expenditures (56.2 percent compared to the regular rate of 50 percent) reduces State-share expenditures and increases federal expenditures by an equal amount, and therefore has no impact on total
Medicaid payments. DOB estimates State-share savings of $497 million in FY 2021 and $995 million in FY 2022.</font> </td></tr>
<tr>

<td>Education.
<font> General Fund savings are achieved from the consolidation of certain expense-based aids into a new block grant and the reduction of its school year (SY) 2022 funding level by $693 million compared to the SY 2022
projections of its components under current law. These reductions, as well as the $1.35 billion local district funding adjustment to school districts, would be more than offset by $3.85 billion in CRRSAA funding to school districts. The Executive
Budget recommends a total of $31.7 billion in school district funding for SY 2022, including school aid, STAR reimbursement payments, the local district funding adjustment, and CRRSAA funding. This represents an increase of $2.1 billion, or 7.1
percent, over the statewide SY 2021 funding level, including federal CARES Act funds, driven by $3.9 billion in CRRSAA funding to districts. Additionally, all formula-based school aid payments previously on hold (approximately $390 million) would be
repaid to school districts before the end of the fiscal year.</font> </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>Additionally, the Executive Budget proposes
to capture roughly half of the savings to school districts from a reduction in 2021-22 charter school tuition rates, lowering State reimbursement through supplemental tuition payments in FY 2022 by roughly $35 million. Further, the Executive Budget
proposes to eliminate State reimbursement to New York City for its charter school rental assistance in order to encourage the use of available co-located space in public facilities instead of leasing space in privately owned facilities. Other
education aid savings include downward revisions to special education spending related to enrollment declines, 5 percent recurring reductions to library aid and public broadcasting, a temporary two-year elimination of aid to private colleges (Bundy
Aid), elimination of certain teacher support and training programs, elimination of New York City’s discretionary Fiscal Stabilization Grant, and elimination of funding for school districts’ prior year aid claims.</div>

offset costs and other revisions. Prior to revisions and savings, the updated forecast of Medicaid costs is expected to exceed the Global Cap, attributable to increased enrollment and utilization. The savings include a comprehensive package of
telehealth reforms, achieving programmatic efficiency savings in the home and community-based care sector with the implementation of the new Electronic Visit Verification system, enhancing pharmacy oversight by eliminating “prescriber
prevails” and coverage for certain over-the-counter products, reducing supplemental pools for certain health care plans and providers, and other continued cost-containment measures that are expected to control the level of spending permitted
under the Global Cap index. Other health care savings include modifying, reducing or eliminating certain public health programs, specifically reducing New York City reimbursement rates for the General Public Health Work program from 20 percent to 10
percent, savings efficiencies in the Early Intervention program and reducing the excess medical malpractice payment by 50 percent and revising the payment schedule.</div> <div>

<td>Mental
Hygiene.<font> Spending revisions reflect updated assumptions and revised timelines for ongoing transformation efforts to ensure efficient use of State resources in mental hygiene service delivery systems as well as
continued support of programs and services to ensure individuals with developmental disabilities, mental illness and addiction have appropriate access to care. These investments are supported in part by continued efficiencies in program operations
and reductions in excess institutional capacity. In addition, savings are expected from the reduction in Medicaid rates for Office for People with Developmental Disabilities (OPWDD) services, and 5 percent reductions to OPWDD non-Medicaid local
assistance and Office of Mental Health non-residential provider payments.</font> </td></tr>
<tr>

<td>Human
Services.<font> Savings reflect proposed 5 percent reductions for various social services programs, the shift of the State share for Committee on Special Education costs to school districts outside of New York City, the
use of available federal Child Care Development Block Grant funds to offset State costs for child care, and the use of alternative resources to support the consolidated homeless and adult shelter programs. The savings are partly offset by higher
costs for childcare and safety net assistance resulting from increases in the public assistance caseload forecasts.</font> </td></tr>

<td>Higher
Education.<font> Savings reflect declining enrollments and revised estimates of spending for student financial aid and FY 2022 formula aid for community colleges. Additional savings are realized through a targeted 5

Operations.</font> Reductions to agency operations contribute approximately $2.2 billion over two years to the General Fund gap closing plan.</div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Fund
Eligible Expenses from CRF.<font> Additional personnel expenses of public health and public safety employees have been charged to the CRF consistent with federal guidance, which reduces State personal service and fringe
benefit costs in FY 2021. The Financial Plan reflects $2.5 billion in payroll charges to the CRF. The Financial Plan includes funding for direct COVID-19 expenses, which DOB continues to assume will be funded from federal sources. The remaining
balance in the CRF is expected to be fully expended for, among other things, vaccine distribution costs by the end of calendar year 2021.</font> </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Pandemic
Expenses/FEMA Reimbursement. <font>The Financial Plan continues to assume that the federal government will fully fund the State’s direct pandemic response costs, but timing differences between State outlays and FEMA
reimbursement will occur. The State is expected to incur an estimated $1 billion in COVID-19 expenses that are eligible for FEMA reimbursement (at 100 percent of cost). FEMA reimbursement is currently expected in FY 2022 ($600 million), FY 2023
($200 million), and FY 2024 ($200 million). The timing difference between the State outlay and FEMA reimbursement creates a current-year cost of $1 billion and commensurate savings from FY 2022 through FY 2024.</font> </td></tr>

<td>Executive
 Agencies.<font> Executive agency budgets, with exceptions for facility operations and public health and safety, have been reduced by 10 percent from budgeted levels beginning in FY 2021. These reductions were allocated
to agencies in the Mid-Year Update to the Financial Plan and are expected to be achieved through adhering strict freeze on hiring and transfers and limiting new contracts or purchase orders for non-personal service expenditures to those needed to
protect the health, safety and security of employees and citizens and to ensure the continuation of high-priority operations and services. Savings are also expected to be achieved in part from the deferral of general salary increases</font>

 Benefits/Fixed Costs.<font> Pension estimates reflect the planned payment of the full FY 2022 Employees’ Retirement System (“ERS”)/Police and Fire Retirement System (“PFRS”) pension bills in
June 2021. Health insurance savings are projected from eliminating taxpayer-subsidized reimbursements for high-income public sector retirees through the Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount New York State Health Insurance Program
(“NYSHIP”), maintaining Medicare Part B premium reimbursements at $148.50 per month, developing a sliding scale for retiree health insurance coverage for new retirees and developing a dependent eligibility verification audit to assure
that divorcees and children who aged out are no longer being covered.</font> </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>The Executive Budget also proposes, for the
fourth consecutive year, lowering the interest charged on judgments against the State from as high as 9 percent (currently authorized) to a fair market-based interest rate. The current rate was established in 1982, when interest rates were at 12
percent, to avoid unnecessary taxpayer costs. The recommended rate is in line with the interest rate applied to judgments in federal courts and would ensure that neither side in a lawsuit will be disadvantaged by an interest rate above or below what
otherwise could be earned while cases are being adjudicated. This will save New York taxpayers millions of dollars annually.</div>
<div><font>Debt Service
Transfers. </font>The Executive Budget reflects savings from expected refundings, continued use of competitive bond sales, and other debt management actions.</div>
<div><font>Capital Projects
Transfers.</font> The Executive Budget reflects lower than expected capital spending in FY 2021, as well as higher than anticipated receipts related to the reimbursement of capital spending, previously financed by the General Fund, with bond
proceeds. Increased costs in FY 2022 reflect the timing of bond proceed reimbursements and additional costs associated with NYC security and national guard deployment, supportive housing, and the judiciary’s capital budget request.</div>
<div>New Unrestricted Federal Aid (FY 2021, $0; FY 2022, $3
billion)</div> <div>The timing and amount of federal aid will
ultimately determine the level of spending cuts and tax increases that must be enacted in FY 2022. For now, until further information is available, DOB is incorporating a cautious estimate of $3 billion in new federal aid in both FY 2022 and FY
2023. The aid is apportioned evenly over the two years to reduce the risk to the FY 2022 budget if such aid is delayed or approved at a lower level than expected.</div>
<div>The Executive Budget includes a provision that will trigger
automatic across-the-board reductions to planned local assistance appropriations and cash disbursements if unrestricted federal aid is not approved by August 31, 2021 or is approved at an amount less than the amount budgeted in the Financial Plan.
The reductions would be calculated to generate savings equal to the difference between the federal aid assumed in the Financial Plan and the approved amount.</div>
<div>The Governor at the time of the Executive Budget had asked
Congress for $15 billion in COVID relief aid to maintain State services. The requested aid would replace less than 40 percent of the State’s estimated receipts losses over four years. The difference between the new federal aid assumed in the
Financial Plan ($6 billion) and the Governor’s request to maintain services ($15 billion) is $9 billion.</div>
<div>If aid were to be approved at the level requested, it would
allow the State to reverse or modify, in the State’s opinion, the most harmful spending reductions and tax increases. The aid amounts are generally two-year totals to conform with the apportionment of the $6 billion in aid assumed in the
Financial Plan.</div> <div>Stabilization Payments</div>
<div>The Financial Plan applies the FY 2021 and FY 2022 surpluses
to reduce the budget gaps in FY 2023 through FY 2025 by equal amounts. For planning purposes, DOB expects to accomplish this goal through the prepayment of debt service due in those years.</div>
<div>Local Aid Payment Withholds</div>
<div>In June 2020, DOB began temporarily withholding 20 percent of
most local aid payments. It initiated the withholds to ensure that up to $8.2 billion in local aid payments could be withheld permanently, if needed, by the end of FY 2021. This was consistent with the assumptions in the Mid-Year Update.</div>

through December 2020 are estimated to have totaled $2.9 billion. An improved receipts picture, the availability of COVID-19 relief resources, and the extension of the higher federal matching rate on Medicaid expenditures through June 30, 2021 has
reduced the need for local assistance reductions.</div> <div>DOB
now expects to reduce most local aid payments by a total of 5 percent from the Enacted Budget estimate, rather than the 20 percent anticipated in the Mid-Year Update and executed as of the date of the Executive Budget. Amounts that have been
withheld in excess of the 5 percent are expected to be reconciled and repaid in the final quarter of FY 2021.</div>
<div>The local aid reductions will be executed pursuant to section
1 of the FY 2021 Aid to Localities bill, which allows the Director of the Budget to withhold payments in response to the direct and indirect financial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.</div>
<div>Liquidity and Debt</div>
<div>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FY 2021 Enacted
Budget authorized the State to access external liquidity during FY 2021, in the form of short-term notes and a line of credit. The Executive Budget proposes continuing these authorizations in FY 2022 as the State continues to respond to the
pandemic.</div> <div>Accordingly, legislation supporting the
Executive Budget authorizes the issuance of up to $8 billion of short-term borrowing in the form of PIT revenue notes and/or sales tax revenue notes (or bond anticipation notes) during FY 2022. The statutory authorization requires any such notes to
be issued on a subordinated basis by December 31, 2021, with an initial maturity no later than March 31, 2022. The notes can be renewed once for up to a year and, as a contingency option, may be refinanced on a long-term basis.</div>
<div>In addition, legislation supporting the Executive Budget
continues existing authorization for the State to enter into up to $3 billion of credit facilities in the form of a line of credit with one or more banks. The line of credit would be authorized for a three-year period, through FY 2024, and would
allow draws in any year, subject to sufficient annual appropriation. The FY 2021 authorization was for a one-year facility that could be extended, but allowed draws only in the first year. As a contingency option, any line of credit balance may be
refinanced on a long-term basis.</div> <div>The Executive Budget
does not currently assume any PIT note sales or use of the line of credit in FY 2022. DOB will evaluate cash results regularly and may adjust the size and use of note sales and/or the line of credit based on liquidity needs, market considerations,
and other factors.</div> <div>In FY 2021, the State issued $4.5
billion of PIT notes to manage a delay in State PIT receipts after the federal government extended the April 15, 2020 PIT filing deadline. As of the date of the Executive Budget, $3.5 billion of PIT notes remain outstanding. The budget reflects full
repayment of the remaining notes when they matured in March 2021. In FY 2021, the interest expense on the notes and the commitment fee on the credit facility are being reimbursed with federal aid provided for in the CRF, as the financings are due
solely to the federal decision to extend tax filing deadlines in response to the pandemic.</div>
<div>Lastly, legislation supporting the Executive Budget authorizes
a continuation of the suspension of the Debt Reform Act of 2000 (“Debt Reform Act”) for all FY 2022 issuances of State-supported debt in FY 2022. State legislation enacted in connection with the adoption of the FY 2021 Enacted Budget
suspended the Debt Reform Act for FY 2021 bond issuances, as part of the State response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, any State-supported debt issued in FY 2021 and FY 2022 is not limited to capital purposes and is not counted towards the
statutory caps on debt outstanding and debt service. In addition, issuances of State-supported debt in FY 2022 would not be limited by a maximum maturity (currently limited to 30 years by the Debt Reform Act), although such State-supported debt
would still be subject to federal tax law limitations. This change would allow State-supported debt to be issued over the full useful life of the assets being financed, which may be over 30 years in limited circumstances (i.e., MTA projects).</div>
<div>FY 2022 Executive Budget Financial Plan</div>
<div><font>Receipts.</font><font> </font>General Fund receipts, including transfers from other funds, are estimated to total $81.4 billion in FY 2022, an increase of $8.3 billion (11.4 percent) from FY 2021 projections. General Fund PIT receipts and
miscellaneous receipts are affected by the PIT note liquidity financings executed to manage the impact of the April 15, 2020 tax filing extension on monthly cash flows. The note proceeds are recorded as miscellaneous receipts, while the repayment
results in a reduction of PIT receipts.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

receipts, including transfers after payment of debt service on State PIT Revenue Bonds, are estimated to total $51.8 billion in FY 2022, an increase of $9.2 billion from FY 2021. Almost half of the increase is due to the planned repayment of the FY
2021 liquidity financings, which reduces PIT receipts by $4.5 billion in FY 2021. The remaining PIT growth is largely attributable to the one-year pause in the phase-in of the middle-class tax cut and the enactment of a high-income PIT
surcharge.</div> <div>PIT receipts are further affected by planned
prepayments, in FY 2021 and FY 2022, of PIT debt service due in FY 2023 through FY 2025. These transactions reduce reported PIT receipts in the fiscal year in which the payments are made and increase PIT receipts in the fiscal years in which the
debt service was originally scheduled to be paid. Such transactions are expected to reduce reported General PIT receipts by $1.6 billion in FY 2021 and $676 million in FY 2022 and to increase reported PIT receipts by $759 million annually in FY 2023
through FY 2025.</div> <div>Consumption/use tax receipts, including
transfers after payment of debt service on Local Government Assistance Corporation and Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, are estimated to total $13.4 billion in FY 2022, an increase of $909 million (7.3 percent) from FY 2021. Increases reflect sales tax base
growth of 7.6 percent as the economy continues to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 economic downturn.</div>
<div>Business tax receipts are estimated at $6 billion in FY 2022,
an increase of $98 million (1.7 percent) from FY 2021. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in CFT audit receipts as audits are expected to return to trend levels. CFT gross receipts are also expected to increase slightly over FY
2021.</div> <div>Other tax receipts, including transfers after
payment of debt service on Clean Water/Clean Air Bonds, are expected to total $1.9 billion in FY 2022, a decrease of $47 million (2.4 percent) from FY 2021. This is primarily due to a decline in the estate tax due to a higher-than-typical number of
extraordinary payments in FY 2021.</div> <div>Non-tax receipts and
transfers are estimated at $5.2 billion in FY 2022, a decrease of $4.5 billion from FY 2021. The decline largely reflects FY 2021 receipts for liquidity financing ($4.5 billion) and extraordinary monetary settlements ($600 million). In addition, the
realignment of certain debt service transfers to simplify reporting increases the transfers from other funds and reduces transfers from the Revenue Bond Tax Fund (“RBTF”), with no financial plan impact.</div>
<div>The Executive Budget reflects the expected receipt of $3
billion in unrestricted federal aid in FY 2022 that would be recorded as a miscellaneous receipt.</div>
<div><font>Disbursements.</font>
General Fund disbursements, including transfers to other funds, are expected to total nearly $82.9 billion in FY 2022, an increase of $8.1 billion (10.9 percent) from FY 2021. The growth is impacted by several transactions in FY 2022 that lower
spending, including the shift of $3 billion of certain health and public safety payroll costs to the CRF, three months (April through June) of a higher federal share of Medicaid (eFMAP) expenses, and the deferment of social security costs. In
addition, General Fund disbursements reflect conservative estimates of disbursements in each financial category, a practice that provides a cushion for potential receipts shortfalls and other unanticipated costs.</div>
<div>Local assistance spending is estimated at $55.5 billion in FY
2022, an increase of $3.5 billion (6.7 percent) from FY 2021. The increase is mainly due to the decline in the eFMAP, which shifts Medicaid costs from the State to the federal share of $3.5 billion in FY 2021 to $995 million in FY 2022. General Fund
spending for education and health care represent 75 percent of total local assistance spending. General Fund support for these programs are affected by the level of financing sources (i.e., HCRA and lottery/gaming receipts) available in other funds,
as well as the impact of eFMAP, which temporarily lowers State spending and increases the federal share of Medicaid costs.</div>
<div>General Fund agency operation costs, including fringe
benefits, are expected to total $20.3 billion in FY 2022, an increase of $3.6 billion from FY 2021. The growth is almost entirely due the reclassification of $3 billion of personnel expenses for public health and public safety employees to the CRF
in FY 2021, the deferral of the employer’s share of Social Security taxes that moved $674 million of expenses from FY 2021 proportionately to FY 2022 and FY 2023, and the 27<sup>th</sup> administrative payroll in FY 2021. Excluding these anomalies, most executive agencies are expected to hold operations spending at FY 2021 levels, which
were reduced by 10 percent from the FY 2021 Enacted Budget levels.</div>
<div>General Fund transfers to other funds are projected to total
$7.1 billion in FY 2022, an increase of $1.1 billion from FY 2021. Debt service supported by transfers from the General Fund is projected to increase by $115 million. Transfers for capital projects are projected to increase by $1.2 billion,

<div><font>FY 2022 Closing
Balance.</font><font> </font>DOB projects the State will end FY 2022 with a General Fund cash balance of $5.7 billion, a decrease of $1.5 billion from FY 2021. The decline is due to the planned use of a portion of the FY
2020 cash balance to reduce the budget gap in FY 2022 and the expected use of extraordinary monetary settlements for initiatives approved in prior budgets.</div>
<div>The General Fund balance, excluding extraordinary monetary
settlements, is estimated at $4.5 billion. The Executive Budget maintains all Rainy Day Reserves, as well as $500 million for debt management purposes and $1.5 billion for economic uncertainties.</div>
<div><font>Cash Flow.</font>
State Finance Law authorizes the General Fund to borrow money temporarily from available funds held in the Short-Term Investment Pool (“STIP”). The Enacted Budget amended the statute to permit the borrowings until the end of FY 2021.
Previously, the borrowing period was limited to four months from the start of a fiscal year. The State last used this authorization in April 2011 when the General Fund needed to borrow funds from STIP for a period of five days. The amount of
resources that can be borrowed by the General Fund is limited to available balances in STIP, as determined by the State Comptroller. Available balances include money in the State’s governmental funds and a relatively small amount of other
money belonging to the State, held in internal service and enterprise funds, as well as certain agency funds. Several accounts in debt service funds and capital projects funds that are part of all governmental funds are excluded from the balances
deemed available in STIP. These excluded funds consist of bond proceeds and money obligated for debt service payments.</div>
<div>Pursuant to authorization included in the Enacted Budget, the
State completed two PIT note sales for cash flow purposes in the first quarter of FY 2021. The note sales generated a total of $4.5 billion in net proceeds, consistent with the assumptions in the Enacted Budget Financial Plan. The sales were done to
meet anticipated liquidity needs arising from the federal government’s decision to extend the income tax filing deadline from April 15, 2020 to July 15, 2020 as a result of the pandemic. The receipt and expected repayments are shown in the
monthly cash balances. The legislation adopted in connection with the Enacted Budget authorized the State to issue up to $8 billion in PIT notes for cash flow purposes in FY 2021 by December 31, 2020. The notes may be renewed once for up to a year
and, as a contingency option, refinanced on a long-term basis. A line of credit for $3.0 billion was also established during FY 2021. Draws on the line of credit were permitted through March 31, 2021, subject to available appropriation. Any balance
on the line of credit may be refinanced twice for up to one year at each refinancing and, as a contingency option, refinanced on a long-term basis. No draws have been made pursuant to the authorization included in the Enacted Budget as of the date
of the AIS Update, and none were planned at the date of the AIS Update.</div>
<div>The State continues to reserve money on a quarterly basis for
debt service payments financed with General Fund resources. Money to pay debt service on bonds secured by dedicated receipts, including PIT bonds and Sales Tax Revenue bonds, continues to be set aside as required by law and bond covenants.</div>
<div>Other Matters Affecting the Financial Plan</div>
<div><font>General.</font> The
Financial Plan is subject to complex economic, social, financial, political, public health, and environmental risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the ability of the State to predict or control. DOB states that the projections of
receipts and disbursements in the Financial Plan are based on reasonable assumptions, but there can be no assurance that results will not differ materially and adversely from these projections. For example, in past years, tax receipts collections
have varied substantially from the levels forecasted, and entitlement-based programmatic spending has also varied significantly from initial projections. More recently, DOB recognized the need to correct a structural imbalance under the Medicaid
Global Cap as spending levels exceeded the indexed levels. Similarly, there are inherent risks related to the financial condition of health care providers and enrollment in public health insurance programs driven directly or indirectly by the
COVID-19 pandemic. Financial Plan projections include recurring savings associated with reductions implemented in FY 2020 and the Medicaid Redesign Team II (“MRT II”) actions authorized in the Enacted Budget to limit Medicaid spending,
which also included increased General Fund support.</div> <div>DOB
routinely executes cash management actions to manage the State’s large and complex budget. These actions are intended for a variety of purposes that include improving the State’s cash flow, managing resources within and across State
fiscal years, assisting in adherence to spending targets, and better positioning the State to address future risks and</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>unanticipated costs, such
as economic downturns, unexpected revenue deterioration, and unplanned expenditures. As such, the State has regularly made certain payments above those initially planned, subject to available resources, to maintain budget flexibility.</div>
<div>The Financial Plan is based on numerous assumptions including
the condition of the State and national economies, and the concomitant collection of economically sensitive tax receipts in the amounts projected. Other uncertainties and risks concerning the economic and receipts forecasts include impacts of
national and international events; ongoing financial risks in the Eurozone; changes in consumer confidence; the price and supply of oil and gas; major terrorist events and hostilities or war; climate change and extreme weather events; severe
epidemic or pandemic events; cybersecurity threats; federal statutory and regulatory changes concerning financial sector activities; changes to federal tax law; changes to federal programs; changes concerning financial sector bonus payouts, as well
as any future legislation governing the structure of such compensation; shifts in monetary policy affecting interest rates and the financial markets; credit rating agency actions; financial and real estate market developments that may adversely
affect bonus income and capital gains realizations; technology industry developments and employment; the effect of household debt on consumer spending and State tax collections; and outcomes of litigation and other claims affecting the State.</div>
<div>The Financial Plan is subject to various uncertainties and
contingencies relating to: wage and benefit increases for State employees that exceed projected annual costs; changes in the size of the State’s workforce; the realization of the projected rate of return for pension fund assets, and current
assumptions with respect to wages for State employees affecting the State’s required pension fund contributions; the willingness and ability of the federal government to provide the aid projected in the Financial Plan; the ability of the State
to implement cost reduction initiatives, including reductions in State agency operations, and the success with which the State controls expenditures; unanticipated growth in Medicaid program costs; and the ability of the State and its public
authorities to issue securities successfully in public credit markets. Some of these issues are described in more detail herein. The projections and assumptions contained in the Financial Plan are subject to revisions that may result in substantial
changes. No assurance can be given that these estimates and projections, which depend in part upon actions the State expects to be taken but which are not within the State’s control, will be realized.</div>
<div>Potential Long-Term Risks to the Financial Plan from COVID-19
Pandemic</div> <div>It is not possible to assess or forecast with
any degree of certainty or precision the long-term impacts of COVID-19 on commuting patterns, remote working, business activity, educational opportunities, social gatherings, tourism, use of public transportation, aviation and more. Adverse results
in the foregoing could have long-term trend impacts on the sources of revenues in the State’s Financial Plan, including PIT, consumption and corporate taxes, fees and more, and such impacts could be material.</div>
<div>For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to changes in the
behavior of resident and nonresident taxpayers. Consistent with the growth in remote work arrangements, many nonresidents are no longer commuting into New York and instead are working remotely from home offices. However, under long-standing State
policy, a nonresident working from home pays New York taxes on wages from a New York employer unless that employer has established the nonresident’s home office as a bona fide office of the employer. The COVID-19 pandemic has also led some New
York residents to shelter in locations outside of the State. In addition, some taxpayers domiciled in New York may have relocated during the pandemic.</div>
<div>Budget Risks and Uncertainties</div>
<div>There can be no assurance that the State’s financial
position will not change materially and adversely from current projections. If this were to occur, the State would be required to take additional gap closing actions. Such actions may include, but are not limited to reductions in State agency
operations; delays or reductions in payments to local governments or other recipients of State aid; delays in or suspension of capital maintenance and construction; extraordinary financing of operating expenses; use of nonrecurring resources; or
other measures. In some cases, the ability of the State to implement such actions requires the approval of the Legislature and cannot be implemented solely by the Governor. The Enacted Budget granted the Budget Director the authority to reduce
aid-to-localities appropriations and disbursements by any amount needed to maintain a balanced budget, as estimated by DOB. The Budget Director’s powers are activated if actual state operating funds tax receipts are less than 99 percent of
estimated tax receipts, or actual state operating funds disbursements are more than 101 percent of estimated disbursements, as measured at three points during the year (April 1-30, May 1-June 30, and July 1-December 31). As of the initial
measurement period (April 1-30), the Budget Director’s powers were activated and are in force for the remainder of FY 2021 to maintain a balanced budget. The Budget Director is authorized to transmit a plan to the Legislature identifying the
specific appropriations and cash disbursements that would be reduced to maintain a</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>balanced budget. The
Legislature would then have 10 days to adopt, by concurrent resolution, its own balanced budget plan. If no plan is adopted, the plan submitted by the Budget Director would take effect automatically. The process exempts certain types of local
assistance appropriations from uniform reduction, including public assistance and Supplemental Security Income payments.</div>
<div>Any reductions made pursuant to this authorization may be paid
in full or in part if one or both of the following events occur: (i) actual state operating funds tax receipts through February 28, 2021 are not less than 98 percent of estimated state operating funds tax receipts through February 28, 2021; or (ii)
the federal government provides aid that the Budget Director deems sufficient to reduce or eliminate the imbalance in the General Fund for FY 2021 and does not adversely impact the projected budget gap in FY 2022.</div>
<div>In addition, to maintain a balanced budget in the General
Fund, the Budget Director is authorized to withhold any payments, including amounts that are to be paid on specific dates prescribed in law or regulation, if such action is necessary to respond to the direct and indirect economic, financial, and
social effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.</div> <div>The Executive
Budget includes a provision that will trigger automatic across-the-board reductions to planned local assistance appropriations and cash disbursements if unrestricted federal aid is not approved by August 31, 2021 or is approved at an amount less
than the amount budgeted in the Financial Plan. The reductions would be calculated to generate savings equal to the difference between the federal aid assumed in the Financial Plan and the amount approved.</div>
<div>The Financial Plan forecast assumes various transactions will
occur as planned including, but not limited to, receipt of certain payments from public authorities; receipt of revenue sharing payments under the tribal-state compacts; receipt of miscellaneous revenues at the levels set forth in the Financial
Plan; and achievement of cost-saving measures including, but not limited to, transfer of available fund balances to the General Fund at levels currently projected and federal approvals necessary to implement the MRT II savings actions authorized in
the Enacted Budget. Such risks and uncertainties, if they were to materialize, could adversely impact the Financial Plan in current or future years, or both.</div>
<div>The Financial Plan also includes actions that affect spending
reported on a state operating funds basis, including accounting and reporting changes. If these and other transactions are not implemented or reported as planned, the annual spending change in state operating funds would increase above current
estimates.</div> <div>In developing the Financial Plan, DOB
attempts to mitigate financial risks from receipts volatility, litigation, and unexpected costs, with an emphasis on the General Fund. It does this by, among other things, exercising caution when calculating total General Fund disbursements and
managing the accumulation of financial resources that can be used to offset new costs. Such resources include, but are not limited to, fund balances not needed each year, reimbursement for capital advances, acceleration of tax refunds above the
level budgeted each year, and prepayment of expenses. There can be no assurance that such resources will be enough to address risks that may materialize in a given fiscal year.</div>
<div>In FY 2012, the State enacted legislation intended to limit
the year-to-year growth in the State’s two largest local assistance programs, school aid and Medicaid. These limitations on spending growth are described further in the following sections.</div>
<div><font>School Aid.</font><font> </font>The school aid growth cap was previously calculated based on the annual growth in the State Personal Income Growth Index (PIGI). With the exception of the 2013 school year increase (based on a five-year average),
the PIGI was based on a one-year growth index. However, in FYs 2014 through 2019, the authorized school aid increases were above the indexed levels. In FY 2020, the authorized school aid increase was within the indexed levels. Beginning in FY 2021,
the statutory PIGI for school aid has been amended to limit school aid increases to no more than the average annual income growth over a 10-year period. This change will reduce volatility in allowable growth and align the school aid cap with the
statutory Medicaid cap.</div> <div>The FY 2022 Executive Budget
recommends an $838 million (3.2 percent) increase in school aid for SY 2022, or $300 million less than the maximum $1.14 billion increase permitted under the final 4.3 percent PIGI for SY 2022. In SY 2023 and thereafter, school aid is projected to
increase consistent with the rates allowed by the growth cap.</div>
<div><font>Medicaid Global
Cap.</font><font> </font>A portion of Department of Health (DOH) State Funds Medicaid spending growth is subject to the Global Cap, the 10-year rolling average of the medical component of the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
Thus, the Global Cap allows for growth attributable to increasing costs, but not increasing utilization.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>The
statutory provisions of the Global Cap allow for flexibility in adjusting Medicaid projections to meet unanticipated costs resulting from a disaster and grant the Commissioner of Health certain powers to limit Medicaid disbursements to the level
authorized by the Global Cap. The Commissioner’s powers are intended to limit the annual growth rate to the levels set by the Global Cap indexed rate for the then-current fiscal year, through actions that may include reducing reimbursement
rates to providers. These actions may be dependent upon timely federal approvals and other elements of the program that govern implementation. Major changes to the State share of Medicaid spending, outside of the Global Cap, include State costs for
the takeover of Medicaid growth from local governments and reimbursement to providers for increased minimum wage costs. It should be further noted that General Fund spending remains sensitive to revenue performance in the State’s HCRA fund,
which finances approximately one-quarter of DOH State-share costs in the Medicaid program. Limitations on elective procedures, changes in consumer behavior, and other factors attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material and adverse
impact on HCRA revenues.</div> <div>Since enactment of the Global
Cap, subject to the management action described below, the portion of DOH State Funds Medicaid spending subject to the Global Cap has remained at or below indexed levels. However, DOH has taken management actions, including adjustments to the timing
of Medicaid payments, consistent with contractual terms, to ensure compliance with the Global Cap.</div>
<div>At the close of FY 2019, DOH deferred, for three business days
into FY 2020, the final cycle payment to Medicaid managed care organizations, as well as other payments. The FY 2019 deferral had a State-share value of $1.7 billion and was paid from available funds in the General Fund in April 2019, consistent
with contractual obligations. Absent the deferral and any other actions, Medicaid spending under the Global Cap would have exceeded the statutorily indexed rate for FY 2019 and the State would have used available General Fund resources to fund the
payments in FY 2019. According to DOH, the deferral had no impact on provider services and was attributable to growth in managed care and long-term managed care enrollment and utilization costs above initial projections, as well as timing of certain
savings actions and offsets not processed by the end of FY 2019.</div>
<div><font>MRT II Solutions to
Global Cap Imbalance.</font><font> </font>Following the need to defer FY 2019 Medicaid payments, DOB recognized that a structural imbalance existed within the Global Cap based on a review of price and utilization trends,
and other factors.<sup>3</sup> A structural imbalance in this case meant that estimated expense growth in State-share Medicaid subject to the Global Cap, absent
measures to control costs, was growing faster than allowed under the Global Cap spending growth index.<sup>4</sup></div>

<div>DOB estimated that, absent actions to control costs,
State-share Medicaid spending subject to the Global Cap would have exceeded the indexed growth amount by upwards of $3-$4 billion annually, inclusive of the FY 2019 deferral of $1.7 billion.</div>
<div>In response to the estimated Global Cap imbalance, the
Governor formed the MRT II as part of the FY 2021 Executive Budget, with the objective of restoring financial sustainability to the Medicaid program while connecting other programmatic initiatives that would advance the core healthcare strategies
pursued by the Governor since taking office in 2011. The Enacted Budget included $2.2 billion in recommendations put forward by the MRT II to create efficiencies within the Medicaid program and address the Medicaid imbalance, including identifying
efficiencies in managed care and managed long-term care as well as administrative reforms.</div>
<div>Additionally, policy initiatives such as the carve-out of
pharmacy services from managed care and the centralization of a transportation broker will increase transparency and identify efficiencies within these areas. The MRT II also focuses on greater program integrity within the Medicaid program and
includes reforms to modernize regulations to eliminate fraud, waste and abuse. The Executive Budget continues these reforms, including additional savings to preserve Global Cap balance for the duration of the Financial Plan. If these measures are
insufficient or federal approvals necessary to implement such savings do not materialize, the Financial Plan in current or future years, or both, could be adversely impacted.</div>

for 12 continuous months, the costs associated with increased enrollment continue into outyear projections. In FY 2021, the cost of the enrollment increase will be partially offset by eFMAP provided in the Families First Coronavirus Response Act
(“FFCRA”) retroactive to January 2020.</div> <div>As
the economic downturn and associated unemployment related to COVID-19 persist, the public assistance caseload is projected to increase, particularly in New York City. However, federal aid for rental assistance coupled with the extension of eviction

Impacts to the Financial Plan</div> <div>The federal government
influences the economy and budget of New York State through grants, direct spending on its own programs, such as Medicare and Social Security, and through federal tax policy. Federal policymakers may place conditions on grants, mandate certain state
actions, preempt state laws, change state and local tax (“SALT”) bases and taxpayer behavior through tax policies, and influence industries through regulatory action. Federal resources support vital services such as health care,
education, transportation, as well as severe weather and emergency response and recovery. Any changes to federal policy or funding levels could have a materially adverse impact on the Financial Plan.</div>
<div>Federal funding is a significant component of New York’s
budget, constituting approximately 40 percent of total revenues in FY 2022, including $3 billion of new unrestricted federal aid. Federal funds are predominantly targeted at programs that support vulnerable populations and those living at or near
the poverty level, such as Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (“TANF”), Elementary and Secondary Education Act Title I grants, and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act grants. Other federal resources are directed at
infrastructure and public protection. Overall, the federal resources expected to be utilized in the FY 2022 Budget include:</div> <div>

<div>Federal Funding Trends</div>
<div>Federal funds spending is expected to total $75.6 billion in

<div>Federal Coronavirus Response Legislation</div>
<div>The federal government has taken legislative, administrative,
and Federal Reserve actions intended to stabilize financial markets; extend aid to large and small businesses, health care providers, and individuals; and reimburse governments for the direct costs of pandemic response. An approximate total of $27.1
billion of funding from five federal bills for expenses related to COVID-19 has been awarded to the State (not including the latest legislation, the American Rescue Plan, which had not been enacted into law as of the date of the AIS Update). For a
majority of the enacted legislation, the economic benefits do not flow to or through the State’s Financial Plan, but instead flow directly to individuals in the form of tax rebates and to large and small businesses in the form of loans or
grants. Specifically, the federal government enacted five pieces of legislation (not including the American Rescue Plan) in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic at the time of the AIS Update:</div>
<div>(i) <font>The
Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act</font>, which provides an initial $8 billion in emergency funding to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, including support for vaccine development, the Public Health Emergency
Preparedness program, and small businesses ($40 million);</div>
<div>(<font>ii)
</font>The Families First Coronavirus Response Act<font>,</font> <font>which provides $192 billion in aid and includes paid sick leave, free testing, expanded food assistance and unemployment
benefits, protections for health care workers, and increased Medicaid funding in response to the COVID-19 pandemic ($9.8 billion);</font></div>
<div>(iii) <font>The
CARES Act</font>,<font> </font>which provides approximately $1.8 trillion in aid for federal agencies, individuals, businesses, states and localities, as well as $100 billion in provider relief funds for hospitals and
health care providers, to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. The law also authorized the Federal Reserve to purchase revenue and bond anticipation notes of states and certain local governments through the Municipal Liquidity Facility (CRF, $5.1
billion; other, $3.5 billion);</div> <div>(iv) <font>The Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act</font>,<font> </font>which provides $484 billion in overall funding for small business programs and healthcare programs, including
$75 billion for hospitals, health care providers, and testing and tracing activities ($704 million);</div>
<div>(v) <font>The
CRRSAA</font>, which provides $935 billion in funding for education, testing, tracing and vaccine distribution, unemployment assistance, small business programs, and housing ($7.9 billion).</div>
<div>Assistance to states through the CARES Act is generally
restricted to specific purposes and includes the CRF ($5.1 billion State allocation) and the Education Stabilization Fund ($1.2 billion State allocation). The FFCRA includes an emergency 6.2 percent increase to the Federal Medicaid Assistance
Percentage (“FMAP”) during the public health emergency. This increase is estimated to provide the State with roughly $3.5 billion in savings in FY 2021 and $995 million in FY 2022; however, projected Medicaid enrollment growth as a
result of the recession erodes the value of the FMAP benefit. The majority of additional funds for the State included in the CRRSAA will be additional education funding.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>In response
to the President’s major disaster declaration for the State in 2020, FEMA is also expected to provide funding for costs related to emergency protective measures conducted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there can be no assurance
that FEMA will approve claims in time for the State to receive reimbursement within the same year the costs are incurred. The State also received additional federal aid in the form of enhanced unemployment insurance funding.</div>
<div>It is expected that State agencies will continue to incur
costs to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in FY 2022. The Financial Plan continues to assume that nearly all direct COVID-19 costs incurred by agencies will be fully covered by federal aid. In addition, the Financial Plan reflects reclassifications
of eligible expenses incurred in FY 2020 and payroll expenses for public health and safety employees through December 31, 2020 to the federal CRF pursuant to U.S. Treasury eligibility guidelines.</div>
<div>The federal legislation the date of the AIS Update, however,
provides only limited unrestricted aid to replace the expected severe loss in State receipts <font></font>—<font></font> nearly $33 billion over four years. A modest increase in tax receipts
estimates since the Mid-Year Update to the Financial Plan in October 2020 has not fundamentally altered the State’s fiscal challenges. The projected aggregate two-year budget gap (FY 2021 and FY 2022) that must be closed in the FY 2022
Executive Budget is projected to total $12.7 billion. The timing and amount of new federal aid, if any, will ultimately determine the level of spending cuts and tax increases that must be enacted by the State in FY 2022. The Governor has asked
Congress for $15 billion in COVID-19 relief aid to maintain State services. About 90 percent of State funding supports schools, healthcare, local grants and services for the most vulnerable populations. The FY 2022 Executive Budget recommends
difficult spending cuts in local aid and agency operations. It also proposes tax increases. Both would slow the State’s economic and fiscal recovery. If the Governor’s full $15 billion aid request is approved, the State would be able to
reverse or modify many of these proposals. The Executive Budget includes a contingency appropriation to enable these restorations in the event that the federal government provides the full amount of aid requested by the Governor.</div>
<div>Federal Risks</div>
<div>The amount and composition of federal funds received by the
State have changed over time as a result of legislative and regulatory actions at the federal level and will likely continue to change in the coming year. Notable areas with potential for change include health care, human services and infrastructure
policy. Any reductions in federal aid could have a materially adverse impact on the Financial Plan.</div>
<div>Notable federal risks include:</div>
<div>

COVID-19 Relief.<font> As of the date of the AIS Update, New York State needed an estimated $15 billion in addition to funds for local governments to close its deficit caused by revenue losses resulting from the pandemic.

government does not act to capitalize the Federal Highway Trust Fund and ensure an extension of current law or enact a new authorization prior to October 1, 2021.</font> </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>The Financial Plan may also be adversely affected by other
federal government actions including audits, disallowances, and changes to federal participation rates or other Medicaid rules. For instance, the Financial Plan includes reimbursement to the federal government of $100 million annually through FY
2027 pursuant to a March 2015 agreement between the State and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (“CMS”). The agreement resolved a pending disallowance for FY 2011 and all related payment disputes for State-operated
services prior to April 1, 2013, including home and community-based waiver services. Pursuant to the agreement, the State must adjust the federal /State share of future Medicaid costs to reimburse the federal government. The State used $850 million
in extraordinary monetary settlement payments, previously set aside for financial risks, to finance the initial repayment amount in FY 2016.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

Federal Aid</div> <div>Former President Trump proposed significant
cuts to mandatory and discretionary domestic programs in recent FFYs, including the current FFY 2021, which were largely rejected in the final appropriations bills approved for each of those years. FFY 2021 appropriations were enacted on December
27, 2020.</div> <div>President Biden, who took office on January
20, 2021, had yet to release a FFY 2022 budget proposal (which was expected to be released on February 1, 2021, but often is delayed during transition years) as of the date of the AIS Update. While the Biden Administration is expected to have its
own priorities for the federal partnership with the states, there can be no assurance of levels of federal aid or other changes affecting the State. However, to the date of the AIS Update, the Administration had submitted a $1.9 trillion plan to
stimulate economic recovery and control the COVID-19 pandemic to Congress. The Biden plan includes $350 billion in direct aid to states and localities to maintain essential services that are at risk as governments contend with dramatic losses in tax
receipts.</div> <div>Federal Debt Limit</div>
<div>The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 suspended the federal debt
limit through July 31, 2021 and brought to a close the extraordinary measures that the U.S. Treasury had been operating under since the prior suspension expired on March 1, 2019. A federal government default on payments, particularly for a prolonged
period, could have a materially adverse effect on national and state economies, financial markets, and intergovernmental aid payments. Specific effects on the Financial Plan of a future federal government default are unknown and impossible to
predict. However, data from past economic downturns suggests that the State’s revenue loss could be substantial if there were an economic downturn due to a federal default.</div>
<div>A payment default by the federal government may also adversely
affect the municipal bond market. Municipal issuers, including the State, could face higher borrowing costs and impaired access to capital markets. This would jeopardize planned capital investments in transportation infrastructure, higher education
facilities, hazardous waste remediation, environmental projects, and economic development projects. Additionally, the market for and market value of outstanding municipal obligations, including municipal obligations of the State, could be adversely
affected.</div> <div>Federal Tax Law Changes</div>
<div>On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”), making major changes to the federal Internal Revenue Code, most of which were effective in the 2018 tax year. The federal tax law made extensive changes to federal personal income taxes, corporate
income taxes, and estate taxes.</div> <div>The State’s income
tax system interacts with the federal system in numerous ways. Changes to the federal tax code have significant flow-through effects on State tax burdens and State tax receipts. From the standpoint of individual New York State taxpayers, the effect
of the new $10,000 limit on the deductibility of SALT payments, effective beginning in tax year 2018, is substantial.</div>
<div>The SALT deduction originated with the first federal income
tax implemented to fund the Civil War effort and has been in place continuously since 1913. The TCJA’s SALT deduction limit represents a large increase in the State’s effective tax rate relative to historical experience and may adversely
affect New York State’s economic competitiveness.</div>
<div>Moreover, the TCJA contains numerous provisions that may
adversely affect residential real estate prices in New York State and elsewhere, of which the SALT deduction limit is the most significant. A loss of wealth associated with a decline in home prices could have a significant impact on household
spending in the State through the wealth effect, whereby consumers perceive the rise and fall of the value of an asset, such as a home, as a corresponding increase or decline in income, causing them to alter their spending practices. Reductions in
household spending by New York residents, if they were to occur, would be expected to result in lower sales for the State’s businesses, which, in turn, would p further reductions in economic activity and employment. Lastly, falling home prices
could result in homeowners delaying the sale of their homes. The combined impact of lower home prices and fewer sales transactions could result in lower real estate transfer tax collections.</div>
<div>In sum, the federal tax law changes may intensify migration
pressures and the drag on the value of home prices, thereby posing risks to the State’s tax base and current Financial Plan projections.</div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>As part of
the State’s continuing response to federal tax law changes, legislation is being proposed for adoption by the State Legislature in support of the Executive Budget that provides for an optional pass-through entity tax (“PTET”) on
the New York-sourced income of partnerships and S corporations that are composed solely of individual partners or shareholders. Qualifying entities that elect to pay PTET will pay a 6.85 percent tax on their New York-sourced ordinary income (and
guaranteed payments for partnerships) at the partnership or corporation level, and their individual partners, members and shareholders will receive a refundable tax credit equal to 92 percent of the proportionate or pro rata share of taxes paid by
the electing entity. Additionally, the proposal includes a resident tax credit that allows reciprocity with other states that have implemented substantially similar taxes, such as Connecticut and New Jersey.</div>
<div>DOB expects that the PTET legislation, if adopted as proposed,
would be revenue neutral for the State, although personal income tax receipts would decrease to the extent that qualifying entities elect to pay PTET. However, to hold harmless the Revenue Bond Tax Fund and to maintain comparable security for PIT
bondholders, the State is also proposing legislation that would cause 50 percent of receipts from PTET to be deposited into the RBTF. Accordingly, aggregate contributions to the RBTF are expected to be unaffected because 50 percent of net revenues
from both PIT and the proposed PTET, as well as 50 percent of the net revenues from the Employer Compensation Expense Program (“ECEP”), will be deposited into the RBTF.</div>
<div>The Financial Plan does not currently include an estimate for
PTET receipts or the corresponding decrease in PIT receipts as the opt-in rates for electing entities will not be known until December 2021. DOB expects to include estimates as opt-in rates and other information become known. In November 2020, the
IRS released Notice 2020-75, which announced that the Treasury and IRS intend to issue proposed regulations to clarify that State and local income taxes imposed on and paid by a partnership or an S corporation on its income, such as the PTET, are
allowable as a federal deduction to taxable income, which may increase participation in the program.</div>
<div>Previously, the State enacted tax reforms in tax year 2018
intended to mitigate issues arising from the federal law, including decoupling many State tax provisions from the federal changes, creation of an optional payroll tax program, and establishment of a new State charitable giving vehicle, as described
below.</div> <div>The State developed the ECEP and the Charitable
Gifts Trust Fund, as described below, based on a review of existing laws, regulations, and precedents. However, there can be no assurance that the IRS will allow taxes paid under the ECEP by an electing employer or donations made by taxpayers to the
Charitable Gifts Trust Fund to be deductible for federal tax purposes under current law and the TCJA. As noted below, the IRS issued regulations that impair the ability of taxpayers to deduct donations to the Charitable Gifts Trust Fund from
federally taxable income while receiving State tax credits for such donations.</div>
<div>On July 17, 2018, the State, joined by Connecticut, Maryland,
and New Jersey, filed a lawsuit to protect New York taxpayers from the new federal limit on the SALT deduction. The lawsuit claimed the new SALT limit was enacted to target New York and similarly situated states, interfered with states’ rights
to make their own fiscal decisions, and disproportionately harmed taxpayers in these states. On September 30, 2019, the Southern District of New York found that the states failed to make a valid legal claim that the SALT limit unconstitutionally
encroaches on states’ sovereign authority to determine their own taxation and fiscal policies. The State, along with Connecticut, Maryland, and New Jersey, filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on
November 26, 2019, and briefing for the appeal was completed as of June 29, 2020. Oral argument was held on December 3, 2020, and a decision is pending.</div>
<div>On June 13, 2019, the IRS issued final regulations, known as
Treasury Decision 9864, that provided final rules and additional guidance on the availability of federal income tax deductions for charitable contributions when a taxpayer receives or expects to receive a State or local tax credit for such
charitable contributions. In the case of State tax credits received by a taxpayer making a charitable contribution, the regulations require the taxpayer to reduce the federal income tax deduction by the amount of the State tax credit received for
such charitable contribution. This rule does not apply, however, if the value of the State tax credit does not exceed 15 percent of the charitable contribution. The regulations were made retroactive to August 27, 2018 (the date on which the U.S.
Treasury and IRS first published proposed regulatory changes).</div>
<div>On July 17, 2019, New York State, joined by Connecticut and
New Jersey, filed a federal lawsuit challenging Treasury Decision 9864. Among other things, the lawsuit seeks to restore the full federal income tax deduction for charitable contributions, regardless of the amount of any State tax credit provided to
taxpayers as a result of contributions made to the Charitable Gifts Trust Fund, in accordance with the precedent since 1917. The federal defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, in the alternative for summary judgment, on December 23, 2019, and
the states responded and filed their own motion for summary judgment on February 28, 2020. Briefing on the motions was completed in July 2020, and the states’ request for oral</div> </div> <div type="Block">

If the lawsuit is successful, it is expected that donations to the Charitable Gifts Trust Fund in future years could be higher than the $93 million in donations made in 2018.</div>
<div>As part of the State tax reforms enacted in 2018, taxpayers
may claim reimbursement from the State for interest on underpayments of federal tax liability for the 2019, 2020 and 2021 tax years if the underpayments arise from reliance on the 2018 amendments to State Tax Law. To receive reimbursement, taxpayers
are required to submit their reimbursement claims to the Department of Taxation and Finance (“DTF”) within 60 days of making an interest payment to the IRS.</div>
<div>The State would incur costs if taxpayer participation in the
ECEP and Charitable Gifts initiatives for the 2019, 2020 and 2021 tax years results in federal determinations of underpayment of federal income tax. Any cost to the Financial Plan from State reimbursement of interest charges would occur in FY 2021
at the earliest for determinations on 2019 tax payments due in July 2020 or thereafter.</div>
<div>The Financial Plan does not include any estimate of the
magnitude of the possible interest expense to the State, which depends on several factors, including the rates of participation in the ECEP; magnitude of donations to the Charitable Gifts Trust Fund; aggregate amount of determinations of
underpayment attributable to reliance on the 2018 amendments to State Tax Law; amount of time between the due date of the return and the date any federal determination is issued; interest rate applied; and frequency at which taxpayers submit timely
reimbursement claims to the State. Interest on unpaid federal tax generally accrues from the due date of the return until the date of payment in full. Under current federal law, the interest rate is determined quarterly and is the federal short-term
rate plus 3 percent, compounded daily.</div> <div>Essential
Plan</div> <div>Due to the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19
pandemic, the number of eligible recipients for EP coverage increased as unemployment increased, employer-sponsored coverage ended and incomes fell below the eligibility threshold. New costs associated with increased EP coverage are expected to
continue in the outyears as the economy recovers. Since the EP is fully federally funded, additional enrollment costs will draw in additional federal revenues and are not anticipated to increase State support in FY 2021 and beyond. Although the EP
is not a Medicaid program, EP resources are managed within the Medicaid Global Cap. Accordingly, State savings associated with the EP local assistance program are realized within the Global Cap.</div>
<div>Medicaid Redesign Team (MRT) Medicaid Waiver</div>
<div>The CMS and the State have an existing agreement authorizing
up to $8 billion in federal funding through March 31, 2021 to transform New York’s health care system and ensure access to quality care for all Medicaid beneficiaries. This funding was provided through an amendment to the State’s
Partnership Plan 1115 Medicaid waiver. Since January 1, 2014, in accordance with provisions of the ACA, the State has been eligible for eFMAP funding associated with childless adults.</div>
<div>Due to the demonstrated success of the Delivery System Reform
Incentive Payment (“DSRIP”) waiver, the State submitted a waiver request to CMS on November 25, 2019, seeking an extension of the original waiver to authorize the remaining $625 million of spending in FY 2021 for an additional period of
four years (through FY 2024) and up to $8 billion in additional federal funding for continued health care beginning in FY 2022.</div>
<div>However, CMS denied the State’s request on February 21,
2020, ’on the basis that the original DSRIP award was time-limited and meant to be a one-time investment, and that it was not in a position to authorize a conceptual agreement beyond the current demonstration program. ’On May 11, 2020,
the State submitted a subsequent 1115 Medicaid waiver request that aligns with the expiration of the MRT waiver on March 31, 2021. If approved, the COVID-19 1115 Waiver would provide the State with $1.9 billion and new flexibilities to respond to
the public health emergency.</div> <div>As a result of the
Governor’s MRT II initiatives, DOH is building on prior successes in transforming the State’s ability to provide Medicaid services by preparing a waiver extension of the MRT 1115 waiver. DOH was preparing at the time of the AIS Update to
file a three-year extension to the existing MRT 1115 Waiver by March 2021.</div>
<div>Once the MRT waiver is extended, additional funding requests
can be pursued. New York will explore new initiatives through amendments to the approved waiver on Medicaid policy priorities, including telehealth, alternative payment methodologies, workforce and health equity and social determinants of health,
and to address the COVID-19 pandemic impact on the State’s health care delivery system.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

Compensation Expense Program</div> <div>Employers that elect to
participate in the ECEP are subject to a 5 percent State tax on all annual payroll expenses in excess of $40,000 per employee, phased in over three years beginning on January 1, 2019, as follows: 1.5 percent in tax year 2019, 3 percent in tax year
2020, and 5 percent in tax year 2021. Employers must elect to participate in the ECEP for the upcoming tax year by December 1 of the preceding calendar year. For tax year 2019, 262 employers elected to participate in the ECEP and remitted $1.5
million, with the number of participating employers increasing to 299 for tax year 2020.</div>
<div>The ECEP is intended to mitigate the tax burden for employees
affected by the SALT deduction limit. While the TCJA limits deductibility for individuals, it does not cap deductibility for ordinary and necessary business expenses paid or incurred by employers in carrying on a trade or business. The ECEP is
expected to be State revenue neutral, with any decrease in New York State PIT receipts expected to be offset by a comparable increase in ECEP revenue. A State PIT credit is available to employees whose wages are subject to the tax. Any decrease in
New York State PIT receipts is expected to be offset by a comparable increase in ECEP revenue because the formula used to calculate the State PIT credit corresponds in value to the ECEP. Remittance of ECEP revenue to the State began in the fourth

who donates may also claim a State tax credit equal to 85 percent of the donation amount for the tax year after the donation is made. State PIT receipts will be reduced by the State tax deduction and 85 percent tax credit.<sup>5</sup></div>

$93 million in charitable gifts deposited to the Charitable Gifts Trust Fund for healthcare and education ($58 million and $35 million, respectively). Charitable gifts are appropriated for the authorized purposes.</div>
<div>Impact of State Tax Law Changes on PIT Revenue Bonds</div>
<div>To offset the potential reduction in the level of New York
State PIT receipts resulting from activity of the ECEP and donations to the Charitable Gifts Trust Fund, State Finance Law provisions creating the Revenue Bond Tax Fund were amended to increase the percentage of New York State PIT receipts required
to be deposited upon receipt in the RBTF, from 25 percent to 50 percent. In addition, the legislation that created the ECEP required that 50 percent of ECEP receipts received by the State be deposited to the RBTF. These changes became effective
April 1, 2018.</div> <div>The amendments also increased the amount
of all New York State PIT receipts collected from payroll withholding and ECEP receipts that must be deposited in the RBTF if (a) the State Legislature fails to appropriate amounts required to make all debt service payments on State PIT Revenue
Bonds or (b) having been appropriated and set aside pursuant to a certificate of the Director of the Budget, debt service payments and other cash requirements under the applicable financing agreements have not been made when due on the State PIT
Revenue Bonds. Under prior law, New York State PIT receipts from payroll withholding were to be deposited to the RBTF until amounts on deposit in the RBTF equaled the greater of 25 percent of annual New York State PIT receipts or $6 billion. Under
the new law, New York State PIT receipts and ECEP receipts are deposited to the RBTF until amounts on deposit in the RBTF equal the greater of 40 percent of the aggregate of annual New York State PIT receipts and ECEP receipts or $12 billion.</div>
<div>Donations to the Charitable Gifts Trust Fund could reduce
State PIT receipts by nearly one dollar for every dollar donated. If Treasury Decision 9864 is upheld in federal court, taxpayer participation in the future will likely be reduced. However, if the legal challenge is successful in restoring the full
federal tax deduction for charitable contributions, donations to the Charitable Gifts Trust Fund in future years could be higher than in 2018, when donations totaled $93 million. In such event, the amount of donations to the Charitable Gifts Trust
Fund would pose a risk to the amount of New York State PIT receipts deposited to the RBTF in future years. To address this risk, the State increased the amount of PIT receipts deposited to the RBTF from 25 percent to 50 percent as part of the State
tax reforms enacted in 2018.</div> <div>DOB and DTF performed a

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>the Charitable Gifts Trust
Fund was intended to serve as a stress test on State PIT receipts that may flow to the RBTF under different levels of assumed taxpayer participation. Accordingly, the calculation should not, under any circumstances, be viewed as a projection of
likely donations in any future year. The factors that may influence donation activity are complex and include, but are not limited to, possible statements, actions, or interpretive guidance by the IRS or others relating to the deductibility of such
donations; the liquidity position, risk tolerance, and knowledge of individual taxpayers; advice or guidance of tax advisors or other professionals; changes in general economic conditions; adoption of similar trusts in other states; and tax
reciprocity agreements among states.</div> <div>The calculation of
the maximum amount of potential donations from 2020 through 2024 is on average in the range of $22 billion annually. The calculation assumes that every resident taxpayer who has an incentive to donate will do so, and such donations will be equal to
the total value of each resident taxpayer’s SALT payments, less the value of the $10,000 federal SALT deduction limit, up to the value of the taxpayer’s total State tax liability. The calculation is dependent on several assumptions
concerning the number of itemized filers. It relies on the most recent PIT population study file, as trended forward, as well as the impact of the TCJA and State law changes on the number and distribution of itemized and standardized filers. The
calculation also assumes that no further changes in federal tax law occur and DOB projections of the level of State taxpayer liability for the forecast period as set forth in the Financial Plan are materially accurate.</div>
<div>In general, assumptions made regarding taxpayer behavior were
intended to maximize the calculated impact of charitable giving on PIT receipts in each year. After factoring in all of the foregoing adjustments and with inclusion of ECEP revenues, RBTF receipts are projected to remain above the level of receipts
that would have been expected under statutes in effect prior to April 2018, even in a maximum participation scenario.</div>
<div>The DOB and DTF calculation of the projected maximum amount of
potential contributions to the Charitable Gifts Trust Fund is necessarily based on many assumptions that may change materially over time. While DOB believes that these factors can be expected to constrain donation activity, there can be no assurance
that, under conditions of maximum participation, the amount of annual charitable gifts will not reduce the level of PIT receipts deposited into the RBTF below the levels projected in February 2018 before State tax reforms were enacted. If that were
to occur, it is DOB’s expectation that changes to the tax law would be recommended to further increase the percentage of PIT receipts deposited into the RBTF.</div>
<div>Climate Change Adaptation.
<font>Climate change poses significant long-term threats to physical, biological and economic systems in New York and around the world. Potential hazards and risks related to climate change for the State include, among
other things, rising sea levels, more severe coastal flooding and erosion hazards, and more intense storms. Storms in recent years, including Superstorm Sandy, Hurricane Irene, and Tropical Storm Lee, have demonstrated vulnerabilities in the
State’s infrastructure (including mass transit systems, power transmission and distribution systems, and other critical lifelines) to extreme weather events including coastal flooding caused by storm surges. The potential effects of climate
change could adversely impact the Financial Plan in current or future years. To mitigate and manage these impacts, significant long-term planning and investments by the federal government, the State, municipalities, and public utilities are expected
to be needed to adapt existing infrastructure to climate change risks.</font></div>
<div>The State continues to recover from the damage sustained
during three powerful storms that crippled entire regions of the State. In August 2011, Hurricane Irene disrupted power and caused extensive flooding in various counties. In September 2011, Tropical Storm Lee caused flooding in additional counties
and, in some cases, exacerbated the damage caused by Hurricane Irene. On October 29, 2012, Superstorm Sandy struck the East Coast, causing widespread infrastructure damage and economic losses to the greater New York region. The frequency and
intensity of these storms present economic and financial risks to the State. Reimbursement claims for costs of the immediate response, recovery, and future mitigation efforts continue, largely supported by federal funds. In January 2013, the federal
government approved approximately $60 billion in federal disaster aid for general recovery, rebuilding, and mitigation activity nationwide in response to Superstorm Sandy. A total of $28.9 billion has been committed to repairing impacted homes and
businesses, restoring community services, and mitigating future storm risks to the State and its localities.</div>
<div>Financial markets participants are increasingly acknowledging
climate change risks. In June 2017, an industry-led Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures convened by the Financial Stability Board (an international body that monitors the global financial system) published recommendations stating
that climate risk affects most market sectors and that climate-related risk should be publicly disclosed to investors in annual financial filings. In November 2017, Moody’s Investors Service issued guidance to state and local governments that
climate change is forecast to heighten exposure to economic losses, placing potential pressure on credit ratings. The Moody’s report identified rising sea levels and their effect on coastal</div> </div>

primary climate risks for the northeastern United States, including New York State. These risks are heightened by population and critical infrastructure concentration in coastal counties.</div>
<div>An October 2018 special report released by the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of the United Nations (“IPCC”) found that human activity has already caused approximately 1.0°C of warming and is continuing to increase average global temperatures at 0.2°C per decade
due to past and ongoing emissions. The IPCC states that global warming is likely to reach 1.5°C of warming between 2030 and 2052 if temperatures continue to increase at the current rate. This increase is expected to produce a range of adverse
outcomes“”. For example, the IPCC rates global risks of extreme weather events and coastal flooding as increasing from moderate (“detectable”) today to high (“severe and widespread”) at 1.5°C of warming. The
risk of severe impacts increases further at higher temperatures. Using current trends, climate change risks increasingly fall within the term of current outstanding bonds of the State, its public authorities and municipalities. State bonds may be
issued with a term of up to 30 years under State statute.</div>
<div>The State is participating in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions in order to mitigate the risk of severe impacts from climate change. The Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act of 2019 set the State on a path toward developing regulations to reduce statewide greenhouse gas emissions to 85
percent below the 1990 level by 2050. As part of this target, the State plans to fully transition its electricity sector away from carbon emissions by 2040. The State is a member of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and has used a cap and trade
mechanism to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from electric power plants since 2008.</div>
<div>Extraordinary Monetary Settlements</div>
<div>Beginning in FY 2015, the State began receiving extraordinary
monetary settlements for violations of State laws by major financial institutions and other entities. Effective April 1, 2019, DOB no longer classifies or distinctly identifies any settlement of less than $25 million as an extraordinary monetary
settlement.</div> <div>State Government Employment</div>
<div>As of March 31, 2020, the State had approximately 183,700 FTE
annual salaried employees funded from all funds including some part-time and temporary employees, independently elected agencies and university systems, but excluding seasonal, legislative and judicial employees. The workforce is now substantially
smaller than it was in 1990, when it peaked at approximately 230,000 positions. The State workforce is projected to total 184,059 positions at the end of FY 2021. The State workforce subject to direct Executive control is expected to total 118,850
FTE positions at the end of FY 2021.</div> <div>Status of Current
Labor Negotiations<font>.</font><font> The State has multi-year labor agreements in place with most of the unionized workforce and continues to negotiate new agreements with unions whose
contracts are expiring or have expired. The State continues to withhold the general salary increases that were scheduled to go into effect on April 1, 2020 and planned at the time of the AIS Update to withhold the April 1, 2021 general salary
increases.</font></div> <div>The Judiciary also has contracts in
place with all 12 unions represented within its workforce through FY 2021, which include the Civil Service Employees Association (FY 2018 to FY 2021); the New York State Supreme Court Officers Association, the New York State Court Officers
Association and the Court Clerks Association (FY 2012 to FY 2021); and eight other unions (FY 2020 to FY 2021).</div>
<div>State Retirement System (“System”)<font>. The System provides pension benefits to public employees of the State and its localities (except employees of New York City and public school teachers and administrators, who are covered by separate public retirement
systems). State employees made up about 32 percent of the System’s membership as of March 31, 2020. There were 2,962 public employers participating in the System, including the State, all cities and counties (except New York City), most towns,
villages and school districts (with respect to non-teaching employees), and many public authorities.</font></div>
<div>As of March 31, 2020, 673,336 persons were members of the
System and 487,407 pensioners or beneficiaries were receiving pension benefits. Article 5, section 7 of the State Constitution considers membership in any State pension or retirement system to be “a contractual relationship, the benefits of
which shall not be diminished or impaired.”</div> <div>The
State Comptroller is the administrative head of New York State and Local Retirement System (“NYSLRS”) and the trustee and custodian of the Common Retirement Fund , a trust created pursuant to the Retirement and Social Security Law
(“RSSL”) to hold the System’s assets and, as such, is responsible for investing the assets of the System.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

including the Judiciary, to the NYSLRS, which account for the majority of the State’s pension costs.<sup>6</sup> All projections are based on estimated market

pension costs also include costs for State employees in the Teachers’ Retirement System for both SUNY and the State Education Department (“SED”), the Optional Retirement Program for both SUNY and SED, and the New York State
Voluntary Defined Contribution Plan. </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>New York State Retirement and Social Security Law Section 11
directs the Actuary for NYSLRS to provide a quinquennial report on the System’s’ experience and to propose assumptions and methods for the actuarial valuations. The Actuary issued the quinquennial report in August 2020. The report did
not recommend significant changes due the economic uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic but recommended revisiting the assumptions in August 2021.</div>
<div>As such, in FY 2022, the economic assumptions for NYSLRS
remain unchanged, including inflation and cost-of-living adjustment (2.5 percent <font>I </font>1.5 percent), investment return (6.8 percent), salary scale (4.5 percent for ERS and 5.7 percent for PFRS), and asset
valuation method (five-year level smoothing of gains or losses above or below the assumed return applied to all assets and cash flows). However, demographic assumptions were updated including pension mortality (gender/collar specific tables based
upon FY 2016-2020 experience with Society of Actuaries Scale MP-2019 loading for mortality improvement) and active member decrements (based upon FY 2016-2020 experience). The impact of the updated demographic assumptions and a valuation date during
a bear market is an increase in the average employer contribution rates in 2020, to 16.2 percent for ERS and 28.3 percent for PFRS. The percentage increases are 11 percent higher for ERS and 16 percent higher for PFRS than the previous fiscal
year’s rates.</div> <div>The FY 2022 ERS/PFRS pension
estimate of $2.7 billion relied upon the December 2020 estimate from the State Comptroller, which reflects a negative 2.68 percent return in the Common Retirement Fund in FY 2020. This was partially offset by the lower cost of Tier 6 entrants and
the use of a new mortality improvement scale. The State will continue to pay $400 million towards the balance outstanding on prior-year deferrals. The Office of the State Comptroller (“OSC”) does not forecast pension liability estimates
beyond the budget year, thus estimates for FY 2023 and beyond are developed by DOB. DOB’s forecast assumes growth in the salary base consistent with collective bargaining agreements and a conservative rate of return compared to the assumed
rate of return by NYSLRS. The current Financial Plan forecast does not reflect the potential losses in asset value as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and recession.</div>
<div>The pension liability also reflects changes to military
service credit provisions found in Section 1000 of the Retirement and Social Security Law enacted during the 2016 legislative session (Chapter 41 of the Laws of 2016). All veterans who are members of NYSLRS may, upon application, receive extra
service credit for up to three years of military duty if such veterans (a) were honorably discharged, (b) have achieved five years of credited service in a public retirement system, and (c) have agreed to pay the employee share of such additional
pension credit. Costs to the State for employees in the ERS are incurred at the time each member purchases credit, as documented by the OSC at the end of each calendar year. Costs for employees in PFRS are distributed across PFRS employers and
billed on a two-year lag (e.g., FY 2017 costs were first billed in FY 2019). Additionally, Section 25 of the RSSL requires the State to pay the ERS employer contributions associated with this credit on behalf of local governments. The State is also
permitted to amortize the cost of past service credits that are newly incurred in a given fiscal year. The ERS cost to the State (including costs covered for local ERS) was $20.7 million in FY 2021 based on actual credit purchased through December
31, 2020. DOB has revised estimates to reflect stronger participation in the program. ERS costs are estimated to be $25 million in FY 2022 and $15 million annually in the outyears.</div>
<div>The amount of future annual employer contribution rates will
depend, in part, on the value of the assets held by the CRF as of each April 1, as well as on the present value of the anticipated benefits to be paid by the System as of each April 1. Contribution rates for FY 2022 were released in August 2020. The
average ERS rate increased by 1.6 percent from 14.6 percent of salary in FY 2021 to 16.2 percent of salary in FY 2022, while the average PFRS rate increased by 3.9 percent from 24.4 percent of salary in FY 2021 to 28.3 percent of salary in FY
2022.</div> <div>The System’s assets are held by the CRF for
the exclusive benefit of members, retirees and beneficiaries. Investments for the System are made by the State Comptroller as trustee of the CRF. The System reports that the net position restricted for pension benefits as of March 31, 2020 was

anticipates that the plan net position, plus future actuarially determined contributions, will be sufficient to pay for the anticipated benefits of current members, retirees and beneficiaries. The valuation used by the System’s Actuary was
based on the audited net position restricted for pension benefits as of March 31, 2020. Actuarially determined contributions are calculated using actuarial assets and the present value of anticipated benefits. Actuarial assets differed from plan net
position on April 1, 2020 in that the determination of actuarial assets utilized a smoothing method that recognized 20 percent of the unexpected loss for FY 2020, 40 percent of the unexpected gain for FY 2019, 60 percent of the unexpected gain for
FY 2018, and 80 percent of the unexpected gain for FY 2017. The asset valuation method smooths gains and losses based on the market value of all investments. Actuarial assets increased from $213.0 billion on April 1, 2019 to $214.1 billion on April

<div>The State Comptroller adopted Governmental Accounting
Standards Board Statement (“GASBS”) 75, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions, for the State’s basic financial statements for FY 2019. GASBS 75, which replaces GASBS 45 and GASBS 57,
addresses accounting and financial reporting for OPEB provided to the employees of state and local governmental employers. GASBS 75 establishes standards for recognizing and measuring liabilities and expenses/expenditures, as well as identifying the
methods and assumptions that are required to be used to project benefit payments, discount projected benefit payments to their actuarially determined present value, and attribute that present value to periods of employee service. Specifically, GASBS
75 now requires the full liability to be recognized.</div> <div>The
State’s total OPEB liability equals the employer’s share of the actuarially determined present value of projected benefit payments attributed to past periods of employee service. The total OPEB obligation less any OPEB assets set aside
in an OPEB trust or similar arrangement represents the net OPEB obligation.</div>
<div>As reported in the State’s basic financial statements
for FY 2020, the total ending OPEB liability for FY 2020 is $63.9 billion ($51.1 billion for the State and $12.8 billion for SUNY). The total OPEB liability as of March 31, 2020 was measured as of March 31, 2019 and was determined using an actuarial
valuation as of April 1, 2018, with update procedures used to roll forward the total OPEB liability to March 31, 2019. The total beginning OPEB liability for FY 2020 was $63.45 billion ($50.9 billion for the State and $12.5 billion for SUNY). The
total OPEB liability was calculated using the entry age normal cost method. The discount rate is based on the Bond Buyer 20-year general obligation municipal bond index rate at March 31 (3.89 percent in FY 2019 and 3.79 percent in FY 2020). The
total OPEB liability increased by $529 million (0.8 percent) during FY 2020.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>The FY 2018 Enacted Budget included legislation creating a
Retiree Health Benefit Trust Fund (the “Trust Fund”), a qualified trust under GASBS 75, that authorizes the State to reserve money for the payment of health benefits of retired employees and their dependents. Under the legislation, the
State may deposit into the Trust Fund, in any given fiscal year, up to 0.5 percent of total then-current unfunded actuarial accrued OPEB liability. The Financial Plan does not currently include any deposits to the Trust Fund.</div>
<div>GASBS 75 is not expected to alter the Financial Plan cash

<div>Cybersecurity. <font>New York State
government, like many other large public and private entities, relies on a large and complex technology environment to conduct its operations. As a recipient and provider of personal, private, or sensitive information, the State and its public
corporations and municipalities face multiple cyber threats including, but not limited to, hacking, viruses, malware and other attacks on computer and other sensitive digital networks and systems. Entities or individuals may attempt to gain
unauthorized access to ’digital systems for the purposes of misappropriating assets or information or causing operational disruption and damage. To mitigate the risk of business operations impact and/or damage from cyber incidents or
cyberattacks, the State invests in multiple forms of cybersecurity and operational controls. The State’s Chief Information Security Office (“CISO”) within the State’s Office of Information Technology Services maintains
comprehensive policies and standards, programs, and services relating to the security of State government networks and geographic information systems and annually assesses the implementation of security policies and standards to ensure compliance
through the Nationwide Cyber Security Review. In addition, the CISO maintains the New York State Cyber Command Center team, which provides a security operations center, digital forensics capabilities, and related procedures for cyber incident
reporting and response. The CISO distributes real-time advisories and alerts, provides managed security services, and implements statewide information security awareness and training. While controls are routinely reviewed and tested, no assurances
can be given that such security and operational control measures will be completely successful at guarding against cyber threats and attacks. The results of any such attack could impact business operations and/or damage State digital networks and
systems or State and local infrastructure, and the costs of remedying any such damage could be substantial.</font></div>
<div>The State has also adopted regulations designed to protect the
financial services industry from cyberattacks. Banks, insurance companies and other covered entities regulated by the Department of Financial Services (“DFS”) are, unless eligible for limited exemptions, required to (a) maintain a
cybersecurity program, (b) create written cybersecurity policies and perform risk assessments, (c) designate a CISO with responsibility to oversee the cybersecurity program, (d) annually certify compliance with the cybersecurity regulations, and (e)
report to DFS cybersecurity events that have a reasonable likelihood of materially harming any material part of the entity’s normal operation(s) or for which notice is required to any government body, self-regulatory agency, or supervisory
body.</div> <div>Financial Condition of New York State Localities. <font>The State’s localities rely in part on State aid to balance their budgets and meet their cash requirements. As such, unanticipated financial need among localities can adversely affect the State financial
projections. Certain localities outside New York City, including cities and counties, have experienced financial problems and have requested and received additional State assistance during the last several State fiscal years. In 2013, the Financial
Restructuring Board for Local Governments was created to provide assistance to distressed local governments. The Restructuring Board performs comprehensive reviews and provides grants and loans on the condition of implementing recommended efficiency
initiatives.</font></div> <div>The wide-ranging economic, health,

<div>Bond Market<font>. Successful
implementation of the Financial Plan is dependent on the State’s ability to market bonds. The State finances much of its capital spending, in the first instance, from the General Fund or the Short-Term Investment Pool, which it then reimburses
with proceeds from the sale of bonds. An in ability of the State to sell bonds at the levels or on the timetable it expects could have a material and adverse impact on the State’s financial position and the implementation of its capital plan.
The success of projected public sales will be subject to prevailing market conditions and related ratings issued by national credit rating agencies, among other factors. The outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States significantly disrupted the
municipal bond market. In response, the federal CARES Act created the Municipal Liquidity Facility, which authorizes the Federal Reserve to purchase revenue and bond anticipation notes of states and certain other municipal issuers. The facility was
authorized to purchase up to $500 billion of short-term notes through December 31, 2020. DOB will continue to monitor any further Federal Reserve actions that impact municipal markets. Future developments in the financial markets, including possible
changes in federal tax law relating to the taxation of interest on municipal bonds, as well as future developments concerning the State and public discussion of such developments generally, may affect the market for outstanding State-supported and
State-related debt.</font></div> <div>The major rating agencies,
Fitch, Kroll, Moody’s, and Standard &amp; Poor’s, have assigned the State general credit ratings of AA+, AA+, Aa2, and AA+, respectively. On December 11, 2020, Standard &amp; Poor’s changed the State’s outlook from
“stable” to “negative” due to risks including “potentially weaker economic growth compared to the rest of the country, uncertainty surrounding continuing Federal aid, and contagion risk from financial and economic
stress associated with the MTA and New York City.” On October 1, 2020, Moody’s downgraded the State’s credit rating from Aa1 to Aa2, noting the financial consequences to the State of the disproportionate impact of the coronavirus
pandemic. On April 10, 2020, Fitch changed the State’s credit outlook from “stable” to “negative,” citing “the considerable economic and fiscal uncertainty faced by the state as it confronts the coronavirus
pandemic.”</div> <div>The State, through its public
authorities and general obligation issuances, is one of the largest issuers of municipal bonds in the United States. The State relies on regular bond sales to fund its capital program. In addition, in FY 2021, the State was authorized to sell
short-term notes to meet temporary liquidity needs caused by the pandemic. The Executive Budget proposes continuing this authorization in FY 2022 as the State continues to respond to the pandemic.</div>
<div>Debt Reform Act. <font>The Debt
Reform Act of 2000 “”restricts the issuance of State-supported debt to capital purposes only and for a maximum term of bonds to 30 years. The Debt Reform Act limits the amount of new State-supported debt to 4 percent of State personal
income, and new State-supported debt service costs to 5 percent of receipts. The restrictions apply to all new State-supported debt issued since April 1, 2000. DOB, as administrator of the Debt Reform Act, determined that the State was in compliance
with the statutory caps in the most recent calculation period.</font></div>
<div>State legislation enacted in connection with the adoption of
the FY 2021 Enacted Budget suspended the Debt Reform Act for FY 2021 bond issuances as part of the State response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Executive Budget proposes continuing the suspension for FY 2022 issuances. Accordingly, any
State-supported debt issued in FY 2021 and FY 2022 is not limited to capital purposes and is not counted towards the statutory caps on debt outstanding and debt service. In addition, FY 2022 issuances would not be limited by a maximum maturity,
currently capped at 30 years by the Debt Reform Act. Bonds would still be subject to federal tax law limitations, but this change allows bonds to be issued over the full useful life of the assets being financed, which may be over 30 years in limited
circumstances (i.e., MTA capital projects). The suspension of the Debt Reform Act also includes up to $8 billion of PIT notes and up to $3.0 billion of line of credit facilities that were authorized in FY 2021 and that the Executive Budget proposes
reauthorizing in FY 2022, as well as any short- or long-term refinancing of such borrowings in future years. Current projections anticipate that debt outstanding and debt service will continue to remain below limits imposed by the Debt Reform Act,
due to the suspension of the debt cap during FY 2021 and FY 2022.</div>
<div>Based on the most recent personal income and debt outstanding
forecasts, the available debt capacity under the debt outstanding cap is expected to fluctuate from $12.2 billion in FY 2021 to a low point of $5.8 billion in FY 2026. This calculation excludes all State-supported debt issuances in FY 2021 and FY
2022 but includes the estimated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on personal income calculations and of funding increased capital commitment levels with State bonds after FY 2022. The debt service on State-supported debt issued after April 1, 2000
and subject to the statutory cap is projected at $5.1 billion in FY 2021, or roughly $4.6 billion below the statutory debt service limit.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>The State
uses personal income estimates published by the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis (“BEA”) to calculate the cap on debt outstanding, as required by statute. The BEA revises these estimates on a quarterly basis, and such revisions can be
significant. For federal reporting purposes, BEA reassigns income from the state where it was earned to the state in which a person resides for situations where a person lives and earns income in different states (the “residency
adjustment”). The BEA residency adjustment has the effect of reducing reported New York State personal income because income earned in New York by nonresidents regularly exceeds income earned in other states by New York residents. The State
taxes all personal income earned in New York, regardless of place of residency.</div>
<div>The FY 2022 Executive Budget includes new bond-financed
capital commitments that add $2.7 billion in new debt over the five-year capital plan period. To help MTA, the State also converted its $10.3 billion contribution for the MTA’s 2015-19 and 2020-24 capital plans to bond-financed capital in the
Executive Budget; prior to the pandemic, the State had expected to offset debt service on MTA bonds through additional local aid payments to the MTA.</div>
<div>Changes in the State’s available debt capacity reflect
personal income forecast adjustments, debt amortizations, and bond sale results. The debt capacity reflects the suspension of the Debt Reform Act for FY 2021 and FY 2022 issuances in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as discussed previously. The
State may adjust capital spending priorities and debt financing practices from time to time to preserve available debt capacity and stay within the statutory limits, as events warrant.</div>
<div>Secured Hospital Program<font>.
Under the Secured Hospital Program, the State entered into service contracts to enable certain financially distressed not-for-profit hospitals to have tax-exempt debt issued on their behalf, to pay for upgrading their primary health care facilities.
Revenues pledged to pay debt service on the bonds include hospital payments made under loan agreements between the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York (“DASNY”) and the hospitals, and certain reserve funds held by the applicable
trustees for the bonds. In the event of revenue shortfalls to pay debt service on the Secured Hospital bonds, the service contracts obligate the State to pay debt service, subject to annual appropriations by the Legislature, on bonds issued by DASNY
through the Secured Hospital Program. As of March 31, 2020, there were approximately $135 million of bonds outstanding for this program.</font></div>
<div>Three of the four remaining hospitals in the State’s
Secured Hospital Program are in poor financial condition. In relation to the Secured Hospital Program, the State’s contingent contractual obligation was invoked to pay debt service for the first time in FY 2014. Since then the State has paid
$182 million for debt service costs. DASNY estimates the State will pay debt service costs of approximately $29 million in FY 2022, $22 million in each of FY 2023 and FY 2024, $13 million in FY 2025 and $11 million in FY 2026. These amounts are
based on the actual experience of the participants in the program and would cover debt service costs for one hospital whose debt service obligation was discharged in bankruptcy, a second hospital that closed in 2010, and a third hospital that is
currently delinquent in its payments. The State has estimated additional exposure of up to $6 million annually in FY 2021 and FY 2022 if all hospitals in the program failed to meet the terms of their agreements with DASNY and if available reserve
funds were depleted.</div> <div>The Executive Budget includes
authorization to issue PIT or Sales Tax bonds to refund bonds issued under the Secured Hospital Program. Therefore, the State plans to refund the remaining hospital debt where the State is responsible for the entirety of the debt service payments,
which will provide savings to the State.</div> <div>The U.S. and
Global Economy</div> <div>The International Monetary Fund revised
upward its forecast for 2021 global economic growth and growth in several key economies in its January 2021 outlook, compared to the October 2020 outlook. As COVID-19 infections continue to persist in various nations across the globe, bringing about
new waves of preventive lockdown measures, the timing of the global economy’s return to pre-pandemic normalcy remains uncertain. There is considerable downside risk to the Eurozone’s economic growth in the first half of calendar year
2021 and therefore to global growth and trade.</div> <div>The
second estimate of U.S. real gross domestic product (“GDP”) growth in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2020 was 4.1 percent, after surging a record-breaking 33.4 percent in the third quarter. Real GDP fell a record-breaking 31.4
percent in the second quarter of 2020, as economic activity reached a trough in April 2020, and then began to recover in May and June 2020. The level of real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2020 was 2.4 percent below the peak level reached in the
fourth quarter of 2019. Overall real GDP growth for 2020 fell 3.5 percent, the weakest annual growth rate since 1946.</div>

U.S. economic forecast incorporates the first estimate of 2020 fourth-quarter GDP, the December 2020 personal income and outlays estimates, the December 2020 CPI report, and the initial estimate of January 2021 employment. Real GDP growth is
projected at 4.5 percent for 2021, aided by strong growth in real consumption, investment and exports.</div>
<div>The COVID-19 pandemic’s damaging effects on labor
markets are still mounting and will be a major obstacle to a balanced economic recovery. Real GDP is expected to recover to its previous peak (reached in the fourth quarter of 2019) by the second half of 2021, but employment is not expected to reach
a full recovery until the first quarter of 2023. Employment registered a 5.7 percent decline in 2020, with monthly employment decreases occurring in March, April, and December 2020. The employment recovery is continuing to lose momentum, with the
level of employment still well below the February 2020 peak. The payroll count in January 2021 was approximately 9.9 million below the level of February 2020. Total nonfarm employment growth of 2.7 percent is projected for 2021. Meanwhile, nonfarm
employment growth of 3.2 percent is projected for 2022. The unemployment rate went down to 6.3 percent in January 2021, compared to a peak of 14.8 percent in April 2020. The unemployment rate is projected to edge lower in 2021, reaching an estimated
5.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 5.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022. Growth in wages and salaries for 2021 is estimated to be 6.4 percent, and personal income growth for 2021 is estimated to be 2.4 percent.</div>
<div>The main transmission channel for the unprecedented swings in
real GDP in 2020 was consumer spending. Fluctuations were driven by the COVID-19 pandemic as business restrictions and pandemic fears caused consumers to pull back on spending. As a consequence, consumer spending is expected to dictate the path of
the recovery and in turn will be primarily influenced by the future timing and severity of the pandemic. Additional income support due to a second round of federal fiscal stimulus (as a part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 enacted at
the end of 2020) is likely to keep consumption growth from entering negative territory in the first quarter of 2021. After a 3.9 percent decline in 2020, real consumption is forecast to grow 4.9 percent in 2021 and 3.8 percent in 2022.</div>
<div>Consumer price inflation is expected to reach 2.3 percent in
2021, following 1.2 percent price growth in 2020. Acceleration in inflation is expected due to higher oil prices, a weaker dollar and higher inflation expectations. The outlook for monetary policy is premised on the Federal Reserve’s responses
to the coronavirus pandemic, and the Federal Open Market Committee’s (“FOMC”) formal adoption of a revised framework for monetary policy in August 2020. The FOMC is expected to remain on hold with respect to monetary policy for the
foreseeable future.</div> <div>The residential housing market
evolved into an economic bright spot as the COVID-19 pandemic appears to have increased demand for spacious houses in suburban areas. New and existing home sales have recovered rapidly. Residential building activities were among the first that
resumed in the summer of 2020 after the pandemic lockdowns since social distancing is relatively easy to implement among construction workers. Real residential investment is forecast to surge from a 6.0 percent gain in 2020 to an 11.0 percent growth
rate in 2021, followed by 0.2 percent growth in 2022.</div>
<div>Real nonresidential fixed investment declined 4.0 percent in
2020. DOB projects real nonresidential investment growth for 2021 of 6.5 percent.</div>
<div>Upside risks include an effective containment of COVID-19
through wide distribution and implementation of vaccinations, fast recovery of the worst-affected service sectors, a housing market boom due to remote-work policies, additional fiscal stimulus such as the Biden Administration’s American Rescue
Plan, and better global economic conditions. Downside risks to the forecast include worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic, prolonged business and labor market disruptions, anemic global economic growth, commodity and oil price instability, a stock
market correction, and the elevated federal budget deficit and mounting debt burden.</div>
<div>The New York State Economy</div>
<div>After unprecedented employment declines during March and April
2020, New York State’s steady job recovery came to a halt in December 2020. Employment declined by 37,200 month-over-month due largely to the seasonal surge in confirmed COVID-19 cases. This most recent wave resulted in a tightening of
restrictions on restaurants, bars, and other industries where social distancing remains a challenge. Weak U.S. payroll growth in January 2021 and rising unemployment insurance claims for New York State indicate a fragile labor market. On a positive
note, increases in vaccine availability and restrictions imposed during January 2021 led to noticeable declines in confirmed COVID-19 cases during February 2021. This progress will allow State and local governments to judiciously roll back some of
the restrictions.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>New York State faces many of the same forecasting risks as the
U.S. As the nation‘s financial capital, the volume of financial market activity and volatility in equity markets pose a significant degree of exposure to the New York State economy. The State successfully curbed the number of confirmed
COVID-19 cases from the most recent seasonal wave and made advances in vaccine distribution and availability, but ’a potential COVD-19 resurgence continues to pose a significant downside risk. Furthermore, the threat posed by new variants of
the virus, including vaccine-resistant strains, represents a further risk to the State’s economy. The American Rescue Plan could provide a substantial boost to incomes and provide aid to state and local governments, all of which would
contribute to higher economic growth in the short run.</div>
<div>Supranational Entities Risk.
<font> Certain of the Funds may invest in obligations issued or guaranteed by supranational entities (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, the
World Bank, European Investment Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, and Asia Development Bank), which are often chartered to promote economic development. The government members, or “stockholders,” usually make initial capital
contributions to the supranational entity and, in many cases, are committed to make additional capital contributions if such entity is unable to repay its borrowings. There is no guarantee that one or more stockholders of the supranational entity
will continue to make any necessary additional capital contributions. If such contributions are not made, the entity may be unable to pay interest or repay principal on its debt securities, certain of the Funds may have limited legal recourse in the
event of default, and certain of the Funds may lose money on such investments.</font></div>
<div>Tax Risks Associated with Municipal Securities. <font> As with any investment, you should consider how your investment in shares of each Municipal Bond Fund will be taxed. The tax information in the relevant Prospectus and this SAI is provided as general information.
You should consult your own tax professional about the tax consequences of an investment in shares of each Municipal Bond Fund.</font></div>
<div>Unless your investment in shares is made through a tax-exempt
entity or tax-deferred retirement account, such as an individual retirement account, you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when each Municipal Bond Fund makes distributions or you sell Municipal Bond Fund shares. In general, each
Municipal Bond Fund seeks to produce income that is generally exempt from federal income tax and will not benefit investors in tax deferred retirement accounts such as IRAs or investors not subject to federal income tax. Further, the iShares
California Muni Bond ETF seeks to produce income that is generally exempt from California's income tax, which will not provide any state tax benefit to investors who are not subject to California's state income tax and the iShares New York Muni Bond
ETF seeks to produce income that is generally exempt from New York's income tax, which will not provide any state tax benefit to investors who are not subject to New York's state income tax.</div>
<div>In response to the national economic downturn in recent years,
governmental cost burdens may be reallocated among federal, state and local governments. Also, as a result of the downturn, many state and local governments are experiencing significant reductions in revenues and are consequently experiencing
difficulties meeting ongoing expenses. Certain of these state or local governments may have difficulty paying principal or interest on their outstanding debt and may experience ratings downgrades of their debt.</div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>U.S. Economic
Trading Partners Risk. <font> The U.S. is a significant, and in some cases the most significant, trading partner of, or foreign investor in, the country or countries in which a Fund invests. As a result, economic
conditions of such countries may be particularly affected by changes in the U.S. economy. The U.S. economy has recently experienced very difficult conditions and increased volatility, as well as significant adverse trends. While government
intervention and recent legislation has been enacted to improve the U.S. economy, the recovery has been fragile and modest. A decrease in U.S. imports or exports, new trade and financial regulations or tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar exchange
rate or an economic slowdown in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on a country’s economic conditions and, as a result, securities to which a Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>The U.S. has developed increasingly strained relations with a
number of foreign countries, including traditional allies, such as certain European countries, and historical adversaries, such as North Korea, Iran, China and Russia. If these relations were to worsen, it could adversely affect U.S. issuers as well
as non-U.S. issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. The U.S. has also experienced increased internal unrest and discord. If this trend were to continue, it may have an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and many of the issuers in which a Fund
invests.</div> <div>U.S. Treasury Obligations Risk. <font> Certain of the Funds invest in various types of U.S. Treasury securities. U.S. Treasury obligations may differ from other securities in their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and other characteristics.
Similar to other issuers, changes to the financial condition or credit rating of the U.S. government may cause the value of U.S. Treasury obligations to decline. U.S. Treasury obligations typically offer lower interest rates than other obligations.
Neither the U.S. government nor any of its agencies or instrumentalities guarantees the market value of the securities it issues.</font></div>
<div>The total public debt of the U.S. as a percent of GDP has
grown rapidly since the 2008 financial crisis and is continuing to grow. Although high debt levels do not necessarily indicate or cause economic problems, they may create systemic risks if sound debt management practices are not implemented. A high
national debt level may increase market pressures to meet government funding needs, which may drive debt cost higher and cause a country to sell additional debt, thereby increasing refinancing risk. A high national debt also raises concerns that the
U.S. government will not be able to make principal or interest payments when they are due. In the worst case, unsustainable debt levels can cause a decline in the value of the dollar (which may lead to inflation), and can prevent the U.S. government
from implementing effective counter-cyclical fiscal policy in economic downturns.</div>
<div>On August 5, 2011, S&amp;P Global Ratings downgraded U.S.
Treasury securities from an AAA rating to AA+. A further downgrade of the ratings of U.S. government debt obligations, which are often used as a benchmark for other borrowing arrangements, could result in higher interest rates for individual and
corporate borrowers, cause disruptions in the international bond markets and generally have a substantial negative effect on the U.S. economy. A downgrade of U.S. Treasury securities from another ratings agency or a further downgrade beyond AA+
rating by S&amp;P Global Ratings may cause the value of a Fund's U.S. Treasury obligations to decline.</div>
<div>Valuation Risk. <font> In
certain circumstances, a Fund’s securities may be valued using techniques other than market quotations. The value established for a security may be different from what would be produced through the use of another methodology or if the value
had been priced using market quotations. Securities that are valued using methods other than market quotations, including “fair valued” securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation in their value from one day to the next than would
be the case if market quotations were used. In addition, there is no assurance that a Fund could sell a security for the value established for it at any time, and it is possible that a Fund could incur a loss if a security is sold for less than its
established value.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in Africa.<font>  Investments in securities of issuers in certain African countries involve heightened risks including, among others, expropriation and/or nationalization of assets, confiscatory taxation, political instability,
including authoritarian and/or military involvement in governmental decision-making, armed conflict, civil war, and social instability as a result of religious, ethnic and/or socio-economic unrest or widespread outbreaks of disease and, in certain
countries, genocidal warfare.</font></div> <div>Certain countries
in Africa generally have less developed capital markets than traditional emerging market countries, and, consequently, the risks of investing in foreign securities are magnified in such countries. Because securities markets of countries in Africa
are generally underdeveloped and are generally less correlated to global economic cycles than those markets located in more developed countries, securities markets in African countries are subject to greater risks associated with market volatility,
lower market capitalization, lower trading volume, illiquidity, inflation, greater price fluctuations and uncertainty regarding the existence of trading markets. Moreover, trading on African securities markets may be suspended altogether.</div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Market
volatility may also be heightened by the actions of a small number of investors. Brokerage firms in certain countries in Africa may be fewer in number and less established than brokerage firms in more developed markets. Since a Fund may need to
effect securities transactions through these brokerage firms, the Fund is subject to the risk that these brokerage firms will not be able to fulfill their obligations to the Fund (<font>i.e., </font>counterparty risk).
This risk is magnified to the extent that a Fund effects securities transactions through a single brokerage firm or a small number of brokerage firms.</div>
<div>Certain governments in African countries restrict or control
to varying degrees the ability of foreign investors to invest in securities of issuers located or operating in those countries. Moreover, certain countries in Africa require governmental approval or special licenses prior to investment by foreign
investors and may limit the amount of investment by foreign investors in a particular industry and/or issuer, and may limit such foreign investment to a certain class of securities of an issuer that may have less advantageous rights than the classes
available for purchase by domestic investors of the countries and/or impose additional taxes on foreign investors. A delay in obtaining a government approval or a license would delay investments in a particular country, and, as a result, a Fund may
not be able to invest in certain securities while approval is pending. The government of a particular country may also withdraw or decline to renew a license that enables a Fund to invest in such country. These factors make investing in issuers
located or operating in countries in Africa significantly riskier than investing in issuers located or operating in more developed countries, and any one of these factors could cause a decline in the value of a Fund's investments. Issuers located or
operating in countries in Africa are generally not subject to the same rules and regulations as issuers located or operating in more developed countries. Therefore, there may be less financial and other information publicly available with regard to
issuers located or operating in countries in Africa and such issuers are generally not subject to the uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards applicable to issuers located or operating in more developed countries.</div>
<div>In addition, governments of certain countries in Africa in
which a Fund may invest may levy withholding or other taxes on income such as dividends, interest and realized capital gains. Although in certain countries in Africa a portion of these taxes are recoverable, the non-recovered portion of foreign
withholding taxes will reduce the income received from investments in such countries.</div>
<div>Investment in countries in Africa may be subject to a greater
degree of risk associated with governmental approval in connection with the repatriation of investment income, capital or the proceeds of sales of securities by foreign investors. In addition, there is the risk that if an African country’s
balance of payments declines, such African country may impose temporary restrictions on foreign capital remittances. Consequently, a Fund could be adversely affected by delays in, or a refusal to grant, required governmental approval for
repatriation of capital, as well as by the application to the Fund of any restrictions on investments. Additionally, investments in countries in Africa may require a Fund to adopt special procedures, seek local government approvals or take other
actions, each of which may involve additional costs to a Fund.</div>
<div>Securities laws in many countries in Africa are relatively new
and unsettled and, consequently, there is a risk of rapid and unpredictable change in laws regarding foreign investment, securities regulation, title to securities and shareholder rights. Accordingly, foreign investors may be adversely affected by
new or amended laws and regulations. In addition, there may be no single centralized securities exchange on which securities are traded in certain countries in Africa and the systems of corporate governance to which issuers located in countries in
Africa are subject may be less advanced than those systems to which issuers located in more developed countries are subject, and, therefore, shareholders of issuers located in such countries may not receive many of the protections available to
shareholders of issuers located in more developed countries. Even in circumstances where adequate laws and shareholder rights exist, it may not be possible to obtain swift and equitable enforcement of the law. In addition, the enforcement of systems
of taxation at federal, regional and local levels in countries in Africa may be inconsistent and subject to sudden change.</div>
<div>Certain countries in Africa may be heavily dependent upon
international trade and, consequently, have been and may continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values and other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries
with which they trade. These countries also have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade. Certain countries in Africa depend to a significant extent upon exports of primary
commodities such as gold, silver, copper and diamonds. These countries therefore are vulnerable to changes in commodity prices, which may be affected by a variety of factors. In addition, certain issuers located in countries in Africa in which a
Fund invests may operate in, or have dealings with, countries subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations, and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. As a
result, an issuer may sustain damage to its reputation if it is</div> </div> <div type="Block">

which operates in, or has dealings with, such countries. A Fund, as an investor in such issuers, will be indirectly subject to those risks.</div>
<div>The governments of certain countries in Africa may exercise
substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic conditions in such countries, which could have a negative impact on
private sector companies. There is also the possibility of diplomatic developments that could adversely affect investments in certain countries in Africa. Some countries in Africa may be affected by a greater degree of public corruption and crime,
including organized crime.</div> <div>Recent political instability
and protests in North Africa and the Middle East have caused significant disruptions to many industries. In addition, the outbreak of Ebola in Western Africa severely challenged health care industries in those countries and adversely impacted the
region’s economy due to quarantines and disruptions of trade, which has further increased instability in the region. This instability has demonstrated that political and social unrest can spread quickly through the region, and that
developments in one country can influence the political events in neighboring countries. Some protests have turned violent, and civil war and political reconstruction in certain countries such as Libya, Iraq and Syria pose a risk to investments in
the region. Continued political and social unrest in these regions, including the ongoing warfare and terrorist activities in the Middle East and Africa, may negatively affect the value of an investment in a Fund.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Asia.<font>
  Investments in securities of issuers in certain Asian countries involve risks not typically associated with investments in securities of issuers in other regions. Such heightened risks include, among others, expropriation and/or
nationalization of assets, confiscatory taxation, piracy of intellectual property, data and other security breaches (especially of data stored electronically), political instability, including authoritarian and/or military involvement in
governmental decision-making, armed conflict and social instability as a result of religious, ethnic and/or socio-economic unrest. Certain Asian economies have experienced rapid rates of economic growth and industrialization in recent years, and
there is no assurance that these rates of economic growth and industrialization will be maintained.</font></div>
<div>Certain Asian countries have democracies with relatively short
histories, which may increase the risk of political instability. These countries have faced political and military unrest, and further unrest could present a risk to their local economies and securities markets. Indonesia and the Philippines have
each experienced violence and terrorism, which has negatively impacted their economies. North Korea and South Korea each have substantial military capabilities, and historical tensions between the two countries present the risk of war. Escalated
tensions involving the two countries and any outbreak of hostilities between the two countries, or even the threat of an outbreak of hostilities, could have a severe adverse effect on the entire Asian region. Certain Asian countries have also
developed increasingly strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect Asian issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. Political, religious, and border disputes persist in India. India has
recently experienced and may continue to experience civil unrest and hostilities with certain of its neighboring countries. Increased political and social unrest in these geographic areas could adversely affect the performance of investments in this
region.</div> <div>Certain governments in this region administer
prices on several basic goods, including fuel and electricity, within their respective countries. Certain governments may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector in their respective countries and may own or control
many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic conditions in this region, which in turn could have a negative impact on private sector companies. There is also the possibility of diplomatic developments
adversely affecting investments in the region.</div>
<div>Corruption and the perceived lack of a rule of law in dealings
with international companies in certain Asian countries may discourage foreign investment and could negatively impact the long-term growth of certain economies in this region. In addition, certain countries in the region are experiencing high
unemployment and corruption, and have fragile banking sectors.</div>
<div>Some economies in this region are dependent on a range of
commodities, including oil, natural gas and coal. Accordingly, they are strongly affected by international commodity prices and particularly vulnerable to any weakening in global demand for these products. The market for securities in this region
may also be directly influenced by the flow of international capital, and by the economic and market conditions of neighboring countries. China is a key trading partner of many Asian countries and any changes in trading relationships between China
and other Asian countries may affect the region as a whole. Adverse economic conditions or developments in neighboring countries may increase investors' perception of the risk of investing in the region as a whole, which may adversely impact the
market value of the securities issued by companies in the region.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Risk of
Investing in Australasia. <font> The economies of Australasia, which include Australia and New Zealand, are dependent on exports from the agricultural and mining sectors. This makes Australasian economies susceptible
to fluctuations in the commodity markets. Australasian economies are also increasingly dependent on their growing service industries. Australia and New Zealand are located in a part of the world that has historically been prone to natural disasters,
such as drought and flooding. Any such event in the future could have a significant adverse impact on the economies of Australia and New Zealand and affect the value of securities held by a relevant Fund. The economies of Australia and New Zealand
are dependent on trading with certain key trading partners, including Asia and the U.S. Economic events in the U.S., Asia, or in other key trading countries can have a significant economic effect on the Australian economy. The economies of Australia
and New Zealand are heavily dependent on the mining sector. Passage of new regulations limiting foreign ownership of companies in the mining sector or imposition of new taxes on profits of mining companies may dissuade foreign investment, and as a
result, have a negative impact on companies to which a Fund has exposure.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Central and South America. <font> The economies of certain Central and South American countries have experienced high interest rates, economic volatility, inflation, currency devaluations, government defaults, high unemployment rates and political
instability which can adversely affect issuers in these countries. In addition, commodities (such as oil, gas and minerals) represent a significant percentage of the region's exports and many economies in this region are particularly sensitive to
fluctuations in commodity prices. Adverse economic events in one country may have a significant adverse effect on other countries of this region.</font></div>
<div>The governments of certain countries in Central and South
America may exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic conditions in such countries, which could have a
negative impact on the securities in which the Fund invests. Diplomatic developments may also adversely affect investments in certain countries in Central and South America. Some countries in Central and South America may be affected by public
corruption and crime, including organized crime.</div> <div>Certain
countries in Central and South America may be heavily dependent upon international trade and, consequently, have been and may continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values
and other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade. These countries also have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade. In addition,
certain issuers located in countries in Central and South America in which the Fund invests may be the subject of sanctions (for example, the U.S. has imposed sanctions on certain Venezuelan individuals, corporate entities and the Venezuelan
government) or have dealings with countries subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. An issuer may sustain damage
to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer that has dealings with such countries. The Fund may be adversely affected if it invests in such issuers.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Developed Countries. <font> Many countries with developed markets have recently experienced significant economic pressures. These countries generally tend to rely on the services sectors (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, the financial services sector) as the primary source of economic growth and may be susceptible to the risks of individual service sectors. For example,
companies in the financial services sector are subject to governmental regulation and, recently, government intervention, which may adversely affect the scope of their activities, the prices they can charge and amount of capital they must maintain.
Recent dislocations in the financial sector and perceived or actual governmental influence over certain financial companies may lead to credit rating downgrades and, as a result, impact, among other things, revenue growth for such companies. If
financial companies experience a prolonged decline in revenue growth, certain developed countries that rely heavily on financial companies as an economic driver may experience a correlative slowdown. Recently, new concerns have emerged with respect
to the economic health of certain developed countries. These concerns primarily stem from heavy indebtedness of many developed countries and their perceived inability to continue to service high debt loads without simultaneously implementing
stringent austerity measures. Such concerns have led to tremendous downward pressure on the economies of these countries. As a result, it is possible that interest rates on debt of certain developed countries may rise to levels that make it
difficult for such countries to service such debt. Spending on health care and retirement pensions in most developed countries has risen dramatically over the last few years. Medical innovation, extended life expectancy and higher public
expectations are likely to continue the increase in health care and pension costs. Any increase in health care and pension costs will likely have a negative impact on the economic growth of many developed countries. Certain developed countries rely
on imports of certain key items, such as crude oil, natural gas, and other commodities. As a result, an increase in demand for, or price fluctuations of, certain commodities may negatively affect developed country economies. Developed market
countries generally are dependent on the economies of certain key trading partners. Changes in any one economy may cause</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

several developed countries. In addition, heavy regulation of, among others, labor and product markets may have an adverse effect on certain issuers. Such regulations may negatively affect economic growth or cause prolonged periods of recession.
Such risks, among others, may adversely affect the value of a Fund’s investments.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Emerging Markets. <font> Certain of the Funds may invest in securities of issuers domiciled in emerging market countries.  Investments in emerging market countries may be subject to greater risks than investments in developed
countries. These risks include: (i) less social, political, and economic stability; (ii) greater illiquidity and price volatility due to smaller or limited local capital markets for such securities, or low or non-existent trading volumes; (iii)
companies, custodians, clearinghouses, foreign exchanges and broker-dealers may be subject to less scrutiny and regulation by local authorities; (iv) local governments may decide to seize or confiscate securities held by foreign investors and/or
local governments may decide to suspend or limit an issuer's ability to make dividend or interest payments; (v) local governments may limit or entirely restrict repatriation of invested capital, profits, and dividends; (vi) capital gains may be
subject to local taxation, including on a retroactive basis; (vii) issuers facing restrictions on dollar or euro payments imposed by local governments may attempt to make dividend or interest payments to foreign investors in the local currency;
(viii) there may be significant obstacles to obtaining information necessary for investigations into or litigation against companies and investors may experience difficulty in enforcing legal claims related to the securities and/or local judges may
favor the interests of the issuer over those of foreign parties; (ix) bankruptcy judgments may only be permitted to be paid in the local currency; (x) limited public information regarding the issuer may result in greater difficulty in determining
market valuations of the securities; and (xi) lack of financial reporting on a regular basis, substandard disclosure and differences in accounting standards may make it difficult to ascertain the financial health of an issuer. The Funds are not
actively managed and do not select investments based on investor protection considerations.</font></div>
<div>Emerging market securities markets are typically marked by a
high concentration of market capitalization and trading volume in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries, as well as a high concentration of ownership of such securities by a limited number of investors. In addition,
brokerage and other costs associated with transactions in emerging market securities can be higher, sometimes significantly, than similar costs incurred in securities markets in developed countries. Although some emerging markets have become more
established and tend to issue securities of higher credit quality, the markets for securities in other emerging market countries are in the earliest stages of their development, and these countries issue securities across the credit spectrum. Even
the markets for relatively widely traded securities in emerging market countries may not be able to absorb, without price disruptions, a significant increase in trading volume or trades of a size customarily undertaken by institutional investors in
the securities markets of developed countries. The limited size of many of these securities markets can cause prices to be erratic for reasons apart from factors that affect the soundness and competitiveness of the securities issuers. For example,
prices may be unduly influenced by traders who control large positions in these markets. Additionally, market making and arbitrage activities are generally less extensive in such markets, which may contribute to increased volatility and reduced
liquidity of such markets. The limited liquidity of emerging market country securities may also affect a Fund's ability to accurately value its portfolio securities or to acquire or dispose of securities at the price and time it wishes to do so or
in order to meet redemption requests.</div> <div>Many emerging
market countries suffer from uncertainty and corruption in their legal frameworks. Legislation may be difficult to interpret and laws may be too new to provide any precedential value. Laws regarding foreign investment and private property may be
weak or non-existent. Sudden changes in governments may result in policies which are less favorable to investors such as policies designed to expropriate or nationalize “sovereign” assets. Certain emerging market countries in the past
have expropriated large amounts of private property, in many cases with little or no compensation, and there can be no assurance that such expropriation will not occur in the future.</div>
<div>Investment in the securities markets of certain emerging
market countries is restricted or controlled to varying degrees. These restrictions may limit a Fund's investment in certain emerging market countries and may increase the expenses of the Fund. Certain emerging market countries require governmental
approval prior to investments by foreign persons or limit investment by foreign persons to only a specified percentage of an issuer's outstanding securities or a specific class of securities which may have less advantageous terms (including price)
than securities of the company available for purchase by nationals.</div>
<div>Many emerging market countries lack the social, political, and
economic stability characteristic of the U.S. Political instability among emerging market countries can be common and may be caused by an uneven distribution of wealth, social unrest, labor strikes, civil wars, and religious oppression. Economic
instability in emerging market countries may take the form of: (i) high interest rates; (ii) high levels of inflation, including hyperinflation; (iii) high levels of unemployment or</div> </div> <div type="Block">

changes in government economic and tax policies, including confiscatory taxation; and (v) imposition of trade barriers.</div>
<div>A Fund's income and, in some cases, capital gains from foreign
securities will be subject to applicable taxation in certain of the emerging market countries in which it invests, and treaties between the U.S. and such countries may not be available in some cases to reduce the otherwise applicable tax
rates.</div> <div>Emerging markets also have different clearance
and settlement procedures, and in certain of these emerging markets there have been times when settlements have been unable to keep pace with the volume of securities transactions, making it difficult to conduct such transactions.</div>
<div>In the past, certain governments in emerging market countries
have become overly reliant on the international capital markets and other forms of foreign credit to finance large public spending programs, which in the past have caused huge budget deficits. Often, interest payments have become too overwhelming
for a government to meet, representing a large percentage of total GDP. These foreign obligations have become the subject of political debate and served as fuel for political parties of the opposition, which pressure the government not to make
payments to foreign creditors, but instead to use these funds for, among other things, social programs. Either due to an inability to pay or submission to political pressure, foreign governments have been forced to seek a restructuring of their loan
and/or bond obligations, have declared a temporary suspension of interest payments or have defaulted. These events have adversely affected the values of securities issued by foreign governments and corporations domiciled in those countries and have
negatively affected not only their cost of borrowing, but their ability to borrow in the future as well.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Europe.
<font> Investing in European countries may expose a Fund to the economic and political risks associated with Europe in general and the specific European countries in which it invests. The economies and markets of
European countries are often closely connected and interdependent, and events in one European country can have an adverse impact on other European countries. A Fund makes investments in securities of issuers that are domiciled in, have significant
operations in, or that are listed on at least one securities exchange within member states of the EU. A number of countries within the EU are also members of the EMU (the “eurozone”) and have adopted the euro as their currency. Eurozone
membership requires member states to comply with restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, interest rates, debt levels and fiscal and monetary controls, each of which may significantly affect every country in Europe. Changes in import or export
tariffs, changes in governmental or EU regulations on trade, changes in the exchange rate of the euro and other currencies of certain EU countries which are not in the eurozone, the default or threat of default by an EU member state on its sovereign
debt, and/or an economic recession in an EU member state may have a significant adverse effect on the economies of other EU member states and their trading partners. Although certain European countries are not in the eurozone, many of these
countries are obliged to meet the criteria for joining the eurozone. Consequently, these countries must comply with many of the restrictions noted above. The European financial markets have experienced volatility and adverse trends due to concerns
about economic downturns, rising government debt levels and the possible default of government debt in several European countries, including, but not limited to, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ukraine.
In order to prevent further economic deterioration, certain countries, without prior warning, can institute “capital controls.” Countries may use these controls to restrict volatile movements of capital entering and exiting their
country. Such controls may negatively affect a Fund’s investments. A default or debt restructuring by any European country would adversely impact holders of that country’s debt and sellers of credit default swaps linked to that
country’s creditworthiness, which may be located in countries other than those listed above. In addition, the credit ratings of certain European countries were downgraded in the past. These events have adversely affected the value and exchange
rate of the euro and may continue to significantly affect the economies of every country in Europe, including countries that do not use the euro and non-EU member states. Responses to the financial problems by European governments, central banks and
others, including austerity measures and reforms, may not produce the desired results, may result in social unrest and may limit future growth and economic recovery or have other unintended consequences. Further defaults or restructurings by
governments and other entities of their debt could have additional adverse effects on economies, financial markets and asset valuations around the world. In addition, one or more countries may abandon the euro and/or withdraw from the EU. The impact
of these actions, especially if they occur in a disorderly fashion, is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely impact the value of a Fund’s investments in the region. The United Kingdom (the “U.K.”)
left the EU (“Brexit”) on January 31, 2020. The U.K. and EU have reached an agreement on the terms of their future trading relationship effective January 1, 2021, which principally relates to the trading of goods rather than services,
including financial services. Further discussions are to be held between the U.K. and the EU in relation to matters not covered by the trade agreement, such as financial services. A Fund will face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and
consequences that may follow</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Brexit, including with
respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory
agencies and financial markets. Brexit has also led to legal uncertainty and could lead to politically divergent national laws and regulations as a new relationship between the U.K. and EU is defined and the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace
or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit could adversely affect any of the companies to which a Fund has exposure and any other assets in which a Fund invests. The political, economic and legal consequences of Brexit are not yet fully known. In
the short term, financial markets may experience heightened volatility, particularly those in the U.K. and Europe, but possibly worldwide. The U.K. and Europe may be less stable than they have been in recent years, and investments in the U.K. and
the EU may be difficult to value, or subject to greater or more frequent volatility. In the longer term, there is likely to be a period of significant political, regulatory and commercial uncertainty as the U.K. continues to negotiate its long-term
exit from the EU and the terms of its future trading relationships.</div>
<div>Certain European countries have also developed increasingly
strained relationships with the U.S., and if these relations were to worsen, they could adversely affect European issuers that rely on the U.S. for trade. Secessionist movements, such as the Catalan movement in Spain and the independence movement in
Scotland, as well as governmental or other responses to such movements, may also create instability and uncertainty in the region. In addition, the national politics of countries in the EU have been unpredictable and subject to influence by
disruptive political groups and ideologies. The governments of EU countries may be subject to change and such countries may experience social and political unrest. Unanticipated or sudden political or social developments may result in sudden and
significant investment losses. The occurrence of terrorist incidents throughout Europe also could impact financial markets. The impact of these events is not clear but could be significant and far-reaching and could adversely affect the value
and liquidity of a Fund's investments.</div> <div>Risk of Investing
in the Middle East. <font> Many Middle Eastern countries have little or no democratic tradition, and the political and legal systems in such countries may have an adverse impact on a Fund. Many economies in the
Middle East are highly reliant on income from the sale of oil and natural gas or trade with countries involved in the sale of oil and natural gas, and their economies are therefore vulnerable to changes in the market for oil and natural gas and
foreign currency values. As global demand for oil and natural gas fluctuates, many Middle Eastern economies may be significantly impacted.</font></div>
<div>In addition, many Middle Eastern governments have exercised
and continue to exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector. In certain cases, a Middle Eastern country’s government may own or control many companies, including some of the largest companies in the country.
Accordingly, governmental actions in the future could have a significant effect on economic conditions in Middle Eastern countries. This could affect private sector companies and a Fund, as well as the value of securities in a Fund's
portfolio.</div> <div>Certain Middle Eastern markets are in the
earliest stages of development. As a result, there may be a high concentration of market capitalization and trading volume in a small number of issuers representing a limited number of industries, as well as a high concentration of investors and
financial intermediaries. Brokers in Middle Eastern countries typically are fewer in number and less capitalized than brokers in the U.S.</div>
<div>The legal systems in certain Middle Eastern countries also may
have an adverse impact on a Fund. For example, the potential liability of a shareholder in a U.S. corporation with respect to acts of the corporation generally is limited to the amount of the shareholder’s investment. However, the notion of
limited liability is less clear in certain Middle Eastern countries. A Fund therefore may be liable in certain Middle Eastern countries for the acts of a corporation in which it invests for an amount greater than its actual investment in that
corporation. Similarly, the rights of investors in Middle Eastern issuers may be more limited than those of shareholders of a U.S. corporation. It may be difficult or impossible to obtain or enforce a legal judgment in a Middle Eastern country. Some
Middle Eastern countries prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on investments in their capital markets, particularly their equity markets, by foreign entities such as a Fund. For example, certain countries may require governmental approval
prior to investment by foreign persons or limit the amount of investment by foreign persons in a particular issuer. Certain Middle Eastern countries may also limit investment by foreign persons to only a specific class of securities of an issuer
that may have less advantageous terms (including price) than securities of the issuer available for purchase by nationals of the relevant Middle Eastern country.</div>
<div>The manner in which foreign investors may invest in companies
in certain Middle Eastern countries, as well as limitations on those investments, may have an adverse impact on the operations of a Fund. For example, in certain of these countries, a Fund may be required to invest initially through a local broker
or other entity and then have the shares that were purchased re-registered in the name of a Fund. Re-registration in some instances may not be possible on a timely basis. This may result</div> </div>

Fund may be denied certain of its rights as an investor, including rights as to dividends or to be made aware of certain corporate actions. There also may be instances where a Fund places a purchase order but is subsequently informed, at the time of
re-registration, that the permissible allocation of the investment to foreign investors has already been filled and, consequently, a Fund may not be able to invest in the relevant company.</div>
<div>Substantial limitations may exist in certain Middle Eastern
countries with respect to a Fund’s ability to repatriate investment income or capital gains. A Fund could be adversely affected by delays in, or a refusal to grant, any required governmental approval for repatriation of capital, as well as by
the application to a Fund of any restrictions on investment.</div>
<div>Certain Middle Eastern countries may be heavily dependent upon
international trade and, consequently, have been and may continue to be negatively affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values and other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries
with which they trade. These countries also have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade. In addition, certain issuers located in Middle Eastern countries in which a Fund invests
may operate in, or have dealings with, countries subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations, and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer
may sustain damage to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer which operates in, or has dealings with, such countries. A Fund, as an investor in such issuers, will be indirectly subject to those risks.</div>
<div>Certain Middle Eastern countries have strained relations with
other Middle Eastern countries due to territorial disputes, historical animosities, international alliances, defense concerns or other reasons, which may adversely affect the economies of these Middle Eastern countries. Certain Middle Eastern
countries experience significant unemployment, as well as widespread underemployment. There has also been a recent increase in recruitment efforts and an aggressive push for territorial control by terrorist groups in the region, which has led to an
outbreak of warfare and hostilities. Warfare in Syria has spread to surrounding areas, including many portions of Iraq and Turkey. Such hostilities may continue into the future or may escalate at any time due to ethnic, racial, political, religious
or ideological tensions between groups in the region or foreign intervention or lack of intervention, among other factors.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in North America. <font> A decrease in imports or exports, changes in trade regulations or an economic recession in any North American country can have a significant economic effect on the entire North American region and on some or all of
the North American countries in which a Fund invests.</font></div>
<div>The U.S. is Canada's and Mexico's largest trading and
investment partner. The Canadian and Mexican economies are significantly affected by developments in the U.S. economy. Since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) in 1994 among Canada, the U.S. and
Mexico, total merchandise trade among the three countries has increased. However, political developments including the implementation of tariffs by the U.S., and the renegotiation of NAFTA in the form of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement
(“USMCA”), which replaced NAFTA on July 1, 2020, could negatively affect North America’s economic outlook and, as a result, the value of securities held by a Fund. Policy and legislative changes in one country may have a
significant effect on North American markets generally, as well as on the value of certain securities held by a Fund.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Russia.
<font> Investing in the Russian securities market involves a high degree of risk and special considerations not typically associated with investing in the U.S. securities market, and should be considered highly
speculative. Risks include: the absence of developed legal structures governing private and foreign investments and private property; the possibility of the loss of all or a substantial portion of a Fund’s assets invested in Russia as a result
of expropriation; certain national policies which may restrict the Fund’s investment opportunities, including, without limitation, restrictions on investing in issuers or industries deemed sensitive to relevant national interests; and
potentially greater price volatility in, significantly smaller capitalization of, and relative illiquidity of, the Russian market. There can also be no assurance that a Fund’s investments in the Russian securities market would not be
expropriated, nationalized or otherwise confiscated. In the event of the settlement of any such claims or such expropriation, nationalization or other confiscation, a Fund could lose its entire investment. In addition, it may be difficult and more
costly to obtain and enforce a judgment in the Russian court system.</font></div>
<div>Russia may also be subject to a greater degree of economic,
political and social instability than is the case in other developed countries. Such instability may result from, among other things, the following: (i) an authoritarian government or military involvement in political and economic decision-making,
including changes in government through extra-constitutional</div> </div> <div type="Block">

associated with demands for improved political, economic and social conditions; (iii) internal insurgencies; (iv) hostile relations with neighboring countries; and (v) ethnic, religious and racial disaffection.</div>
<div>The Russian economy is heavily dependent upon the export of a
range of commodities including most industrial metals, forestry products and oil and gas. Accordingly, it is strongly affected by international commodity prices and is particularly vulnerable to any weakening in global demand for these products. Any
acts of terrorism or armed conflicts in Russia or internationally could have an adverse effect on the financial and commodities markets and the global economy. As Russia produces and exports large amounts of crude oil and gas, any acts of terrorism
or armed conflict causing disruptions of Russian oil and gas exports could negatively affect the Russian economy and, thus, adversely affect the financial condition, results of operations or prospects of related companies. Current and future
economic sanctions may also adversely affect the Russian oil, banking, mining, metals, rail, pipeline and gas sectors, among other sectors.</div>
<div>The Russian government may exercise substantial influence over
many aspects of the private sector and may own or control many companies. Future government actions could have a significant effect on the economic conditions in Russia, which could have a negative impact on private sector companies. There is also
the possibility of diplomatic developments that could adversely affect investments in Russia. In recent years, the Russian government has begun to take bolder steps to re-assert its regional geopolitical influence (including military steps).
Additionally, Russia is alleged to have participated in state-sponsored cyberattacks against foreign companies and foreign governments. Such steps may increase tensions between Russia and its neighbors and Western countries and may negatively affect
economic growth. Actual and threatened responses by other nation-states to Russia’s alleged cyber activity may have an adverse impact on the Russian economy and the Russian issuers of securities in which a Fund invests. For example, the U.S.
has added certain foreign technology companies to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security’s “Entity List,” which is a list of companies believed to pose a national security risk to the U.S. Actions
like these may have unanticipated and disruptive effects on the Russian economy. </div>
<div>Russia Sanctions. <font>The U.S.
and the Economic and Monetary Union (the “EMU”) of the European Union (the “EU”), along with the regulatory bodies of a number of countries including Japan, Australia, Norway, Switzerland and Canada (collectively,
“Sanctioning Bodies”), have imposed economic sanctions, which consist of prohibiting certain securities trades, prohibiting certain private transactions in the energy sector, asset freezes and prohibition of all business, against certain
Russian individuals and Russian corporate entities. The Sanctioning Bodies could also institute broader sanctions on Russia. These sanctions, or even the threat of further sanctions, may result in the decline of the value and liquidity of Russian
securities, a weakening of the ruble or other adverse consequences to the Russian economy. These sanctions could also result in the immediate freeze of Russian securities and/or funds invested in prohibited assets, impairing the ability of a Fund to
buy, sell, receive or deliver those securities and/or assets. Additional sanctions against Russia have been, and may in the future be, imposed by the U.S. or other countries. </font></div>
<div>The sanctions against certain Russian issuers include
prohibitions on transacting in or dealing in issuances of debt or equity of such issuers. Compliance with each of these sanctions may impair the ability of a Fund to buy, sell, hold, receive or deliver the affected securities or other securities of
such issuers. If it becomes impracticable or unlawful for a Fund to hold securities subject to, or otherwise affected by, sanctions (collectively, “affected securities”), or if deemed appropriate by BFA, a Fund may prohibit in-kind
deposits of the affected securities in connection with creation transactions and instead require a cash deposit, which may also increase a Fund's transaction costs. A Fund may also be legally required to freeze assets in a blocked account.</div>
<div>Also, if an affected security is included in a Fund's
Underlying Index, a Fund may, where practicable, seek to eliminate its holdings of the affected security by employing or augmenting its representative sampling strategy to seek to track the investment results of its Underlying Index. The use of (or
increased use of) a representative sampling strategy may increase a Fund’s tracking error risk. If the affected securities constitute a significant percentage of the Underlying Index, a Fund may not be able to effectively implement a
representative sampling strategy, which may result in significant tracking error between a Fund’s performance and the performance of its Underlying Index.</div>
<div>Current or future sanctions may result in Russia taking
counter measures or retaliatory actions, which may further impair the value and liquidity of Russian securities. These retaliatory measures may include the immediate freeze of Russian assets held by a Fund. In the event of such a freeze of any Fund
assets, including depositary receipts, a Fund may need to liquidate non-restricted assets in order to satisfy any Fund redemption orders. The liquidation of Fund assets during this time may also result in a Fund receiving substantially lower prices
for its securities.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

These sanctions may also lead to changes in a Fund’s Underlying Index. A Fund’s index provider may remove securities from its Underlying Index or implement caps on the securities of certain issuers that have been subject to recent
economic sanctions. In such an event, it is expected that a Fund will rebalance its portfolio to bring it in line with its Underlying Index as a result of any such changes, which may result in transaction costs and increased tracking error. These
sanctions, the volatility that may result in the trading markets for Russian securities and the possibility that Russia may impose investment or currency controls on investors may cause a Fund to invest in, or increase a Fund’s investments in,
depositary receipts that represent the securities of its Underlying Index. These investments may result in increased transaction costs and increased tracking error.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in Saudi Arabia. <font>  The ability of foreign investors (such as the Funds) to invest in the securities of Saudi Arabian issuers is relatively new. Such ability could be restricted by the Saudi Arabian government at any time, and
unforeseen risks could materialize with respect to foreign ownership in such securities. In addition, the Capital Market Authority (“CMA”) places investment limitations on the ownership of the securities of Saudi Arabian issuers by
foreign investors, including a limitation on a Fund’s ownership of the securities of any single issuer listed on the Saudi Arabian Stock Exchange, which may prevent a Fund from investing in accordance with its strategy and contribute to
tracking error against the Underlying Index. These restrictions may be changed or new restrictions, such as licensing requirements, special approvals or additional foreign taxes, may be instituted at any time. A Fund may not be able to obtain or
maintain any such licenses or approvals and may not be able to buy and sell securities at full value. Major disruptions or regulatory changes could occur in the Saudi Arabian market, any of which could negatively impact a Fund. These risks may be
exacerbated, compared to more developed markets, given the limited history of foreign investment in the Saudi Arabian market. Investments in Saudi Arabia may also be subject to loss due to expropriation or nationalization of assets and property or
the imposition of restrictions on additional foreign investments and repatriation of capital. Such heightened risks may include, among others, restrictions on and government intervention in international trade, confiscatory taxation, political
instability, including authoritarian and/or military involvement in governmental decision making, armed conflict, crime and instability as a result of religious, ethnic and/or socioeconomic unrest. Saudi Arabia has privatized, or has begun the
process of privatizing, certain entities and industries. Newly privatized companies may face strong competition from government-sponsored competitors that have not been privatized. In some instances, investors in newly privatized entities have
suffered losses due to the inability of the newly privatized entities to adjust quickly to a competitive environment or changing regulatory and legal standards or, in some cases, due to re-nationalization of such privatized entities. There is no
assurance that similar losses will not recur. Saudi Arabia is highly reliant on income from the sale of petroleum and trade with other countries involved in the sale of petroleum, and its economy is therefore vulnerable to changes in foreign
currency values and the market for petroleum, as well as acts targeting petroleum production or processing facilities in Saudi Arabia. As global demand for petroleum fluctuates, Saudi Arabia may be significantly impacted. In the recent past, the
Saudi Arabian government has explored privatization and diversification of the economy in the wake of a diminished petroleum market.</font></div>
<div>Like most Middle Eastern governments, the government of Saudi
Arabia exercises substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector. Although liberalization in the wider economy is underway, in many areas it has lagged significantly: restrictions on foreign ownership persist, and the government has an
ownership stake in many key industries. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that Saudi Arabia is governed by an absolute monarchy. Saudi Arabia has historically experienced strained relations with economic partners worldwide, including other
countries in the Middle East, due to geopolitical events. Incidents involving a Middle Eastern country’s or the region’s security, including terrorism, may cause uncertainty in their markets and may adversely affect its economy and a
Fund’s investments.</div> <div>Governmental actions in the
future could have a significant effect on economic conditions in Saudi Arabia, which could affect private sector companies and a Fund, as well as the value of securities in a Fund’s portfolio. Any economic sanctions on Saudi Arabian
individuals or Saudi Arabian corporate entities, or even the threat of sanctions, may result in the decline of the value and liquidity of Saudi Arabian securities, a weakening of the Saudi riyal or other adverse consequences to the Saudi Arabian
economy. Any sanctions could also result in the immediate freeze of Saudi Arabian securities and/or funds investing in prohibited assets, impairing the ability of a Fund to buy, sell, receive or deliver those securities and/or assets. In addition,
Saudi Arabia’s economy relies heavily on cheap, foreign labor, and changes in the availability of this labor supply could have an adverse effect on the economy.</div>
<div>The securities markets in Saudi Arabia may not be as developed
as those in other countries. As a result, securities markets in Saudi Arabia are subject to greater risks associated with market volatility, lower market capitalization, lower trading volume, illiquidity, inflation, greater price fluctuations,
uncertainty regarding the existence of trading markets, governmental control and heavy regulation of labor and industry. Shares of certain Saudi Arabian companies tend to trade less frequently than</div> </div>

exchanges in more developed markets. Such infrequent trading may adversely affect the pricing of these securities and a Fund’s ability to sell these securities in the future.</div>
<div>Although the political situation in Saudi Arabia is largely
stable, Saudi Arabia has historically experienced political instability, and there remains the possibility that the stability will not hold in the future or that instability in the larger Middle East region could adversely impact the economy of
Saudi Arabia. Instability may be caused by military developments, government interventions in the marketplace, terrorism, extremist attitudes, attempted social or political reforms, religious differences, or other factors. Additionally, anti-Western
views held by certain groups in the Middle East may influence government policies regarding foreign investment. Further developments in U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia and other Middle-Eastern countries may affect these attitudes and policies. The
U.S. is a significant trading partner of, or foreign investor in, Saudi Arabia. As a result, economic conditions of Saudi Arabia may be particularly affected by changes in the U.S. economy. A decrease in U.S. imports or exports, new trade and
financial regulations or tariffs, changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate or an economic slowdown in the U.S. may have a material adverse effect on the economic conditions of Saudi Arabia and, as a result, securities to which a Fund has exposure.
Political instability in North Africa and the larger Middle East region has caused significant disruptions to many industries. Continued political and social unrest in these areas may negatively affect the value of securities in a Fund’s
portfolio.</div> <div>Certain issuers located in Saudi Arabia may
operate in, or have dealings with, countries subject to sanctions and/or embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and the United Nations and/or countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism. As a result, an issuer may
sustain damage to its reputation if it is identified as an issuer which operates in, or has dealings with, such countries. A Fund, as an investor in such issuers, will be indirectly subject to those risks.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Automotive Sub-Industry. <font> The automotive sub-industry can be highly cyclical, and companies in the automotive sub-industry may suffer periodic losses. The automotive sub-industry is also highly competitive and there may be, at times, excess
capacity in the global and domestic automotive sub-industry. Over the last several decades, the U.S. automotive sub-industry has experienced periodic downturns; certain automotive companies required stimulus from the U.S. government, while others
formed strategic industry alliances in order to weather the substantially difficult market conditions. In general, the automotive sub-industry is susceptible to labor disputes, product defect litigation, patent expiration, increased pension
liabilities, rise in material or component prices and changing consumer tastes.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Basic Materials Industry. <font> Issuers in the basic materials industry could be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, exchange rate fluctuations, social and political unrest, import controls and increased competition. Companies in
the basic materials industry may be subject to swift fluctuations in supply and demand. Fluctuations may be caused by events relating to political and economic developments, the environmental impact of basic materials operations, and the success of
exploration projects. Production of industrial materials often exceeds demand as a result of over-building or economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns. Issuers in the basic materials industry are at risk for environmental damage and
product liability claims and may be adversely affected by depletion of resources, delays in technical progress, labor relations, tax and government regulations related to changes to, among other things, energy and environmental
policies.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in the Capital Goods
Industry. <font> Companies in the capital goods industry may be affected by fluctuations in the business cycle and by other factors affecting manufacturing demands. Companies in the capital goods industry depend
heavily on corporate spending. Companies in the capital goods industry may perform well during times of economic expansion, and as economic conditions worsen, the demand for capital goods may decrease due to weakening demand, worsening business cash
flows, tighter credit controls and deteriorating profitability. During times of economic volatility, corporate spending may fall and adversely affect the capital goods industry. This industry may also be affected by changes in interest rates,
corporate tax rates and other government policies. Many capital goods are sold internationally and such companies are subject to market conditions in other countries and regions.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Cyclical Industry. <font> A Fund may invest in consumer cyclical companies, which rely heavily on business cycles and economic conditions. Consumer cyclical companies include automotive manufacturers, retail companies, and housing-related
companies. The consumer cyclical industry can be significantly affected by several factors,</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

limitation, the performance of domestic and international economies, exchange rates, changing consumer tastes and trends, marketing campaigns, cyclical revenue generation, consumer confidence, commodity price volatility, labor relations, interest
rates, import and export controls, intense competition, technological developments and government regulation.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Discretionary Sector. <font> Companies engaged in the design, production or distribution of products or services for the consumer discretionary sector (including, without limitation, television and radio broadcasting, manufacturing,
publishing, recording and musical instruments, motion pictures, photography, amusement and theme parks, gaming casinos, sporting goods and sports arenas, camping and recreational equipment, toys and games, apparel, travel-related services,
automobiles, hotels and motels, and fast food and other restaurants) are subject to the risk that their products or services may become obsolete quickly. The success of these companies can depend heavily on disposable household income and consumer
spending. During periods of an expanding economy, the consumer discretionary sector may outperform the consumer staples sector, but may underperform when economic conditions worsen. Moreover, the consumer discretionary sector can be significantly
affected by several factors, including, without limitation, the performance of domestic and international economies, exchange rates, changing consumer preferences, demographics, marketing campaigns, cyclical revenue generation, consumer confidence,
commodity price volatility, labor relations, interest rates, import and export controls, intense competition, technological developments and government regulation.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Goods Industry. <font> Companies in the consumer goods industry include companies involved in the design, production or distribution of goods for consumers, including food, household, home, personal and office products, clothing and
textiles. The success of the consumer goods industry is tied closely to the performance of the domestic and international economy, interest rates, exchange rates, competition, consumer confidence and consumer disposable income. The consumer goods
industry may be affected by trends, marketing campaigns and other factors affecting consumer demand. Governmental regulation affecting the use of various food additives may affect the profitability of certain companies in the consumer goods
industry. Moreover, international events may affect food and beverage companies that derive a substantial portion of their net income from foreign countries. In addition, tobacco companies may be adversely affected by new laws, regulations and
litigation. Many consumer goods may be marketed globally, and consumer goods companies may be affected by the demand and market conditions in other countries and regions. Companies in the consumer goods industry may be subject to severe competition,
which may also have an adverse impact on their profitability. Changes in demographics and consumer preferences may affect the success of consumer products.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Services Industry. <font> The success of firms in the consumer services industry and certain retailers (including food and beverage, general retailers, media, and travel and leisure) is tied closely to the performance of the domestic and
international economy, interest rates, exchange rates, competition and consumer confidence. The consumer services industry depends heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending. Companies in the consumer services industry may be
subject to severe competition, which may also have an adverse impact on their profitability. Companies in the consumer services industry are facing increased government and regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or regulatory
action. Changes in demographics and consumer preferences may affect the success of consumer service providers.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Consumer Staples Sector. <font> Companies in the consumer staples sector may be adversely affected by changes in the global economy, consumer spending, competition, demographics and consumer preferences, and production spending. Companies in the
consumer staples sector may also be affected by changes in global economic, environmental and political events, economic conditions, the depletion of resources, and government regulation. For instance, government regulations may affect the
permissibility of using various food additives and production methods of companies that make food products, which could affect company profitability. In addition, tobacco companies may be adversely affected by the adoption of proposed legislation
and/or by litigation. Companies in the consumer staples sector also may be subject to risks pertaining to the supply of, demand for and prices of raw materials. The prices of raw materials fluctuate in response to a number of factors, including,
without limitation, changes in government agricultural support programs, exchange rates, import and export controls, changes in international agricultural and trading policies, and seasonal and weather conditions. Companies in the consumer staples
sector may be subject to severe competition, which may also have an adverse impact on their profitability.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Energy Sector. <font> Companies in the energy sector are strongly affected by the levels and volatility of global energy prices, energy supply and demand, government regulations and policies, energy production and conservation efforts,
technological change, development of alternative energy sources, and other factors that they cannot control. These</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>companies may also lack
resources and have limited business lines. Energy companies may have relatively high levels of debt and may be more likely to restructure their businesses if there are downturns in certain energy markets or in the global economy. If an energy
company in a Fund's portfolio becomes distressed, a Fund could lose all or a substantial portion of its investment.</div>
<div>The energy sector is cyclical and is highly dependent on
commodity prices; prices and supplies of energy may fluctuate significantly over short and long periods of time due to, among other things, national and international political changes, Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(“OPEC”) policies, changes in relationships among OPEC members and between OPEC and oil-importing nations, the regulatory environment, taxation policies, and the economy of the key energy-consuming countries. Commodity prices have
recently been subject to increased volatility and declines, which may negatively affect companies in which a Fund invests. For example, in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak and disputes among oil-producing countries regarding potential limits on
the production of crude oil, the energy sector has experienced increased volatility. In particular, significant market volatility occurred in the crude oil markets as well as the oil futures markets, which resulted in the market price of certain
crude oil futures contracts falling below zero for a period of time.</div>
<div>Companies in the energy sector may be adversely affected by
terrorism, cyber incidents, natural disasters or other catastrophes. Companies in the energy sector are at risk of civil liability from accidents resulting in injury, loss of life or property, pollution or other environmental damage claims.
Disruptions in the oil industry or shifts in fuel consumption may significantly impact companies in this sector. Significant oil and gas deposits are located in emerging markets countries where corruption and security may raise significant risks, in
addition to the other risks of investing in emerging markets. Additionally, the Middle East, where many companies in the energy sector may operate, has historically and recently experienced widespread social unrest.</div>
<div>Companies in the energy sector may also be adversely affected
by changes in exchange rates, interest rates, economic conditions, tax treatment, government regulation and intervention, negative perception, efforts at energy conservation and world events in the regions in which the companies operate (<font>e.g.,</font> expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest, violence or labor
unrest). Because a significant portion of revenues of companies in this sector is derived from a relatively small number of customers that are largely composed of governmental entities and utilities, governmental budget constraints may have a
significant impact on the stock prices of companies in this sector. The energy sector is highly regulated. Entities operating in the energy sector are subject to significant regulation of nearly every aspect of their operations by governmental
agencies. Such regulation can change rapidly or over time in both scope and intensity. Stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be enacted in the future which would likely increase compliance costs and may materially adversely affect
the financial performance of companies in the energy sector.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Financials Sector. <font> Companies in the financials sector include regional and money center banks, securities brokerage firms, asset management companies, savings banks and thrift institutions, specialty finance companies (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, credit card, mortgage providers), insurance and insurance brokerage firms, consumer finance firms, financial conglomerates and foreign banking and
financial companies.</font></div> <div>Most financial companies are
subject to extensive governmental regulation, which limits their activities and may affect their ability to earn a profit from a given line of business. Government regulation may change frequently and may have significant adverse consequences for
companies in the financials sector, including effects not intended by the regulation. Direct governmental intervention in the operations of financial companies and financial markets may materially and adversely affect the companies in which a Fund
invests, including legislation in many countries that may increase government regulation, repatriation and other intervention. The impact of governmental intervention and legislative changes on any individual financial company or on the financials
sector as a whole cannot be predicted. The valuation of financial companies has been and continues to be subject to unprecedented volatility and may be influenced by unpredictable factors, including interest rate risk and sovereign debt default.
Certain financial businesses are subject to intense competitive pressures, including market share and price competition. Financial companies in foreign countries are subject to market specific and general regulatory and interest rate concerns. In
particular, government regulation in certain foreign countries may include taxes and controls on interest rates, credit availability, minimum capital requirements, bans on short sales, limits on prices and restrictions on currency transfers. In
addition, companies in the financials sector may be the targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or customer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses.</div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>The
profitability of banks, savings and loan associations and financial companies is largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change; for instance, when interest rates go up, the
value of securities issued by many types of companies in the financials sector generally goes down. In other words, financial companies may be adversely affected in certain market cycles, including, without limitation, during periods of rising
interest rates, which may restrict the availability and increase the cost of capital, and during periods of declining economic conditions, which may cause, among other things, credit losses due to financial difficulties of borrowers.</div>
<div>In addition, general economic conditions are important to the
operations of these companies, and financial difficulties of borrowers may have an adverse effect on the profitability of financial companies. Financial companies can be highly dependent upon access to capital markets, and any impediments to such
access, such as adverse overall economic conditions or a negative perception in the capital markets of a financial company’s financial condition or prospects, could adversely affect its business. Deterioration of credit markets can have an
adverse impact on a broad range of financial markets, causing certain financial companies to incur large losses. In these conditions, companies in the financials sector may experience significant declines in the valuation of their assets, take
actions to raise capital and even cease operations. Some financial companies may also be required to accept or borrow significant amounts of capital from government sources and may face future government-imposed restrictions on their businesses or
increased government intervention. In addition, there is no guarantee that governments will provide any such relief in the future. These actions may cause the securities of many companies in the financials sector to decline in value.</div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Healthcare Sector. <font> Companies in the healthcare sector are often issuers whose profitability may be affected by extensive government regulation, restrictions on government reimbursement for medical expenses, rising or falling costs of
medical products and services, pricing pressure, an increased emphasis on outpatient services, a limited number of products, industry innovation, changes in technologies and other market developments. Many healthcare companies are heavily dependent
on patent protection and the actual or perceived safety and efficiency of their products.</font></div>
<div>Patents have a limited duration, and, upon expiration, other
companies may market substantially similar “generic” products that are typically sold at a lower price than the patented product, which can cause the original developer of the product to lose market share and/or reduce the price charged
for the product, resulting in lower profits for the original developer. As a result, the expiration of patents may adversely affect the profitability of these companies.</div>
<div>In addition, because the products and services of many
companies in the healthcare sector affect the health and well-being of many individuals, these companies are especially susceptible to extensive litigation based on product liability and similar claims. Healthcare companies are subject to
competitive forces that may make it difficult to raise prices and, in fact, may result in price discounting. Many new products in the healthcare sector may be subject to regulatory approvals. The process of obtaining such approvals may be long and
costly, which can result in increased development costs, delayed cost recovery and loss of competitive advantage to the extent that rival companies have developed competing products or procedures, adversely affecting the company’s revenues and
profitability. In other words, delays in the regulatory approval process may diminish the opportunity for a company to profit from a new product or to bring a new product to market, which could have a material adverse effect on a company’s
business. Healthcare companies may also be strongly affected by scientific biotechnology or technological developments, and their products may quickly become obsolete. Also, many healthcare companies offer products and services that are subject to
governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies or laws. Changes in governmental policies or laws may span a wide range of topics, including cost control, national health insurance, incentives for
compensation in the provision of healthcare services, tax incentives and penalties related to healthcare insurance premiums, and promotion of prepaid healthcare plans. In addition, a number of legislative proposals concerning healthcare have been
considered by the U.S. Congress in recent years. It is unclear what proposals will ultimately be enacted, if any, and what effect they may have on companies in the healthcare sector.</div>
<div>Additionally, the expansion of facilities by
healthcare-related providers may be subject to “determinations of need” by certain government authorities. This process not only generally increases the time and costs involved in these expansions, but also makes expansion plans
uncertain, limiting the revenue and profitability growth potential of healthcare-related facilities operators and negatively affecting the prices of their securities. Moreover, in recent years, both local and national governmental budgets have come
under pressure to reduce spending and control healthcare costs, which could both adversely affect regulatory processes and public funding available for healthcare products, services and facilities.</div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Risk of
Investing in the Industrials Sector. <font> The value of securities issued by companies in the industrials sector may be adversely affected by supply of and demand for both their specific products or services and for
industrials sector products in general. The products of manufacturing companies may face obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product introduction. Government regulations, trade disputes, world events and economic
conditions may affect the performance of companies in the industrials sector. The industrials sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced by unpredictable factors. For example, commodity
price declines and unit volume reductions resulting from an over-supply of materials used in the industrials sector can adversely affect the sector. Furthermore, companies in the industrials sector may be subject to liability for environmental
damage, product liability claims, depletion of resources, and mandated expenditures for safety and pollution control.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Infrastructure Industry. <font> Companies in the infrastructure industry may be subject to a variety of factors that could adversely affect their business or operations, including high interest costs in connection with capital construction
programs, high degrees of leverage, costs associated with governmental, environmental and other regulations, the effects of economic slowdowns, increased competition from other providers of services, uncertainties concerning costs, the level of
government spending on infrastructure projects, and other factors. Infrastructure companies may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility, changes in exchange rates, import controls, depletion of resources, technological developments, and
labor relations. There is also the risk that corruption may negatively affect publicly funded infrastructure projects, especially in emerging markets, resulting in delays and cost overruns. Infrastructure issuers can be significantly affected by
government spending policies because companies involved in this industry rely to a significant extent on U.S. and other government demand for their products.</font></div>
<div>Infrastructure companies in the oil and gas industry may be
adversely affected by government regulation or world events in the regions where the companies operate (<font>e.g.</font>, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or the imposition of
restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest, violence or labor unrest). Infrastructure companies may have significant capital investments in, or engage in transactions involving, emerging market
countries, which may heighten these risks.</div> <div>Operations
Risk. <font>The failure of an infrastructure company to carry adequate insurance or to operate its assets appropriately could lead to significant losses. Infrastructure may be adversely affected by environmental clean-up
costs and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts.</font></div>
<div>Customer Risk. <font>Infrastructure
companies can be dependent upon a narrow customer base. Additionally, if these customers fail to pay their obligations, significant revenues could be lost and may not be replaceable.</font></div>
<div>Regulatory Risk.
<font>Infrastructure companies may be subject to significant regulation by various governmental authorities and also may be affected by regulation of rates charged to customers, service interruption due to environmental,
operational or other events, the imposition of special tariffs and changes in tax laws, regulatory policies and accounting standards.</font></div>
<div>Strategic Asset Risk.
<font>Infrastructure companies may control significant strategic assets (</font>e.g.<font>, major pipelines or highways), which are assets that have a national or regional profile, and may have
monopolistic characteristics. Given their national or regional profile or irreplaceable nature, strategic assets could generate additional risk not common in other industry sectors and they may be targeted for terrorist acts or adverse political
actions.</font></div> <div>Interest Rate Risk. <font>Rising interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for infrastructure companies, which could negatively impact their ability to meet payment obligations.</font></div>
<div>Leverage Risk. <font>Infrastructure
companies can be highly leveraged, which increases investments risk and other risks normally associated with debt financing and could adversely affect an infrastructure company's operations and market value in periods of rising interest
rates.</font></div> <div>Inflation Risk. <font>Many infrastructure companies may have fixed income streams. Consequently, their market values may decline in times of higher inflation. Additionally, the prices that an infrastructure company is able to charge users of
its assets may be linked to inflation, whether by government regulation, contractual arrangement or other factors. In this case, changes in the rate of inflation may affect the company's profitability.</font></div> </div>

transportation industry group.</font></div> <div>Oil and Gas Risk.<font> The profitability of oil and gas companies is related to worldwide energy prices, exploration, and production spending.</font></div>
<div>Utilities Risk. <font>Utilities
companies face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which may have an adverse effect on their profit margins. The rates charged by regulated utility companies are subject to review and limitation by governmental regulatory
commissions.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in the Insurance
Industry. <font> The insurance industry is subject to extensive government regulation in some countries and can be significantly affected by changes in interest rates, general economic conditions, price and marketing
competition, the imposition of premium rate caps or other changes in government regulation or tax law. Different segments of the insurance industry can be significantly affected by changes in mortality and morbidity rates, environmental clean-up
costs and catastrophic events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist acts.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Media Sub-Industry. <font> Companies in the media sub-industry may encounter distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition, particularly in formulating new products and services using new
technology. Media companies are subject to risks that include cyclicality of revenues and earnings, a potential decrease in the discretionary income of targeted individuals, changing consumer tastes and interests, competition in the industry and the
potential for increased state and federal regulation. Advertising spending is an important source of revenue for media companies. During economic downturns, advertising spending typically decreases and, as a result, media companies tend to generate
less revenue.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in Municipal
Securities in the Utilities Sector. <font> Certain municipal securities are issued by public bodies, including state and municipal utility authorities, to, among other things, finance the operation or expansion of
utility entities. Various future economic and other conditions may adversely affect utility entities, including inflation, increases in financing requirements, increases in raw material costs and other operating costs, changes in demand for services
and the effects of environmental and other governmental regulations. Municipal securities that are issued to finance a particular utility project often depend on revenues from that project to make principal and interest payments. Adverse conditions
and developments affecting a particular utility project can result in lower revenues to the issuer of the municipal securities. Certain utilities are subject to specific risks. Gas utilities are subject to risks of supply conditions and increased
competition from other providers of utility services. In addition, gas utilities are affected by gas prices, which may be magnified to the extent that a gas utility enters into long-term contracts for the purchase or sale of gas at a fixed price,
since such prices may change significantly and to the disadvantage of the gas utility.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Oil and Gas Industry. <font> Companies in the oil and gas industry are strongly affected by the levels and volatility of global energy prices, oil and gas supply and demand, government regulations and policies, oil and gas production and
conservation efforts and technological change. The oil and gas industry is cyclical and from time to time may experience a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or qualified personnel, or due to significant demand, such services may not be
available on commercially reasonable terms. Prices and supplies of oil and gas may fluctuate significantly over short and long periods of time due to national and international political changes, OPEC policies, changes in relationships among OPEC
members and between OPEC and oil-importing nations, the regulatory environment, taxation policies, and the economies of key energy-consuming countries. Disruptions in the oil sub-industry or shifts in energy consumption may significantly impact
companies in this industry. For instance, significant oil and gas deposits are located in emerging market countries where corruption and security may raise significant risks, in addition to the other risks of investing in emerging markets. In
addition, the Middle East, where many companies in the oil and gas industry may operate, has recently experienced widespread social unrest. Oil and gas companies operate in a highly competitive industry, with intense price competition. A significant
portion of their revenues may depend on a relatively small number of customers, including governmental entities and utilities.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Real Estate Industry. <font> Companies in the real estate industry include companies that invest in real estate, such as REITs, real estate holding and operating companies or real estate development companies (collectively, “Real Estate
Companies”). Investing in Real Estate Companies exposes investors to the risks of owning real estate directly, as well as to risks that relate specifically to the way in which Real Estate Companies are organized and operated. The real
estate</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>industry is highly
sensitive to general and local economic conditions and developments, and characterized by intense competition and periodic overbuilding. Investing in Real Estate Companies involves various risks. Some risks that are specific to Real Estate Companies
are discussed in greater detail below.</div> <div>Concentration
Risk.<font> Real Estate Companies may own a limited number of properties and concentrate their investments in a particular geographic region or property type. Economic downturns affecting a particular region, industry or
property type may lead to a high volume of defaults within a short period.</font></div>
<div>Distressed Investment Risk.<font>
Real Estate Companies may invest in distressed, defaulted or out-of-favor bank loans. Identification and implementation by a Real Estate Company of loan modification and restructure programs involves a high degree of uncertainty. Even successful
implementation may still require adverse compromises and may not prevent bankruptcy. Real Estate Companies may also invest in other debt instruments that may become non-performing, including the securities of companies with higher credit and market
risk due to financial or operational difficulties. Higher risk securities may be less liquid and more volatile than the securities of companies not in distress.</font></div>
<div>Illiquidity Risk.<font> Investing
in Real Estate Companies may involve risks similar to those associated with investing in small-capitalization companies. Real Estate Company securities, like the securities of small-capitalization companies, may be more volatile than, and perform
differently from, shares of large-capitalization companies. There may be less trading in Real Estate Company shares, which means that buy and sell transactions in those shares could have a magnified impact on share price, resulting in abrupt or
erratic price fluctuations. In addition, real estate is relatively illiquid, and, therefore, a Real Estate Company may have a limited ability to vary or liquidate properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions.</font></div>
<div>Interest Rate Risk.<font> Rising
interest rates could result in higher costs of capital for Real Estate Companies, which could negatively impact a Real Estate Company’s ability to meet its payment obligations. Declining interest rates could result in increased prepayment on
loans and require redeployment of capital in less desirable investments.</font></div>
<div>Leverage Risk.<font> Real Estate
Companies may use leverage (and some may be highly leveraged), which increases investment risk and could adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s operations and market value in periods of rising interest rates. Real Estate Companies are also
exposed to the risks normally associated with debt financing. Financial covenants related to a Real Estate Company’s leverage may affect the ability of the Real Estate Company to operate effectively. In addition, real property may be subject
to the quality of credit extended and defaults by borrowers and tenants. If the properties do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses, including, where applicable, debt service, ground lease payments, tenant improvements,
third-party leasing commissions and other capital expenditures, the income and ability of a Real Estate Company to make payments of any interest and principal on its debt securities will be adversely affected.</font></div>
<div>Loan Foreclosure Risk.<font> Real
Estate Companies may foreclose on loans that the Real Estate Company originated and/or acquired. Foreclosure may generate negative publicity for the underlying property that affects its market value. In addition to the length and expense of such
proceedings, the validity of the terms of the applicable loan may not be recognized in foreclosure proceedings. Claims and defenses asserted by borrowers or other lenders may interfere with the enforcement of rights by a Real Estate Company.
Parallel proceedings, such as bankruptcy, may also delay resolution and limit the amount of recovery on a foreclosed loan by a Real Estate Company even where the property underlying the loan is liquidated.</font></div>
<div>Management Risk.<font> Real Estate
Companies are dependent upon management skills and may have limited financial resources. Real Estate Companies are generally not diversified and may be subject to heavy cash flow dependency, default by borrowers and voluntary liquidation. In
addition, transactions between Real Estate Companies and their affiliates may be subject to conflicts of interest, which may adversely affect a Real Estate Company’s shareholders. A Real Estate Company may also have joint venture investments
in certain of its properties, and, consequently, its ability to control decisions relating to such properties may be limited.</font></div>
<div>Property Risk.<font> Real Estate
Companies may be subject to risks relating to functional obsolescence or reduced desirability of properties; extended vacancies due to economic conditions and tenant bankruptcies; catastrophic events such as earthquakes, hurricanes and terrorist
acts; and casualty or condemnation losses. Real estate income and values also may be greatly affected by demographic trends, such as population shifts or changing tastes and values, or increasing vacancies or declining rents resulting from legal,
cultural, technological, global or local economic developments.</font></div>
<div>Regulatory Risk.<font> Real estate
income and values may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable domestic and foreign laws (including tax laws). Government actions, such as tax increases, zoning law changes, mandated closures or other</font></div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>commercial restrictions or
environmental regulations, also may have a major impact on real estate income and values. In addition, quarterly compliance with regulations limiting the proportion of asset types held by a U.S. REIT may force certain Real Estate Companies to
liquidate or restructure otherwise attractive investments. Some countries may not recognize REITs or comparable structures as a viable form of real estate funds.</div>
<div>Underlying Investment Risk.<font>
Real Estate Companies make investments in a variety of debt and equity instruments with varying risk profiles. For instance, Real Estate Companies may invest in debt instruments secured by commercial property that have higher risks of delinquency
and foreclosure than loans on single family homes due to a variety of factors associated with commercial property, including the tie between income available to service debt and productive use of the property. Real Estate Companies may also invest
in debt instruments and preferred equity that are junior in an issuer’s capital structure and that involve privately negotiated structures. Subordinated debt investments, such as B-Notes and mezzanine loans, involve a greater credit risk of
default due to the need to service more senior debt of the issuer. Similarly, preferred equity investments involve a greater risk of loss than conventional debt financing due to their non-collateralized nature and subordinated ranking. Investments
in CMBS may also be junior in priority in the event of bankruptcy or similar proceedings. Investments in senior loans may be effectively subordinated if the senior loan is pledged as collateral. The ability of a holder of junior claims to proceed
against a defaulting issuer is circumscribed by the terms of the particular contractual arrangement, which vary considerably from transaction to transaction.</font></div>
<div>U.S. Tax Risk.<font> Certain U.S.
Real Estate Companies are subject to special U.S. federal tax requirements. A REIT that fails to comply with such tax requirements may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation, which may affect the value of the REIT and the characterization of the
REIT’s distributions. The U.S. federal tax requirement that a REIT distribute substantially all of its net income to its shareholders may result in a REIT having insufficient capital for future expenditures. A REIT that successfully maintains
its qualification may still become subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes, including excise, penalty, franchise, payroll, mortgage recording, and transfer taxes, both directly and indirectly through its subsidiaries. Because REITs often do
not provide complete tax information until after the calendar year-end, a Fund may at times need to request permission to extend the deadline for issuing your tax reporting statement or supplement the information otherwise provided to
you.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in the Retail Industry. <font> The retail industry may be affected by changes in domestic and international economies, consumer confidence, disposable household income and spending, and consumer tastes and preferences. Companies in the retail
industry face intense competition, which may have an adverse effect on their profitability. The success of companies in the retail industry may be strongly affected by social trends, marketing campaigns and public perceptions. Companies in the
retail industry may be dependent on outside financing, which may be difficult to obtain. Many of these companies are dependent on third party suppliers and distribution systems. Retail companies may be unable to protect their intellectual property
rights or may be liable for infringing the intellectual property rights of others.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Technology Sector. <font> Technology companies are characterized by periodic new product introductions, innovations and evolving industry standards, and, as a result, face intense competition, both domestically and internationally, which
may have an adverse effect on profit margins. Companies in the technology sector are often smaller and less experienced companies and may be subject to greater risks than larger companies; these risks may be heightened for technology companies in
foreign markets. Technology companies may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. The products of technology companies may face product obsolescence due to rapid technological developments and frequent new product
introduction, changes in consumer and business purchasing patterns, unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for the services of qualified personnel. In addition, a rising interest rate environment tends to negatively affect companies
in the technology sector because, in such an environment, those companies with high market valuations may appear less attractive to investors, which may cause sharp decreases in the companies’ market prices. Companies in the technology sector
are heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights. The loss or impairment of these rights may adversely affect the profitability of these companies. Companies in the technology sector are facing increased government and regulatory
scrutiny and may be subject to adverse government or regulatory action. The technology sector may also be adversely affected by changes or trends in commodity prices, which may be influenced or characterized by unpredictable factors. Finally, while
all companies may be susceptible to network security breaches, certain companies in the technology sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a
material adverse effect on their businesses.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Risk of
Investing in the Telecommunications Sector. <font> The telecommunications sector of a country’s economy is often subject to extensive government regulation. The costs of complying with governmental regulations,
delays or failure to receive required regulatory approvals, or the enactment of new regulatory requirements may negatively affect the business of telecommunications companies. Government actions around the world, specifically in the area of
pre-marketing clearance of products and prices, can be arbitrary and unpredictable. Companies in the telecommunications sector may experience distressed cash flows due to the need to commit substantial capital to meet increasing competition,
particularly in developing new products and services using new technology. Technological innovations may make the products and services of certain telecommunications companies obsolete. Finally, while all companies may be susceptible to network
security breaches, certain companies in the telecommunications sector may be particular targets of hacking and potential theft of proprietary or consumer information or disruptions in service, which could have a material adverse effect on their
businesses.</font></div> <div>Risk of Investing in the Transportation
Infrastructure Industry. <font> Municipal securities include, among others, bonds payable from fuel taxes and tolls for municipal toll roads, as well as general airport bonds. Issuers in the transportation
infrastructure industry can be significantly affected by economic changes, fuel prices, labor relations, technology developments, exchange rates, industry competition, insurance costs and deteriorating public infrastructure, such as bridges, roads,
rails, ports and airports. Municipal securities that are issued to finance a particular transportation project often depend on revenues from that project to make principal and interest payments. Adverse conditions and developments affecting a
particular project can result in lower revenues to the issuer of the municipal securities. Other risk factors that may affect the transportation infrastructure industry include the risk of increases in fuel and other operating costs and the effects
of regulatory changes or other government decisions.</font></div>
<div>Risk of Investing in the Utilities Sector. <font> The utilities sector may be adversely affected by changing commodity prices, government regulation stipulating rates charged by utilities, increased tariffs, changes in tax laws, interest rate fluctuations and
changes in the cost of providing specific utility services. The utilities industry is also subject to potential terrorist attacks, natural disasters and severe weather conditions, as well as regulatory and operational burdens associated with the
operation and maintenance of nuclear facilities. Government regulators monitor and control utility revenues and costs, and therefore may limit utility profits. In certain countries, regulatory authorities may also restrict a company’s access
to new markets, thereby diminishing the company’s long-term prospects.</font></div>
<div>There are substantial differences among the regulatory
practices and policies of various jurisdictions, and any regulatory agency may make major shifts in policy from time to time. There is no assurance that regulatory authorities will, in the future, grant rate increases. Additionally, existing and
possible future regulatory legislation may make it even more difficult for utilities to obtain adequate relief. Certain of the issuers of securities held in a Fund's portfolio may own or operate nuclear generating facilities. Governmental
authorities may from time to time review existing policies and impose additional requirements governing the licensing, construction and operation of nuclear power plants. Prolonged changes in climate conditions can also have a significant impact on
both the revenues of an electric and gas utility as well as the expenses of a utility, particularly a hydro-based electric utility.</div>
<div>The rates that traditional regulated utility companies may
charge their customers generally are subject to review and limitation by governmental regulatory commissions. Rate changes may occur only after a prolonged approval period or may not occur at all, which could adversely affect utility companies when
costs are rising. The value of regulated utility debt securities (and, to a lesser extent, equity securities) tends to have an inverse relationship to the movement of interest rates. Certain utility companies have experienced full or partial
deregulation in recent years. These utility companies are frequently more similar to industrial companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been permitted by regulators to diversify outside of their original geographic regions
and their traditional lines of business. As a result, some companies may be forced to defend their core business and may be less profitable. Deregulation may also permit a utility company to expand outside of its traditional lines of business and
engage in riskier ventures.</div> <div>Proxy Voting Policy</div>
<div>For the Funds, the Board has delegated the voting of proxies
for each Fund’s securities to BFA pursuant to the Funds' Proxy Voting Policy (the “iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policy”), and BFA has adopted policies and procedures (the “BlackRock Proxy Voting Policies”) governing
proxy voting by accounts managed by BFA, including the Funds.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

BlackRock Proxy Voting Policies, BFA will vote proxies related to Fund securities in the best interests of a Fund and its shareholders. From time to time, a vote may present a conflict between the interests of a Fund’s shareholders, on the one
hand, and those of BFA, or any affiliated person of a Fund or BFA, on the other. BFA maintains policies and procedures that are designed to prevent undue influence on BFA’s proxy voting activity that might stem from any relationship between
the issuer of a proxy (or any dissident shareholder) and BFA, BFA’s affiliates, a Fund or a Fund’s affiliates. Most conflicts are managed through a structural separation of BFA’s Corporate Governance Group from BFA’s
employees with sales and client responsibilities. In addition, BFA maintains procedures to ensure that all engagements with corporate issuers or dissident shareholders are managed consistently and without regard to BFA’s relationship with the
issuer of the proxy or the dissident shareholder. In certain instances, BFA may determine to engage an independent fiduciary to vote proxies as a further safeguard to avoid potential conflicts of interest or as otherwise required by applicable
law.</div> <div>Copies of the iShares ETFs Proxy Voting Policy, the

return characteristics similar to those of the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index, the parent index. The Underlying Index is constructed by selecting constituents from the parent index and applying an optimization process to certain constituents
using ESG rating inputs from MSCI ESG Research in an effort to maximize exposure to ESG factors for a target tracking error constraint of 10 basis points relative to the parent index. To construct the Underlying Index, the Fund’s index
provider begins with the parent index and replicates its U.S. Treasury bond, MBS, CMBS and ABS exposures. These exposures are preserved at the weights of the parent index and are not subject to the index provider’s optimization process, which
is a quantitative process that seeks to determine optimal weights for securities to maximize exposure to securities of entities with higher MSCI ESG Research ratings subject to seeking to maintain risk and return characteristics similar to the
parent index. For the remaining constituents of the parent index, the index provider excludes securities of entities without an MSCI ESG Research rating and:</font></div> <div>

The Bloomberg Indexes are valued using end of day bid side prices, as marked by
Bloomberg. Intra-month cash flows contribute to monthly returns, but they are not reinvested during the month and do not earn a reinvestment return. Total returns are calculated based on the sum of price changes, gain/loss on repayments of
principal, and coupon received or accrued, expressed as a percentage of beginning market value. The Bloomberg Indexes are calculated once a day and are available from major data vendors.</font></div>

bonds, government-related bonds, investment-grade corporate bonds, MBS, CMBS and ABS that are publicly offered for sale in the U.S. The securities in the Underlying Index must have $300 million or more of outstanding face value and must have at
least one year remaining to maturity, with the exception of amortizing securities such as ABS and MBS, which have lower minimum thresholds as defined by the index provider. In addition, the securities must be denominated in U.S. dollars and must be
fixed-rate, non-convertible, and taxable. Certain types of securities, such as SLGs, are excluded from the Underlying Index. Also excluded from the Underlying Index are structured notes with embedded swaps or other special features, private
placements, floating rate securities and Eurobonds. The Underlying Index is market capitalization weighted and the securities in the Underlying Index are updated on the last business day of each month. As of February 28, 2021, approximately 27.3% of
the bonds represented in the Underlying Index were U.S. fixed-rate agency MBS. U.S. fixed-rate agency MBS are securities issued by entities such as Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae that are backed by pools of mortgages. Most transactions in
fixed-rate MBS occur through standardized contracts for future delivery in which the exact mortgage pools to be delivered are not specified until a few days prior to settlement (TBA transactions). The Fund may enter into such contracts on a regular
basis. The Fund, pending settlement of such contracts, will invest its assets in high-quality, liquid short-term instruments, including shares of BlackRock Cash Funds. The Fund will assume its pro rata share of the fees and expenses of any money
market fund that it may invest in, in addition to the Fund's own fees and expenses. The Fund may also acquire interests in mortgage pools through means other than such standardized contracts for future delivery.</font></div>

<div>Index Methodology. <font>The
Underlying Index is market value weighted based on amounts outstanding of issuances consisting of publicly issued U.S. Treasury securities with a remaining term to final maturity of less than or equal to three months as of the rebalance date and
have $1 billion or more of outstanding face value, excluding amounts held by the Federal Reserve System Open Market Account. In addition, the securities in the Underlying Index must have a fixed coupon schedule and be denominated in U.S. dollars.
Excluded from the Underlying Index are inflation-linked securities, cash management bills and zero-coupon bonds that have been stripped from coupon-paying bonds (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities). However, the amounts outstanding of qualifying coupon securities in the Underlying Index are not reduced by any individual components of such
securities (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, coupon or principal) that have been stripped after inclusion in the Underlying Index. Accrued interest is calculated assuming next
day settlement. The Underlying Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of each month. Cash flows from bond payments and redemptions are retained in the Underlying Index until end of the month and then removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash
does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the Underlying Index. New issues must be auctioned on or before the rebalancing date in order to qualify for the coming month.</font></div>

Underlying Index, but that no longer satisfy all the criteria at month-end, will be removed from the Underlying Index. If a bond becomes eligible in the middle of the month, it will still need to satisfy the criteria at the end of the month, and can
be included only upon rebalancing at month-end. When a bond is called, it remains in the Underlying Index at its call price until the end of the month, after which it is removed. Changes in issue size that take place during the month are taken into
consideration only at the next rebalancing date.</div> <div>Markit<sup>®</sup> and iBoxx<sup>®</sup> are registered trademarks of Markit

these investments, is the responsibility of separate regional index committees composed of S&amp;P index staff specialized in the various regional equity markets and, in some cases with the assistance of local stock exchanges. Public announcements
of index changes as the result of committee decisions will generally be made two business days in advance of the anticipated effective date whenever possible, although for exceptional corporate events announcements may be made earlier.</div>
<div>Index Maintenance.<font> Maintaining
the S&amp;P Fixed Income Indexes includes monitoring and completing the adjustments for bond additions and deletions, par amount changes, rating changes and corporate actions. Each S&amp;P Fixed Income Index is a market-value weighted index.
Securities Evaluations | ICE Data Services (“Securities Evaluations”), the pricing division of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (“ICE”), Securities Evaluations, reports the price of each bond in the index each day. The prices
used in the index calculation will add the accrued interest for each bond to the price reported by S&amp;P. The total return is calculated by aggregating the interest return, reflecting the return due to paid and accrued interest, and principal
return, reflecting the capital gains or losses due to changes in S&amp;P's end-of-day price and principal repayments and the reinvestment return, excluding the reinvestment of related cash flows. Each index is generally reviewed and rebalanced on a
monthly basis. The SPDJI Index Committee, nevertheless, reserves the right to make adjustments to each index at any time that it believes appropriate. Additions, deletions and other changes to each index arising from the monthly rebalancing are
published three business days prior to the last business day of the month (the “Announcement Date”). Publicly available information, up to and including the close on the fourth business day preceding the Rebalancing Date, is considered
in the rebalancing. Index changes published in the announcement will not normally be subject to revision and will become effective after the close. Any index bond that is downgraded below investment grade between rebalancing dates is removed at the
next rebalancing date.</font></div> <div>Index Availability.<font> All S&amp;P Fixed-Income Indexes are calculated at the end of the business day. Most S&amp;P Indexes are available from major data vendors.</font></div>

<div><font>Number of Components:
approximately 3,592</font></div> <div>Index Description.<font> The S&amp;P California AMT-Free Municipal Bond Index<sup>TM</sup> is a broad, comprehensive, market-value weighted index designed to
measure the performance of the investment-grade, tax-exempt bond issues within the California segment of the U.S. municipal bond market. As of February 28, 2021, the Underlying Index consisted of 3,592 constituents, with a total market value of
$191.8 billion.</font></div> <div>Index Methodology.<font> To be included in the Underlying Index, bonds must meet all of the following criteria: (i) the bond issuer is from a California State or local government or agency whose interest payments are exempt from U.S. federal
income taxes and the federal AMT as determined by the index provider in accordance with its methodology; (ii) the bond must be denominated in U.S. dollars; (iii) the bond must have a rating of at least BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings, Baa3 by
Moody’s, or BBB- by Fitch. A bond must be rated by at least one of these three rating agencies in order to qualify for the Underlying Index, and the lowest rating will be used in determining if a bond is investment-grade; (iv) each bond in the
Underlying Index must be a constituent of an offering where the original offering amount was at least $100 million, and must have a minimum par amount of $15 million. To remain in the Underlying Index, bonds must maintain a minimum par amount
greater than or equal to $15 million as of the next rebalancing date and must maintain a minimum Par Amount greater than or equal to $15 million as of four days prior to last business day of each month (“Rebalancing Reference Date”); and
(v) as of the last business day of each month (“Rebalancing Date”), the bond must have a minimum term to maturity and/or pre-refunded or call date greater than one calendar month. “Business Day” is defined as any day that
U.S. municipal bonds are traded, as determined by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (“SIFMA”). Bonds that are completely called or tendered during the course of the month and bonds that are scheduled to be
completely called or redeemed, during the course of the month following the Rebalancing Date, will be removed on the Rebalancing Date. At each monthly rebalancing, no one issuer can represent more than 25% of the weight of the Underlying Index; and
individual issuers that represent at least 5% of the weight of the Underlying Index cannot account for more than 50% of the weight of the Underlying Index in aggregate. The following types of bonds are specifically excluded from the Underlying
Index: bonds subject to AMT, bonds issued by U.S. territories and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, bonds issued under SEC Rule 144A, commercial paper, derivative securities (inverse floaters, forwards, and swaps), housing bonds, non-rated bonds,

<div>Notations Regarding each of the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond
ETF's, iShares 25+ Year Treasury STRIPS Bond ETF's, iShares Core 5-10 Year USD Bond ETF's, iShares ESG Advanced Total USD Bond Market ETF's, iShares ESG Aware 1-5 Year USD Corporate Bond ETF's, iShares ESG Aware U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF's, iShares
ESG Aware USD Corporate Bond ETF's, iShares High Yield Bond Factor ETF's and iShares Investment Grade Bond Factor ETF's Fundamental Investment Policies</div>
<div>The following notations are not considered to be part of each
Fund’s fundamental investment policies and are subject to change without shareholder approval.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to
concentration set forth in (1) above, the Investment Company Act does not define what constitutes “concentration” in an industry. The SEC staff has taken the position that investment of 25% or more of a fund’s total assets in one
or more issuers conducting their principal activities in the same industry or group of industries constitutes concentration. It is possible that interpretations of concentration could change in the future. The policy in (1) above will be interpreted
to refer to concentration as that term may be interpreted from time to time. The policy also will be interpreted to permit investment without limit in the following: securities of the U.S. government and its agencies or instrumentalities; securities
of state, territory, possession or municipal governments and their authorities, agencies, instrumentalities or political subdivisions; and repurchase agreements collateralized by any such obligations. Accordingly, issuers of the foregoing securities
will not be considered to be members of any industry. There also will be no limit on investment in issuers domiciled in a single jurisdiction or country. Finance companies will be considered to be in the industries of their parents if their
activities are primarily related to financing the activities of the parents. Each foreign government will be considered to be a member of a separate industry. With respect to each Fund's industry classifications, each Fund currently utilizes any one
or more of the industry sub-classifications used by one or more widely recognized</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>market indexes or rating
group indexes, and/or as defined by Fund management. The policy also will be interpreted to give broad authority to each Fund as to how to classify issuers within or among industries.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to borrowing
money set forth in (2) above, the Investment Company Act permits each Fund to borrow money in amounts of up to one-third of the Fund’s total assets from banks for any purpose, and to borrow up to 5% of the Fund’s total assets from banks
or other lenders for temporary purposes. (The Fund’s total assets include the amounts being borrowed.) To limit the risks attendant to borrowing, the Investment Company Act requires each Fund to maintain at all times an “asset
coverage” of at least 300% of the amount of its borrowings. Asset coverage means the ratio that the value of each Fund’s total assets (including amounts borrowed), minus liabilities other than borrowings, bears to the aggregate amount of
all borrowings. Borrowing money to increase portfolio holdings is known as “leveraging.” Certain trading practices and investments, such as reverse repurchase agreements, may be considered to be borrowings or involve leverage and thus
are subject to the Investment Company Act restrictions. In accordance with SEC staff guidance and interpretations, when each Fund engages in such transactions, the Fund, instead of maintaining asset coverage of at least 300%, may segregate or
earmark liquid assets, or enter into an offsetting position, in an amount at least equal to the Fund’s exposure, on a mark-to-market basis, to the transaction (as calculated pursuant to requirements of the SEC). The policy in (2) above will be
interpreted to permit each Fund to engage in trading practices and investments that may be considered to be borrowing or to involve leverage to the extent permitted by the Investment Company Act and to permit each Fund to segregate or earmark liquid
assets or enter into offsetting positions in accordance with the Investment Company Act. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered to be
borrowings under the policy. Practices and investments that may involve leverage but are not considered to be borrowings are not subject to the policy.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to
underwriting set forth in (5) above, the Investment Company Act does not prohibit each Fund from engaging in the underwriting business or from underwriting the securities of other issuers; in fact, in the case of diversified funds, the Investment
Company Act permits the Fund to have underwriting commitments of up to 25% of its assets under certain circumstances. Those circumstances currently are that the amount of each Fund’s underwriting commitments, when added to the value of the
Fund’s investments in issuers where each Fund owns more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of those issuers, cannot exceed the 25% cap. A fund engaging in transactions involving the acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities
may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act. Although it is not believed that the application of the 1933 Act provisions described above would cause each Fund to be engaged in the business of underwriting, the policy in (5) above will
be interpreted not to prevent the Fund from engaging in transactions involving the acquisition or disposition of portfolio securities, regardless of whether the Fund may be considered to be an underwriter under the 1933 Act or is otherwise engaged
in the underwriting business to the extent permitted by applicable law.</div>
<div>With respect to the fundamental policy relating to lending set
forth in (7) above, the Investment Company Act does not prohibit each Fund from making loans (including lending its securities); however, SEC staff interpretations currently prohibit funds from lending more than one-third of their total assets
(including lending its securities), except through the purchase of debt obligations or the use of repurchase agreements. In addition, collateral arrangements with respect to options, forward currency and futures transactions and other derivative
instruments (as applicable), as well as delays in the settlement of securities transactions, will not be considered loans.</div>

to the investment restrictions adopted as fundamental policies, set forth above, each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy not to invest in the securities of a company for the purpose of exercising management or control, or purchase or
otherwise acquire any illiquid investment, except as permitted under the 1940 Act, which currently limits each Fund’s holdings in illiquid investments to 15% of a Fund’s net assets. BFA monitors Fund holdings in illiquid investments
pursuant to the Liquidity Program. Except with regard to the fundamental policy relating to senior securities set forth in (3) above for all Funds, if any percentage restriction described above is complied with at the time of an investment, a later
increase or decrease in percentage resulting from a change in values of assets will not constitute a violation of such restriction.</div>
<div>Under normal circumstances (i) each of the iShares National
Muni Bond ETF and the iShares Short-Term National Muni Bond ETF will invest at least 80% of the value of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in investments the income of which is free from federal income tax,
including AMT; (ii) the iShares California Muni Bond ETF will invest at least 80% of the value of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in investments the income of which is free from federal income tax,
including AMT, and California income tax; and (iii) the iShares New York Muni Bond ETF will invest at least 80% of the value of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in investments the income of which is free
from federal income tax, including AMT, and New York income tax. These policies are fundamental policies of the Municipal Bond Funds and may not be changed without a vote of a majority of each Fund’s outstanding voting securities, as defined
in the 1940 Act. Each Fund (except the Municipal Bond Funds, iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF, iShares 25+ Year Treasury STRIPS Bond ETF, iShares ESG Advanced Total USD Bond Market ETF, iShares ESG Aware U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF, iShares High
Yield Bond Factor ETF and iShares Investment Grade Bond Factor ETF) has adopted a non-fundamental investment policy to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the value of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment
purposes, in securities in the Fund's Underlying Index and (except the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF, iShares 25+ Year Treasury STRIPS Bond ETF, iShares ESG Advanced Total USD Bond Market ETF, iShares ESG Aware 1-5 Year USD Corporate Bond ETF,
iShares ESG Aware USD Corporate Bond ETF, iShares High Yield Bond Factor ETF and iShares Investment Grade Bond Factor ETF) in TBA transactions with respect to the percentage of the Underlying Index (if any) that consists of mortgage pass-through
securities. The iShares ESG Aware U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF has adopted a non-fundamental policy to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the value of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in the
component securities in the Fund's Underlying Index and in TBA transactions with respect to the percentage of its Underlying Index that consists of mortgage pass-through securities. Each of the iShares Core 10+ Year USD Bond ETF and iShares Core
U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF have adopted an additional non-fundamental policy under which the iShares Core 10+ Year USD Bond ETF and iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF, under normal circumstances, will invest, at least 80% of its net assets, plus the
amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in securities of U.S. issuers. The iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF and iShares 25+ Year Treasury STRIPS Bond ETF have adopted a non-fundamental investment policy in accordance with Rule 35d-1
under the 1940 Act to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the value of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in the component securities in the Fund’s Underlying Index. The iShares ESG
Advanced Total USD Bond Market ETF has adopted a non-fundamental investment policy in accordance with Rule 35d-1 under the Investment Company Act to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the value of its net assets, plus the amount of
any borrowings for investment purposes, in component securities in the Fund’s Underlying Index and in TBA transactions with respect to the percentage of the Underlying Index that consists of mortgage pass-through securities. The iShares High
Yield Bond Factor ETF and iShares Investment Grade Bond Factor ETF have adopted a non-fundamental investment policy in accordance with Rule 35d-1 under the Investment Company Act to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the value of
its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in securities in its Underlying Index and in to-be-announced transactions with respect to the percentage of its Underlying Index (if any) that consists of mortgage
pass-through securities. Each Fund also has adopted a policy to provide its shareholders with at least 60 days’ prior written notice of any change in such policy. If, subsequent to an investment, an 80% requirement is no longer met, a
Fund’s future investments will be made in a manner that will bring the Fund into compliance with this policy.</div>
<div>Each Fund has adopted a non-fundamental policy not to purchase
securities of other investment companies, except to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. As a matter of policy, however, a Fund will not purchase shares of any registered open-end investment company or registered unit investment trust, in reliance
on Section 12(d)(1)(F) or (G) (the “fund of funds” provisions) of the 1940 Act, at any time the Fund has knowledge that its shares are purchased by another investment company investor in reliance on the provisions of subparagraph (G) of

<div>The method by which Creation Units are created and traded may
raise certain issues under applicable securities laws. Because new Creation Units are issued and sold by the Funds on an ongoing basis, at any point a “distribution,” as such term is used in the 1933 Act, may occur. Broker-dealers and
other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters and subject them to the
prospectus delivery requirement and liability provisions of the 1933 Act.</div>
<div>For example, a broker-dealer firm or its client may be deemed
a statutory underwriter if it takes Creation Units after placing an order with the Distributor, breaks them down into constituent shares and sells such shares directly to customers or if it chooses to couple the creation of new shares with an active
selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand for shares. A determination of whether one is an underwriter for purposes of the 1933 Act must take into account all of the facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the
broker-dealer or its client in the particular case and the examples mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that could lead to a categorization as an underwriter.</div>
<div>Broker-dealer firms should also note that dealers who are not
“underwriters” but are effecting transactions in shares, whether or not participating in the distribution of shares, generally are required to deliver a prospectus. This is because the prospectus delivery exemption in Section 4(a)(3) of
the 1933 Act is not available in respect of such transactions as a result of Section 24(d) of the 1940 Act. Firms that incur a prospectus delivery obligation with respect to shares of the Funds are reminded that, pursuant to Rule 153 under the 1933
Act, a prospectus delivery obligation under Section 5(b)(2) of the 1933 Act owed to an exchange member in connection with a sale on the Listing Exchange generally is satisfied by the fact that the prospectus is available at the Listing Exchange upon
request. The prospectus delivery mechanism provided in Rule 153 is available only with respect to transactions on an exchange.</div>
<div>Management</div>
<div>Trustees and Officers.
<font> The Board has responsibility for the overall management and operations of the Funds, including general supervision of the duties performed by BFA and other service providers. Each Trustee serves until he or
she resigns, is removed, dies, retires or becomes incapacitated. Each officer shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualifies or until his or her death, resignation or removal. Trustees who are not “interested
persons” (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Trust are referred to as independent trustees (“Independent Trustees”).</font></div>
<div>The registered investment companies advised by BFA or its
affiliates (the “BlackRock-advised Funds”) are organized into one complex of open-end equity, multi-asset, index and money market funds and ETFs (the “BlackRock Multi-Asset Complex”), one complex of closed-end funds and
open-end non-index fixed-income funds (including ETFs) (the “BlackRock Fixed-Income Complex”) and one complex of ETFs (“Exchange-Traded Fund Complex”) (each, a “BlackRock Fund Complex”). Each Fund is included in
the Exchange-Traded Fund Complex. Each Trustee also serves as a Director of iShares, Inc. and a Trustee of iShares U.S. ETF Trust and, as a result, oversees all of the funds within the Exchange-Traded Fund Complex, which consists of 381 funds as of
June 29, 2021. With the exception of Robert S. Kapito, Salim Ramji and Charles Park, the address of each Trustee and officer is c/o BlackRock, Inc., 400 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. The address of Mr. Kapito, Mr. Ramji and Mr. Park is c/o
BlackRock, Inc., Park Avenue Plaza, 55 East 52<sup>nd</sup> Street, New York, NY 10055. The Board has designated Cecilia H. Herbert as its Independent Board Chair.

<div>The Board has concluded that, based on each Trustee’s
experience, qualifications, attributes or skills on an individual basis and in combination with those of the other Trustees, each Trustee should serve as a Trustee of the Board. Among the attributes common to all Trustees are their ability to review

<div><font>Board –
Leadership Structure and Oversight Responsibilities</font></div>
<div>Overall responsibility for oversight of the Funds rests with
the Board. The Board has engaged BFA to manage the Funds on a day-to-day basis. The Board is responsible for overseeing BFA and other service providers in the operations of the Funds in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, applicable
provisions of state and other laws and the Trust’s charter. The Board is currently composed of nine members, seven of whom are Independent Trustees. The Board currently conducts regular in person meetings four times a year. In addition, the
Board frequently holds special in person or telephonic meetings or informal conference calls to discuss specific matters that may arise or require action between regular meetings. The Independent Trustees meet regularly outside the presence of
management, in executive session or with other service providers to the Trust.</div>
<div>The Board has appointed an Independent Trustee to serve in the
role of Board Chair. The Board Chair’s role is to preside at all meetings of the Board and to act as a liaison with service providers, officers, attorneys, and other Trustees generally between meetings. The Board Chair may also perform such
other functions as may be delegated by the Board from time to time. The Board has established seven standing Committees: a Nominating and Governance Committee, an Audit Committee, a 15(c) Committee, a Securities Lending Committee, a Risk Committee,
an Equity Plus Committee and a Fixed Income Plus Committee to assist the Board in the oversight and direction of the business and affairs of the Funds, and from time to time the Board may establish ad hoc committees or informal working groups to
review and address the policies and practices of the Funds with respect to certain specified matters. The Chair of each standing Committee is an Independent Trustee. The role of the Chair of each Committee is to preside at all meetings of the
Committee and to act as a liaison with service providers, officers, attorneys and other Trustees between meetings. Each standing Committee meets regularly to conduct the oversight functions delegated to the Committee by the Board and reports its
finding to the Board. The Board and each standing Committee conduct annual assessments of their oversight function and structure. The Board has determined that the Board’s leadership structure is appropriate because it allows the Board to
exercise independent judgment over management and it allocates areas of responsibility among committees of Independent Trustees and the full Board to enhance effective oversight.</div>
<div>Day-to-day risk management with respect to the Funds is the
responsibility of BFA or other service providers (depending on the nature of the risk), subject to the supervision of BFA. Each Fund is subject to a number of risks, including investment, compliance, operational, reputational, counterparty and
valuation risks, among others. While there are a number of risk management functions performed by BFA and other service providers, as applicable, it is not possible to identify and eliminate all of the risks applicable to the Funds. The Trustees
have an oversight role in this area, satisfying themselves that risk management processes and controls are in place and operating effectively. Risk oversight forms part of the Board’s general oversight of each Fund and is addressed as part of
various Board and committee activities. In some cases, risk management issues are specifically addressed in presentations and discussions. For example, BFA has an independent dedicated Risk and Quantitative Analysis Group (“RQA”) that
assists BFA in managing fiduciary and corporate risks, including investment, operational, counterparty credit and enterprise risk. Representatives of RQA meet with the Board to discuss their analysis and methodologies, as well as specific risk
topics such as operational and counterparty risks relating to the Funds. The Board, directly or through a committee, also reviews reports from, among others, management and the independent registered public accounting firm for the Trust, as
appropriate, regarding risks faced by each Fund and management’s risk functions. The Board has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer who oversees the implementation and testing of the Trust's compliance program, including assessments by
independent third parties, and reports to the Board regarding compliance matters for the Trust and its principal service providers. In testing and maintaining the compliance program, the Chief Compliance Officer (and his or her delegates) assesses
key compliance risks affecting each Fund, and addresses them in periodic reports to the Board. In addition, the Audit Committee meets with both the Funds' independent registered public accounting firm and BFA’s internal audit group to review
risk controls in place that support each Fund as well as test results. Board oversight of risk is also performed as needed between meetings through communications between BFA and the Board.</div> </div>

with respect to the Funds and/or other accounts managed by BlackRock, may give rise to actual or perceived conflicts of interest such as those described below.</font></div>
<div>BlackRock is one of the world's largest asset management
firms. BlackRock, its subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers and employees, including the business units or entities and personnel who may be involved in the investment activities and business operations of a Fund, are engaged
worldwide in businesses, including managing equities, fixed-income securities, cash and alternative investments, and have interests other than that of managing the Funds. These are considerations of which investors in a Fund should be aware, and
which may cause conflicts of interest that could disadvantage a Fund and its shareholders. These businesses and interests include potential multiple advisory, financial and other relationships with, or interests in, companies and interests in
securities or other instruments that may be purchased or sold by a Fund.</div>
<div>BlackRock has proprietary interests in, and may manage or
advise with respect to, accounts or funds (including separate accounts and other funds and collective investment vehicles) that have investment objectives similar to those of a Fund and/or that engage in transactions in the same types of securities,
currencies and instruments as the Funds. BlackRock is also a major participant in the global currency, equities, swap and fixed income markets, in each case, for the accounts of clients and, in some cases, on a proprietary basis. As such, BlackRock
is or may be actively engaged in transactions in the</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>same securities,
currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests. Such activities could affect the prices and availability of the securities, currencies, and instruments in which a Fund invests, which could have an adverse impact on a Fund's performance. Such
transactions, particularly in respect of most proprietary accounts or client accounts, will be executed independently of a Fund's transactions and thus at prices or rates that may be more or less favorable than those obtained by the Funds.</div>
<div>When BlackRock seeks to purchase or sell the same assets for
managed accounts, including a Fund, the assets actually purchased or sold may be allocated among the accounts on a basis determined in its good faith discretion to be equitable. In some cases, this system may adversely affect the size or price of
the assets purchased or sold for a Fund. In addition, transactions in investments by one or more other accounts managed by BlackRock may have the effect of diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of a Fund,
particularly, but not limited to, with respect to small-capitalization, emerging market or less liquid strategies. This may occur with respect to BlackRock-advised accounts when investment decisions regarding a Fund are based on research or other
information that is also used to support decisions for other accounts. When BlackRock implements a portfolio decision or strategy on behalf of another account ahead of, or contemporaneously with, similar decisions or strategies for a Fund, market
impact, liquidity constraints, or other factors could result in the Fund receiving less favorable trading results and the costs of implementing such decisions or strategies could be increased or the Fund could otherwise be disadvantaged. BlackRock
may, in certain cases, elect to implement internal policies and procedures designed to limit such consequences, which may cause a Fund to be unable to engage in certain activities, including purchasing or disposing of securities, when it might
otherwise be desirable for it to do so.</div> <div>Conflicts may
also arise because portfolio decisions regarding a Fund may benefit other accounts managed by BlackRock. For example, the sale of a long position or establishment of a short position by a Fund may impair the price of the same security sold short by
(and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its other accounts or funds, and the purchase of a security or covering of a short position in a security by a Fund may increase the price of the same security held by (and therefore benefit) BlackRock or its
other accounts or funds. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, certain Funds may invest their assets in other funds advised by BlackRock, including funds that are managed by one or more of the same portfolio managers, which could
result in conflicts of interest relating to asset allocation, timing of Fund purchases and sales, and increased remuneration and profitability for BlackRock, and/or its personnel, including portfolio managers.</div>
<div>In certain circumstances, BlackRock, on behalf of the Funds,
may seek to buy from or sell securities to another fund or account advised by BlackRock. BlackRock may (but is not required to) effect purchases and sales between BlackRock clients (“cross trades”), including the Funds, if BlackRock
believes such transactions are appropriate based on each party's investment objectives and guidelines, subject to applicable law and regulation. There may be potential conflicts of interest or regulatory issues relating to these transactions which
could limit BlackRock’s decision to engage in these transactions for the Funds. BlackRock may have a potentially conflicting division of loyalties and responsibilities to the parties in such transactions. On any occasion when a Fund
participates in a cross trade, BlackRock will comply with procedures adopted under applicable rules and SEC guidance.</div>
<div>BlackRock and its clients may pursue or enforce rights with
respect to an issuer in which a Fund has invested, and those activities may have an adverse effect on the Fund. As a result, prices, availability, liquidity and terms of a Fund's investments may be negatively impacted by the activities of BlackRock
or its clients, and transactions for the Fund may be impaired or effected at prices or terms that may be less favorable than would otherwise have been the case.</div>
<div>The results of a Fund’s investment activities may differ
significantly from the results achieved by BlackRock for its proprietary accounts or other accounts (including investment companies or collective investment vehicles) which it manages or advises. It is possible that one or more accounts managed or
advised by BlackRock and such other accounts will achieve investment results that are substantially more or less favorable than the results achieved by a Fund. Moreover, it is possible that a Fund will sustain losses during periods in which one or
more proprietary or other accounts managed or advised by BlackRock achieve significant profits. The opposite result is also possible.</div>
<div>From time to time, a Fund may be restricted from purchasing or
selling securities, or from engaging in other investment activities because of regulatory, legal or contractual requirements applicable to BlackRock or other accounts managed or advised by BlackRock, and/or the internal policies of BlackRock
designed to comply with such requirements. As a result, there may be periods, for example, when BlackRock will not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions in certain securities or instruments with respect to which BlackRock is performing
services or when position limits have been reached.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>For example, the
investment activities of BlackRock for its proprietary accounts and accounts under its management may limit the investment opportunities for a Fund in certain emerging and other markets in which limitations are imposed upon the amount of investment,
in the aggregate or in individual issuers, by affiliated foreign investors.</div>
<div>In connection with its management of a Fund, BlackRock may
have access to certain fundamental analysis and proprietary technical models developed by BlackRock. BlackRock will not be under any obligation, however, to effect transactions on behalf of a Fund in accordance with such analysis and models. In
addition, BlackRock will not have any obligation to make available any information regarding its proprietary activities or strategies, or the activities or strategies used for other accounts managed by them, for the benefit of the management of a
Fund and it is not anticipated that BlackRock will have access to such information for the purpose of managing the Fund. The proprietary activities or portfolio strategies of BlackRock, or the activities or strategies used for accounts managed by
BlackRock or other client accounts could conflict with the transactions and strategies employed by BlackRock in managing a Fund.</div>
<div>The Funds may be included in investment models developed by
BlackRock for use by clients and financial advisors. To the extent clients invest in these investment models and increase the assets under management of the Funds, the investment management fee amounts paid by the Funds to BlackRock may also
increase. The price, availability and liquidity of a Fund may be impacted by purchases and sales of the Fund by model-driven investment portfolios, as well as by BlackRock itself and by its advisory clients.</div>
<div>In addition, certain principals and certain employees of a
Fund’s investment adviser are also principals or employees of other business units or entities within BlackRock. As a result, these principals and employees may have obligations to such other business units or entities or their clients and
such obligations to other business units or entities or their clients may be a consideration of which investors in a Fund should be aware.</div>
<div>BlackRock may enter into transactions and invest in
securities, instruments and currencies on behalf of a Fund in which clients of BlackRock or, to the extent permitted by the SEC and applicable law, BlackRock serves as the counterparty, principal or issuer. In such cases, such party's interests in
the transaction will be adverse to the interests of the Fund, and such party may have no incentive to assure that the Fund obtains the best possible prices or terms in connection with the transactions. In addition, the purchase, holding and sale of
such investments by a Fund may enhance the profitability of BlackRock.</div>
<div>BlackRock may also create, write or issue derivatives for
clients, the underlying securities, currencies or instruments in which a Fund may invest or which may be based on the performance of the Fund. An entity in which BlackRock has a significant minority interest will create, write or issue options which
may be based on the performance of certain Funds. BlackRock has the right to receive a portion of the gross revenue earned by such entity. Options writing by such entity on a Fund could potentially lead to increased purchase activity with respect to
the Fund and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</div>
<div>BlackRock has entered into an arrangement with Markit Indices
Limited, the index provider for underlying fixed-income indexes used by certain iShares funds, related to derivative fixed-income products that are based on such iShares funds. BlackRock may receive certain payments for licensing intellectual
property belonging to BlackRock and for facilitating the provision of data in connection with such derivative products, which may include payments based on the trading volumes of, or revenues generated by, the derivative products. However, BlackRock
will not receive any such payments on those derivative products utilized by the Funds or other BlackRock funds or accounts. Other funds and accounts managed by BlackRock may from time to time transact in such derivative products, which could
contribute to the viability or success of such derivative products by making them more appealing to funds and accounts managed by third parties, and in turn lead to increased payments to BlackRock. Trading activity in such derivative products could
also potentially lead to increased purchase activity with respect to these iShares funds and increased assets under management for BlackRock.</div>
<div>A Fund may, subject to applicable law, purchase investments
that are the subject of an underwriting or other distribution by BlackRock and may also enter into transactions with other clients of BlackRock where such other clients have interests adverse to those of the Fund.</div>
<div>At times, these activities may cause business units or
entities within BlackRock to give advice to clients that may cause these clients to take actions adverse to the interests of a Fund. To the extent such transactions are permitted, a Fund will deal with BlackRock on an arm’s-length basis.</div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>To the
extent authorized by applicable law, BlackRock may act as broker, dealer, agent, lender or adviser or in other commercial capacities for a Fund. It is anticipated that the commissions, mark-ups, mark-downs, financial advisory fees, underwriting and
placement fees, sales fees, financing and commitment fees, brokerage fees, other fees, compensation or profits, rates, terms and conditions charged by BlackRock will be in its view commercially reasonable, although BlackRock, including its sales
personnel, will have an interest in obtaining fees and other amounts that are favorable to BlackRock and such sales personnel, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. Index based funds may use an index provider that is affiliated with another
service provider of a Fund or BlackRock that acts as a broker, dealer, agent, lender or in other commercial capacities for a Fund or BlackRock.</div>
<div>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock (and its personnel and
other distributors) will be entitled to retain fees and other amounts that they receive in connection with their service to the Funds as broker, dealer, agent, lender, adviser or in other commercial capacities. No accounting to the Funds or their
shareholders will be required, and no fees or other compensation payable by the Funds or their shareholders will be reduced by reason of receipt by BlackRock of any such fees or other amounts.</div>
<div>When BlackRock acts as broker, dealer, agent, adviser or in
other commercial capacities in relation to the Funds, BlackRock may take commercial steps in its own interests, which may have an adverse effect on the Funds. A Fund will be required to establish business relationships with its counterparties based
on the Fund's own credit standing. BlackRock will not have any obligation to allow its credit to be used in connection with a Fund's establishment of its business relationships, nor is it expected that the Fund's counterparties will rely on the
credit of BlackRock in evaluating the Fund's creditworthiness.</div>
<div>BTC, an affiliate of BFA pursuant to SEC exemptive relief,
acts as securities lending agent to, and receives a share of securities lending revenues from, the Funds. BlackRock will also receive compensation for managing the reinvestment of the cash collateral from securities lending. There are potential
conflicts of interests in managing a securities lending program, including but not limited to: (i) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to increase or decrease the amount of securities on loan or to lend particular securities
in order to generate additional risk-adjusted revenue for BlackRock and its affiliates; and (ii) BlackRock as securities lending agent may have an incentive to allocate loans to clients that would provide more revenue to BlackRock. As described
further below, BlackRock seeks to mitigate this conflict by providing its securities lending clients with equal lending opportunities over time in order to approximate <font>pro rata </font>allocation. </div>
<div>As part of its securities lending program, BlackRock
indemnifies certain clients and/or funds against a shortfall in collateral in the event of borrower default. BlackRock’s RQA calculates, on a regular basis, BlackRock’s potential dollar exposure to the risk of collateral shortfall upon
counterparty default (“shortfall risk”) under the securities lending program for both indemnified and non-indemnified clients. On a periodic basis, RQA also determines the maximum amount of potential indemnified shortfall risk arising
from securities lending activities (“indemnification exposure limit”) and the maximum amount of counterparty-specific credit exposure (“credit limits”) BlackRock is willing to assume as well as the program’s operational
complexity. RQA oversees the risk model that calculates projected shortfall values using loan-level factors such as loan and collateral type and market value as well as specific borrower counterparty credit characteristics. When necessary, RQA may
further adjust other securities lending program attributes by restricting eligible collateral or reducing counterparty credit limits. As a result, the management of the indemnification exposure limit may affect the amount of securities lending
activity BlackRock may conduct at any given point in time and impact indemnified and non-indemnified clients by reducing the volume of lending opportunities for certain loans (including by asset type, collateral type and/or revenue profile).</div>
<div>BlackRock uses a predetermined systematic process in order to
approximate <font>pro rata</font> allocation over time. In order to allocate a loan to a portfolio: (i) BlackRock as a whole must have sufficient lending capacity pursuant to the various program limits (<font>i.e.,</font> indemnification exposure limit and counterparty credit limits); (ii) the lending portfolio must hold the asset at the time a loan opportunity arrives; and (iii) the lending portfolio must also have enough
inventory, either on its own or when aggregated with other portfolios into one single market delivery, to satisfy the loan request. In doing so, BlackRock seeks to provide equal lending opportunities for all portfolios, independent of whether
BlackRock indemnifies the portfolio. Equal opportunities for lending portfolios does not guarantee equal outcomes. Specifically, short and long-term outcomes for individual clients may vary due to asset mix, asset/liability spreads on different
securities, and the overall limits imposed by the firm.</div>
<div>Purchases and sales of securities and other assets for a Fund
may be bunched or aggregated with orders for other BlackRock client accounts, including with accounts that pay different transaction costs solely due to the fact that they have different research payment arrangements. BlackRock, however, is not
required to bunch or aggregate orders if portfolio management</div> </div> <div type="Block">

accounts are made separately, or if they determine that bunching or aggregating is not practicable or required, or in cases involving client direction.</div>
<div>Prevailing trading activity frequently may make impossible the
receipt of the same price or execution on the entire volume of securities purchased or sold. When this occurs, the various prices may be averaged, and the Funds will be charged or credited with the average price. Thus, the effect of the aggregation
may operate on some occasions to the disadvantage of the Funds. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Funds will not be charged the same commission or commission equivalent rates in connection with a bunched or aggregated order.</div>
<div>Subject to applicable law, BlackRock may select brokers that
furnish BlackRock, the Funds, other BlackRock client accounts or personnel, directly or through correspondent relationships, with research or other appropriate services which provide, in BlackRock's view, appropriate assistance to BlackRock in the
investment decision-making process (including with respect to futures, fixed-price offerings and OTC transactions). Such research or other services may include, to the extent permitted by law, research reports on companies, industries and
securities; economic and financial data; financial publications; proxy analysis; trade industry seminars; computer data bases; research-oriented software and other services and products. Research or other services obtained in this manner may be used
in servicing any or all of the Funds and other BlackRock client accounts, including in connection with BlackRock client accounts other than those that pay commissions to the broker relating to the research or other service arrangements. Such
products and services may disproportionately benefit other BlackRock client accounts relative to the Funds based on the amount of brokerage commissions paid by the Funds and such other BlackRock client accounts. For example, research or other
services that are paid for through one client's commissions may not be used in managing that client's account. In addition, other BlackRock client accounts may receive the benefit, including disproportionate benefits, of economies of scale or price
discounts in connection with products and services that may be provided to the Funds and to such other BlackRock client accounts. To the extent that BlackRock uses soft dollars, it will not have to pay for those products and services itself.</div>
<div>BlackRock does not currently enter into arrangements to use
the Funds' assets for, or participate in, soft dollars, although BlackRock may receive research that is bundled with the trade execution, clearing, and/or settlement services provided by a particular broker-dealer. To the extent that BlackRock
receives research on this basis, many of the same conflicts related to traditional soft dollars may exist. For example, the research effectively will be paid by client commissions that also will be used to pay for the execution, clearing, and
settlement services provided by the broker-dealer and will not be paid by BlackRock. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may endeavor to execute trades through brokers who, pursuant to such arrangements, provide research or other
services in order to ensure the continued receipt of research or other services BlackRock believes are useful in its investment decision-making process. BlackRock may from time to time choose not to engage in the above described arrangements to
varying degrees. BlackRock, unless prohibited by applicable law, may also enter into commission sharing arrangements under which BlackRock may execute transactions through a broker-dealer, and request that the broker-dealer allocate a portion of the
commissions or commission credits to another firm that provides research to BlackRock. To the extent that BlackRock engages in commission sharing arrangements, many of the same conflicts related to traditional soft dollars may exist.</div>
<div>BlackRock may utilize certain electronic crossing networks
(“ECNs”) (including, without limitation, ECNs in which BlackRock has an investment or other interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law) in executing client securities transactions for certain types of securities. These ECNs
may charge fees for their services, including access fees and transaction fees. The transaction fees, which are similar to commissions or markups/markdowns, will generally be charged to clients and, like commissions and markups/markdowns, would
generally be included in the cost of the securities purchased. Access fees may be paid by BlackRock even though incurred in connection with executing transactions on behalf of clients, including the Funds. In certain circumstances, ECNs may offer
volume discounts that will reduce the access fees typically paid by BlackRock. BlackRock will only utilize ECNs consistent with its obligation to seek to obtain best execution in client transactions.</div>
<div>BlackRock owns a minority interest in, and is a member of,
Members Exchange (“MEMX”), a newly created U.S. stock exchange. Transactions for a Fund may be executed on MEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue for execution of orders placed by BlackRock traders on behalf of
such Funds. In addition, transactions in Fund shares may in the future be executed on MEMX if third party brokers select MEMX as the appropriate venue for the execution of such orders.</div> </div>

has adopted policies and procedures designed to prevent conflicts of interest from influencing proxy voting decisions that it makes on behalf of advisory clients, including the Funds, and to help ensure that such decisions are made in accordance
with BlackRock's fiduciary obligations to its clients. Nevertheless, notwithstanding such proxy voting policies and procedures, actual proxy voting decisions of BlackRock may have the effect of favoring the interests of other clients or businesses
of other divisions or units of BlackRock, provided that BlackRock believes such voting decisions to be in accordance with its fiduciary obligations. For a more detailed discussion of these policies and procedures, see the <font>Proxy Voting Policy</font> section of this SAI.</div>
<div>It is also possible that, from time to time, BlackRock and/or
its advisory clients (including other funds and separately managed accounts) may, subject to compliance with applicable law, purchase and hold shares of a Fund. Increasing a Fund’s assets may enhance liquidity, investment flexibility and
diversification and may contribute to economies of scale that tend to reduce the Fund's expense ratio. BlackRock reserves the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to sell into the market or redeem in Creation Units through an Authorized
Participant at any time some or all of the shares of a Fund acquired for its own accounts or the account of a BlackRock advisory client. A large sale or redemption of shares of a Fund by BlackRock itself or a BlackRock advisory client could
significantly reduce the asset size of the Fund, which might have an adverse effect on the Fund's liquidity, investment flexibility, portfolio diversification, expense ratio or ability to comply with the listing requirements for the Fund.</div>
<div>It is possible that a Fund may invest in securities of, or
engage in transactions with, companies in which BlackRock has significant debt or equity investments or other interests. A Fund may also invest in issuances (such as structured notes) by entities for which BlackRock provides and is compensated for
cash management services relating to the proceeds from the sale of such issuances. In making investment decisions for a Fund, BlackRock is not permitted to obtain or use material non-public information acquired by any unit of BlackRock in the course
of these activities. In addition, from time to time, the activities of BlackRock may limit a Fund's flexibility in purchases and sales of securities. As indicated below, BlackRock may engage in transactions with companies in which BlackRock-advised
funds or other clients of BlackRock have an investment.</div>
<div>BlackRock and Chubb Limited (“Chubb”), a public
company whose securities are held by BlackRock-advised funds and other accounts, partially funded the creation of a re-insurance company (“Re Co”) pursuant to which each has approximately a 9.9% ownership interest and each has
representation on the board of directors. Certain employees and executives of BlackRock have a less than ½ of 1% ownership interest in Re Co. BlackRock manages the investment portfolio of Re Co, which is held in a wholly-owned subsidiary. Re Co
participates as a reinsurer with reinsurance contracts underwritten by subsidiaries of Chubb.</div>
<div>BlackRock, its personnel and other financial service providers
may have interests in promoting sales of the Funds. With respect to BlackRock and its personnel, the remuneration and profitability relating to services to and sales of the Funds or other products may be greater than remuneration and profitability
relating to services to and sales of certain funds or other products that might be provided or offered. BlackRock and its sales personnel may directly or indirectly receive a portion of the fees and commissions charged to the Funds or their
shareholders. BlackRock and its advisory or other personnel may also benefit from increased amounts of assets under management. Fees and commissions may also be higher than for other products or services, and the remuneration and profitability to
BlackRock and such personnel resulting from transactions on behalf of or management of the Funds may be greater than the remuneration and profitability resulting from other funds or products.</div>
<div>Third parties, including service providers to BlackRock or a
Fund, may sponsor events (including, but not limited to, marketing and promotional activities and presentations, educational training programs and conferences) for registered representatives, other professionals and individual investors. There is a
potential conflict of interest as such sponsorships may defray the costs of such activities to BlackRock, and may provide an incentive to BlackRock to retain such third parties to provide services to a Fund.</div>
<div>BlackRock may provide valuation assistance to certain clients
with respect to certain securities or other investments and the valuation recommendations made for such clients' accounts may differ from the valuations for the same securities or investments assigned by a Fund's pricing vendors, especially if such
valuations are based on broker-dealer quotes or other data sources unavailable to the Fund's pricing vendors. While BlackRock will generally communicate its valuation information or determinations to a Fund's pricing vendors and/or fund accountants,
there may be instances where the Fund's pricing vendors or fund accountants assign a different valuation to a security or other investment than the valuation for such security or investment determined or recommended by BlackRock.</div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>As
disclosed in more detail in the <font>Determination of Net Asset Value</font> section in this SAI, when market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BlackRock to be unreliable, each Fund’s
investments are valued at fair value by BlackRock’s Valuation Committee (the “Valuation Committee”) in accordance with policies and procedures approved by a Fund’s Board (the “Valuation Procedures”). When
determining a “fair value price,” the Valuation Committee seeks to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or liability in an arm’s-length transaction. The price
generally may not be determined based on what a Fund might reasonably expect to receive for selling an asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. While fair value determinations will be based upon all
available factors that BlackRock deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be based on analytical values determined by BlackRock using proprietary or third-party valuation models, fair value represents only a good faith approximation
of the value of an asset or liability. The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not, in retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used
in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at NAV, at a time when a holding or holdings are valued by the Valuation Committee at fair value, may have the effect of diluting or increasing the
economic interest of existing shareholders and may affect the amount of revenue received by BlackRock with respect to services for which it receives an asset-based fee.</div>
<div>To the extent permitted by applicable law, a Fund may invest
all or some of its short-term cash investments in any money market fund or similarly-managed private fund advised or managed by BlackRock. In connection with any such investments, a Fund, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, may pay its share of
expenses of a money market fund or other similarly-managed private fund in which it invests, which may result in a Fund bearing some additional expenses.</div>
<div>BlackRock and its directors, officers and employees, may buy
and sell securities or other investments for their own accounts and may have conflicts of interest with respect to investments made on behalf of a Fund. As a result of differing trading and investment strategies or constraints, positions may be
taken by directors, officers and employees that are the same, different from or made at different times than positions taken for a Fund. To lessen the possibility that a Fund will be adversely affected by this personal trading, each Fund, BFA and
BlackRock have each adopted a code of ethics in compliance with Section 17(j) of the 1940 Act that restricts securities trading in the personal accounts of investment professionals and others who normally come into possession of information
regarding a Fund's portfolio transactions. Each code of ethics is available by contacting BlackRock at the telephone number on the back cover of each Fund’s Prospectus or by accessing the EDGAR Database on the SEC's Internet site at
http://www.sec.gov, and copies may be obtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by e-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov.</div>
<div>BlackRock will not purchase securities or other property from,
or sell securities or other property to, a Fund, except that a Fund may in accordance with rules or guidance adopted under the 1940 Act engage in transactions with another Fund or accounts that are affiliated with a Fund as a result of common
officers, directors, or investment advisers or pursuant to exemptive orders granted to the Funds and/or BlackRock by the SEC. These transactions would be effected in circumstances in which BlackRock determined that it would be appropriate for a Fund
to purchase and another client of BlackRock to sell, or the Fund to sell and another client of BlackRock to purchase, the same security or instrument on the same day. From time to time, the activities of a Fund may be restricted because of
regulatory requirements applicable to BlackRock and/or BlackRock's internal policies designed to comply with, limit the applicability of, or otherwise relate to such requirements. A client not advised by BlackRock would not be subject to some of
those considerations. There may be periods when BlackRock may not initiate or recommend certain types of transactions, or may otherwise restrict or limit its advice in certain securities or instruments issued by or related to companies for which
BlackRock is performing advisory or other services or has proprietary positions. For example, when BlackRock is engaged to provide advisory or risk management services for a company, BlackRock may be prohibited from or limited in purchasing or
selling securities of that company on behalf of a Fund, particularly where such services result in BlackRock obtaining material non-public information about the company (<font>e.g.</font>, in connection with participation
in a creditors’ committee). Similar situations could arise if personnel of BlackRock serve as directors of companies the securities of which a Fund wishes to purchase or sell. However, if permitted by applicable law, and where consistent with
BlackRock’s policies and procedures (including the necessary implementation of appropriate information barriers), the Funds may purchase securities or instruments that are issued by such companies, are the subject of an advisory or risk
management assignment by BlackRock, or where personnel of BlackRock are directors or officers of the issuer.</div>
<div>The investment activities of BlackRock for its proprietary
accounts and for client accounts may also limit the investment strategies and rights of the Funds. For example, in certain circumstances where the Funds invest in securities issued by companies that operate in certain regulated industries or in
certain emerging or international markets, or are subject to</div> </div> <div type="Block">

ownership restrictions, or invest in certain futures or other derivative transactions, there may be limits on the aggregate amount invested by BlackRock for their proprietary accounts and for client accounts (including the Funds) that may not be
exceeded without the grant of a license or other regulatory or corporate consent or, if exceeded, may cause BlackRock, the Funds or other client accounts to suffer disadvantages or business restrictions.</div>
<div>If certain aggregate ownership thresholds are reached either
through the actions of BlackRock or a Fund or as a result of third-party transactions, the ability of BlackRock, on behalf of clients (including the Funds), to purchase or dispose of investments, or exercise rights or undertake business
transactions, may be restricted by regulation or otherwise impaired. As a result, BlackRock, on behalf of its clients (including the Funds), may limit purchases, sell existing investments, or otherwise restrict, forgo or limit the exercise of rights
(including transferring, outsourcing or limiting voting rights or forgoing the right to receive dividends) when BlackRock, in its sole discretion, deems it appropriate in light of potential regulatory or other restrictions on ownership or other
consequences resulting from reaching investment thresholds.</div>
<div>In those circumstances where ownership thresholds or
limitations must be observed, BlackRock seeks to allocate limited investment opportunities equitably among clients (including the Funds), taking into consideration benchmark weight and investment strategy. BlackRock has adopted certain controls
designed to prevent the occurrence of a breach of any applicable ownership threshold or limits, including, for example, when ownership in certain securities nears an applicable threshold, BlackRock may remove such securities from the list of Deposit
Securities to be delivered to the Fund in connection with purchases of Creation Units of such Fund and may limit purchases in such securities to the issuer's weighting in the applicable benchmark used by BlackRock to manage such Fund. If client
(including Fund) holdings of an issuer exceed an applicable threshold and BlackRock is unable to obtain relief to enable the continued holding of such investments, it may be necessary to sell down these positions to meet the applicable limitations.
In these cases, benchmark overweight positions will be sold prior to benchmark positions being reduced to meet applicable limitations.</div>
<div>In addition to the foregoing, other ownership thresholds may
trigger reporting requirements to governmental and regulatory authorities, and such reports may entail the disclosure of the identity of a client or BlackRock’s intended strategy with respect to such security or asset.</div>
<div>BlackRock may not serve as an Authorized Participant in the
creation and redemption of iShares ETFs.</div> <div>BlackRock may
maintain securities indices. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, the Funds may seek to license and use such indices as part of their investment strategy. Index based funds that seek to track the performance of securities indices also may use
the name of the index or index provider in the fund name. Index providers, including BlackRock (to the extent permitted by applicable law), may be paid licensing fees for use of their index or index name. BlackRock may benefit from the Funds using
BlackRock indices by creating increasing acceptance in the marketplace for such indices. BlackRock is not obligated to license its indices to a Fund and the Funds are under no obligation to use BlackRock indices. Any Fund that enters into a license
for a BlackRock index cannot be assured that the terms of any index licensing agreement with BlackRock will be as favorable as those terms offered to other licensees.</div>
<div>The custody arrangement described in “Investment
Advisory, Administrative and Distribution Services” may lead to potential conflicts of interest with BlackRock where BlackRock has agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse ordinary operating expenses in order to cap expenses of the Funds (or
where BlackRock charges a unitary management fee). This is because the custody arrangements with certain Funds' custodian may have the effect of reducing custody fees when the Funds leave cash balances uninvested. This could be viewed as having the
potential to provide BlackRock an incentive to keep high positive cash balances for Funds in order to offset fund custody fees that BlackRock might otherwise reimburse or pay. However, BlackRock’s portfolio managers do not intentionally keep
uninvested balances high, but rather make investment decisions that they anticipate will be beneficial to fund performance. For funds without a unitary management fee, when a fund’s actual operating expense ratio exceeds a stated cap, a
reduction in custody fees reduces the amount of waivers and/or reimbursements BlackRock would be required to make to the fund.</div>
<div>BlackRock may enter into contractual arrangements with
third-party service providers to a Fund (<font>e.g.</font>, custodians, administrators and index providers) pursuant to which BlackRock receives fee discounts or concessions in recognition of BlackRock’s overall
relationship with such service providers. BlackRock may also enter into contractual arrangements with such service providers pursuant to which BlackRock incurs additional costs if the service provider’s services are terminated with respect to
a Fund. To the extent that BlackRock is responsible for paying these service providers out of its management fee, the benefits of any such fee discounts or concessions, or any additional costs, may accrue, in whole or in part, to BlackRock, which
could result in conflicts of interest relating to the use or termination of service providers to a Fund.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

services to accounts managed by BlackRock and funds managed and sponsored by BlackRock, including the Funds, that engage the service provider (typically the custodian). A Fund’s service provider remunerates BlackRock for the use of the

<div>BlackRock has entered into an arrangement with ICE to be one
of ICE’s development partners in connection with ICE’s open-architecture, centralized industry platform to facilitate creation and redemption orders for ETFs (the “ICE Platform”). As a development partner, BlackRock has
licensed certain of its intellectual property to ICE. BlackRock uses the ICE Platform to facilitate creations and redemptions in the Funds and certain other services provided by the ICE Platform. BlackRock may have an incentive to promote the broad
adoption of the ICE Platform by the ETF marketplace because BlackRock will earn a fee, based on the total revenues earned by the ICE Platform, for licensing BlackRock’s intellectual property to ICE and for BlackRock’s role as development
partner. ICE Data Indices, LLC, the underlying index provider for certain BFA managed funds, is a wholly owned subsidiary of ICE.</div>
<div>BlackRock’s receipt of fees from a service provider in

manages and administers the Trust and the investment of each Fund’s assets. BFA is responsible for placing purchase and sale orders and providing continuous supervision of the investment portfolio of each Fund.</font></div>
<div>Pursuant to the investment advisory agreement, BFA may, from
time to time, in its sole discretion and to the extent permitted by applicable law, appoint one or more sub-advisers, including, without limitation, affiliates of BFA, to perform investment advisory or other services with respect to a Fund. In
addition, BFA may delegate certain of its investment advisory functions under the investment advisory agreement to one or more of its affiliates to the extent permitted by applicable law. BFA may terminate any or all sub-advisers or such delegation
arrangements in its sole discretion upon appropriate notice at any time to the extent permitted by applicable law.</div>
<div>BFA is responsible, under the investment advisory agreement,
for substantially all expenses of the Funds, including the cost of transfer agency, custody, fund administration, legal, audit and other services. BFA is not responsible for, and the Funds will bear, the management fees, interest expenses, taxes,

other financial instruments that compose those indexes or through a representative sampling of the securities and other financial instruments that compose those indexes based on objective criteria and data. Pursuant to BFA policy, investment
opportunities are allocated equitably among the Funds and other portfolios and accounts. For example, under certain circumstances, an investment opportunity may be restricted due to limited supply in the market, legal constraints or other factors,
in which event the investment opportunity will be allocated equitably among those portfolios and accounts, including the Funds, seeking such investment opportunity. As a consequence, from time to time the Funds may receive a smaller allocation of an

Funds, the other portfolios or accounts for which the Portfolio Managers are primarily responsible for the day-to-day portfolio management generally pay an asset-based fee to BFA or its affiliates, as applicable, for its advisory services. One or
more of those other portfolios or accounts, however, may pay BFA or its affiliates a performance-based fee in lieu of, or in addition to, an asset-based fee for its advisory services. A portfolio or account with a performance-based fee would pay BFA
or its affiliates a portion of that portfolio's or account's gains, or would pay BFA or its affiliates more for its services than would otherwise be the case if BFA or its affiliates meets or exceeds specified performance targets. Performance-based
fee arrangements could present an incentive for BFA or its affiliates to devote greater resources, and allocate more investment opportunities, to the portfolios or accounts that have those fee arrangements, relative to other portfolios or accounts,
in order to earn larger fees. Although BFA and its affiliates have an obligation to allocate resources and opportunities equitably among portfolios and accounts and intends to do so, shareholders of the Funds should be aware that, as with any group
of portfolios and accounts managed by an investment adviser and/or its affiliates pursuant to varying fee arrangements, including performance-based fee arrangements, there is the potential for a conflict of interest, which may result in the

from year to year based on a number of factors. The principal components of compensation include a base salary, a performance-based discretionary bonus, participation in various benefits programs and one or more of the incentive compensation
programs established by BlackRock, Inc.</div> <div>Each portfolio
manager receives base compensation based on their position with the firm, as well as retirement and other benefits offered to all BlackRock employees. Additionally, each portfolio manager receives discretionary incentive compensation, determined
based on several components, including: the performance of BlackRock, Inc., the performance of the portfolio manager’s group within BlackRock, the performance of portfolios managed by the portfolio manager and the team relative to the
portfolios’ investment objectives (which in the case of index ETFs would be how closely the ETF tracks its Underlying Index), and the individual’s performance and contribution to the overall performance of these portfolios and BlackRock.
Discretionary incentive compensation is paid in cash up to a certain threshold with the remaining portion represented by deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock awards. In some cases, additional deferred BlackRock, Inc. stock may be granted to certain key
employees as part of a long-term incentive award to aid in retention, align interests with long-term shareholders and motivate performance.</div>
<div>The discretionary incentive income for James Mauro, Scott
Radell and Karen Uyehara includes as an additional consideration the performance of actively-managed portfolios they manage over 1, 3 and 5 year periods measured against the respective benchmark of each portfolio as well as peer group performance. A
portion of the discretionary incentive compensation for James Mauro, Scott Radell and Karen Uyehara is distributed in the form of deferred cash awards that notionally track the returns of select BlackRock, Inc. investment products they manage, which
provides direct alignment of portfolio manager discretionary incentive compensation with investment product results. Deferred cash awards vest ratably over a number of years and, once vested, settle in the form of cash.</div>

<div>Codes of Ethics. <font> The
Trust, BFA and the Distributor have adopted codes of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act. The codes of ethics permit personnel subject to the codes of ethics to invest in securities, subject to certain limitations, including securities
that may be purchased or held by the Funds. Each code of ethics is available by contacting BlackRock at the telephone number on the back cover of each Fund’s Prospectus or by accessing the EDGAR Database on the SEC's Internet site at
http://www.sec.gov, and copies may be obtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by e-mail at publicinfo@sec.gov.</font></div>
<div>Anti-Money Laundering Requirements. <font> The Funds are subject to the USA PATRIOT Act (the “Patriot Act”). The Patriot Act is intended to prevent the use of the U.S. financial system in furtherance of money laundering, terrorism or other
illicit activities. Pursuant to requirements under the Patriot Act, a Fund may request information from Authorized Participants to enable it to form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of its Authorized Participants. This information
will be used to verify the identity of Authorized Participants or, in some cases, the status of financial professionals; it will be used only for compliance with the requirements of the Patriot Act.</font></div>
<div>The Funds reserve the right to reject purchase orders from
persons who have not submitted information sufficient to allow a Fund to verify their identity. Each Fund also reserves the right to redeem any amounts in a Fund from persons whose identity it is unable to verify on a timely basis. It is the Funds'
policy to cooperate fully with appropriate regulators in any investigations conducted with respect to potential money laundering, terrorism or other illicit activities.</div>

administrative, legal, tax and accounting and financial reporting services for the maintenance and operations of the Trust and each Fund. In addition, State Street makes available the office space, equipment, personnel and facilities required to
provide such services. Pursuant to the Service Module for Custodial Services with the Trust, State Street maintains, in separate accounts, cash, securities and other assets of the Trust and each Fund, keeps all necessary accounts and records and
provides other services. State Street is required, upon the order of the Trust, to deliver securities held by State Street and to make payments for securities purchased by the Trust for each Fund. State Street is authorized to appoint certain
foreign custodians or foreign custody managers for Fund investments outside the U.S. Pursuant to the Service Module for Transfer Agency Services with the Trust, State Street acts as a transfer agent for each Fund’s authorized and issued shares
of beneficial interest, and as dividend disbursing agent of the Trust. As compensation for these services, State Street receives certain out-of-pocket costs, transaction fees and asset-based fees which are accrued daily and paid monthly by BFA from
its management fee.</font></div> <div>The following table sets

Distribution Agreement for each Fund provides that it may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, on at least 60 days' prior written notice to the other party following (i) the vote of a majority of the Independent Trustees,
or (ii) the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the relevant Fund. The Distribution Agreement will terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act).</div>
<div>The Distributor may also enter into agreements with securities
dealers (“Soliciting Dealers”) who will solicit purchases of Creation Units of Fund shares. Such Soliciting Dealers may also be Authorized Participants (as described below), DTC participants and/or investor services organizations.</div>

<div>Securities Lending. <font> To
the extent that a Fund engages in securities lending, each Fund conducts its securities lending pursuant to SEC exemptive relief, and BTC acts as securities lending agent for the Funds, subject to the overall supervision of BFA, pursuant to a
written agreement (the “Securities Lending Agency Agreement”).</font></div>
<div>Each Fund retains a portion of the securities lending income
and remits the remaining portion to BTC as compensation for its services as securities lending agent. Securities lending income is generally equal to the total of income earned from the reinvestment of cash collateral (and excludes collateral
investment fees as defined below), and any fees or other payments to and from borrowers of securities. As securities lending agent, BTC bears all operational costs directly related to securities lending. Each Fund is responsible for fees in
connection with the investment of cash collateral received for securities on loan in a money market fund managed by BFA (the “collateral investment fees”); however, BTC has agreed to reduce the amount of securities lending income it
receives in order to effectively limit the collateral investment fees the Fund bears to an annual rate of 0.04%. Such money market fund shares will not be subject to a sales load, redemption fee, distribution fee or service fee.</div>
<div>Under the securities lending program, the Funds are
categorized into one of several specific asset classes. The determination of a Fund’s asset class category (fixed-income, domestic equity, international equity or fund-of-funds), each of which may be subject to a different fee arrangement, is
based on a methodology agreed to by the Trust and BTC.</div>
<div>Pursuant to the Securities Lending Agency Agreement:</div>
<div>(i) fixed-income funds, such as the Funds, retain 82% of
securities lending income (which excludes collateral investment fees), and (ii) this amount can never be less than 70% of the sum of securities lending income plus collateral investment fees.</div>
<div>In addition, commencing the business day following the date
that the aggregate securities lending income (which includes, for this purpose, collateral investment fees) earned across the Exchange-Traded Fund Complex (as defined under “Management<font></font>—<font></font>Trustees and Officers”) in a calendar year exceeds a specified threshold, each applicable fixed income fund, pursuant to the current Securities Lending Agency Agreement, will receive for the remainder of that
calendar year securities lending income as follows:</div> <div>(i)
85% of securities lending income (which excludes collateral investment fees) and (ii) this amount can never be less than 70% of the sum of securities lending income plus collateral investment fees.</div>
<div>Prior to January 1, 2021, fixed-income funds, such as the
Funds were subject to a different securities lending fee arrangement and were also subject to a different securities lending fee arrangement prior to January 1, 2020.</div>
<div>The services provided to the Funds by BTC in the most recent
fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 primarily included the following:</div>
<div>(1) selecting borrowers from an approved
list of borrowers and executing a securities lending agreement as agent on behalf of the Funds with each such borrower; </div>
<div>(2) negotiating the terms of securities
loans, including the amount of fees; </div>
<div>(3) directing the delivery of loaned
securities; </div> <div>(4) monitoring the daily
value of the loaned securities and directing the payment of additional collateral or the return of excess collateral, as necessary;</div> </div> <div type="Block">

with respect to any securities loan, using the collateral or the proceeds of the liquidation of collateral to purchase replacement securities of the same issue, type, class and series as that of the loaned securities; and </div>

indirectly in part from fees paid by the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products, these payments do not increase the price paid by investors for the purchase of shares of, or the cost of owning, the Funds, other iShares funds or

professionals and individual investors more knowledgeable about exchange-traded products, including the Funds and other iShares funds, or for other activities, such as participation in marketing activities and presentations, educational training
programs, conferences, the development of technology platforms and reporting systems (“Education Costs”). BFA Entities also make payments to Intermediaries for certain printing, publishing and mailing costs or materials relating to the
Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products (“Publishing Costs”). In addition, BFA Entities make payments to Intermediaries that make shares of the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products available to their
clients, develop new products that feature iShares or otherwise promote the Funds, other iShares funds and exchange-traded products. BFA Entities may also reimburse expenses or make payments from their own assets to Intermediaries or other persons
in consideration of services or other activities that the BFA Entities believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products. Payments of the type described above are
sometimes referred to as revenue-sharing payments.</div>
<div>Payments to an Intermediary may be significant to the
Intermediary, and amounts that Intermediaries pay to your salesperson or other investment professional may also be significant for your salesperson or other investment professional. Because an Intermediary may make decisions about which investment
options it will recommend or make available to its clients or what services to provide for various products based on payments it receives or is eligible to receive, such payments may create conflicts of interest between the Intermediary and its
clients and these financial incentives may cause the Intermediary to recommend the Funds, other iShares funds or exchange-traded products over other investments. The same conflicts of interest and financial incentives exist with respect to your
salesperson or other investment professional if he or she receives similar payments from his or her Intermediary firm.</div>
<div>In addition to the payments described above, BFA Entities have
developed proprietary tools, calculators and related interactive or digital content that is made available through the www.BlackRock.com website at no additional cost to Intermediaries. BlackRock may configure these tools and calculators and
localize the content for Intermediaries as part of its customary digital marketing support and promotion of the Funds, other iShares funds, exchange-traded products and BlackRock mutual funds.</div>
<div>As of March 1, 2013, BFA Entities have contractual
arrangements to make payments (in addition to payments for Education Costs or Publishing Costs) to one Intermediary, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC (“FBS”). Effective June 4, 2016, this relationship was expanded to include National
Financial Services, LLC (“NFS”), an affiliate of FBS. Pursuant to this special, long-term and significant arrangement (the “Marketing Program”), FBS, NFS and certain of their affiliates (collectively “Fidelity”)
have agreed, among other things, to actively promote iShares funds to customers, investment professionals and other intermediaries and in advertising campaigns as the preferred exchange-traded product, to offer certain iShares funds in certain
Fidelity platforms and investment programs, in some cases at a waived or reduced commission rate or ticket charge, and to provide marketing data to BFA Entities. BFA Entities have agreed to facilitate the Marketing Program by, among other things,
making certain payments to FBS and NFS for marketing and implementing certain brokerage and investment programs. Upon termination of the arrangement, the BFA Entities will make additional payments to FBS and/or NFS based upon a number of criteria,
including the overall success of the Marketing Program and the level of services provided by FBS and NFS during the wind-down period.</div>
<div>In addition, BFA Entities may enter into other contractual
arrangements with Intermediaries and certain other third parties that the BFA Entities believe may benefit the iShares business or facilitate investment in iShares funds. Such agreements may include payments by BFA Entities to such Intermediaries
and third parties for data collection and provision, technology support, platform enhancement, or co-marketing and cross-promotional efforts. Payments made pursuant to such arrangements may vary in any year and may be different for different
Intermediaries and third parties. In certain cases, the payments described in the preceding sentence may be subject to certain minimum payment levels. As of the date of this SAI, the Intermediaries and other third parties receiving one or more types
of the contractual payments described above include (in addition to FBS and NFS): BNY Mellon Performance &amp; Risk Analytics, LLC, Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Inc., Commonwealth Equity Services, LLC, Dorsey Wright and Associates, LLC, Edward D. Jones
&amp; Co., L.P., Envestnet Asset Management, Inc., FDx Advisors, Inc., LPL Financial LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC, Orion Portfolio Solutions, LLC, Pershing LLC, Raymond James Financial

BFA Entities make Education Costs and Publishing Costs payments to other Intermediaries that are not listed in the immediately preceding paragraph. BFA Entities may determine to make such payments based on any number of metrics. For example, BFA
Entities may make payments at year-end or other intervals in a fixed amount, an amount based upon an Intermediary’s services at defined levels or an amount based on the Intermediary’s net sales of one or more iShares funds in a year or
other period, any of which arrangements may include an agreed-upon minimum or maximum payment, or any combination of the foregoing. As of the date of this SAI, BFA anticipates that the payments paid by BFA Entities in connection with the Funds,
iShares funds and exchange-traded products in general will be immaterial to BFA Entities in the aggregate for the next year. <font>Please contact your salesperson or other investment professional for more information
regarding any such payments or financial incentives his or her Intermediary firm may receive. Any payments made, or financial incentives offered, by the BFA Entities to an Intermediary may create the incentive for the Intermediary to encourage
customers to buy shares of the Funds, other iShares funds or other exchange-traded products.</font></div>
<div>The Funds may participate in certain market maker incentive
programs of a national securities exchange in which an affiliate of the Funds would pay a fee to the exchange used for the purpose of incentivizing one or more market makers in the securities of a Fund to enhance the liquidity and quality of the
secondary market of securities of a Fund. The fee would then be credited by the exchange to one or more market makers that meet or exceed liquidity and market quality standards with respect to the securities of a Fund. Each market maker incentive
program is subject to approval from the SEC. Any such fee payments made to an exchange will be made by an affiliate of a Fund solely for the benefit of a Fund and will not be paid from any Fund assets. Other funds managed by BFA may also participate
in such programs.</div> <div>Determination of Net Asset

the last traded price on that Exchange prior to the time as of which the assets or liabilities are valued. However, under certain circumstances, other means of determining current market value may be used. If an equity security is traded on more
than one Exchange, the current market value of the security where it is primarily traded generally will be used. In the event that there are no sales involving an equity security held by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values such security, the
prior day’s price will be used, unless BlackRock determines that such prior day’s price no longer reflects the fair value of the security, in which case such asset would be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below).</font></div>
<div>Fixed-Income Investments.
<font>Fixed-income securities for which market quotations are readily available are generally valued using such securities’ current market value. A Fund values fixed-income portfolio securities using the last
available bid prices or current market quotations provided by dealers or prices (including evaluated prices) supplied by a Fund’s approved independent third-party pricing services, each in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. The pricing
services may use matrix pricing or valuation models that utilize certain inputs and assumptions to derive values, including transaction data (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>,
recent representative bids and offers), credit quality information, perceived market movements, news, and other relevant information and by other methods, which may include consideration of: yields or prices of securities of comparable quality,
coupon, maturity and type; indications as to values from dealers; general market conditions; and/or other factors and assumptions. Pricing services generally value fixed-income securities assuming orderly transactions of an institutional round lot
size, but a Fund may hold or transact in such securities in smaller, odd lot sizes. Odd lots may trade at lower prices than institutional round lots. The amortized cost method of valuation may be used with respect to debt obligations with 60 days or
less remaining to maturity unless such method does not represent fair value. Certain fixed-income investments, including asset-backed and mortgage-related securities, may be valued based on valuation models that consider the estimated cash flows of
each tranche of the issuer, establish a benchmark yield and develop an estimated tranche-specific spread to the benchmark yield based on the unique attributes of the tranche.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Options,
Futures, Swaps and Other Derivatives. <font>Exchange-traded equity options for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the mean of the last bid and ask prices as quoted on the Exchange or the board of
trade on which such options are traded. In the event that there is no mean price available for an exchange traded equity option held by a Fund on a day on which a Fund values such option, the last bid (long positions) or ask (short positions) price,
if available, will be used as the value of such option. If no bid or ask price is available on a day on which a Fund values such option, the prior day’s price will be used, unless BlackRock determines that such prior day’s price no
longer reflects the fair value of the option, in which case such option will be treated as a Fair Value Asset (as defined below). OTC derivatives may be valued using a mathematical model which may incorporate a number of market data factors.
Financial futures contracts and options thereon, which are traded on exchanges, are valued at their last sale price or settle price as of the close of such exchanges. Swap agreements and other derivatives are generally valued daily based upon
quotations from market makers or by a pricing service in accordance with the Valuation Procedures.</font></div>
<div>Underlying Funds. <font>Shares of
underlying open-end funds (including money market funds) are valued at NAV. Shares of underlying exchange-traded closed-end funds or other ETFs will be valued at their most recent closing price.</font></div>
<div>General Valuation Information.
<font>Prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services, broker-dealers or market makers to value a Fund’s securities and other assets and liabilities are based on information available at the time a
Fund values its assets and liabilities. In the event that a pricing service quotation is revised or updated subsequent to the day on which a Fund valued such security, the revised pricing service quotation generally will be applied prospectively.
Such determination will be made considering pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding the revision.</font></div>
<div>The price a Fund could receive upon the sale of any particular
portfolio investment may differ from a Fund’s valuation of the investment, particularly for assets that trade in thin or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair valuation methodology or a price provided by an independent pricing
service. As a result, the price received upon the sale of an investment may be less than the value ascribed by a Fund, and a Fund could realize a greater than expected loss or lesser than expected gain upon the sale of the investment. A Fund’s
ability to value its investment may also be impacted by technological issues and/or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers.</div>
<div>All cash, receivables and current payables are carried on a
Fund’s books at their fair value.</div> <div>In the event
that application of the methods of valuation discussed above result in a price for a security which is deemed not to be representative of the fair market value of such security, the security will be valued by, under the direction of or in accordance
with a method approved by the Fund’s Board as reflecting fair value. All other assets and liabilities (including securities for which market quotations are not readily available) held by a Fund (including restricted securities) are valued at
fair value as determined in good faith by the Board or the Valuation Committee (its delegate) pursuant to the Valuation Procedures. Any assets and liabilities which are denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the
prevailing market rates.</div> <div>Use of fair value prices and
certain current market valuations could result in a difference between the prices used to calculate a Fund’s NAV and the prices used in the Underlying Index, which, in turn, could result in a difference between a Fund’s performance and
the performance of the Underlying Index.</div> <div>Fair Value.<font> When market quotations are not readily available or are believed by BlackRock to be unreliable, a Fund’s investments are valued at fair value (“Fair Value Assets”). Fair Value Assets are valued by
BlackRock in accordance with the Valuation Procedures. BlackRock may reasonably conclude that a market quotation is not readily available or is unreliable if, among other things, a security or other asset or liability does not have a price source
due to its complete lack of trading, if BlackRock believes a market quotation from a broker-dealer or other source is unreliable (</font><font>e.g.</font><font>, where it
varies significantly from a recent trade, or no longer reflects the fair value of the security or other asset or liability subsequent to the most recent market quotation), or where the security or other asset or liability is only thinly traded or
due to the occurrence of a significant event subsequent to the most recent market quotation. For this purpose, a “significant event” is deemed to occur if BlackRock determines, in its reasonable business judgment, that an event has
occurred after the close of trading for an asset or liability but prior to or at the time of pricing a Fund’s assets or liabilities, is likely to cause a material change to the last exchange closing price or closing market price of one or more
assets or liabilities held by a Fund. On any day the NYSE is open and a foreign market or the primary exchange on which a foreign asset or liability is traded is closed, such asset or liability will be valued using the prior day’s price,
provided that BlackRock is not aware of any significant event or other information that would cause such price to no longer reflect the fair value of the asset or liability, in which case such asset or liability would be treated as a Fair Value
Asset.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>BlackRock,
with input from portfolio management, will submit its recommendations regarding the valuation and/or valuation methodologies for Fair Value Assets to the Valuation Committee. The Valuation Committee may accept, modify or reject any recommendations.
In addition, a Fund’s accounting agent periodically endeavors to confirm the prices it receives from all third-party pricing services, index providers and broker-dealers, and, with the assistance of BlackRock, to regularly evaluate the values
assigned to the securities and other assets and liabilities of a Fund. The pricing of all Fair Value Assets is subsequently reported to the Board or a committee thereof.</div>
<div>When determining the price for a Fair Value Asset, the
Valuation Committee will seek to determine the price that a Fund might reasonably expect to receive from the current sale of that asset or liability in an arm’s-length transaction on the date on which the asset or liability is being valued,
and does not seek to determine the price a Fund might reasonably expect to receive for selling an asset or liability at a later time or if it holds the asset or liability to maturity. Fair value determinations will be based upon all available
factors that the Valuation Committee deems relevant at the time of the determination, and may be based on analytical values determined by BlackRock using proprietary or third-party valuation models.</div>
<div>Fair value represents a good faith approximation of the value
of an asset or liability. When determining the fair value of an investment, one or more fair value methodologies may be used (depending on certain factors, including the asset type). For example, the investment may be initially priced based on the
original cost of the investment or, alternatively, using proprietary or third-party models that may rely upon one or more unobservable inputs. Prices of actual, executed or historical transactions in the relevant investment (or comparable
instruments) or, where appropriate, an appraisal by a third-party experienced in the valuation of similar instruments, may also be used as a basis for establishing the fair value of an investment.</div>
<div>The fair value of one or more assets or liabilities may not,
in retrospect, be the price at which those assets or liabilities could have been sold during the period in which the particular fair values were used in determining a Fund’s NAV. As a result, a Fund’s sale or redemption of its shares at
NAV, at a time when a holding or holdings are valued at fair value, may have the effect of diluting or increasing the economic interest of existing shareholders.</div>
<div>Each Fund’s annual audited financial statements, which
are prepared in accordance with US GAAP, follow the requirements for valuation set forth in Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” (“ASC
820”), which defines and establishes a framework for measuring fair value under US GAAP and expands financial statement disclosure requirements relating to fair value measurements.</div>
<div>Generally, ASC 820 and other accounting rules applicable to
funds and various assets in which they invest are evolving. Such changes may adversely affect a Fund. For example, the evolution of rules governing the determination of the fair market value of assets or liabilities, to the extent such rules become
more stringent, would tend to increase the cost and/or reduce the availability of third-party determinations of fair market value. This may in turn increase the costs associated with selling assets or affect their liquidity due to a Fund’s
inability to obtain a third-party determination of fair market value. The SEC recently adopted new Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, which will establish an updated regulatory framework for registered investment company valuation practices and may
impact a Fund’s valuation policies. A Fund will not be required to comply with the new rule until September 8, 2022.</div>
<div>Brokerage Transactions</div>
<div>Subject to policies established by the Board, BFA is primarily
responsible for the execution of a Fund’s portfolio transactions and the allocation of brokerage. BFA does not execute transactions through any particular broker or dealer, but seeks to obtain the best net results for the Funds, taking into
account such factors as price (including the applicable brokerage commission or dealer spread), size of order, difficulty of execution, operational facilities of the firm and the firm’s risk and skill in positioning blocks of securities. While
BFA generally seeks reasonable trade execution costs, a Fund does not necessarily pay the lowest spread or commission available, and payment of the lowest commission or spread is not necessarily consistent with obtaining the best price and execution
in particular transactions. Subject to applicable legal requirements, BFA may select a broker based partly upon brokerage or research services provided to BFA and its clients, including a Fund. In return for such services, BFA may cause a Fund to
pay a higher commission than other brokers would charge if BFA determines in good faith that the commission is reasonable in relation to the services provided.</div>
<div>In selecting brokers or dealers to execute portfolio
transactions, BFA seeks to obtain the best price and most favorable execution for a Fund and may take into account a variety of factors including: (i) the size, nature and character of the security</div> </div>

and the markets in which it is purchased or sold; (ii) the desired timing of the transaction; (iii) BFA’s knowledge of the expected commission rates and spreads currently available; (iv) the activity existing and expected in the market for the
particular security or instrument, including any anticipated execution difficulties; (v) the full range of brokerage services provided; (vi) the broker’s or dealer’s capital; (vii) the quality of research and research services provided;
(viii) the reasonableness of the commission, dealer spread or its equivalent for the specific transaction; and (ix) BFA’s knowledge of any actual or apparent operational problems of a broker or dealer. Brokers may also be selected because of
their ability to handle special or difficult executions, such as may be involved in large block trades, thinly traded securities, or other circumstances.</div>
<div>Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act (“Section 28(e)”)
permits a U.S. investment adviser, under certain circumstances, to cause an account to pay a broker or dealer a commission for effecting a transaction in securities that exceeds the amount another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting
the same transaction in recognition of the value of brokerage and research services provided by that broker or dealer. This includes commissions paid on riskless principal transactions in securities under certain conditions.</div>
<div>From time to time, a Fund may purchase new issues of
securities in a fixed price offering. In these situations, the broker may be a member of the selling group that will, in addition to selling securities, provide BFA with research services. FINRA has adopted rules expressly permitting these types of
arrangements under certain circumstances. Generally, the broker will provide research “credits” in these situations at a rate that is higher than that available for typical secondary market transactions. These arrangements may not fall
within the safe harbor of Section 28(e).</div> <div>OTC issues,
including most fixed-income securities such as corporate debt and U.S. Government securities, are normally traded on a “net” basis without a stated commission, through dealers acting for their own account and not as brokers. The Funds
will primarily engage in transactions with these dealers or deal directly with the issuer unless a better price or execution could be obtained by using a broker. Prices paid to a dealer with respect to both foreign and domestic securities will
generally include a “spread,” which is the difference between the prices at which the dealer is willing to purchase and sell the specific security at the time, and includes the dealer’s normal profit.</div>
<div>Under the 1940 Act, persons affiliated with a Fund and persons
who are affiliated with such affiliated persons are prohibited from dealing with the Fund as principal in the purchase and sale of securities unless a permissive order allowing such transactions is obtained from the SEC. Since transactions in the
OTC market usually involve transactions with the dealers acting as principal for their own accounts, the Funds will not deal with affiliated persons and affiliated persons of such affiliated persons in connection with such transactions. The Funds
will not purchase securities during the existence of any underwriting or selling group relating to such securities of which BFA, BRIL or any affiliated person (as defined in the 1940 Act) thereof is a member except pursuant to procedures adopted by
the Board in accordance with Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 Act.</div>
<div>Purchases of money market instruments by the Funds are made
from dealers, underwriters and issuers. The Funds do not currently expect to incur any brokerage commission expense on such transactions because money market instruments are generally traded on a “net” basis with dealers acting as
principal for their own accounts without a stated commission. The price of the security, however, usually includes a profit to the dealer.</div>
<div>BFA may, from time to time, effect trades on behalf of and for
the account of the Funds with brokers or dealers that are affiliated with BFA, in conformity with Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act and SEC rules and regulations. Under these provisions, any commissions paid to affiliated brokers or dealers must be
reasonable and fair compared to the commissions charged by other brokers or dealers in comparable transactions.</div>
<div>Securities purchased in underwritten offerings include a fixed
amount of compensation to the underwriter, generally referred to as the underwriter’s concession or discount. When securities are purchased or sold directly from or to an issuer, no commissions or discounts are paid.</div>
<div>Investment decisions for the Funds and for other investment
accounts managed by BFA and the other Affiliates are made independently of each other in light of differing conditions. A variety of factors will be considered in making investment allocations. These factors include: (i) investment objectives or
strategies for particular accounts, including sector, industry, country or region and capitalization weightings; (ii) tax considerations of an account; (iii) risk or investment concentration parameters for an account; (iv) supply or demand for a
security at a given price level; (v) size of available investment; (vi) cash availability and liquidity requirements for accounts; (vii) regulatory restrictions; (viii) minimum investment size of an</div> </div>

size of account; and (x) such other factors as may be approved by BlackRock’s general counsel. Moreover, investments may not be allocated to one client account over another based on any of the following considerations: (i) to favor one client
account at the expense of another; (ii) to generate higher fees paid by one client account over another or to produce greater performance compensation to BlackRock; (iii) to develop or enhance a relationship with a client or prospective client; (iv)
to compensate a client for past services or benefits rendered to BlackRock or to induce future services or benefits to be rendered to BlackRock; or (v) to manage or equalize investment performance among different client accounts. BFA and the other
Affiliates may deal, trade and invest for their own respective accounts in the types of securities in which the Funds may invest.</div>
<div>Initial public offerings (“IPOs”) of securities
may be over-subscribed and subsequently trade at a premium in the secondary market. When BFA is given an opportunity to invest in such an initial offering or “new” or “hot” issue, the supply of securities available for client
accounts is often less than the amount of securities the accounts would otherwise take. In order to allocate these investments fairly and equitably among client accounts over time, each portfolio manager or a member of his or her respective
investment team will indicate to BFA’s trading desk their level of interest in a particular offering with respect to eligible clients’ accounts for which that team is responsible. IPOs of U.S. equity securities will be identified as
eligible for particular client accounts that are managed by portfolio teams who have indicated interest in the offering based on market capitalization of the issuer of the security and the investment mandate of the client account and in the case of
international equity securities, the country where the offering is taking place and the investment mandate of the client account. Generally, shares received during the IPO will be allocated among participating client accounts within each investment
mandate on a <font>pro rata</font> basis. This <font>pro rata</font> allocation may result in a Fund receiving less of a particular security than if pro-rating had not occurred. All allocations
of securities will be subject, where relevant, to share minimums established for accounts and compliance constraints. In situations where supply is too limited to be allocated among all accounts for which the investment is eligible, portfolio
managers may rotate such investment opportunities among one or more accounts so long as the rotation system provides for fair access for all client accounts over time. Other allocation methodologies that are considered by BFA to be fair and
equitable to clients may be used as well.</div> <div>Because
different accounts may have differing investment objectives and policies, BFA may buy and sell the same securities at the same time for different clients based on the particular investment objective, guidelines and strategies of those accounts. For
example, BFA may decide that it may be entirely appropriate for a growth fund to sell a security at the same time a value fund is buying that security. To the extent that transactions on behalf of more than one client of BFA or the other Affiliates
during the same period increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, there may be an adverse effect on price. For example, sales of a security by BlackRock on behalf of one or more of its clients may
decrease the market price of such security, adversely impacting other BlackRock clients that still hold the security. If purchases or sales of securities arise for consideration at or about the same time that would involve the Funds or other clients
or funds for which BFA or another Affiliate act as investment manager, transactions in such securities will be made, insofar as feasible, for the respective funds and clients in a manner deemed equitable to all.</div>
<div>In certain instances, BFA may find it efficient for purposes
of seeking to obtain best execution, to aggregate or “bunch” certain contemporaneous purchases or sale orders of its advisory accounts and advisory accounts of affiliates. In general, all contemporaneous trades for client accounts under
management by the same portfolio manager or investment team will be bunched in a single order if the trader believes the bunched trade would provide each client with an opportunity to achieve a more favorable execution at a potentially lower
execution cost. The costs associated with a bunched order will be shared <font>pro rata</font> among the clients in the bunched order. Generally, if an order for a particular portfolio manager or management team is filled
at several different prices through multiple trades, all accounts participating in the order will receive the average price (except in the case of certain international markets where average pricing is not permitted). While in some cases this
practice could have a detrimental effect upon the price or value of the security as far as the Funds are concerned, in other cases it could be beneficial to the Funds. Transactions effected by BFA or the other Affiliates on behalf of more than one
of its clients during the same period may increase the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold, causing an adverse effect on price. The trader will give the bunched order to the broker-dealer that the trader has
identified as being able to provide the best execution of the order. Orders for purchase or sale of securities will be placed within a reasonable amount of time of the order receipt and bunched orders will be kept bunched only long enough to execute
the order.</div> <div>The table below sets forth the brokerage
commissions paid by each Fund for the fiscal years noted. Any differences in brokerage commissions paid by a Fund from year to year are principally due to increases or decreases in that Fund’s assets over those periods or the
magnitude of changes to the components of a Fund's Underlying Index:</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Portfolio turnover may vary from year to year, as well as
within a year. Certain Funds may use TBA transactions, which are expected to cause a higher portfolio turnover rate and may cause significant variation in portfolio turnover rate because TBA positions are rolled every month. High turnover rates
may result in comparatively greater brokerage expenses. While each Fund's portfolio turnover rates are generally expected to be low, the portfolio turnover rate for that portion of the iShares Core 5-10 Year USD Bond ETF's, iShares Core U.S.

<div>Additional Information Concerning the Trust</div>
<div>Shares.<font>  The Trust
currently consists of more than 305 separate investment series or portfolios called funds. The Trust issues shares of beneficial interests in the funds with no par value. The Board may designate additional iShares funds.</font></div>
<div>Each share issued by a fund has a <font>pro rata</font> interest in the assets of that fund. Shares have no preemptive, exchange, subscription or conversion rights and are freely transferable. Each share is entitled to participate equally in dividends and
distributions declared by the Board with respect to the relevant fund, and in the net distributable assets of such fund on liquidation.</div>
<div>Each share has one vote with respect to matters upon which the
shareholder is entitled to vote. In any matter submitted to shareholders for a vote, each fund shall hold a separate vote, provided that shareholders of all affected funds will vote together when: (i) required by the 1940 Act, or (ii) the Trustees
determine that the matter affects the interests of more than one fund.</div>
<div>Under Delaware law, the Trust is not required to hold an
annual meeting of shareholders unless required to do so under the 1940 Act. The policy of the Trust is not to hold an annual meeting of shareholders unless required to do so under the 1940 Act. All shares (regardless of the fund) have noncumulative
voting rights in the election of members of the Board. Under Delaware law, Trustees of the Trust may be removed by vote of the shareholders.</div>
<div>Following the creation of the initial Creation Unit(s) of
shares of a fund and immediately prior to the commencement of trading in such fund’s shares, a holder of shares may be a “control person” of the fund, as defined in Rule 0-1 under the 1940 Act. A fund cannot predict the length of
time for which one or more shareholders may remain a control person of the fund.</div>
<div>Shareholders may make inquiries by writing to iShares Trust,
c/o BlackRock Investments, LLC, 1 University Square Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540.</div>
<div>Absent an applicable exemption or other relief from the SEC or
its staff, beneficial owners of more than 5% of the shares of a fund may be subject to the reporting provisions of Section 13 of the 1934 Act and the SEC’s rules promulgated thereunder. In addition, absent an applicable exemption or other
relief from the SEC or its staff, officers and trustees of a fund and beneficial owners of 10% of the shares of a fund (“Insiders”) may be subject to the insider reporting, short-swing profit and short sale provisions of Section 16 of
the 1934 Act and the SEC’s rules promulgated thereunder. Beneficial owners and Insiders should consult with their own legal counsel concerning their obligations under Sections 13 and 16 of the 1934 Act and existing guidance provided by the SEC
staff.</div> <div>In accordance with the Trust's current Agreement
and Declaration of Trust (the “Declaration of Trust”), the Board may, without shareholder approval (unless such shareholder approval is required by the Declaration of Trust or applicable law, including the 1940 Act), authorize certain
funds to merge, reorganize, consolidate, sell all or substantially all of their assets, or take other similar actions with, to or into another fund.  The Trust or a fund may be terminated by a majority vote of the Board, subject to the
affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders of the Trust or such fund entitled to vote on termination; however, in certain circumstances described in the Declaration of Trust, only a majority vote of the Board is required. Although the shares
are not automatically redeemable upon the occurrence of any specific event, the Declaration of Trust provides that the Board will have the unrestricted power to alter the number of shares in a Creation Unit. Therefore, in the event of a termination
of the Trust or a fund, the Board, in its sole discretion, could determine to permit the shares to be redeemable in aggregations smaller than Creation Units or to be individually redeemable. In such circumstance, the Trust or a fund may make
redemptions in-kind, for cash or for a combination of cash or securities. Further, in the event of a termination of the Trust or a fund, the Trust or a fund might elect to pay cash redemptions to all shareholders, with an in-kind election for
shareholders owning in excess of a certain stated minimum amount.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

Securities Depository for Shares of the Funds. <font> Shares of each Fund are represented by securities registered in the name of DTC or its nominee and deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC.</font></div>
<div>DTC was created in 1973 to enable electronic movement of
securities between its participants (“DTC Participants”), and NSCC was established in 1976 to provide a single settlement system for securities clearing and to serve as central counterparty for securities trades among DTC Participants.
In 1999, DTC and NSCC were consolidated within The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”) and became wholly-owned subsidiaries of DTCC. The common stock of DTCC is owned by the DTC Participants, but NYSE and FINRA, through
subsidiaries, hold preferred shares in DTCC that provide them with the right to elect one member each to the DTCC board of directors. Access to the DTC system is available to entities, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies, that clear
through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”).</div>
<div>Beneficial ownership of shares is limited to DTC Participants,
Indirect Participants and persons holding interests through DTC Participants and Indirect Participants. Ownership of beneficial interests in shares (owners of such beneficial interests are referred to herein as “Beneficial Owners”) is
shown on, and the transfer of ownership is effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to DTC Participants) and on the records of DTC Participants (with respect to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners that are not DTC
Participants). Beneficial Owners will receive from or through the DTC Participant a written confirmation relating to their purchase of shares. The laws of some jurisdictions may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of
such securities in definitive form. Such laws may impair the ability of certain investors to acquire beneficial interests in shares of the Fund.</div>
<div>Conveyance of all notices, statements and other communications
to Beneficial Owners is effected as follows. Pursuant to the Depositary Agreement between the Trust and DTC, DTC is required to make available to the Trust upon request and for a fee to be charged to the Trust a listing of the shares of each Fund
held by each DTC Participant. The Trust shall inquire of each such DTC Participant as to the number of Beneficial Owners holding shares, directly or indirectly, through such DTC Participant. The Trust shall provide each such DTC Participant with
copies of such notice, statement or other communication, in such form, number and at such place as such DTC Participant may reasonably request, in order that such notice, statement or communication may be transmitted by such DTC Participant,
directly or indirectly, to such Beneficial Owners. In addition, the Trust shall pay to each such DTC Participant a fair and reasonable amount as reimbursement for the expenses attendant to such transmittal, all subject to applicable statutory and
regulatory requirements.</div> <div>Share distributions shall be
made to DTC or its nominee, Cede &amp; Co., as the registered holder of all shares of the Trust. DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any such distributions, shall credit immediately DTC Participants’ accounts with payments in amounts
proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in shares of each Fund as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. Payments by DTC Participants to Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners of shares held through such DTC Participants
will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in a “street name,” and will be the responsibility of such DTC
Participants.</div> <div>The Trust has no responsibility or
liability for any aspect of the records relating to or notices to Beneficial Owners, or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in such shares, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial
ownership interests, or for any other aspect of the relationship between DTC and the DTC Participants or the relationship between such DTC Participants and the Indirect Participants and Beneficial Owners owning through such DTC Participants. DTC may
decide to discontinue providing its service with respect to shares of the Trust at any time by giving reasonable notice to the Trust and discharging its responsibilities with respect thereto under applicable law. Under such circumstances, the Trust
shall take action to find a replacement for DTC to perform its functions at a comparable cost.</div>
<div>Distribution of Shares.
<font> In connection with each Fund's launch, each Fund was seeded through the sale of one or more Creation Units by each Fund to one or more initial investors. Initial investors participating in the seeding may be
Authorized Participants, a lead market maker or other third party investor or an affiliate of each Fund or each Fund’s adviser. Each such initial investor may sell some or all of the shares underlying the Creation Unit(s) held by them pursuant
to the registration statement for each Fund (each, a “Selling Shareholder”), which shares have been registered to permit the resale from time to time after purchase. Each Fund will not receive any of the proceeds from the resale by the
Selling Shareholders of these shares.</font></div> <div>Selling

reserves the right to increase or decrease the number of a Fund’s shares that constitute a Creation Unit. The Board reserves the right to declare a split or a consolidation in the number of shares outstanding of any Fund, and to make a
corresponding change in the number of shares constituting a Creation Unit, in the event that the per share price in the secondary market rises (or declines) to an amount that falls outside the range deemed desirable by the Board.</div>
<div>A “Business Day” with respect to each Fund is any
day the Fund is open for business, including any day when it satisfies redemption requests as required by Section 22(e) of the 1940 Act. Each Fund is open for business any day on which the Listing Exchange on which the Fund is listed for trading is
open for business. As of the date of this SAI, each Listing Exchange observes the following holidays, as observed: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Presidents' Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day
and Christmas Day.</div> <div>Fund Deposit.<font>  The consideration for purchase of Creation Units of a Fund, generally consists of the Deposit Securities and the Cash Component computed as described below. Together, the Deposit Securities and the Cash Component
constitute the “Fund Deposit,” which, when combined with a Fund’s portfolio securities, is designed to generate performance that has a collective investment profile similar to that of the Underlying Index. The Fund Deposit
represents the minimum initial and subsequent investment amount for a Creation Unit of any Fund. Such Fund Deposit is applicable, subject to any adjustments as described below, to purchases of Creation Units of shares of a given Fund until such time
as the next-announced Fund Deposit is made available.</font></div>
<div>The “Cash Component” is an amount equal to the
difference between the NAV of the shares (per Creation Unit) and the “Deposit Amount,” which is an amount equal to the market value of the Deposit Securities, and serves to compensate for any differences between the NAV per Creation Unit
and the Deposit Amount. Payment of any stamp duty or other similar fees and expenses payable upon transfer of beneficial ownership of the Deposit Securities are the sole responsibility of the Authorized Participant purchasing a Creation Unit.</div>
<div>The iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF, iShares ESG Advanced
Total USD Bond Market ETF and iShares MBS ETF (the “Partial Cash Funds”) generally offer Creation Units partially for cash, but may, in certain circumstances, offer Creation Units solely for cash or solely in-kind. The iShares California
Muni Bond ETF and iShares New York Muni Bond ETF generally offer Creation Units for cash, but may offer Creation Units partially for cash or solely in-kind. Please see the <font>Cash Purchase Method</font> section below
and the following discussion summarizing the Deposit Security method for further information on purchasing Creation Units of the Funds.</div>
<div>The identity and number or par value of the Deposit Securities
change pursuant to changes in the composition of a Fund's portfolio and as rebalancing adjustments and corporate action events are reflected from time to time by BFA with a view to the investment objective of the Fund. The composition of the Deposit
Securities may also change in response to adjustments to the weighting or composition of the component securities constituting the relevant Underlying Index.</div>
<div>The Trust may require the substitution of an amount of cash (<font>i.e.</font>, a “cash in lieu” amount) to replace any Deposit Security of the Partial Cash Funds that is a TBA transaction or an interest in a mortgage pass-through security. The amount of cash contributed will
be equivalent to the price of the TBA transaction or mortgage pass-through security interest listed as a Deposit Security. A transaction fee may be charged on the cash amount contributed in lieu of the TBA transaction or mortgage pass-through
security.</div> <div>The Fund Deposit may also be modified to
minimize the Cash Component by redistributing the cash to the Deposit Securities portion of the Fund Deposit through “systematic rounding.” The rounding methodology “rounds up” position sizes of securities in the Deposit
Securities (which in turn reduces the cash portion). However, the methodology limits the maximum allowed percentage change in weight and share quantity of any given security in the Fund Deposit.</div>
<div>Fund Deposits may also be modified to position a fund towards
a forward index rebalance to reflect revisions that account for index additions, deletions, and re-weights.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>The Trust
may, in its sole discretion, substitute a “cash in lieu” amount to be added to the Cash Component to replace any Deposit Security in certain circumstances, including: (i) when instruments are not available in sufficient quantity for
delivery; (ii) when instruments are not eligible for transfer through DTC or the clearing process (as discussed below); (iii) when instruments that the Authorized Participant (or an investor on whose behalf the Authorized Participant is acting) are
not able to be traded due to a trading restriction; (iv) when delivery of the Deposit Security by the Authorized Participant (or by an investor on whose behalf the Authorized Participant is acting) would be restricted under applicable securities or
other local laws; (v) in connection with distribution payments to be made by a Fund; or (vi) in certain other situations.</div>
<div>Cash Purchase Method.
<font> Although the Trust does not generally permit partial or full cash purchases of Creation Units of its funds, when partial or full cash purchases of Creation Units are available or specified for a Fund (Creation
Units of the Partial Cash Funds are generally offered partially for cash and all or a substantial portion of the Deposit Securities of iShares California Muni Bond ETF, iShares National Muni Bond ETF, iShares New York Muni Bond ETF and iShares
Short-Term National Muni Bond ETF may be substituted for cash), they will be effected in essentially the same manner as in-kind purchases thereof. In the case of a partial or full cash purchase, the Authorized Participant must pay the cash
equivalent of the Deposit Securities it would otherwise be required to provide through an in-kind purchase, plus the same Cash Component required to be paid by an in-kind purchaser.</font></div>
<div>Procedures for Creation of Creation Units.<font>  To be eligible to place orders with the Distributor and to create a Creation Unit of the Funds, an entity must be: (i) a “Participating Party,”</font><font> </font><font>i.e</font><font>., a broker-dealer or other participant in the clearing process through the Continuous Net Settlement System of the NSCC (the “Clearing Process”),
a clearing agency that is registered with the SEC, or (ii) a DTC Participant, and must have executed an agreement with the Distributor, with respect to creations and redemptions of Creation Units (“Authorized Participant Agreement”)
(discussed below). A member or participant of a clearing agency registered with the SEC which has a written agreement with the Funds or one of their service providers that allows such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and
redemption of Creation Units is referred to as an “Authorized Participant.” All shares of the Funds, however created, will be entered on the records of DTC in the name of Cede &amp; Co. for the account of a DTC Participant.</font></div>
<div>Role of the Authorized Participant.<font>  Creation Units may be purchased only by or through a member or participant of a clearing agency registered with the SEC, which has a written agreement with the Funds or one of their service providers that allows
such member or participant to place orders for the purchase and redemption of Creation Units. Such Authorized Participant will agree, pursuant to the terms of such Authorized Participant Agreement and on behalf of itself or any investor on whose
behalf it will act, to certain conditions, including that such Authorized Participant will make available in advance of each purchase of shares an amount of cash sufficient to pay the Cash Component, once the NAV of a Creation Unit is next
determined after receipt of the purchase order in proper form, together with the transaction fees described below. An Authorized Participant, acting on behalf of an investor, may require the investor to enter into an agreement with such Authorized
Participant with respect to certain matters, including payment of the Cash Component. Investors who are not Authorized Participants must make appropriate arrangements with an Authorized Participant. Investors should be aware that their particular
broker may not be a DTC Participant or may not have executed an Authorized Participant Agreement and that orders to purchase Creation Units may have to be placed by the investor's broker through an Authorized Participant. As a result, purchase
orders placed through an Authorized Participant may result in additional charges to such investor. The Trust does not expect to enter into an Authorized Participant Agreement with more than a small number of DTC Participants. A list of current
Authorized Participants may be obtained from the Distributor. The Distributor has adopted guidelines regarding Authorized Participants’ transactions in Creation Units that are made available to all Authorized Participants. These guidelines set
forth the processes and standards for Authorized Participants to transact with the Distributor and its agents in connection with creation and redemption transactions. In addition, the Distributor may be appointed as the proxy of the Authorized
Participant and may be granted a power of attorney under its Authorized Participant Agreement.</font></div>
<div>Placement of Creation Orders.<font>
 Fund Deposits must be delivered through the Federal Reserve System (for cash and U.S. government securities), through DTC (for corporate and municipal securities) or through a central depository account, such as with Euroclear or DTC,
maintained by State Street or a sub-custodian (a “Central Depository Account”). Any portion of a Fund Deposit that may not be delivered through the Fed or DTC must be delivered through a Central Depository Account. The Fund Deposit
transfers made through DTC must be ordered by the DTC Participant in a timely fashion so as to ensure the delivery of the requisite number of Deposit Securities through DTC to the account of the Funds generally before 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the
Settlement Date. Fund Deposit transfers made through the Fed must be deposited by the participant institution in a timely fashion so as to ensure the delivery of the requisite number or amount of Deposit Securities or cash through the Fed to the
account of the Fund generally before 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. Fund Deposit</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

Central Depository Account must be completed pursuant to the requirements established by the custodian or sub-custodian for such Central Depository Account generally before 2:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. The “Settlement
Date” for all funds is generally the second business day after the Transmittal Date. All questions as to the number of Deposit Securities to be delivered, and the validity, form and eligibility (including time of receipt) for the deposit of
any tendered securities, will be determined by the Trust, whose determination shall be final and binding. The amount of cash equal to the Cash Component must be transferred directly to State Street through the Federal Reserve Bank wire transfer
system in a timely manner so as to be received by State Street generally before 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date. If the Cash Component and the Deposit Securities are not received by 3:00 p.m., Eastern time on the Settlement Date, the
creation order may be canceled. Upon written notice to the Distributor, such canceled order may be resubmitted the following Business Day using a Fund Deposit as newly constituted to reflect the then current NAV of the Funds. The delivery of
Creation Units so created generally will occur no later than the second Business Day following the day on which the purchase order is deemed received by the Distributor, provided that the relevant Fund Deposit has been received by the Funds prior to
such time.</div> <div>Purchase Orders.<font>   To initiate an order for a Creation Unit, an Authorized Participant must submit to the Distributor or its agent an irrevocable order to purchase shares of a Fund (except for the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond
ETF and iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF), in proper form, generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day to receive that day’s NAV. For the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF and iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF, shares of a
Fund are sold or redeemed only in Creation Units at a price based on the Fund’s NAV next determined, on any business day, of an order tendered to, and received by, the Distributor or its agent in proper form. Generally, an order will be
implemented as of the next determined NAV, as described in the handbook for Authorized Participants. The Distributor or its agent will notify BFA and the custodian of such order. The custodian will then provide such information to any appropriate
sub-custodian. Procedures and requirements governing the delivery of the Fund Deposit are set forth in the procedures handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time to time. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are
responsible for making arrangements for a creation request to be made through an Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current Authorized Participants upon request. Those placing orders to purchase Creation
Units through an Authorized Participant should allow sufficient time to permit proper submission of the purchase order to the Distributor or its agent by the Cutoff Time (as defined below) on such Business Day.</font></div>
<div>The Authorized Participant must also make available on or
before the contractual settlement date, by means satisfactory to the Funds, immediately available or same day funds estimated by the Funds to be sufficient to pay the Cash Component next determined after acceptance of the purchase order, together
with the applicable purchase transaction fees. Those placing orders should ascertain the applicable deadline for cash transfers by contacting the operations department of the broker or depositary institution effectuating the transfer of the Cash
Component. This deadline is likely to be significantly earlier than the Cutoff Time of the Funds. Investors should be aware that an Authorized Participant may require orders for purchases of shares placed with it to be in the particular form
required by the individual Authorized Participant.</div> <div>The
Authorized Participant is responsible for any and all expenses and costs incurred by a Fund, including any applicable cash amounts, in connection with any purchase order.</div>
<div>Timing of Submission of Purchase Orders.<font>  An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable order to purchase shares of a Fund (except for the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF and iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF) generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern
time on any Business Day in order to receive that day's NAV. For the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF and iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF, shares of a Fund are sold or redeemed only in Creation Units at a price based on the Fund’s NAV next
determined, on any business day, of an order tendered to, and received by, the Distributor or its agent in proper form. Generally, an order will be implemented as of the next determined NAV, as described in the handbook for Authorized Participants.
Creation Orders must be transmitted by an Authorized Participant in the form required by the Funds to the Distributor or its agent pursuant to procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Economic or market disruptions or changes,
or telephone or other communication failure, may impede the ability to reach the Distributor or its agent or an Authorized Participant. Each Fund's deadline specified above for the submission of purchase orders is referred to as that Fund's
“Cutoff Time.” The Distributor or its agent, in their discretion, may permit the submission of such orders and requests by or through an Authorized Participant at any time (including on days on which the Listing Exchange is not open for
business) via communication through the facilities of the Distributor's or its agent's proprietary website maintained for this purpose. Purchase orders and redemption requests, if accepted by the Trust, will be processed based on the NAV next
determined after such acceptance in accordance with a Fund's Cutoff Times as provided in the Authorized Participant Agreement and disclosed in this SAI.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

Orders for Creation Units.<font>   Subject to the conditions that (i) an irrevocable purchase order has been submitted by the Authorized Participant (either on its own or another investor's behalf) and (ii)
arrangements satisfactory to the Funds are in place for payment of the Cash Component and any other cash amounts which may be due, the Funds will accept the order, subject to each Fund's right (and the right of the Distributor and BFA) to reject any
order until acceptance, as set forth below.</font></div> <div>Once
a Fund has accepted an order, upon the next determination of the NAV of the shares, the Fund will confirm the issuance of a Creation Unit, against receipt of payment, at such NAV. The Distributor or its agent will then transmit a confirmation of
acceptance to the Authorized Participant that placed the order.</div>
<div>Each Fund reserves the absolute right to reject or revoke a
creation order transmitted to it by the Distributor or its agent if (i) the order is not in proper form; (ii) the investor(s), upon obtaining the shares ordered, would own 80% or more of the currently outstanding shares of the Fund; (iii) the
Deposit Securities delivered do not conform to the identity and number of shares specified, as described above; (iv) acceptance of the Deposit Securities would have certain adverse tax consequences to the Fund; (v) acceptance of the Fund Deposit
would, in the opinion of counsel, be unlawful; (vi) acceptance of the Fund Deposit would, in the discretion of the Fund or BFA, have an adverse effect on the Fund or the rights of beneficial owners; or (vii) circumstances outside the control of the
Fund, the Distributor or its agent and BFA make it impracticable to process purchase orders. The Distributor or its agent shall notify a prospective purchaser of a Creation Unit and/or the Authorized Participant acting on behalf of such purchaser of
its rejection of such order. The Funds, State Street, the sub-custodian and the Distributor or its agent are under no duty, however, to give notification of any defects or irregularities in the delivery of Fund Deposits nor shall any of them incur
any liability for failure to give such notification.</div>
<div>Issuance of a Creation Unit.<font>
  Except as provided herein, a Creation Unit will not be issued until the transfer of good title to the applicable Fund of the Deposit Securities and the payment of the Cash Component have been completed. When the sub-custodian has confirmed to
the custodian that the securities included in the Fund Deposit (or the cash value thereof) have been delivered to the account of the relevant sub-custodian or sub-custodians, the Distributor or its agent and BFA shall be notified of such delivery
and the applicable Fund will issue and cause the delivery of the Creation Unit. Creation Units are generally issued on a “T+2 basis”
(</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, two Business Days after trade date) (except for the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF and iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF). Each Fund
reserves the right to settle Creation Unit transactions on a different basis, including a shorter settlement period, if necessary or appropriate under the circumstances and compliant with applicable law. For the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF
and iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF, for creation orders tendered before 12:00 p.m., Eastern time, creation units are generally issued on a “T+0 basis” (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, on trade date) and all other orders for creation units are generally settled on a “T+1 basis”.</font></div>
<div>To the extent contemplated by an Authorized Participant
Agreement with the Distributor, each Fund will issue Creation Units to such Authorized Participant, notwithstanding the fact that the corresponding Fund Deposits have not been received in part or in whole, in reliance on the undertaking of the
Authorized Participant to deliver the missing Deposit Securities as soon as possible, which undertaking shall be secured by such Authorized Participant's delivery and maintenance of collateral as set forth in the handbook for Authorized
Participants. The Trust may use such collateral at any time to buy Deposit Securities for the Funds. Such collateral must be delivered no later than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the contractual settlement date. Information
concerning the Funds' current procedures for collateralization of missing Deposit Securities is available from the Distributor or its agent. The Authorized Participant Agreement will permit the Funds to buy the missing Deposit Securities at any time
and will subject the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the cost to the Funds of purchasing such securities and the collateral including, without limitation, liability for related brokerage, borrowings and other
charges.</div> <div>In certain cases, Authorized Participants may
create and redeem Creation Units on the same trade date and in these instances, the Funds reserve the right to settle these transactions on a net basis or require a representation from the Authorized Participants that the creation and redemption
transactions are for separate beneficial owners. All questions as to the number of shares of each security in the Deposit Securities and the validity, form, eligibility and acceptance for deposit of any securities to be delivered shall be determined
by each Fund and the Fund's determination shall be final and binding.</div>
<div>Costs Associated with Creation Transactions.<font>   A standard creation transaction fee is imposed to offset the transfer and other transaction costs associated with the issuance of Creation Units. The standard creation transaction fee is charged to the Authorized
Participant on the day such Authorized Participant creates a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the number of Creation Units purchased by the Authorized Participant on the applicable Business Day. If a purchase consists</font></div> </div>

<div>Redemption of Creation Units.
<font> Shares of a Fund may be redeemed by Authorized Participants only in Creation Units at their NAV next determined after receipt of a redemption request in proper form by the Distributor or its agent and only on
a Business Day. The Funds will not redeem shares in amounts less than Creation Units. There can be no assurance, however, that there will be sufficient liquidity in the secondary market at any time to permit assembly of a Creation Unit. Investors
should expect to incur brokerage and other costs in connection with assembling a sufficient number of shares to constitute a Creation Unit that could be redeemed by an Authorized Participant. Beneficial owners also may sell shares in the
secondary market.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>The Partial
Cash Funds generally redeem Creation Units partially for cash. However, the Funds reserve the right to distribute securities and other portfolio instruments in-kind as payment for Creation Units being redeemed. Please see the <font>Cash Redemption Method</font> section below and the following discussion summarizing the in-kind method for further information on redeeming Creation Units of the Funds.</div>
<div>The designated portfolio of securities (including any portion
of such securities for which cash may be substituted) that will be applicable (subject to possible amendment or correction) to redemption requests received in proper form (as defined below) on that day (“Fund Securities” or
“Redemption Basket”), and an amount of cash (the “Cash Amount,” as described below) (each subject to possible amendment or correction) are applicable, in order to effect redemptions of Creation Units of a Fund until such time
as the next announced composition of the Fund Securities and Cash Amount is made available. Fund Securities received on redemption may not be identical to Deposit Securities that are applicable to creations of Creation Units. Procedures and
requirements governing redemption transactions are set forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants and may change from time to time.</div>
<div>Unless cash redemptions are available or specified for a Fund,
the redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit generally consist of Fund Securities, plus the Cash Amount, which is an amount equal to the difference between the NAV of the shares being redeemed, as next determined after the receipt of a redemption
request in proper form, and the value of Fund Securities, less a redemption transaction fee (as described below).</div>
<div>The Trust may, in its sole discretion, substitute a
“cash in lieu” amount to replace any Fund Security in certain circumstances, including: (i) when the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant (or to an investor on whose behalf the Authorized Participant is acting) would
be restricted under applicable securities or other local laws or due to a trading restriction; (ii) when the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in the disposition of the Fund Security by the Authorized Participant
due to restrictions under applicable securities or other local laws; (iii) when the delivery of a Fund Security to the Authorized Participant would result in unfavorable tax treatment; (iv) when a Fund Security cannot be settled or otherwise
delivered in time to facilitate an in-kind redemption; or (v) in certain other situations. The amount of cash paid out in such cases will be equivalent to the value of the substituted security listed as a Fund Security. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Trust may, in its sole discretion, substitute a “cash in lieu” amount to replace any Fund Security of the Partial Cash Funds that is a TBA transaction or mortgage pass-through security. In such cases, a transaction fee may
be charged on the cash amount paid in lieu of the TBA transaction or mortgage pass through security. In the event that the Fund Securities have a value greater than the NAV of the shares, a compensating cash payment equal to the difference is
required to be made by or through an Authorized Participant by the redeeming shareholder. Each Fund generally redeems Creation Units for Fund Securities (except for the Partial Cash Funds, which generally redeem Creation Units partially for cash),
and the iShares California Muni Bond ETF, iShares National Muni Bond ETF, iShares New York Muni Bond ETF and iShares Short-Term National Muni Bond ETF which may substitute all or a substantial portion of the Fund Securities for cash, but each Fund
reserves the right to utilize a cash option for redemption of Creation Units. Each Fund may, in its sole discretion, provide such redeeming Authorized Participant a portfolio of securities that differs from the exact composition of the Fund
Securities, but does not differ in NAV. The Redemption Basket may also be modified to minimize the Cash Component by redistributing the cash to the Fund Securities portion of the Redemption Basket through systematically rounding. The rounding
methodology allows position sizes of securities in the Fund Securities to be “rounded up,” while limiting the maximum allowed percentage change in weight and share quantity of any given security in the Redemption Basket. Redemption
Baskets may also be modified to position a fund towards a forward index rebalance to reflect revisions that account for index additions, deletions, and re-weights.</div>
<div>Cash Redemption Method.<font>  
Although the Trust does not generally permit full cash redemptions of Creation Units of its funds, when partial or full cash redemptions of Creation Units are available or specified
(</font><font>e.g.,</font><font> Creation Units of the Partial Cash Funds are generally redeemed partially for cash and the iShares California Muni Bond ETF, iShares National
Muni Bond ETF, iShares New York Muni Bond ETF and iShares Short-Term National Muni Bond ETF which may substitute cash for all or a substantial portion of the Fund Securities for cash), they will be effected in essentially the same manner as in-kind
redemptions thereof. In the case of partial or full cash redemption, the Authorized Participant receives the cash equivalent of the Fund Securities and other instruments it would otherwise receive through an in-kind redemption, plus the same Cash
Amount to be paid to an in-kind redeemer.</font></div> <div>Costs
Associated with Redemption Transactions. <font> A standard redemption transaction fee is imposed to offset transfer and other transaction costs that may be incurred by the relevant Fund. The standard redemption
transaction fee is charged to the Authorized Participant on the day such Authorized Participant redeems a Creation Unit, and is the same regardless of the</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

redeemed by an Authorized Participant on the applicable Business Day. If a redemption consists solely or partially of cash, the Authorized Participant may also be required to cover (up to the maximum amount shown below) certain brokerage, tax,
foreign exchange, execution, price movement and other costs and expenses related to the execution of trades resulting from such transaction (which may, in certain instances, be based on a good faith estimate of transaction costs). Authorized
Participants will also bear the costs of transferring the Fund Securities from a Fund to their account on their order. Certain fees/costs associated with redemption transactions may be waived in certain circumstances. Investors who use the services
of a broker or other financial intermediary to dispose of Fund shares may be charged a fee for such services.</div>

<div>Placement of Redemption
Orders.<font>  Redemption requests for Creation Units of the Funds must be submitted to the Distributor or its agent by or through an Authorized Participant. An Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable
request to redeem shares of a Fund (except for the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF and iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF) generally before 4:00 p.m., Eastern time on any Business Day in order to receive that day's NAV. For the iShares 0-3 Month
Treasury Bond ETF and iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF, shares of a Fund are redeemed only in creation units at a price based on the Fund’s NAV next determined, on any business day, of an order tendered to, and received by, the Distributor or
its agent in proper form. Generally, an order will be implemented as of the next determined NAV, as described in the</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>handbook for Authorized
Participants. On days when the Listing Exchange closes earlier than normal, a Fund may require orders to redeem Creation Units to be placed earlier that day. Investors, other than Authorized Participants, are responsible for making arrangements for
a redemption request to be made through an Authorized Participant. The Distributor or its agent will provide a list of current Authorized Participants upon request.</div>
<div>The Authorized Participant must transmit the request for
redemption in the form required by the Funds to the Distributor or its agent in accordance with procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement. Investors should be aware that their particular broker may not have executed an Authorized
Participant Agreement and that, therefore, requests to redeem Creation Units may have to be placed by the investor's broker through an Authorized Participant who has executed an Authorized Participant Agreement. At any time, only a limited number of
broker-dealers will have an Authorized Participant Agreement in effect. Investors making a redemption request should be aware that such request must be in the form specified by such Authorized Participant. Investors making a request to redeem
Creation Units should allow sufficient time to permit proper submission of the request by an Authorized Participant and transfer of the shares to the Funds' transfer agent; such investors should allow for the additional time that may be required to
effect redemptions through their banks, brokers or other financial intermediaries if such intermediaries are not Authorized Participants.</div>
<div>A redemption request is considered to be in “proper
form” if: (i) an Authorized Participant has transferred or caused to be transferred to the Funds' transfer agent the Creation Unit redeemed through the book-entry system of DTC so as to be effective by the Listing Exchange closing time on any
Business Day on which the redemption request is submitted; (ii) a request in form satisfactory to the applicable Fund is received by the Distributor or its agent from the Authorized Participant on behalf of itself or another redeeming investor
within the time periods specified above; and (iii) all other procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement are properly followed.</div>
<div>Upon receiving a redemption request, the Distributor or its
agent shall notify the applicable Fund and the Fund's transfer agent of such redemption request. The tender of an investor's shares for redemption and the distribution of the securities and/or cash included in the redemption payment made in respect
of Creation Units redeemed will be made through DTC and the relevant Authorized Participant to the Beneficial Owner thereof as recorded on the book-entry system of DTC or the DTC Participant through which such investor holds, as the case may be, or
by such other means specified by the Authorized Participant submitting the redemption request.</div>
<div>A redeeming Authorized Participant, whether on its own account
or acting on behalf of a Beneficial Owner, must maintain appropriate security arrangements with a qualified broker-dealer, bank or other custody providers in each jurisdiction in which any of the portfolio securities are customarily traded, to which
account such portfolio securities will be delivered.</div>
<div>Deliveries of redemption proceeds by each Fund are generally
made within two Business Days (<font>i.e.</font>, “T+2”) (except for the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF and iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF). Each Fund reserves the right to settle redemption transactions
on a different basis, if necessary or appropriate under the circumstances and compliant with applicable law. For the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF and iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF, for redemption orders tendered before 12:00 p.m., Eastern
time, creation units are generally settled on a “T+0 basis” (<font>i.e.</font>, on trade date) and all other redemption orders are generally settled on a “T+1 basis”. </div>
<div>If a Fund includes a foreign investment in its basket, and if
a local market holiday, or series of consecutive holidays, or the extended delivery cycles for transferring foreign investments to redeeming Authorized Participants prevents timely delivery of the foreign investment in response to a redemption
request, a Fund may delay delivery of the foreign investment more than seven days if a Fund delivers the foreign investment as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 days. Delayed settlement may occur due to a number of different
reasons, including, without limitation, settlement cycles for the underlying securities, unscheduled market closings, an effort to link distribution to dividend record dates and ex-dates and newly announced holidays. For example, the redemption
settlement process may be extended because of the occurrence of a holiday in a non-U.S. market or in the U.S. bond market that is not a holiday observed in the U.S. equity market.</div>
<div>To the extent contemplated by an Authorized Participant's
agreement with the Distributor or its agent, in the event an Authorized Participant has submitted a redemption request in proper form but is unable to transfer all or part of the Creation Unit to be redeemed to a Fund, at or prior to the time
specified by a Fund or its custodian on the Business Day after the date of submission of such redemption request, the Distributor or its agent will accept the redemption request in reliance on the undertaking by the Authorized Participant to deliver
the missing shares as soon as possible. Such undertaking shall be secured by the Authorized Participant's delivery and maintenance of collateral as set forth in the handbook for Authorized Participants. Such collateral must be delivered no later
than the time specified by a Fund or its custodian on the Business Day</div> </div> <div type="Block">

submission of such redemption request and shall be held by State Street and marked-to-market daily. The fees of State Street and any sub-custodians in respect of the delivery, maintenance and redelivery of the collateral shall be payable by the
Authorized Participant. The Authorized Participant Agreement permits the Funds to acquire shares of the Funds at any time and subjects the Authorized Participant to liability for any shortfall between the aggregate of the cost to the Funds of
purchasing such shares, plus the value of the Cash Amount, and the value of the collateral together with liability for related brokerage and other charges.</div>
<div>Because the portfolio securities of a Fund may trade on
exchange(s) on days that the Listing Exchange is closed or are otherwise not Business Days for such Fund, shareholders may not be able to redeem their shares of such Fund, or purchase or sell shares of such Fund on the Listing Exchange on days when
the NAV of such a Fund could be significantly affected by events in the relevant non-U.S. markets.</div>
<div>Under normal circumstances, each of the iShares 0-3 Month
Treasury Bond ETF and iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF may postpone and/or suspend redemption and payment beyond one business day only as follows: (i) for any period during which there is a non-routine closure of the Fedwire or applicable Federal
Reserve Banks; (ii) for any period during which the Listing Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday closings); (iii) for any period during which trading on the Listing Exchange is suspended or restricted; (iv) for any period
during which an emergency exists as a result of which disposal of the shares of the Fund’s portfolio securities or determination of its net asset value is not reasonably practicable; (v) in such other circumstance as is permitted by the SEC;
(vi) for any period during which the Fund, as part of a necessary liquidation of the Fund, has properly postponed and/or suspended redemption of shares and payment in accordance with federal securities laws; or (vii) on the Fund’s ex-dividend
dates. Any such suspension or postponement described above will be consistent with the Fund’s obligations under Section 22(e)of the 1940 Act.</div>
<div>The right of redemption may be suspended or the date of
payment postponed with respect to any Fund (other than the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF and iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF): (i) for any period during which the Listing Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday closings);
(ii) for any period during which trading on the Listing Exchange is suspended or restricted; (iii) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which disposal of the shares of the Fund's portfolio securities or determination of its
NAV is not reasonably practicable; or (iv) in such other circumstance as is permitted by the SEC.</div>
<div>Custom Baskets.<font>  Creation
and Redemption baskets may differ and each Fund will accept “custom baskets.” A custom basket may include any of the following: (i) a basket that is composed of a non-representative selection of a Fund's portfolio holdings; (ii) a
representative basket that is different from the initial basket used in transactions on the same business day; or (iii) a basket that contains bespoke cash substitutions for a single Authorized Participant. Each Fund has adopted policies and
procedures that govern the construction and acceptance of baskets, including heightened requirements for certain types of custom baskets. Such policies and procedures provide the parameters for the construction and acceptance of custom baskets that
are in the best interests of a Fund and its shareholders, establish processes for revisions to, or deviations from, such parameters, and specify the titles and roles of the employees of BFA who are required to review each custom basket for
compliance with those parameters. In addition, when constructing custom baskets for redemptions, the tax efficiency of a Fund may be taken into account. The policies and procedures distinguish among different types of custom baskets that may be used
for each Fund and impose different requirements for different types of custom baskets in order to seek to mitigate against potential risks of conflicts and/or overreaching by an Authorized Participant. BlackRock has established a governance process
to oversee basket compliance for the Funds, as set forth in each Fund's policies and procedures.</font></div>
<div>Taxation on Creations and Redemptions of Creation Units.<font>   An Authorized Participant generally will recognize either gain or loss upon the exchange of Deposit Securities for Creation Units. This gain or loss is calculated by taking the market value of the Creation Units
purchased over the Authorized Participant’s aggregate basis in the Deposit Securities exchanged therefor. However, the IRS may apply the wash sales rules to determine that any loss realized upon the exchange of Deposit Securities for Creation
Units is not currently deductible. Authorized Participants should consult their own tax advisors.</font></div>
<div>Current U.S. federal income tax laws dictate that capital gain
or loss realized from the redemption of Creation Units will generally create long-term capital gain or loss if the Authorized Participant holds the Creation Units for more than one year, or short-term capital gain or loss if the Creation Units were
held for one year or less, if the Creation Units are held as capital assets.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>The following is a summary of certain material U.S. federal
income tax considerations regarding the purchase, ownership and disposition of shares of a Fund. This summary does not address all of the potential U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be applicable to a Fund or to all categories of
investors, some of which may be subject to special tax rules. Current and prospective shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the specific federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences of investing in a Fund.

<div>Regulated Investment Company Qualifications. <font> Each Fund intends to continue to qualify for and to elect treatment as a separate RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify for treatment as a RIC, each Fund must annually distribute at least
90% of its investment company taxable income (which includes dividends, interest and net short-term capital gains) and meet several other requirements. Among such other requirements are the following: (i) at least 90% of each Fund’s annual
gross income must be derived from dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities or non-U.S. currencies, other income (including, but not limited to, gains from
options, futures or forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies, and net income derived from interests in qualified publicly-traded partnerships (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, partnerships that are traded on an established securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than a partnership that derives at least 90% of
its income from interest, dividends, capital gains and other traditionally permitted RIC income); and (ii) at the close of each quarter of each Fund’s taxable year, (a) at least 50% of the market value of each Fund’s total assets must be
represented by cash and cash items, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs and other securities, with such other securities limited for purposes of this calculation in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater than 5% of the
value of the Fund’s assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (b) not more than 25% of the value of the Fund’s total assets may be invested in the securities of any one issuer, of two or
more issuers of which 20% or more of the voting stock is held by the Fund and that are engaged in the same or similar trades or businesses or related trades or businesses (other than the securities of other RICs) or the securities of one or more
qualified publicly-traded partnerships.</font></div> <div>A Fund
may be able to cure a failure to derive at least 90% of its income from the sources specified above or a failure to diversify its holdings in the manner described above by paying a tax and/or by disposing of certain assets. If, in any taxable year,
a Fund fails one of these tests and does not timely cure the failure, that Fund will be taxed in the same manner as an ordinary corporation and distributions to its shareholders will not be deductible by that Fund in computing its taxable
income.</div> <div>Although in general the passive loss rules of
the Internal Revenue Code do not apply to RICs, such rules do apply to a RIC with respect to items attributable to an interest in a qualified publicly-traded partnership. A Fund’s investments in partnerships, including in qualified
publicly-traded partnerships, may result in the Fund being subject to state, local, or non-U.S. income, franchise or withholding tax liabilities.</div>
<div>Taxation of RICs. <font> As a
RIC, a Fund will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of its taxable investment income and capital gains that it distributes to its shareholders, provided that it satisfies a minimum distribution requirement. To satisfy the
minimum distribution requirement, a Fund must distribute to its shareholders at least the sum of (i) 90% of its “investment company taxable income” (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, income other than its net realized long-term capital gain over its net realized short-term capital loss), plus or minus certain adjustments, and (ii) 90% of its net tax-exempt income for the taxable year. A Fund will
be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates on any taxable income or gains that it does not distribute to its shareholders. If a Fund fails to qualify for any taxable year as a RIC or fails to meet the distribution requirement, all of its
taxable income will be subject to tax at regular corporate income tax rates without any deduction for distributions to shareholders, and such distributions generally will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary dividends to the extent of the
Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits. In such event, distributions to individuals should be eligible to be treated as qualified dividend income and distributions to corporate shareholders generally should be eligible for the
dividends-received deduction. Although each Fund intends to distribute substantially all of its net investment income and its capital gains for each taxable year, a Fund may decide to retain a portion of its income or gains if the Fund determines
that doing so is in the interest of its shareholders. Each Fund will be subject to U.S. federal income taxation to the extent any such income or gains are not distributed. Moreover, if a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC in any year, it must pay out
its earnings and profits accumulated in that year in order to qualify again as a RIC. If a Fund fails to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

98.2% of its capital gain net income for the 12 months ended October 31 of such year. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by a Fund that is subject to corporate income tax will be considered to have
been distributed by year-end. In addition, the minimum amounts that must be distributed in any year to avoid the excise tax will be increased or decreased to reflect any underdistribution or overdistribution, as the case may be, from the previous
year. Each Fund intends to declare and distribute dividends and distributions in the amounts and at the times necessary to avoid the application of this 4% excise tax.</font></div>
<div>Taxation of U.S. Shareholders.
<font> Dividends and other distributions by a Fund are generally treated under the Internal Revenue Code as received by the shareholders at the time the dividend or distribution is made. However, any dividend or

in such a month shall be deemed to have been received by each shareholder on December 31 of such calendar year and to have been paid by the Fund not later than such December 31, provided such dividend is actually paid by the Fund during January of
the following calendar year.</div> <div>Each Fund intends to
distribute annually to its shareholders substantially all of its net tax-exempt income, investment company taxable income and any net realized long-term capital gains in excess of net realized short-term capital losses (including any capital loss
carryovers). However, if a Fund retains for investment an amount equal to all or a portion of its net long-term capital gains in excess of its net short-term capital losses (including any capital loss carryovers), it will be subject to a corporate
tax (at a flat rate of 21%) on the amount retained. In that event, the Fund will report such retained amounts as undistributed capital gains in a notice to its shareholders who (a) will be required to include in income for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, as long-term capital gains, their proportionate shares of the undistributed amount, (b) will be entitled to credit their proportionate shares of the tax paid by the Fund on the undistributed amount against their U.S. federal income tax
liabilities, if any, and to claim refunds to the extent their credits exceed their liabilities, if any, and (c) will be entitled to increase their tax basis, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in their shares by an amount equal to the excess of
the amount in clause (a) over the amount in clause (b). Organizations or persons not subject to U.S. federal income tax on such capital gains will be entitled to a refund of their <font>pro rata</font> share of such taxes
paid by the Fund upon filing appropriate returns or claims for refund with the IRS.</div>
<div>Distributions of net realized long-term capital gains, if any,
that a Fund reports as capital gain dividends are taxable as long-term capital gains, whether paid in cash or in shares and regardless of how long a shareholder has held shares of the Fund. All other dividends of a Fund (including dividends from
short-term capital gains) from its current and accumulated earnings and profits (“regular dividends”) are generally subject to tax as ordinary income. Long-term capital gains are eligible for taxation at a maximum rate of 15% or 20% for
non-corporate shareholders, depending on whether their income exceeds certain threshold amounts.</div>
<div>If an individual receives a regular dividend qualifying for
the long-term capital gain rates and such dividend constitutes an “extraordinary dividend,” and the individual subsequently recognizes a loss on the sale or exchange of stock in respect of which the extraordinary dividend was paid, then
the loss will be long-term capital loss to the extent of such extraordinary dividend. An “extraordinary dividend” on common stock for this purpose is generally a dividend (i) in an amount greater than or equal to 10% of the
taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share of stock, aggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates within an 85-day period, or (ii) in an amount greater than 20% of the taxpayer’s tax basis (or trading value) in a share of stock,
aggregating dividends with ex-dividend dates within a 365-day period.</div>
<div>Distributions in excess of a Fund’s current and
accumulated earnings and profits will, as to each shareholder, be treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of a shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund, and as a capital gain thereafter (if the shareholder holds shares of the
Fund as capital assets). Distributions in excess of a Fund’s minimum distribution requirements, but not in excess of the Fund’s earnings and profits, will be taxable to shareholders and will not constitute nontaxable returns of capital.
The Fund's capital loss carryovers, if any, carried from taxable years beginning before 2011 do not reduce current earnings and profits, even if such carryforwards offset current year realized gains. Shareholders receiving dividends or distributions
in the form of additional shares should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as receiving a distribution in an amount equal to the amount of money that the shareholders receiving cash dividends or distributions will receive and should
have a cost basis in the shares received equal to such amount. No deduction would be allowed to an investor for interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry shares of the Fund to the extent the interest deduction would relate
to exempt-interest dividends received.</div> <div>A 3.8% U.S.
federal Medicare contribution tax is imposed on net investment income, including, but not limited to, interest, dividends, and net gain from investments, of U.S. individuals with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 if married and filing jointly),
and of estates and trusts.</div> <div>Investors considering buying
shares just prior to a dividend or capital gain distribution should be aware that, although the price of shares purchased at that time may reflect the amount of the forthcoming distribution, such dividend or distribution may nevertheless be taxable
to them. If a Fund is the holder of record of any security on the record date for any dividends payable with respect to such security, such dividends will be included in the Fund’s gross income not as of the date received but as of the later
of (i) the date such security became ex-dividend with respect to such dividends (<font>i.e</font>., the date on which a buyer of the security would not be entitled to receive the declared, but unpaid, dividends); or (ii)
the date the Fund acquired</div> </div> <div type="Block">

Accordingly, in order to satisfy its income distribution requirements, a Fund may be required to pay dividends based on anticipated earnings, and shareholders may receive dividends in an earlier year than would otherwise be the case.</div>
<div>In certain situations, a Fund may, for a taxable year, defer
all or a portion of its net capital loss (or if there is no net capital loss, then any net long-term or short-term capital loss) realized after October and its late-year ordinary loss (defined as the sum of the excess of post-October foreign
currency and passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) losses over post-October foreign currency and PFIC gains, plus the excess of post-December ordinary losses over post-December ordinary income) until the next taxable year in
computing its investment company taxable income and net capital gain, which will defer the recognition of such realized losses. Such deferrals and other rules regarding gains and losses realized after October (or December) may affect the tax
character of shareholder distributions.</div> <div>Sales of Shares.<font>  Upon the sale or exchange of shares of a Fund, a shareholder will realize a taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and the shareholder’s basis in shares of the Fund. A
redemption of shares by a Fund will be treated as a sale for this purpose. Such gain or loss will be treated as capital gain or loss if the shares are capital assets in the shareholder’s hands and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the
shares are held for more than one year and short-term capital gain or loss if the shares are held for one year or less. Any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed to the extent the shares disposed of are replaced, including
replacement through the reinvesting of dividends or capital gains distributions, or by an option, or contract to acquire substantially identical shares, within a 61-day period beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after the disposition of the
shares. In such a case, the basis of the shares acquired will be increased to reflect the disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a shareholder on the sale of Fund shares held by the shareholder for six months or less will be treated for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any distributions or deemed distributions of long-term capital gains received by the shareholder with respect to such share. The Medicare contribution tax described above will apply to
the sale of Fund shares.</font></div> <div>If a shareholder incurs
a sales charge in acquiring shares of a Fund, disposes of those shares within 90 days and then, on or before January 31 of the following calendar year, acquires shares in a mutual fund for which the otherwise applicable sales charge is reduced by
reason of a reinvestment right (<font>e.g.</font>, an exchange privilege), the original sales charge will not be taken into account in computing gain/loss on the original shares to the extent the subsequent sales charge is
reduced. Instead, the disregarded portion of the original sales charge will be added to the tax basis of the newly acquired shares. Furthermore, the same rule also applies to a disposition of the newly acquired shares made within 90 days of the
second acquisition. This provision prevents a shareholder from immediately deducting the sales charge by shifting his or her investment within a family of mutual funds.</div>
<div>Backup Withholding. <font> In
certain cases, a Fund will be required to withhold at a 24% rate and remit to the U.S. Treasury such amounts withheld from any distributions paid to a shareholder who: (i) has failed to provide a correct taxpayer identification number; (ii) is
subject to backup withholding by the IRS; (iii) has failed to certify to a Fund that such shareholder is not subject to backup withholding; or (iv) has not certified that such shareholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien). Backup
withholding is not an additional tax and any amount withheld may be credited against a shareholder's U.S. federal income tax liability.</font></div>
<div>Sections 351 and 362.
<font> The Trust, on behalf of each Fund, has the right to reject an order for a purchase of shares of the Fund if the purchaser (or group of purchasers) would, upon obtaining the shares so ordered, own 80% or more
of the outstanding shares of a given Fund and if, pursuant to Sections 351 and 362 of the Internal Revenue Code, that Fund would have a basis in the securities different from the market value of such securities on the date of deposit. If a
Fund’s basis in such securities on the date of deposit was less than market value on such date, the Fund, upon disposition of the securities, would recognize more taxable gain or less taxable loss than if its basis in the securities had been
equal to market value. It is not anticipated that the Trust will exercise the right of rejection except in a case where the Trust determines that accepting the order could result in material adverse tax consequences to a Fund or its shareholders.
The Trust also has the right to require information necessary to determine beneficial share ownership for purposes of the 80% determination.</font></div>
<div>Tax-Exempt Interest Income.<font>
 Dividends paid by the Municipal Bond Funds that are properly reported as exempt-interest dividends will not be subject to regular federal income tax. Each Municipal Bond Fund intends to invest its assets in a manner such that dividend

the Fund properly reports such dividends as exempt-interest dividends.</div>
<div>So long as, at the close of each quarter of the taxable year
of the California Fund, at least 50% of the value of the California Fund’s total assets consists of obligations of the U.S. and of the State of California and its political subdivisions, the interest on which is exempt from California personal
income tax and California corporate income tax (“CA-exempt Obligations”), exempt-interest dividends (i) paid by the California Fund in an amount not exceeding the interest received on such CA-exempt Obligations during the California
Fund’s taxable year, and (ii) reported by the California Fund as exempt-interest dividends (in a written notice mailed to the California Fund’s shareholders) will be treated as an item of interest excludable from income for California
personal income tax purposes and corporate income tax purposes. Exempt-interest dividends paid to a corporate shareholder subject to California corporate franchise tax, however, will be taxable as ordinary income for purposes of such tax.
Distributions derived from interest on tax-exempt obligations issued by governmental authorities in states other than California or on other obligations or investments the interest on which is not exempt from California personal income tax or
corporate income tax, and distributions to shareholders derived from short-term or long-term capital gains, will be taxed as ordinary income for California personal and corporate income tax purposes and California corporate franchise tax purposes.
Interest on indebtedness incurred or continued by a shareholder of the California Fund to purchase or carry shares of the California Fund generally will not be deductible for California personal or corporate income tax purposes. It should be noted
that California law deviates from the provisions of Subchapter M of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code, relating to regulated investment companies in certain potentially material respects.</div>
<div>The foregoing is a general, abbreviated summary of certain of
the provisions of California law presently in effect that govern the taxation of the shareholders of the California Fund. These provisions are subject to change by legislative or administrative action, and any such change may be retroactive.
Shareholders are advised to consult with their own tax advisors for more detailed information concerning California tax matters.</div>
<div>Individual shareholders of the iShares New York Muni Bond ETF
will not be required to include in their gross income for New York State and City purposes any portion of distributions received from the Fund that are directly attributable to (i) interest earned on tax-exempt obligations issued by New York State
or any political subdivision thereof (including New York City) or (ii) interest earned on obligations of U.S. possessions or territories that is exempt from state taxation pursuant to federal law, provided that the Fund qualifies as a RIC and
satisfies the requirement that at least 50% of its assets at the close of each quarter of its taxable year constitute such obligations. Distributions from the Fund that are attributable to sources other than those described in the preceding sentence
(including interest on obligations of other states and their political subdivisions) will generally be taxable to individual shareholders as ordinary income.</div>
<div>Shareholders of the iShares New York Muni Bond ETF that are
subject to New York State corporation franchise tax or New York City general corporation tax will be required to include exempt-interest dividends paid by the Fund in their “entire net income” for purposes of such taxes and will be
required to include their shares of the Fund in their investment capital for purposes of such taxes. If a shareholder is subject to unincorporated business taxation by New York City, income and gains distributed by the Fund will be subject to such
taxation except to the extent such distributions are directly attributable to interest earned on tax-exempt obligations issued by New York State or any political subdivision thereof (including New York City). However, shareholders of the Fund will
not be subject to the unincorporated business tax imposed by New York City solely by reason of their ownership of shares in the Fund. Shares of the iShares New York Muni Bond ETF will not be subject to property taxes imposed by New York State or
City.</div> <div>Interest on indebtedness incurred by shareholders
to purchase or carry shares of New York Municipal Income generally will not be deductible for New York State personal income tax purposes.</div>

Certain Derivatives.<font>  A Fund’s transactions in zero coupon securities, non-U.S. currencies, forward contracts, options and futures contracts (including options and futures contracts on non-U.S.
currencies), to the extent permitted, will be subject to special provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (including provisions relating to “hedging transactions” and “straddles”) that, among other consequences, may affect the
character of gains and losses realized by the Fund (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, may affect whether gains or losses are ordinary or capital), accelerate recognition of
income to the Fund and defer Fund losses. These rules could therefore affect the character, amount and timing of distributions to shareholders. These provisions also (a) will require the Fund to mark-to-market certain types of the positions in its
portfolio (</font><font>i.e.</font><font>, treat them as if they were closed out at the end of each year) and (b) may cause the Fund to recognize income without receiving cash
with which to pay dividends or make distributions in amounts necessary to satisfy the distribution requirements for avoiding income and excise taxes. Each Fund will monitor its transactions, will make the appropriate tax elections and will make the
appropriate entries in its books and records when it acquires any zero coupon security, non-U.S. currency, forward contract, option, futures contract or hedged investment in order to mitigate the effect of these rules and prevent disqualification of
the Fund as a RIC. </font></div> <div>A Fund’s investments in
so-called “section 1256 contracts,” such as regulated futures contracts, most non-U.S. currency forward contracts traded in the interbank market and options on most security indexes, are subject to special tax rules. All section 1256
contracts held by the Fund at the end of its taxable year are required to be marked to their market value, and any unrealized gain or loss on those positions will be included in the Fund’s income as if each position had been sold for its fair
market value at the end of the taxable year. The resulting gain or loss will be combined with any gain or loss realized by the Fund from positions in section 1256 contracts closed during the taxable year. Provided such positions were held as capital
assets and were not part of a “hedging transaction” nor part of a “straddle,” 60% of the resulting net gain or loss will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss, and 40% of such net gain or loss will be treated as
short-term capital gain or loss, regardless of the period of time the positions were actually held by the Fund.</div>
<div>As a result of entering into swap contracts, a Fund may make
or receive periodic net payments. A Fund may also make or receive a payment when a swap is terminated prior to maturity through an assignment of the swap or other closing transaction. Periodic net payments will generally constitute ordinary income
or deductions, while termination of a swap will generally result in capital gain or loss (which will be a long-term capital gain or loss if the Fund has been a party to the swap for more than one year). The cost of any payments made by the Fund on a
swap transaction will be netted <font>pro rata</font> against both tax exempt and taxable gross income. With respect to certain types of swaps, a Fund may be required to currently recognize income or loss with respect to
future payments on such swaps or may elect under certain circumstances to mark such swaps to market annually for tax purposes as ordinary income or loss. Periodic net payments that would otherwise constitute ordinary deductions but are allocable
under the Internal Revenue Code to exempt-interest dividends will not be allowed as deductions but instead will reduce net tax-exempt income.</div>
<div>Market Discount. <font> Any
market discount recognized on a bond is taxable as ordinary income. A market discount bond is a bond acquired in the secondary market at a price below redemption value or adjusted issue price if issued with original issue discount
(“OID”). To the extent a Fund does not include the market discount in income as it accrues, gain on the Fund’s disposition of such an obligation will be treated as ordinary income rather than capital gain to the extent of the
accrued market discount.</font></div> <div>Non-U.S. Investments.<font>  Income (including, in some cases, capital gains) received by certain of the Funds from investments in non-U.S. securities may be subject to withholding and other taxes imposed by non-U.S. countries. Tax
conventions between certain countries and the U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes in some cases. If more than 50% of a Fund’s total assets at the close of its taxable year consists of securities of non-U.S. corporations, the Fund may elect
for U.S. income tax purposes to treat non-U.S. income taxes paid by it as paid by its shareholders. A Fund may qualify for and make this election in some, but not necessarily all, of its taxable years. If a Fund were to make an election,
shareholders of the Fund would be required to take into account an amount equal to their pro rata portions of such non-U.S. taxes in computing their taxable income and then treat an amount equal to those non-U.S. taxes as a U.S. federal income tax
deduction or as a foreign tax credit against their U.S. federal income taxes. Shortly after any year for which it makes such an election, a Fund will report to its shareholders the amount per share of such non-U.S. income tax that must be included
in each shareholder’s gross income and the amount which will be available for the deduction or credit. No deduction for non-U.S. taxes may be claimed by a shareholder who does not itemize deductions. Certain limitations will be imposed on the
extent to which the credit (but not the deduction) for non-U.S. taxes may be claimed.</font></div>

disposition of debt securities denominated in non-U.S. currency, to the extent attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the acquisition and disposition dates, are also treated as ordinary income or loss unless the Fund were to elect
otherwise.</div> <div>Original Issue Discount. <font> OID on tax-exempt bonds is recognized over the term of the bond and is tax-exempt to the holder of the bond. STRIPS are treated as newly issued debt instruments having OID. Special U.S. federal income tax rules
apply to inflation-indexed bonds. Generally, all stated interest on such bonds is taken into income by a Fund under its regular method of accounting for interest income. The amount of a positive inflation adjustment, which results in an increase in
the inflation-adjusted principal amount of the bond, is treated as OID. The OID is included in a Fund’s gross income ratably during the period ending with the maturity of the bond, under the general OID inclusion rules. The amount of a
Fund’s OID in a taxable year with respect to a bond will increase a Fund’s taxable income for such year without a corresponding receipt of cash, until the bond matures. As a result, a Fund may need to use other sources of cash to satisfy
its distributions for such year. The amount of negative inflation adjustment, which results in a decrease in the inflation-adjusted principal amount of the bond, reduces the amount of interest (including stated, interest, OID, and market discount,
if any) otherwise includible in a Fund’s income with respect to the bond for the taxable year.</font></div>
<div>Reporting.<font>  If a
shareholder recognizes a loss with respect to a Fund’s shares of $2 million or more for an individual shareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate shareholder, the shareholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement on IRS Form
8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases exempted from this reporting requirement, but under current guidance, shareholders of a RIC are not exempted. The fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations does not
affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer’s treatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders should consult their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual
circumstances.</font></div> <div>Other Taxes. <font> Dividends, distributions and redemption proceeds may also be subject to additional state, local and non-U.S. taxes depending on each shareholder’s particular situation.</font></div>
<div>Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders. <font> Dividends paid by a Fund to non-U.S. shareholders are generally subject to withholding tax at a 30% rate or a reduced rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty to the extent derived from investment income
and short-term capital gains. Dividends paid by a Fund from net tax-exempt income or long-term capital gains are generally not subject to such withholding tax. In order to obtain a reduced rate of withholding, a non-U.S. shareholder will be required
to provide an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E certifying its entitlement to benefits under a treaty. The withholding tax does not apply to regular dividends paid to a non-U.S. shareholder who provides an IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that the
dividends are effectively connected with the non-U.S. shareholder’s conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. Instead, the effectively connected dividends will be subject to regular U.S. income tax as if the non-U.S. shareholder were a
U.S. shareholder. A non-U.S. corporation receiving effectively connected dividends may also be subject to additional “branch profits tax” imposed at a rate of 30% (or lower treaty rate). A non-U.S. shareholder who fails to provide an IRS
Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or other applicable form may be subject to backup withholding at the appropriate rate.</font></div>
<div>Properly-reported dividends are generally exempt from U.S.
federal withholding tax where they (i) are paid in respect of a Fund’s “qualified net interest income” (generally, a Fund’s U.S. source interest income, other than certain contingent interest and interest from obligations of
a corporation or partnership in which a Fund is at least a 10% shareholder or partner, reduced by expenses that are allocable to such income); or (ii) are paid in respect of a Fund’s “qualified short-term capital gains” (generally,
the excess of a Fund’s net short-term capital gain over a Fund’s long-term capital loss for such taxable year). However, depending on its circumstances, a Fund may report all, some or none of its potentially eligible dividends as such
qualified net interest income or as qualified short-term capital gains and/or treat such dividends, in whole or in part, as ineligible for this exemption from withholding. In order to qualify for this exemption from withholding, a non-U.S.
shareholder will need to comply with applicable certification requirements relating to its non-U.S. status (including, in general, furnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or substitute Form). In the case of shares held through an
intermediary, the intermediary may withhold even if a Fund reports the payment as qualified net interest income or qualified short-term capital gain. Non-U.S. shareholders should contact their intermediaries with respect to the application of these
rules to their accounts.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

rules may apply to a foreign shareholder receiving a Fund distribution if at least 50% of the Fund's assets consist of interests in U.S. real property interests, including certain REITs and U.S. real property holding corporations (as defined in the
Internal Revenue Code and Treasury regulations). Fund distributions that are attributable to gain from the disposition of a U.S. real property interest will be taxable as ordinary dividends and subject to withholding at a 30% or lower treaty rate if
the foreign shareholder held no more than 5% of the Fund's shares at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of the distribution. If the foreign shareholder held at least 5% of the Fund's shares, the distribution would be treated as
income effectively connected with a trade or business within the U.S. and the foreign shareholder would be subject to withholding tax at a rate of 21% and would generally be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return.</div>
<div>Similar consequences would generally apply to a foreign
shareholder's gain on the sale of Fund shares unless the Fund is domestically controlled (meaning that more than 50% of the value of the Fund's shares is held by U.S. shareholders) or the foreign shareholder owns no more than 5% of the Fund's shares
at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of sale. Finally, a domestically controlled Fund may be required to recognize a portion of its gain on the in-kind distribution of certain U.S. real property interests. Shareholders that are

account holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial institutions will need to: (i) enter into agreements with the
IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information including the names, addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders; comply with due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S.
accounts; report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts maintained; agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to account holders who fail to provide the required
information; and determine certain other information as to their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an applicable intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with similar account
holder information. Other foreign entities will need to provide the name, address and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or provide certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership, unless certain exceptions apply.</div>

<div>Regulation Under the Alternative Investment Fund Managers
Directive. <font> The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”) imposes detailed and prescriptive obligations on fund managers established in the EU (“EU Operative Provisions”).
These do not currently apply to managers established outside of the EU, such as BFA. Rather, non-EU managers are only required to comply with certain disclosure, reporting and transparency obligations of AIFMD (“AIFMD Disclosure
Provisions”) if such managers market a fund to EU investors.</font></div>
<div>Where the AIFMD Disclosure Provisions relate to EU Operative
Provisions that do not apply to BFA, no meaningful disclosure can be made. These EU Operative Provisions include prescriptive rules on: measuring and capping leverage in line with known European standards; the treatment of investors; the use of
“depositaries”; and coverage for professional liability risks.</div>
<div>AIFMD imposes certain conditions on the marketing of funds,
such as the Funds, to EU investors. AIFMD requires that an ‘alternative investment fund manager’ (“AIFM”) be identified to meet such conditions where such marketing is sought. For these purposes BFA, as the legal entity
responsible for performing the portfolio and risk management of the Funds, shall be the AIFM.</div>
<div>AIFMD requires disclosure on an ongoing basis of certain
information relating to the use of special arrangements, leverage, rights of reuse of collateral, guarantees granted under leverage arrangements and the use of gates, side pockets and similar liquidity management tools. Given that the Funds do not
use any special arrangements or allow for collateral reuse, it is not intended that such disclosures will need to be made by the Funds. Each Fund will, however, to the extent relevant and appropriate, disclose in its annual report information on the
Fund's leverage, risk profile and risk management systems employed by BFA. Each Fund will also disclose material changes, if any, to the liquidity management systems and procedures employed in respect of the Fund.</div>
<div>BFA has registered the following Funds for marketing to
investors in Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the U.K.:</div>
<div>iShares 1-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF</div>
<div>iShares 5-10 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF</div>

<div>INTRODUCTION TO BLACKROCK</div>
<div>BlackRock’s purpose is to help more and more people
experience financial well-being. As a fiduciary to our clients, we provide the investment and technology solutions they need when planning for their most important goals. We manage assets on behalf of institutional and individual clients, across a
full spectrum of investment strategies, asset classes and regions. Our client base includes pension plans, endowments, foundations, charities, official institutions, insurers and other financial institutions, as well as individuals around the
world.</div> <div>PHILOSOPHY ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE</div>
<div>BlackRock Investment Stewardship (“BIS”)
activities are focused on maximizing long-term value for our clients. BIS does this through engagement with boards and management of investee companies and, for those clients who have given us authority, through voting at shareholder meetings.</div>
<div>We believe that there are certain fundamental rights attached
to shareholding. Companies and their boards should be accountable to shareholders and structured with appropriate checks and balances to ensure that they operate in shareholders’ best interests. Effective voting rights are central to the
rights of ownership and there should be one vote for one share. Shareholders should have the right to elect, remove and nominate directors, approve the appointment of the auditor and to amend the corporate charter or by-laws. Shareholders should be
able to vote on matters that are material to the protection of their investment, including but not limited to, changes to the purpose of the business, dilution levels and pre-emptive rights, and the distribution of income and capital structure. In
order to make informed decisions, we believe that shareholders have the right to sufficient and timely information.</div>
<div>Our primary focus is on the performance of the board of
directors. As the agent of shareholders, the board should set the company’s strategic aims within a framework of prudent and effective controls, which enables risk to be assessed and managed. The board should provide direction and leadership
to management and oversee management’s performance. Our starting position is to be supportive of boards in their oversight efforts on shareholders’ behalf and we would generally expect to support the items of business they put to a vote
at shareholder meetings. Votes cast against or withheld from resolutions proposed by the board are a signal that we are concerned that the directors or management have either not acted in the best interests of shareholders or have not responded
adequately to shareholder concerns. We assess voting matters on a case-by-case basis and in light of each company’s unique circumstances taking into consideration regional best practices and long-term value creation.</div>
<div>These principles set out our approach to engaging with
companies, provide guidance on our position on corporate governance and outline how our views might be reflected in our voting decisions. Corporate governance practices can vary internationally, so our expectations in relation to individual
companies are based on the legal and regulatory framework of each local market. However, we believe there are overarching principles of corporate governance that apply globally and provide a framework for more detailed, market-specific
assessments.</div> <div>We believe BlackRock has a responsibility
in relation to monitoring and providing feedback to companies, sometimes known as “stewardship.” These ownership responsibilities include engaging with management or board members on corporate governance matters, voting proxies in the
best long -term economic interests of our clients, and engaging with regulatory bodies to ensure a sound policy framework consistent with promoting long -term shareholder value creation. We also believe in the responsibility to our clients to have
appropriate resources and oversight structures. Our approach is set out in the section below titled “BlackRock’s oversight of its investment stewardship activities” and is further detailed in a <font>team profile on our website</font>.</div>
<div>CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, ENGAGEMENT AND VOTING</div>
<div>We recognize that accepted standards of corporate governance
differ between markets, but we believe there are sufficient common threads globally to identify an overarching set of principles. The objective of our investment stewardship activities is the protection and enhancement of the value of our
clients’ investments in public corporations. Thus, these principles focus on practices and structures that we consider to be supportive of long-term value creation. We discuss below the principles under six key themes. In our regional and
market-specific voting guidelines we explain how these principles inform our voting decisions in relation to specific resolutions that may appear on the agenda of a shareholder meeting in the relevant market.</div>
<div>The six key themes are:</div> </div>

<div>At a minimum, we expect companies to observe the accepted
corporate governance standards in their domestic market or to explain why doing so is not in the interests of shareholders. Where company reporting and disclosure is inadequate or the approach taken is inconsistent with our view of what is in the
best interests of shareholders, we will engage with the company and/or use our vote to encourage a change in practice. In making voting decisions, we perform independent research and analysis, such as reviewing relevant information published by the
company and apply our voting guidelines to achieve the outcome we believe best protects our clients’ long -term economic interests. We also work closely with our active portfolio managers, and may take into account internal and external
research.</div> <div>BlackRock views engagement as an important
activity; engagement provides us with the opportunity to improve our understanding of the challenges and opportunities that investee companies are facing and their governance structures. Engagement also allows us to share our philosophy and approach
to investment and corporate governance with companies to enhance their understanding of our objectives. Our engagements often focus on providing our feedback on company disclosures, particularly where we believe they could be enhanced. There are a
range of approaches we may take in engaging companies depending on the nature of the issue under consideration, the company and the market.</div>
<div>BlackRock’s engagements emphasize direct dialogue with
corporate leadership on the governance issues identified in these principles that have a material impact on financial performance. These engagements enable us to cast informed votes aligned with clients’ long-term economic interests. We
generally prefer to engage in the first instance where we have concerns and give management time to address or resolve the issue. As a long-term investor, we are patient and persistent in working with our portfolio companies to have an open dialogue
and develop mutual understanding of governance matters, to promote the adoption of best practices and to assess the merits of a company’s approach to its governance. We monitor the companies in which we invest and engage with them
constructively and privately where we believe doing so helps protect shareholders’ interests. We do not try to micro-manage companies, or tell management and boards what to do. We present our views as a long-term shareholder and listen to
companies’ responses. The materiality and immediacy of a given issue will generally determine the level of our engagement and whom we seek to engage at the company, which could be management representatives or board directors.</div>
<div>Boards and directors</div>
<div>The performance of the board is critical to the economic
success of the company and to the protection of shareholders’ interests. Board members serve as agents of shareholders in overseeing the strategic direction and operation of the company. For this reason, BlackRock focuses on directors in many
of our engagements and sees the election of directors as one of our most important responsibilities in the proxy voting context.</div>
<div>We expect the board of directors to promote and protect
shareholder interests by:</div> <div>

relation to board structure) and why this approach is in the best interest of shareholders. We will seek to engage with the appropriate directors where we have concerns about the performance of the board or the company, the broad strategy of the
company, or the performance of individual board members. We believe that when a company is not effectively addressing a material issue, its directors should be held accountable.</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that directors should stand for re-election
on a regular basis. We assess directors nominated for election or re-election in the context of the composition of the board as a whole. There should be detailed disclosure of the relevant credentials of the individual directors in order for
shareholders to assess the caliber of an individual nominee. We expect there to be a sufficient number of independent directors on the board to ensure the protection of the interests of all shareholders. Common impediments to independence may
include but are not limited to:</div> <div>

 </td>
<td>having
 any other interest, business or other relationship which could, or could reasonably be perceived to, materially interfere with the director’s ability to act in the best interests of the company </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>BlackRock believes that the operation of the board is enhanced
when there is a clearly independent, senior non -executive director to chair it or, where the chairman is also the CEO (or is otherwise not independent), an independent lead director. The role of this director is to enhance the effectiveness of the
independent members of the board through shaping the agenda, ensuring adequate information is provided to the board and encouraging independent participation in board deliberations. The lead independent board director should be available to
shareholders in those situations where a director is best placed to explain and justify a company’s approach.</div>
<div>To ensure that the board remains effective, regular reviews of
board performance should be carried out and assessments made of gaps in skills or experience amongst the members. BlackRock believes it is beneficial for new directors to be brought onto the board periodically to refresh the group’s thinking
and to ensure both continuity and adequate succession planning. In identifying potential candidates, boards should take into consideration the multiple dimensions of diversity, including personal factors such as gender, ethnicity, and age; as well
as professional characteristics, such as a director’s industry, area of expertise, and geographic location. The board should review these dimensions of the current directors and how they might be augmented by incoming directors. We believe
that directors are in the best position to assess the optimal size for the board, but we would be concerned if a board seemed too small to have an appropriate balance of directors or too large to be effective.</div>
<div>There are matters for which the board has responsibility that
may involve a conflict of interest for executives or for affiliated directors. BlackRock believes that shareholders’ interests are best served when the board forms committees of fully independent directors to deal with such matters. In many
markets, these committees of the board specialize in audit, director nominations and compensation matters. An ad hoc committee might also be formed to decide on a special transaction, particularly one with a related party or to investigate a
significant adverse event.</div> <div>Auditors and audit-related
issues</div> <div>Comprehensive disclosure provides investors with
a sense of the company’s long-term operational risk management practices and, more broadly, the quality of the board’s oversight. In the absence of robust disclosures, we may reasonably conclude that companies are not adequately managing
risk.</div> <div>BlackRock recognizes the critical importance of
financial statements, which should provide a true and fair picture of a company’s financial condition. We will hold the members of the audit committee or equivalent responsible for overseeing the management of the audit function. We take
particular note of cases involving significant financial restatements or ad hoc notifications of material financial weakness.</div>
<div>The integrity of financial statements depends on the auditor
being free of any impediments to being an effective check on management. To that end, we believe it is important that auditors are, and are seen to be, independent. Where the audit firm provides services to the company in addition to the audit, the
fees earned should be disclosed and explained. Audit committees should have in place a procedure for assessing annually the independence of the auditor.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Capital
structure, mergers, asset sales and other special transactions</div>
<div>The capital structure of a company is critical to its owners,
the shareholders, as it impacts the value of their investment and the priority of their interest in the company relative to that of other equity or debt investors. Pre-emptive rights are a key protection for shareholders against the dilution of
their interests.</div> <div>Effective voting rights are central to
the rights of ownership and we believe strongly in one vote for one share as a guiding principle that supports good corporate governance. Shareholders, as the residual claimants, have the strongest interest in protecting company value, and voting
power should match economic exposure.</div> <div>We are concerned
that the creation of a dual share class may result in an over-concentration of power in the hands of a few shareholders, thus disenfranchising other shareholders and amplifying the potential conflict of interest, which the one share, one vote
principle is designed to mitigate. However, we recognize that in certain circumstances, companies may have a valid argument for dual-class listings, at least for a limited period of time. We believe that such companies should review these dual-class
structures on a regular basis or as company circumstances change. Additionally, they should receive shareholder approval of their capital structure on a periodic basis via a management proposal in the company’s proxy. The proposal should give
unaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to affirm the current structure or establish mechanisms to end or phase out controlling structures at the appropriate time, while minimizing costs to shareholders.</div>
<div>In assessing mergers, asset sales or other special
transactions, BlackRock’s primary consideration is the long -term economic interests of shareholders. Boards proposing a transaction need to clearly explain the economic and strategic rationale behind it. We will review a proposed transaction
to determine the degree to which it enhances long -term shareholder value. We would prefer that proposed transactions have the unanimous support of the board and have been negotiated at arm’s length. We may seek reassurance from the board that
executives’ and/or board members’ financial interests in a given transaction have not adversely affected their ability to place shareholders’ interests before their own. Where the transaction involves related parties, we would
expect the recommendation to support it to come from the independent directors and it is good practice to be approved by a separate vote of the non-conflicted shareholders.</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that shareholders have a right to dispose
of company shares in the open market without unnecessary restriction. In our view, corporate mechanisms designed to limit shareholders’ ability to sell their shares are contrary to basic property rights. Such mechanisms can serve to protect
and entrench interests other than those of the shareholders. We believe that shareholders are broadly capable of making decisions in their own best interests. We expect any so-called ‘shareholder rights plans’ proposed by a board to be
subject to shareholder approval upon introduction and periodically thereafter for continuation.</div>
<div>Compensation and benefits</div>
<div>BlackRock expects a company’s board of directors to put
in place a compensation structure that incentivizes and rewards executives appropriately and is aligned with shareholder interests, particularly generating sustainable long-term shareholder returns. We would expect the compensation committee to take
into account the specific circumstances of the company and the key individuals the board is trying to incentivize. We encourage companies to ensure that their compensation plans incorporate appropriate and challenging performance conditions
consistent with corporate strategy and market practice. We use third party research, in addition to our own analysis, to evaluate existing and proposed compensation structures. We hold members of the compensation committee or equivalent board
members accountable for poor compensation practices or structures.</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that there should be a clear link between
variable pay and company performance that drives shareholder returns. We are not supportive of one-off or special bonuses unrelated to company or individual performance. We acknowledge that the use of peer group evaluation by compensation committees
can help ensure competitive pay; however, we are concerned when increases in total compensation at a company are justified solely on peer benchmarking rather than outperformance. We support incentive plans that foster the sustainable achievement of
results relative to competitors. The vesting timeframes associated with incentive plans should facilitate a focus on long -term value creation. We believe consideration should be given to building claw back provisions into incentive plans such that
executives would be required to forgo rewards when they are not justified by actual performance. Compensation committees should guard against contractual arrangements that would entitle executives to material compensation for early termination of
their contract. Finally, pension contributions and other deferred compensation arrangements should be reasonable in light of market practice.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Non-executive directors should be compensated in a manner that
is commensurate with the time and effort expended in fulfilling their professional responsibilities. Additionally, these compensation arrangements should not risk compromising their independence or aligning their interests too closely with those of
the management, whom they are charged with overseeing.</div>
<div>Environmental and social issues</div>
<div>Our fiduciary duty to clients is to protect and enhance their
economic interest in the companies in which we invest on their behalf. It is within this context that we undertake our corporate governance activities. We believe that well -managed companies will deal effectively with the material environmental and
social (“E&amp;S”) factors relevant to their businesses.</div>
<div>Robust disclosure is essential for investors to effectively
gauge companies’ business practices and planning related to E&amp;S risks and opportunities.</div>
<div>BlackRock expects companies to issue reports aligned with the
recommendations of the Task Force on Climate -related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the standards put forward by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). We view the SASB and TCFD frameworks as complementary in achieving the goal of
disclosing more financially material information, particularly as it relates to industry -specific metrics and target setting. TCFD’s recommendations provide an overarching framework for disclosure on the business implications of climate
change, and potentially other E&amp;S factors. We find SASB’s industry-specific guidance (as identified in its materiality map) beneficial in helping companies identify and discuss their governance, risk assessments, and performance against
these key performance indicators (KPIs). Any global standards adopted, peer group benchmarking undertaken, and verification processes in place should also be disclosed and discussed in this context.</div>
<div>BlackRock has been engaging with companies for several years
on disclosure of material E&amp;S factors. Given the increased understanding of sustainability risks and opportunities, and the need for better information to assess them, we specifically ask companies to:</div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>1)
 </td>
<td>publish a disclosure in line
with industry-specific SASB guidelines by year-end, if they have not already done so, or disclose a similar set of data in a way that is relevant to their particular business; and </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>2)
 </td>
<td>disclose
climate-related risks in line with the TCFD’s recommendations, if they have not already done so. This should include the company’s plan for operating under a scenario where the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to
less than two degrees is fully realized, as expressed by the TCFD guidelines. </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>See our
<font>commentary</font><font> </font>on our approach to engagement on TCFD and SASB aligned reporting for greater detail of our expectations.</div>
<div>We will use these disclosures and our engagements to ascertain
whether companies are properly managing and overseeing these risks within their business and adequately planning for the future. In the absence of robust disclosures, investors, including BlackRock, will increasingly conclude that companies are not
adequately managing risk.</div> <div>We believe that when a company
is not effectively addressing a material issue, its directors should be held accountable. We will generally engage directly with the board or management of a company when we identify issues. We may vote against the election of directors where we
have concerns that a company might not be dealing with E&amp;S factors appropriately.</div>
<div>Sometimes we may reflect such concerns by supporting a
shareholder proposal on the issue, where there seems to be either a significant potential threat or realized harm to shareholders’ interests caused by poor management of material E&amp;S factors.</div>
<div>In deciding our course of action, we will assess the
company’s disclosures and the nature of our engagement with the company on the issue over time, including whether:</div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>The company has already
taken sufficient steps to address the concern </td></tr>

process of actively implementing a response </td></tr>

 is a clear and material economic disadvantage to the company in the near-term if the issue is not addressed in the manner requested by the shareholder proposal </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>We do not see it as our role to make social or political
judgments on behalf of clients. Our consideration of these E&amp;S factors is consistent with protecting the long-term economic interest of our clients’ assets. We expect investee companies to comply,</div> </div>

<div>Within the framework laid out above, as well as our guidance
on “<font>How BlackRock Investment Stewardship engages on climate risk</font>,” we believe that climate presents significant investment risks and opportunities that may impact the long - term financial
sustainability of companies. We believe that the reporting frameworks developed by TCFD and SASB provide useful guidance to companies on identifying, managing, and reporting on climate -related risks and opportunities.</div>
<div>We expect companies to help their investors understand how the
company may be impacted by climate risk, in the context of its ability to realize a long-term strategy and generate value over time. We expect companies to convey their governance around this issue through their corporate disclosures aligned with
TCFD and SASB. For companies in sectors that are significantly exposed to climate-related risk, we expect the whole board to have demonstrable fluency in how climate risk affects the business and how management approaches assessing, adapting to, and
mitigating that risk.</div> <div>Where a company receives a
shareholder proposal related to climate risk, in addition to the factors laid out above, our assessment will take into account the robustness of the company’s existing disclosures as well as our understanding of its management of the issues as
revealed through our engagements with the company and board members over time. In certain instances, we may disagree with the details of a climate-related shareholder proposal but agree that the company in question has not made sufficient progress
on climate-related disclosures. In these instances, we may not support the proposal, but may vote against the election of relevant directors.</div>
<div>General corporate governance matters and shareholder
protections</div> <div>BlackRock believes that shareholders have a
right to timely and detailed information on the financial performance and viability of the companies in which they invest. In addition, companies should also publish information on the governance structures in place and the rights of shareholders to
influence these. The reporting and disclosure provided by companies help shareholders assess whether their economic interests have been protected and the quality of the board’s oversight of management. We believe shareholders should have the
right to vote on key corporate governance matters, including changes to governance mechanisms, to submit proposals to the shareholders’ meeting and to call special meetings of shareholders.</div>
<div>BLACKROCK’S OVERSIGHT OF ITS INVESTMENT STEWARDSHIP
ACTIVITIES</div> <div>Oversight</div>
<div>We hold ourselves to a very high standard in our investment
stewardship activities, including proxy voting. This function is executed by a team called BlackRock Investment Stewardship (“BIS”) which is comprised of BlackRock employees who do not have other responsibilities other than their roles
in BIS. BIS is considered an investment function. The team does not have sales responsibilities.</div>
<div>BlackRock maintains three regional advisory committees
(“Stewardship Advisory Committees”) for (a) the Americas; (b) Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and (c) Asia-Pacific, generally consisting of senior BlackRock investment professionals and/or senior employees with
practical boardroom experience. The regional Stewardship Advisory Committees review and advise on amendments to the proxy voting guidelines covering markets within each respective region (“Guidelines”).</div>
<div>In addition to the regional Stewardship Advisory Committees,
the Investment Stewardship Global Oversight Committee (“Global Committee”) is a risk-focused committee, comprised of senior representatives from various BlackRock investment teams, BlackRock’s Deputy General Counsel, the Global
Head of Investment Stewardship (“Global Head”), and other senior executives with relevant experience and team oversight.</div>
<div>The Global Head has primary oversight of the activities of
BIS, including voting in accordance with the Guidelines, which require the application of professional judgment and consideration of each company’s unique circumstances. The Global Committee reviews and approves amendments to these Global
Corporate Governance &amp; Engagement Principles. The Global</div> </div> <div type="Block">

approves amendments to the regional Guidelines, as proposed by the regional Stewardship Advisory Committees.</div>
<div>In addition, the Global Committee receives and reviews
periodic reports regarding the votes cast by BIS, as well as regular updates on material process issues, procedural changes and other risk oversight considerations. The Global Committee reviews these reports in an oversight capacity as informed by
the BIS corporate governance engagement program and Guidelines.</div>
<div>BIS carries out engagement with companies, monitors and
executes proxy votes, and conducts vote operations (including maintaining records of votes cast) in a manner consistent with the relevant Guidelines. BIS also conducts research on corporate governance issues and participates in industry discussions
to keep abreast of important developments in the corporate governance field. BIS may utilize third parties for certain of the foregoing activities and performs oversight of those third parties. BIS may raise complicated or particularly controversial
matters for internal discussion with the relevant investment teams and/or refer such matters to the appropriate regional Stewardship Advisory Committees for review, discussion and guidance prior to making a voting decision.</div>
<div>Vote execution</div>
<div>We carefully consider proxies submitted to funds and other
fiduciary account(s) (“Fund” or “Funds”) for which we have voting authority. BlackRock votes (or refrains from voting) proxies for each Fund for which we have voting authority based on our evaluation of the best long-term
economic interests of shareholders, in the exercise of our independent business judgment, and without regard to the relationship of the issuer of the proxy (or any shareholder proponent or dissident shareholder) to the Fund, the Fund’s
affiliates (if any), BlackRock or BlackRock’s affiliates, or BlackRock employees (see “Conflicts management policies and procedures”, below).</div>
<div>When exercising voting rights, BlackRock will normally vote on
specific proxy issues in accordance with the Guidelines for the relevant market. The Guidelines are reviewed regularly and are amended consistent with changes in the local market practice, as developments in corporate governance occur, or as
otherwise deemed advisable by BlackRock’s Stewardship Advisory Committees. BIS may, in the exercise of their professional judgment, conclude that the Guidelines do not cover the specific matter upon which a proxy vote is required or that an
exception to the Guidelines would be in the best long - term economic interests of BlackRock’s clients.</div>
<div>In the uncommon circumstance of there being a vote with
respect to fixed income securities or the securities of privately held issuers, the decision generally will be made by a Fund's portfolio managers and/or BIS based on their assessment of the particular transactions or other matters at issue.</div>
<div>In certain markets, proxy voting involves logistical issues
which can affect BlackRock’s ability to vote such proxies, as well as the desirability of voting such proxies. These issues include but are not limited to: (i) untimely notice of shareholder meetings; (ii) restrictions on a foreigner’s
ability to exercise votes; (iii) requirements to vote proxies in person; (iv) “share- blocking” (requirements that investors who exercise their voting rights surrender the right to dispose of their holdings for some specified period in
proximity to the shareholder meeting); (v) potential difficulties in translating the proxy; (vi) regulatory constraints; and (vii) requirements to provide local agents with unrestricted powers of attorney to facilitate voting instructions. We are
not supportive of impediments to the exercise of voting rights such as share-blocking or overly burdensome administrative requirements.</div>
<div>As a consequence, BlackRock votes proxies on a
“best-efforts” basis. In addition, BIS may determine that it is generally in the best interests of BlackRock’s clients not to vote proxies if the costs (including but not limited to opportunity costs associated with share-blocking
constraints) associated with exercising a vote are expected to outweigh the benefit the client would derive by voting on the proposal.</div>
<div>Portfolio managers have full discretion to vote the shares in
the Funds they manage based on their analysis of the economic impact of a particular ballot item. Portfolio managers may from time to time reach differing views on how best to maximize economic value with respect to a particular investment.
Therefore, portfolio managers may, and sometimes do, vote shares in the Funds under their management differently from one another. However, because BlackRock’s clients are mostly long-term investors with long-term economic goals, ballots are
frequently cast in a uniform manner.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

the independent fiduciary’s determination. BlackRock uses an independent fiduciary to vote proxies of (i) any company that is affiliated with BlackRock, Inc., (ii) any public company that includes BlackRock employees on its board of directors,
(iii) The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., (iv) any public company of which a BlackRock, Inc. board member serves as a senior executive, and (v) companies when legal or regulatory requirements compel BlackRock to use an independent fiduciary. In

and operational capacity to accurately deliver the assigned votes in a timely manner. We may engage more than one independent fiduciary, in part in order to mitigate potential or perceived conflicts of interest at an independent fiduciary. The

<div>When so authorized, BlackRock acts as a securities lending
agent on behalf of Funds. With regard to the relationship between securities lending and proxy voting, BlackRock’s approach is driven by our clients’ economic interests. The decision whether to recall securities on loan to vote is based
on a formal analysis of the revenue producing value to clients of loans, against the assessed economic value of casting votes. Generally, we expect that the likely economic value to clients of casting votes would be less than the securities lending
income, either because, in our assessment, the resolutions being voted on will not have significant economic consequences or because the outcome would not be affected by BlackRock recalling loaned securities in order to vote. BlackRock also may, in
our discretion, determine that the value of voting outweighs the cost of recalling shares, and thus recall shares to vote in that instance.</div>

whether to recall securities on loan in order to vote and may modify it as necessary.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

guidelines should be read in conjunction with the BlackRock Investment Stewardship Global Corporate Governance Guidelines &amp; Engagement Principles (See Appendix A2 of this SAI).</div>
<div>INTRODUCTION</div>
<div>BlackRock, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively,
“BlackRock”) seek to make proxy voting decisions in the manner most likely to protect and enhance the economic value of the securities held in client accounts. The following issue-specific proxy voting guidelines (the
“Guidelines”) are intended to summarize BlackRock Investment Stewardship’s general philosophy and approach to corporate governance issues that most commonly arise in proxy voting for U.S. securities. These Guidelines are not
intended to limit the analysis of individual issues at specific companies and are not intended to provide a guide to how BlackRock will vote in every instance. Rather, they share our view about corporate governance issues generally, and provide
insight into how we typically approach issues that commonly arise on corporate ballots , as well as our expectations of boards of directors. They are applied with discretion, taking into consideration the range of issues and facts specific to the
company and the individual ballot item.</div> <div>VOTING
GUIDELINES</div> <div>These guidelines are divided into eight key
themes which group together the issues that frequently appear on the agenda of annual and extraordinary meetings of shareholders:</div> <div>

DIRECTORS</div> <div>Director elections</div>
<div>In general, BlackRock supports the election of directors as
recommended by the board in uncontested elections. However, we believe that when a company is not effectively addressing a material issue, its directors should be held account able. We may withhold votes from directors or members of particular board
committees in certain situations, as indicated below .</div>
<div>Independence</div>
<div>We expect a majority of the directors on the board to be
independent. In addition, all members of key committees, including audit, compensation, and nominating / governance committees, should be independent. Our view of independence may vary slightly from listing standards.</div>
<div>In particular, common impediments to independence in the U.S.
may include:</div> <div>
<table>

 </td>
<td>Employment as a senior
executive by the company or a subsidiary within the past five years </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>An equity ownership in the
company in excess of 20% </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Having
 any other interest, business, or relationship which could, or could reasonably be perceived to, materially interfere with the director’s ability to act in the best interests of the company </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>We may vote against directors serving on key committees that
we do not consider to be independent.</div> <div>When evaluating
controlled companies, as defined by the U.S. stock exchanges, we will only vote against insiders or affiliates who sit on the audit committee, but not other key committees.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>Oversight</div>
<div>We expect the board to exercise appropriate oversight over
management and business activities of the company. We will consider voting against committee members and / or individual directors in the following circumstances:</div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Where the
board has failed to exercise oversight with regard to accounting practices or audit oversight, we will consider voting against the current audit committee, and any other members of the board who may be responsible. For example, this may apply to
members of the audit committee during a period when the board failed to facilitate quality, independent auditing if substantial accounting irregularities suggest insufficient oversight by that committee </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Members
of the compensation committee during a period in which executive compensation appears excessive relative to performance and peers, and where we believe the compensation committee has not already substantially addressed this issue </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>The chair
of the nominating / governance committee, or where no chair exists, the nominating / governance committee member with the longest tenure, where the board is not comprised of a majority of independent directors. However, this would not apply in the
case of a controlled company </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Where it
appears the director has acted (at the company or at other companies) in a manner that compromises his / her reliability to represent the best long-term economic interests of shareholders </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Where a
director has a pattern of poor attendance at combined board and applicable key committee meetings. Excluding exigent circumstances, BlackRock generally considers attendance at less than 75% of the combined board and applicable key committee meetings
by a board member to be poor attendance </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Where
 a director serves on an excess number of boards, which may limit his / her capacity to focus on each board’s requirements. The following illustrates the maximum number of boards on which a director may serve, before he / she is considered to
be over-committed: </td></tr></table> </div>

shareholders</div> <div>We expect a board to be engaged and
responsive to its shareholders. Where we believe a board has not substantially addressed shareholder concerns, we may vote against the appropriate committees and / or individual directors. The following illustrates common circumstances:</div>
<div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>The
independent chair or lead independent director, members of the nominating / governance committee, and / or the longest tenured director(s), where we observe a lack of board responsiveness to shareholders, evidence of board entrenchment, and / or
failure to promote adequate board succession planning </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>The chair
of the nominating / governance committee, or where no chair exists, the nominating / governance committee member with the longest tenure, where board member(s) at the most recent election of directors have received withhold votes from more than 30%
of shares voted and the board has not taken appropriate action to respond to shareholder concerns. This may not apply in cases where BlackRock did not support the initial withhold vote </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>The
 independent chair or lead independent director and / or members of the nominating / governance committee, where a board fails to implement shareholder proposals that receive a majority of votes cast at a prior shareholder meeting, and the
proposals, in our view, have a direct and substantial impact on shareholders’ fundamental rights or long-term economic interests </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>Shareholder rights</div>
<div>We expect a board to act with integrity and to uphold
governance best practices. Where we believe a board has not acted in the best interests of its shareholders, we may vote against the appropriate committees and / or individual directors. The following illustrates common circumstances:</div> </div>

 a board maintains a classified structure, it is possible that the director(s) with whom we have a particular concern may not be subject to election in the year that the concern arises. In such situations, if we have a concern regarding a committee
or committee chair that is not up for re-election, we will generally register our concern by withholding votes from all available members of the relevant committee </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>Board composition and effectiveness</div>
<div>We encourage boards to periodically renew their membership to
ensure relevant skills and experience within the boardroom. To this end, regular performance reviews and skills assessments should be conducted by the nominating / governance committee.</div>
<div>Furthermore, we expect boards to be comprised of a diverse
selection of individuals who bring their personal and professional experiences to bear in order to create a constructive debate of competing views and opinions in the boardroom. We recognize that diversity has multiple dimensions. In identifying
potential candidates, boards should take into consideration the full breadth of diversity including personal factors, such as gender, ethnicity, and age; as well as professional characteristics, such as a director’s industry, area of
expertise, and geographic location. In addition to other elements of diversity, we encourage companies to have at least two women directors on their board. Our publicly available <font>commentary</font><sup> </sup>explains our approach to engaging on board diversity.</div>
<div>We encourage boards to disclose their views on:</div>
<div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>The mix
of competencies, experience, and other qualities required to effectively oversee and guide management in light of the stated long-term strategy of the company </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>The
process by which candidates are identified and selected, including whether professional firms or other sources outside of incumbent directors’ networks have been engaged to identify and / or assess candidates </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>The
process by which boards evaluate themselves and any significant outcomes of the evaluation process, without divulging inappropriate and / or sensitive details </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>The
 consideration given to board diversity, including, but not limited to, gender, ethnicity, race, age, experience, geographic location, skills, and perspective in the nomination process </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>While we support regular board refreshment, we are not opposed
in principle to long-tenured directors, nor do we believe that long board tenure is necessarily an impediment to director independence. A variety of director tenures within the boardroom can be beneficial to ensure board quality and continuity of
experience.</div> <div>Our primary concern is that board members
are able to contribute effectively as corporate strategy evolves and business conditions change, and that all directors, regardless of tenure, demonstrate appropriate responsiveness to shareholders. We acknowledge that no single person can be
expected to bring all relevant skill sets to a board; at the same time, we generally do not believe it is necessary or appropriate to have any particular director on the board solely by virtue of a singular background or specific area of
expertise.</div> <div>Where boards find that age limits or term
limits are the most efficient and objective mechanism for ensuring periodic board refreshment, we generally defer to the board’s determination in setting such limits.</div>
<div>To the extent that we believe that a company has not
adequately accounted for diversity in its board composition within a reasonable timeframe, we may vote against the nominating / governance committee for an apparent lack of commitment to board effectiveness.</div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Board
size</div> <div>We typically defer to the board in setting the
appropriate size and believe directors are generally in the best position to assess the optimal board size to ensure effectiveness. However, we may oppose boards that appear too small to allow for effective shareholder representation or too large to
function efficiently.</div> <div>CEO and management succession
planning</div> <div>There should be a robust CEO and senior
management succession plan in place at the board level that is reviewed and updated on a regular basis. We expect succession planning to cover both long-term planning consistent with the strategic direction of the company and identified leadership
needs over time, as well as short-term planning in the event of an unanticipated executive departure. We encourage the company to explain its executive succession planning process, including where accountability lies within the boardroom for this
task, without prematurely divulging sensitive information commonly associated with this exercise.</div>
<div>Classified board of directors / staggered terms</div>
<div>We believe that directors should be re-elected annually and
that classification of the board generally limits shareholders’ rights to regularly evaluate a board’s performance and select directors. While we will typically support proposals requesting board de-classification, we may make
exceptions, should the board articulate an appropriate strategic rationale for a classified board structure, such as when a company needs consistency and stability during a time of transition, e.g. newly public companies or companies undergoing a
strategic restructuring. A classified board structure may also be justified at non-operating companies in certain circumstances. We would, however, expect boards with a classified structure to periodically review the rationale for such structure and
consider when annual elections might be appropriate.</div>
<div>Without a voting mechanism to immediately address concerns of
a specific director, we may choose to vote against or withhold votes from the available slate of directors by default (see “Shareholder rights” for additional detail).</div>
<div>Contested director elections</div>
<div>The details of contested elections, or proxy contests, are
assessed on a case-by-case basis. We evaluate a number of factors, which may include: the qualifications of the dissident and management candidates; the validity of the concerns identified by the dissident; the viability of both the
dissident’s and management’s plans; the likelihood that the dissident’s solutions will produce the desired change; and whether the dissident represents the best option for enhancing long -term shareholder value.</div>
<div>Cumulative voting</div>
<div>We believe that a majority vote standard is in the best long
-term interest of shareholders. It ensures director accountability via the requirement to be elected by more than half of the votes cast. As such, we will generally oppose proposals requesting the adoption of cumulative voting, which may
disproportionately aggregate votes on certain issues or director candidates.</div>
<div>Director compensation and equity programs</div>
<div>We believe that compensation for directors should be
structured to attract and retain the best possible directors, while also aligning their interests with those of shareholders. We believe director compensation packages that are based on the company’s long-term value creation and include some
form of long-term equity compensation are more likely to meet this goal. In addition, we expect directors to build meaningful share ownership over time.</div>
<div>Majority vote requirements</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that directors should generally be elected
by a majority of the shares voted and will normally support proposals seeking to introduce bylaws requiring a majority vote standard for director elections. Majority voting standards assist in ensuring that directors who are not broadly supported by
shareholders are not elected to serve as their representatives. Some companies with a plurality voting standard have adopted a resignation policy for directors who do not receive support from at least a majority of votes cast. Where we believe that
the company already has a sufficiently robust majority voting process in place, we may not support a shareholder proposal seeking an alternative mechanism.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Risk
oversight</div> <div>Companies should have an established process
for identifying, monitoring, and managing key risks. Independent directors should have ready access to relevant management information and outside advice, as appropriate, to ensure they can properly oversee risk management. We encourage companies to
provide transparency around risk measurement, mitigation, and reporting to the board. We are particularly interested in understanding how risk oversight processes evolve in response to changes in corporate strategy and / or shifts in the business
and related risk environment. Comprehensive disclosure provides investors with a sense of the company’s long -term operational risk management practices and, more broadly, the quality of the board’s oversight. In the absence of robust
disclosures, we may reasonably conclude that companies are not adequately managing risk.</div>
<div>Separation of chairman and CEO</div>
<div>We believe that independent leadership is important in the
boardroom. In the U.S. there are two commonly accepted structures for independent board leadership: 1) an independent chairman; or 2) a lead independent director when the roles of chairman and CEO are combined.</div>
<div>In the absence of a significant governance concern, we defer
to boards to designate the most appropriate leadership structure to ensure adequate balance and independence.</div>
<div>In the event that the board chooses a combined chair / CEO
model, we generally support the designation of a lead independent director if they have the power to: 1) provide formal input into board meeting agendas; 2) call meetings of the independent directors; and 3) preside at meetings of independent
directors. Furthermore, while we anticipate that most directors will be elected annually, we believe an element of continuity is important for this role for an extended period of time to provide appropriate leadership balance to the chair /
CEO.</div> <div>The following table illustrates examples of
responsibilities under each board leadership model:</div> <div>

<div>AUDITORS AND AUDIT-RELATED ISSUES</div>
<div>BlackRock recognizes the critical importance of financial
statements to provide a complete and accurate portrayal of a company’s financial condition. Consistent with our approach to voting on boards of directors, we seek to hold the audit committee of the board responsible for overseeing the
management of the audit function at a company, and may withhold votes from the audit committee members where the board has failed to facilitate quality, independent auditing. We look to</div> </div>

effectively fulfilling its role. To that end, we favor an independent auditor. In addition, to the extent that an auditor fails to reasonably identify and address issues that eventually lead to a significant financial restatement, or the audit firm
has violated standards of practice that protect the interests of shareholders, we may also vote against ratification.</div>
<div>From time to time, shareholder proposals may be presented to
promote auditor independence or the rotation of audit firms. We may support these proposals when they are consistent with our views as described above.</div>
<div>CAPITAL STRUCTURE PROPOSALS</div>
<div>Equal voting rights</div>
<div>BlackRock believes that shareholders should be entitled to
voting rights in proportion to their economic interests. We believe that companies that look to add or already have dual or multiple class share structures should review these structures on a regular basis or as company circumstances change.
Companies should receive shareholder approval of their capital structure on a periodic basis via a management proposal on the company’s proxy. The proposal should give unaffiliated shareholders the opportunity to affirm the current structure
or establish mechanisms to end or phase out controlling structures at the appropriate time, while minimizing costs to shareholders. Equal voting rights</div>

<div>Blank check preferred stock</div>
<div>We frequently oppose proposals requesting authorization of a
class of preferred stock with unspecified voting, conversion, dividend distribution, and other rights (“blank check” preferred stock) because they may serve as a transfer of authority from shareholders to the board and as a possible
entrenchment device. We generally view the board’s discretion to establish voting rights on a when-issued basis as a potential anti-takeover device, as it affords the board the ability to place a block of stock with an investor sympathetic to
management, thereby foiling a takeover bid without a shareholder vote.</div>
<div>Nonetheless, we may support the proposal where the
company:</div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Appears to have a legitimate
financing motive for requesting blank check authority </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Has committed publicly that
blank check preferred shares will not be used for anti-takeover purposes </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Has a history of using blank
check preferred stock for financings </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Has
 blank check preferred stock previously outstanding such that an increase would not necessarily provide further anti-takeover protection but may provide greater financing flexibility </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>Increase in authorized common shares</div>
<div>BlackRock considers industry-specific norms in our analysis of
these proposals, as well as a company’s history with respect to the use of its common shares. Generally, we are predisposed to support a company if the board believes additional common shares are necessary to carry out the firm’s
business. The most substantial concern we might have with an increase is the possibility of use of common shares to fund a poison pill plan that is not in the economic interests of shareholders.</div>
<div>Increase or issuance of preferred stock</div>
<div>We generally support proposals to increase or issue preferred
stock in cases where the company specifies the voting, dividend, conversion, and other rights of such stock where the terms of the preferred stock appear reasonable.</div> </div> <div type="Block">

splits</div> <div>We generally support stock splits that are not
likely to negatively affect the ability to trade shares or the economic value of a share. We generally support reverse stock splits that are designed to avoid delisting or to facilitate trading in the stock, where the reverse split will not have a
negative impact on share value (e.g<font>.</font> one class is reduced while others remain at pre- split levels). In the event of a proposal for a reverse split that would not also proportionately reduce the
company’s authorized stock, we apply the same analysis we would use for a proposal to increase authorized stock.</div>
<div>MERGERS, ASSET SALES, AND OTHER SPECIAL TRANSACTIONS</div>
<div>BlackRock’s primary concern is the best long-term
economic interests of shareholders. While merger, asset sales, and other special transaction proposals vary widely in scope and substance, we closely examine certain salient features in our analyses, such as:</div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>The
degree to which the proposed transaction represents a premium to the company’s trading price. We consider the share price over multiple time periods prior to the date of the merger announcement. In most cases, business combinations should
provide a premium. We may consider comparable transaction analyses provided by the parties’ financial advisors and our own valuation assessments. For companies facing insolvency or bankruptcy, a premium may not apply </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>There should be clear
strategic, operational, and / or financial rationale for the combination </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Unanimous
board approval and arm’s-length negotiations are preferred. We will consider whether the transaction involves a dissenting board or does not appear to be the result of an arm’s-length bidding process. We may also consider whether
executive and / or board members’ financial interests in a given transaction appear likely to affect their ability to place shareholders’ interests before their own </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>We
 prefer transaction proposals that include the fairness opinion of a reputable financial advisor assessing the value of the transaction to shareholders in comparison to recent similar transactions </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>Poison pill plans</div>
<div>Where a poison pill is put to a shareholder vote by
management, our policy is to examine these plans individually. Although we oppose most plans, we may support plans that include a reasonable “qualifying offer clause.” Such clauses typically require shareholder ratification of the pill
and stipulate a sunset provision whereby the pill expires unless it is renewed.</div>
<div>These clauses also tend to specify that an all cash bid for
all shares that includes a fairness opinion and evidence of financing does not trigger the pill, but forces either a special meeting at which the offer is put to a shareholder vote, or the board to seek the written consent of shareholders where
shareholders could rescind the pill at their discretion. We may also support a pill where it is the only effective method for protecting tax or other economic benefits that may be associated with limiting the ownership changes of individual
shareholders.</div> <div>We generally vote in favor of shareholder
proposals to rescind poison pills.</div> <div>Reimbursement of
expenses for successful shareholder campaigns</div> <div>We
generally do not support shareholder proposals seeking the reimbursement of proxy contest expenses, even in situations where we support the shareholder campaign. We believe that introducing the possibility of such reimbursement may incentivize
disruptive and unnecessary shareholder campaigns.</div>
<div>EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION</div>
<div>We note that there are both management and shareholder
proposals related to executive compensation. We generally vote on these proposals as described below, except that we typically oppose shareholder proposals on issues where the company already has a reasonable policy in place that we believe is
sufficient to address the issue. We may also oppose a shareholder proposal regarding executive compensation if the company’s history suggests that the issue raised is not likely to present a problem for that company.</div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>Advisory
resolutions on executive compensation (“Say on Pay”)</div>
<div>In cases where there is a Say on Pay vote, BlackRock will
respond to the proposal as informed by our evaluation of compensation practices at that particular company and in a manner that appropriately addresses the specific question posed to shareholders. In a commentary on our website, entitled “<font>BlackRock Investment Stewardship’s approach to executive compensation</font>,” we explain our beliefs and expectations related to executive compensation practices, our Say on Pay analysis framework,
and our typical approach to engagement and voting on Say on Pay.</div>
<div>Advisory votes on the frequency of Say on Pay resolutions</div>
<div>BlackRock will generally support triennial pay frequency
votes, but we defer to the board to determine the appropriate timeframe upon which pay should be reviewed. In evaluating pay, we believe that the compensation committee is responsible for constructing a plan that appropriately incentivizes
executives for long-term value creation, utilizing relevant metrics and structure to ensure overall pay and performance alignment. In a similar vein, we defer to the board to establish the most appropriate timeframe for review of pay structure,
absent a change in strategy that would suggest otherwise.</div>
<div>However, we may support an annual pay frequency vote in some
situations, for example, where we conclude that a company has failed to align pay with performance. In these circumstances, we will also consider voting against the compensation committee members.</div>
<div>Claw back proposals</div>
<div>We generally favor recoupment from any senior executive whose
compensation was based on faulty financial reporting or deceptive business practices. In addition to fraudulent acts, we also favor recoupment from any senior executive whose behavior caused direct financial harm to shareholders, reputational risk
to the company , or resulted in a criminal investigation, even if such actions did not ultimately result in a material restatement of past results. This includes, but is not limited to, settlement agreements arising from such behavior and paid for
directly by the company. We typically support shareholder proposals on these matters unless the company already has a robust claw back policy that sufficiently addresses our concerns.</div>
<div>Employee stock purchase plans</div>
<div>We believe these plans can provide performance incentives and
help align employees’ interests with those of shareholders. The most common form of employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) qualifies for favorable tax treatment under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. We will typically
support qualified ESPP proposals.</div> <div>Equity compensation
plans</div> <div>BlackRock supports equity plans that align the
economic interests of directors, managers, and other employees with those of shareholders. We believe that boards should establish policies prohibiting the use of equity awards in a manner that could disrupt the intended alignment with shareholder
interests (e.g. the use of stock as collateral for a loan; the use of stock in a margin account; the use of stock or an unvested award in hedging or derivative transactions). We may support shareholder proposals requesting the establishment of such
policies.</div> <div>Our evaluation of equity compensation plans is
based on a company’s executive pay and performance relative to peers and whether the plan plays a significant role in a pay-for-performance disconnect. We generally oppose plans that contain “evergreen” provisions, which allow for
the unlimited increase of shares reserved without requiring further shareholder approval after a reasonable time period. We also generally oppose plans that allow for repricing without shareholder approval. We may also oppose plans that provide for
the acceleration of vesting of equity awards even in situations where an actual change of control may not occur. We encourage companies to structure their change of control provisions to require the termination of the covered employee before
acceleration or special payments are triggered.</div> <div>Golden
parachutes</div> <div>We generally view golden parachutes as
encouragement to management to consider transactions that might be beneficial to shareholders. However, a large potential pay-out under a golden parachute arrangement also presents the risk of motivating a management team to support a sub-optimal
sale price for a company. When determining whether to support or oppose an</div> </div> <div type="Block">

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>advisory vote on a golden
parachute plan, we normally support the plan unless it appears to result in payments that are excessive or detrimental to shareholders. In evaluating golden parachute plans, BlackRock may consider several factors, including:</div>
<div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Whether we believe that the
triggering event is in the best interest of shareholders </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Whether management attempted
to maximize shareholder value in the triggering event </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>The
percentage of total premium or transaction value that will be transferred to the management team, rather than shareholders, as a result of the golden parachute payment </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Whether excessively large
excise tax gross-up payments are part of the pay-out </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Whether
the pay package that serves as the basis for calculating the golden parachute payment was reasonable in light of performance and peers </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Whether
 the golden parachute payment will have the effect of rewarding a management team that has failed to effectively manage the company </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>It may be difficult to anticipate the results of a plan until
after it has been triggered; as a result, BlackRock may vote against a golden parachute proposal even if the golden parachute plan under review was approved by shareholders when it was implemented.</div>
<div>We may support shareholder proposals requesting that
implementation of such arrangements require shareholder approval. We generally support proposals requiring shareholder approval of plans that exceed 2.99 times an executive’s current salary and bonus, including equity compensation.</div>
<div>Option exchanges</div>
<div>We believe that there may be legitimate instances where
underwater options create an overhang on a company’s capital structure and a repricing or option exchange may be warranted. We will evaluate these instances on a case -by-case basis. BlackRock may support a request to reprice or exchange
underwater options under the following circumstances:</div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>The
company has experienced significant stock price decline as a result of macroeconomic trends, not individual company performance </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Directors
and executive officers are excluded; the exchange is value neutral or value creative to shareholders; tax, accounting, and other technical considerations have been fully contemplated </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>There
 is clear evidence that absent repricing, the company will suffer serious employee incentive or retention and recruiting problems </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>BlackRock may also support a request to exchange underwater
options in other circumstances, if we determine that the exchange is in the best interest of shareholders.</div>
<div>Pay-for-Performance plans</div>
<div>In order for executive compensation exceeding $1 million USD
to qualify for federal tax deductions, related to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (“OBRA”) requires companies to link compensation for the company’s top five executives to
disclosed performance goals and submit the plans for shareholder approval. The law further requires that a compensation committee comprised solely of outside directors administer these plans. Because the primary objective of these proposals is to
preserve the deductibility of such compensation, we generally favor approval in order to preserve net income.</div>
<div>Supplemental executive retirement plans</div>
<div>BlackRock may support shareholder proposals requesting to put
extraordinary benefits contained in Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans (“SERP”) agreements to a shareholder vote unless the company’s executive pension plans do not contain excessive benefits beyond what is offered under
employee-wide plans.</div> <div>ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL

effectively with the material environmental and social (“E&amp;S”) factors relevant to their businesses. Robust disclosure is essential for investors to effectively gauge companies’ business practices and planning related to E&amp;
S risks and opportunities.</div> <div>BlackRock expects companies
to issue reports aligned with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate -related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the standards put forward by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). We view the SASB and TCFD frameworks as
complementary in achieving the goal of disclosing more financially material information, particularly as it relates to industry -specific metrics and target setting. TCFD’s recommendations provide an overarching framework for disclosure on the
business implications of climate change, and potentially other E&amp;S factors. We find SASB’s industry-specific guidance (as identified in its materiality map) beneficial in helping companies identify and discuss their governance, risk
assessments, and performance against these key performance indicators (KPIs). Any global standards adopted, peer group benchmarking undertaken, and verification process in place should also be disclosed and discussed in this context.</div>
<div>BlackRock has been engaging with companies for several years
on disclosure of material E&amp;S factors. Given the increased understanding of sustainability risks and opportunities, and the need for better information to assess them, we specifically ask companies to:</div> <div>
<table>
<tr>

 </td>
<td>Publish
disclosures in line with industry specific SASB guidelines by year-end, if they have not already done so, or disclose a similar set of data in a way that is relevant to their particular business; and </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>Disclose
 climate-related risks in line with the TCFD’s recommendations, if they have not already done so. This should include the company’s plan for operating under a scenario where the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to
less than two degrees is fully realized, as expressed by the TCFD guidelines. </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>See our
<font>commentary</font> on our approach to engagement on TCFD and SASB aligned reporting for greater detail of our expectations.</div>
<div>We will use these disclosures and our engagements to ascertain
whether companies are properly managing and overseeing these risks within their business and adequately planning for the future. In the absence of robust disclosures, investors, including BlackRock, will increasingly conclude that companies are not
adequately managing risk.</div> <div>We believe that when a company
is not effectively addressing a material issue, its directors should be held accountable. We will generally engage directly with the board or management of a company when we identify issues. We may vote against the election of directors where we
have concerns that a company might not be dealing with E&amp;S factors appropriately.</div>
<div>Sometimes we may reflect such concerns by supporting a
shareholder proposal on the issue, where there seems to be either a significant potential threat or realized harm to shareholders’ interests caused by poor management of material E&amp;S factors. In deciding our course of action, we will
assess the nature of our engagement with the company on the issue over time, including whether:</div> <div>
<table>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>The company has already
taken sufficient steps to address the concern </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>The company is in the
process of actively implementing a response </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>•
 </td>
<td>There
 is a clear and material economic disadvantage to the company in the near-term if the issue is not addressed in the manner requested by the shareholder proposal </td></tr></table> </div>
<div>We do not see it as our role to make social, ethical, or
political judgments on behalf of clients, but rather, to protect the ir long-term economic interests as shareholders. We expect investee companies to comply, at a minimum, with the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they operate.
They should explain how they manage situations where such laws or regulations are contradictory or ambiguous.</div>
<div>Climate risk</div>
<div>Within the framework laid out above, as well as our guidance
on “<font>How BlackRock Investment Stewardship engages on climate risk</font>,” we believe that climate presents significant investment risks and opportunities that may impact the long- term financial
sustainability of companies. We believe that the reporting frameworks developed by TCFD and SASB provide useful guidance to companies on identifying, managing, and reporting on climate-related risks and opportunities.</div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>We expect
companies to help their investors understand how the company may be impacted by climate risk, in the context of its ability to realize a long-term strategy and generate value over time. We expect companies to convey their governance around this
issue through their corporate disclosures aligned with TCFD and SASB. For companies in sectors that are significantly exposed to climate-related risk, we expect the whole board to have demonstrable fluency in how climate risk affects the business
and how management approaches assessing, adapting to, and mitigating that risk.</div>
<div>Where a company receives a shareholder proposal related to
climate risk, in addition to the factors laid out above, our assessment will take into account the robustness of the company’s existing disclosures as well as our understanding of its management of the issues as revealed through our
engagements with the company and board members over time. In certain instances, we may disagree with the details of a climate-related shareholder proposal but agree that the company in question has not made sufficient progress on climate-related
disclosures. In these instances, we may not support the proposal, but may vote against the election of relevant directors.</div>
<div>Corporate political activities</div>
<div>Companies may engage in certain political activities, within
legal and regulatory limits, in order to influence public policy consistent with the companies’ values and strategies, and thus serve shareholders’ best long-term economic interests. These activities can create risks, including: the
potential for allegations of corruption; the potential for reputational issues associated with a candidate, party, or issue; and risks that arise from the complex legal, regulatory , and compliance considerations associated with corporate political
activity. We believe that companies which choose to engage in political activities should develop and maintain robust processes to guide these activities and to mitigate risks, including a level of board oversight.</div>
<div>When presented with shareholder proposals requesting increased
disclosure on corporate political activities, we may consider the political activities of that company and its peers, the existing level of disclosure, and our view regarding the associated risks. We generally believe that it is the duty of boards
and management to determine the appropriate level of disclosure of all types of corporate activity, and we are generally not supportive of proposals that are overly prescriptive in nature. We may decide to support a shareholder proposal requesting
additional reporting of corporate political activities where there seems to be either a significant potential threat or actual harm to shareholders’ interests, and where we believe the company has not already provided shareholders with
sufficient information to assess the company’s management of the risk.</div>
<div>Finally, we believe that it is not the role of shareholders to
suggest or approve corporate political activities; therefore we generally do not support proposals requesting a shareholder vote on political activities or expenditures.</div>
<div>GENERAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS</div>
<div>Adjourn meeting to solicit additional votes</div>
<div>We generally support such proposals unless the agenda contains
items that we judge to be detrimental to shareholders’ best long-term economic interests.</div>
<div>Bundled proposals</div>
<div>We believe that shareholders should have the opportunity to
review substantial governance changes individually without having to accept bundled proposals. Where several measures are grouped into one proposal, BlackRock may reject certain positive changes when linked with proposals that generally contradict
or impede the rights and economic interests of shareholders.</div>
<div>Exclusive forum provisions</div>
<div>BlackRock generally supports proposals to seek exclusive forum
for certain shareholder litigation. In cases where a board unilaterally adopts exclusive forum provisions that we consider unfavorable to the interests of shareholders, we will vote against the independent chair or lead independent director and
members of the governance committee.</div> <div>Multi-jurisdictional
companies</div> <div>Where a company is listed on multiple
exchanges or incorporated in a country different from its primary listing, we will seek to apply the most relevant market guideline(s) to our analysis of the company’s governance structure and specific proposals</div> </div>

</a> </div> <div type="Block"> <div>on the shareholder meeting
agenda. In doing so, we typically consider the governance standards of the company’s primary listing, the market standards by which the company governs itself, and the market context of each specific proposal on the agenda. If the relevant
standards are silent on the issue under consideration, we will use our professional judgment as to what voting outcome would best protect the long-term economic interests of investors. We expect that companies will disclose the rationale for their
selection of primary listing, country of incorporation, and choice of governance structures, in particular where there is conflict between relevant market governance practices.</div>
<div>Other business</div>
<div>We oppose giving companies our proxy to vote on matters where
we are not given the opportunity to review and understand those measures and carry out an appropriate level of shareholder oversight.</div>
<div>Reincorporation</div>
<div>Proposals to reincorporate from one state or country to
another are most frequently motivated by considerations of anti - takeover protections, legal advantages, and / or cost savings. We will evaluate, on a case-by-case basis, the economic and strategic rationale behind the company’s proposal to
reincorporate. In all instances, we will evaluate the changes to shareholder protection under the new charter / articles / bylaws to assess whether the move increases or decreases shareholder protections. Where we find that shareholder protections
are diminished, we may support reincorporation if we determine that the overall benefits outweigh the diminished rights.</div>
<div>IPO governance</div>
<div>We expect boards to consider and disclose how the corporate
governance structures adopted upon initial public offering (“IPO”) are in shareholders’ best long-term interests. We also expect boards to conduct a regular review of corporate governance and control structures, such that boards
might evolve foundational corporate governance structures as company circumstances change, without undue costs and disruption to shareholders. In our <font>letter on unequal voting structures</font>, we articulate
our view that “one vote for one share” is the preferred structure for publicly -traded companies. We also recognize the potential benefits of dual class shares to newly public companies as they establish themselves; however, we believe
that these structures should have a specific and limited duration. We will generally engage new companies on topics such as classified boards and supermajority vote provisions to amend bylaws, as we believe that such arrangements may not be in the
best interest of shareholders in the long-term.</div> <div>We will
typically apply a one-year grace period for the application of certain director-related guidelines (including, but not limited to, director independence and over-boarding considerations), during which we expect boards to take steps to bring
corporate governance standards in line with our expectations.</div>
<div>Further, if a company qualifies as an emerging growth company
(an “EGC”) under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), we will give consideration to the NYSE and NASDAQ governance exemptions granted under the JOBS Act for the duration such a company is
categorized as an EGC. We expect an EGC to have a totally independent audit committee by the first anniversary of its IPO, with our standard approach to voting on auditors and audit -related issues applicable in full for an EGC on the first
anniversary of its IPO.</div> <div>SHAREHOLDER PROTECTIONS</div>
<div>Amendment to charter / articles / bylaws</div>
<div>We believe that shareholders should have the right to vote on
key corporate governance matters, including on changes to governance mechanisms and amendments to the charter / articles / bylaws. We may vote against certain directors where changes to governing documents are not put to a shareholder vote within a
reasonable period of time, in particular if those changes have the potential to impact shareholder rights ( see “Director elections” herein). In cases where a board’s unilateral adoption of changes to the charter / articles /
bylaws promotes cost and operational efficiency benefits for the company and its shareholders, we may support such action if it does not have a negative effect on shareholder rights or the company’s corporate governance structure.</div>
<div>When voting on a management or shareholder proposal to make
changes to the charter / articles / bylaws, we will consider in part the company’s and / or proponent’s publicly stated rationale for the changes, the company’s governance profile and history, relevant jurisdictional laws, and
situational or contextual circumstances which may have motivated the proposed</div> </div> <div type="Block">

factors. We will typically support changes to the charter / articles / bylaws where the benefits to shareholders, including the costs of failing to make those changes, demonstrably outweigh the costs or risks of making such changes.</div>
<div>Proxy access</div>
<div>We believe that long-term shareholders should have the
opportunity, when necessary and under reasonable conditions, to nominate directors on the company’s proxy card.</div>
<div>In our view, securing the right of shareholders to nominate
directors without engaging in a control contest can enhance shareholders’ ability to meaningfully participate in the director election process, stimulate board attention to shareholder interests, and provide shareholders an effective means of
directing that attention where it is lacking. Proxy access mechanisms should provide shareholders with a reasonable opportunity to use this right without stipulating overly restrictive or onerous parameters for use, and also provide assurances that
the mechanism will not be subject to abuse by short-term investors, investors without a substantial investment in the company, or investors seeking to take control of the board.</div>
<div>In general, we support market-standardized proxy access
proposals, which allow a shareholder (or group of up to 20 shareholders) holding three percent of a company’s outstanding shares for at least three years the right to nominate the greater of up to two directors or 20% of the board. Where a
standardized proxy access provision exists, we will generally oppose shareholder proposals requesting outlier thresholds.</div>
<div>Right to act by written consent</div>
<div>In exceptional circumstances and with sufficiently broad
support, shareholders should have the opportunity to raise issues of substantial importance without having to wait for management to schedule a meeting. We therefore believe that shareholders should have the right to solicit votes by written consent
provided that: 1) there are reasonable requirements to initiate the consent solicitation process (in order to avoid the waste of corporate resources in addressing narrowly supported interests); and 2) shareholders receive a minimum of 50% of
outstanding shares to effectuate the action by written consent. We may oppose shareholder proposals requesting the right to act by written consent in cases where the proposal is structured for the benefit of a dominant shareholder to the exclusion
of others, or if the proposal is written to discourage the board from incorporating appropriate mechanisms to avoid the waste of corporate resources when establishing a right to act by written consent. Additionally, we may oppose shareholder
proposals requesting the right to act by written consent if the company already provides a shareholder right to call a special meeting that we believe offers shareholders a reasonable opportunity to raise issues of substantial importance without
having to wait for management to schedule a meeting.</div> <div>Right
to call a special meeting</div> <div>In exceptional circumstances
and with sufficiently broad support, shareholders should have the opportunity to raise issues of substantial importance without having to wait for management to schedule a meeting. We therefore believe that shareholders should have the right to call
a special meeting in cases where a reasonably high proportion of shareholders (typically a minimum of 15% but no higher than 25%) are required to agree to such a meeting before it is called, in order to avoid the waste of corporate resources in
addressing narrowly supported interests. However, we may oppose this right in cases where the proposal is structured for the benefit of a dominant shareholder to the exclusion of others. We generally believe that a right to act via written consent
is not a sufficient alternative to the right to call a special meeting.</div>
<div>Simple majority voting</div>
<div>We generally favor a simple majority voting requirement to
pass proposals. Therefore, we will support the reduction or the elimination of supermajority voting requirements to the extent that we determine shareholders’ ability to protect their economic interests is improved. Nonetheless, in situations
where there is a substantial or dominant shareholder, supermajority voting may be protective of public shareholder interests and we may support supermajority requirements in those situations.</div> </div>

– Description of Fixed-Income Ratings</div> <div>A rating is
generally assigned to a fixed-income security at the time of issuance by a credit rating agency designated as a NRSRO by the SEC. While NRSROs may from time to time revise such ratings, they undertake no obligation to do so, and the ratings given to
securities at issuance do not necessarily represent ratings which would be given to these securities on a particular subsequent date.</div>
<div>NRSROs may rate specific investments (<font>e.g.</font>, bonds), issuers (<font>e.g.</font>, corporations, governments and financial institutions) and/or programs (<font>e.g.</font>, commercial paper programs).
However, certain types of investments generally are not rated by NRSROs, such as certain government/sovereign obligations, US agency securities, commercial paper, time deposits at financial institutions, and derivative instruments such as credit
default swaps. For these types of investments, as well as US Treasury securities (some of which are not rated), where a NRSRO has not rated the specific investment but has rated the investment’s issuer, program, financial institution or
underlying reference asset, BFA may consider the investment to have the same NRSRO rating as its issuer, program, financial institution or underlying reference asset, as applicable. In the case of municipal securities, where one NRSRO provides
multiple ratings for the same security (<font>e.g.</font>, “underlying,” “insured” and/or “enhanced” ratings), BFA may consider the security to have the highest of the multiple
ratings.</div> <div>New issue securities (regardless of type)
rarely are rated by a NRSRO at the time of their initial offering. Preliminary prospectuses or term sheets for new issue securities often include an expected rating for the security (as determined by the underwriter and/or issuer) or a NRSRO rating
for the issuer of the security. If applicable, when deciding whether to purchase a new issue security that has not yet been rated by a NRSRO, BFA may attribute an expected rating to the security based on: (i) the expected rating of the security set
forth in the preliminary prospectus or term sheet for the security; (ii) the NRSRO’s rating for the issuer of the security set forth in the preliminary prospectus or term sheet for the security; or (iii) with respect to asset-backed
securities, the rating of a prior issuance having a similar structure or the same sponsor.</div>
<div>Where the investment objective of a Fund is to track the
performance of an index that includes credit ratings eligibility criteria as part of its index methodology, a Fund may purchase any security within the index, such security having been determined by the index provider as meeting its credit ratings
eligibility criteria. The credit ratings practices of an index provider may differ from BlackRock’s practices, as described above. Further, a Fund may invest, directly or indirectly, in securities that are not rated by a rating agency or
securities with a credit rating that differs from the credit rating specified in its index methodology in various circumstances, including where a security is downgraded but not yet removed from an index, following the removal of a security from an
index prior to its sale by the Fund or as a result of a corporate action or restructuring affecting an issuer of a security held by a Fund.</div>
<div>Fixed-income securities which are unrated expose the investor
to risks with respect to capacity to pay interest or repay principal which are similar to the risks of lower-rated speculative bonds. Evaluation of these securities is dependent on the investment adviser’s judgment, analysis and experience in
the evaluation of such securities.</div> <div>Investors should note
that the assignment of a rating to a security by an NRSRO may not reflect the effect of recent developments on the issuer’s ability to make interest and principal payments or on the likelihood of default.</div>
<div>Securities deemed to be high yield are rated below Baa3 by
Moody’s and below BBB- by S&amp;P Global Ratings and Fitch.</div>
<div>The descriptions below relate to general long-term and
short-term obligations of an issuer.</div> <div>Moody’s

<div>Aaa:<font> Obligations rated Aaa are
judged to be of the highest quality, subject to the lowest level of credit risk.</font></div>

<div>A:<font> Obligations rated A are

<div>Caa:<font> Obligations rated Caa are
judged to be speculative, of poor standing and are subject to very high credit risk.</font></div>
<div>Ca:<font> Obligations rated Ca are
highly speculative and are likely in, or very near, default, with some prospect of recovery of principal and interest.</font></div>
<div>C:<font> Obligations rated C are the
lowest rated and are typically in default, with little prospect for recovery of principal or interest.</font></div>
<div>Note:<font> Moody's appends
numerical modifiers 1, 2 and 3 in each generic rating classification from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the
modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the lower end of that generic rating category.</font></div>
<div>Absence of Rating:<font> Where no
rating has been assigned or where a rating has been withdrawn, it may be for reasons unrelated to the creditworthiness of the issue.</font></div>
<div>Should no rating be assigned, the reason may be one of the
following:</div> <div>1. An application was not received or
accepted.</div> <div>2. The issue or issuer belongs to a group of
securities or entities that are not rated as a matter of policy.</div>
<div>3. There is a lack of essential data pertaining to the issue
or issuer.</div> <div>4. The issue was privately placed, in which
case the rating is not published in Moody’s publications.</div>
<div>Withdrawal may occur if new and material circumstances arise,
the effects of which preclude satisfactory analysis; if there is no longer available reasonable up-to-date data to permit a judgment to be formed; if a bond is called for redemption; or for other reasons.</div>
<div>Short-Term Obligations</div>
<div>Moody’s short-term debt ratings are opinions of the
ability of issuers to honor short-term financial obligations, generally with an original maturity not exceeding thirteen months.</div>
<div>Moody's employs the following designations to indicate the
relative repayment ability of rated issuers:</div> <div>P-1: <font>Issuers (or supporting institutions) rated Prime-1 have a superior ability to repay short-term debt obligations.</font></div>
<div>P-2: <font>Issuers (or supporting
institutions) rated Prime-2 have a strong ability to repay short-term debt obligations.</font></div>
<div>P-3: <font>Issuers (or supporting
institutions) rated Prime-3 have an acceptable ability to repay short-term obligations.</font></div>
<div>NP: <font>Issuers (or supporting
institutions) rated Not Prime do not fall within any of the Prime rating categories.</font></div>
<div>US Municipal Short-Term Debt Obligations</div>
<div>There are three rating categories for short-term municipal
obligations that are considered investment grade and are designated as Municipal Investment Grade (MIG). In addition, those short-term obligations that are of speculative quality are designated SG, or speculative grade. MIG ratings expire at the
maturity of the obligation.</div> <div>MIG 1:<font> This designation denotes superior credit quality. Excellent protection is afforded by established cash flows, highly reliable liquidity support, or demonstrated broad-based access to the market for
refinancing.</font></div> <div>MIG 2:<font> This designation denotes strong credit quality. Margins of protection are ample, although not as large as in the preceding group.</font></div>
<div>MIG 3:<font> This designation
denotes acceptable credit quality. Liquidity and cash-flow protection may be narrow, and market access for refinancing is likely to be less well-established.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

<div>S&amp;P Global Ratings</div>
<div>Long-Term Obligations</div>
<div>AAA:<font> An obligation rated AAA
has the highest rating assigned by S&amp;P Global Ratings. The obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong.</font></div>
<div>AA:<font> An obligation rated AA
differs from the highest-rated obligations only to a small degree. The obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment is very strong.</font></div>
<div>A:<font> An obligation rated A is
somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher-rated categories. However, the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is still
strong.</font></div> <div>BBB:<font> An
obligation rated BBB exhibits adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation.</font></div> <div>BB; B; CCC; CC; and C:<font> Obligations rated BB, B, CCC, CC, and C are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics. BB indicates the least degree of speculation and C the highest. While such obligations will likely have some
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.</font></div>
<div>BB:<font> An obligation rated BB is
less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions which could lead to the obligor’s inadequate capacity to meet its
financial commitment on the obligation.</font></div> <div>B:<font> An obligation rated B is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated BB, but the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Adverse business, financial, or economic
conditions will likely impair the obligor’s capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.</font></div>
<div>CCC:<font> An obligation rated CCC
is currently vulnerable to nonpayment, and is dependent upon favorable business, financial, and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. In the event of adverse business, financial, or economic
conditions, the obligor is not likely to have the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.</font></div>
<div>CC:<font> An obligation rated CC is
currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment. The CC rating is used when a default has not yet occurred, but S&amp;P Global Ratings expects default to be a virtual certainty, regardless of the anticipated time to default.</font></div>
<div>C:<font> An obligation rated C is
currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment, and the obligation is expected to have lower relative seniority or lower ultimate recovery compared to obligations that are rated higher.</font></div>
<div>D:<font> An obligation rated D is in
default or in breach of an imputed promise. For non-hybrid capital instruments, the D rating category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due, unless S&amp;P Global Ratings believes that such payments will be made within
five business days in the absence of a stated grace period or within the earlier of the stated grace period or 30 calendar days. The D rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of similar action and where
default on an obligation is a virtual certainty, for example due to automatic stay provisions. An obligation's rating is lowered to D if it is subject to a distressed exchange offer.</font></div>
<div>NR:<font> NR indicates no rating has
been requested, or that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that S&amp;P Global Ratings does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy.</font></div>
<div>Note:<font> The ratings from AA to
CCC may be modified by the addition of a plus (+) or minus (-) sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories.</font></div>

<div>A-2: <font>A short-term obligation

<div>Municipal Short-Term Obligations</div>
<div>An S&amp;P U.S. municipal note rating reflects S&amp;P Global
Ratings opinion about the liquidity factors and market access risks unique to the notes. Notes due in three years or less will likely receive a note rating. Notes with an original maturity of more than three years will most likely receive a
long-term debt rating.</div> <div>SP-1:<font> Strong capacity to pay principal and interest. An issue determined to possess a very strong capacity to pay debt service is given a plus (+) designation.</font></div>
<div>SP-2:<font> Satisfactory capacity to
pay principal and interest, with some vulnerability to adverse financial and economic changes over the term of the notes.</font></div>
<div>SP-3:<font> Speculative capacity to
pay principal and interest.</font></div> <div>Fitch Ratings</div>
<div>Long-Term Obligations</div>
<div>AAA:<font> Highest credit quality.
AAA ratings denote the lowest expectation of credit risk. They are assigned only in cases of exceptionally strong capacity for payment of financial commitments. This capacity is highly unlikely to be adversely affected by foreseeable
events.</font></div> <div>AA:<font> Very
high credit quality. AA ratings denote expectations of very low credit risk. They indicate very strong capacity for payment of financial commitments. This capacity is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events.</font></div>
<div>A:<font> High credit quality. A
ratings denote expectations of low credit risk. The capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered strong. This capacity may, nevertheless, be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic conditions than is the case for higher
ratings.</font></div> <div>BBB:<font>
Good credit quality. BBB ratings indicate that expectations of credit risk are currently low. The capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered adequate but adverse business or economic conditions are more likely to impair this
capacity.</font></div> </div> <div type="Block">

or “-” may be appended to a rating to denote relative status within major rating categories. Such suffixes are not added to the AAA obligation rating category, or to corporate finance obligation ratings in the categories below CCC.</div>
<div>The subscript 'emr' is appended to a rating to denote embedded
market risk which is beyond the scope of the rating. The designation is intended to make clear that the rating solely addresses the counterparty risk of the issuing bank. It is not meant to indicate any limitation in the analysis of the counterparty
risk, which in all other respects follows published Fitch criteria for analyzing the issuing financial institution. Fitch does not rate these instruments where the principal is to any degree subject to market risk.</div>
<div>Short-Term Obligations (Corporate and Public Finance)</div>
<div>A short-term issuer or obligation rating is based in all cases
on the short-term vulnerability to default of the rated entity or security stream and relates to the capacity to meet financial obligations in accordance with the documentation governing the relevant obligation. Short-Term Ratings are assigned to
obligations whose initial maturity is viewed as “short-term” based on market convention. Typically, this means up to 13 months for corporate, sovereign, and structured obligations, and up to 36 months for obligations in U.S. public
finance markets.</div> <div>F1:<font>
Highest short-term credit quality. Indicates the strongest intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments; may have an added “+” to denote any exceptionally strong credit feature.</font></div>
<div>F2:<font> Good short-term credit
quality. Good intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments.</font></div>
<div>F3:<font> Fair short-term credit
quality. The intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments is adequate.</font></div>
<div>B:<font> Speculative short-term
credit quality. Minimal capacity for timely payment of financial commitments, plus heightened vulnerability to near term adverse changes in financial and economic conditions.</font></div>
<div>C:<font> High short-term default
risk. Default is a real possibility.</font></div> <div>RD:<font> Restricted default. Indicates an entity that has defaulted on one or more of its financial commitments, although it continues to meet other financial obligations. Typically applicable to entity ratings
only.</font></div> <div>D:<font> Default.
Indicates a broad-based default event for an entity, or the default of a short-term obligation.</font></div>
