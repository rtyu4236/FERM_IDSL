   *  The Trust Agreement became effective, the initial deposit was made and the
      Trust commenced operation on January 22, 1993.

  **  Ordinary operating expenses of the Trust currently are being accrued at an
      annual rate of 0.1200%.  Last year's operating expenses were 0.1383%,  but
      the excess  over  0.1200% was waived by the Trustee  and,  after  earnings
      credits  of .0078%  were  applied,  the net  expenses  of the  Trust  were
      0.1122%. Future accruals will depend primarily on the level of the Trust's
      net  assets and the level of Trust  expenses.  The  Trustee  has agreed to
      waive a  portion  of its fee  until  March  9,  2004,  but may  thereafter
      discontinue this voluntary waiver policy.  The Sponsor has undertaken that
      the  ordinary  operating  expenses  of the Trust will not exceed an amount
      that is  0.1845%  of the daily NAV of the  Trust,  but this  amount may be
      changed.  Therefore,  there  is no  guarantee  that the  Trust's  ordinary
      operating  expenses will not exceed the current  0.1200% or 0.1845% of the
      Trust's daily NAV.

                                   HIGHLIGHTS

o    SPDRS ARE OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN THE SPDR TRUST

     SPDR  Trust,  Series 1  ("Trust")  is a unit  investment  trust that issues
securities called "Standard &amp; Poor's Depositary  Receipts" or "SPDRs." The Trust
is  organized  under New York law and is governed by a trust  agreement  between
State  Street  Bank  and  Trust  Company   ("Trustee")   and  PDR  Services  LLC
("Sponsor"),  dated and  executed as of January 22,  1993  ("Trust  Agreement").
SPDRs  represent  an undivided  ownership  interest in a portfolio of all of the
common stocks of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Composite  Stock Price Index(R) ("S&amp;P
500 Index").

o    SPDRS SHOULD CLOSELY TRACK THE VALUE OF THE STOCKS INCLUDED IN THE
     S&amp;P 500 INDEX

     SPDRs intend to provide investment results that, before expenses, generally
correspond  to the price and yield  performance  of the S&amp;P 500  Index.  Current
information  regarding  the value of the S&amp;P 500 Index is available  from market
information  services.   Standard  &amp;  Poor's,  a  division  of  The  McGraw-Hill
Companies,  Inc. ("S&amp;P") obtains information for inclusion in, or for use in the
calculation of, the S&amp;P 500 Index from sources S&amp;P considers  reliable.  None of
S&amp;P,  the  Sponsor,  the Trust or the  Exchange  accepts  responsibility  for or
guarantees  the accuracy  and/or  completeness  of the S&amp;P 500 Index or any data
included in the S&amp;P 500 Index.

     The Trust holds the  Portfolio  and cash and is not  actively  "managed" by
traditional methods,  which typically involve effecting changes in the Portfolio
on the basis of  judgments  made  relating  to  economic,  financial  and market
considerations.  To maintain  the  correspondence  between the  composition  and
weightings of stocks held by the Trust ("Portfolio Securities" or, collectively,
"Portfolio") and component stocks of the S&amp;P 500 Index ("Index Securities"), the
Trustee  adjusts the Portfolio from time to time to conform to periodic  changes
in the identity  and/or  relative  weightings of Index  Securities.  The Trustee
aggregates  certain of these  adjustments  and makes changes to the Portfolio at
least monthly or more  frequently in the case of significant  changes to the S&amp;P
500 Index.  Any change in the identity or weighting  of an Index  Security  will
result  in a  corresponding  adjustment  to  the  prescribed  Portfolio  Deposit
effective  on any day that  the New York  Stock  Exchange  is open for  business
("Business  Day")  following  the day on which  the  change to the S&amp;P 500 Index
takes effect after the close of the market.

     The value of SPDRs  fluctuates  in  relation to changes in the value of the
Portfolio.  The market price of each individual SPDR may not be identical to the
net asset value  ("NAV") of such SPDR but,  historically,  these two  valuations
have been very close.

o    SPDRS TRADE ON THE AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE

     SPDRs are listed for trading on the American Stock  Exchange  ("Exchange"),
and are bought and sold in the secondary market like ordinary shares of stock at
any time during

                                        3
<page>


the trading day.  SPDRs are traded on the  Exchange in 100 SPDR round lots,  but
can be  traded  in odd lots of as little  as one  SPDR.  The  Exchange  may halt
trading of SPDRs under certain circumstances.

o    BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS ON SPDRS

     Secondary  market  purchases  and sales of SPDRs are  subject  to  ordinary
brokerage commissions and charges.

o    THE TRUST ISSUES AND REDEEMS SPDRS IN "CREATION UNITS"

     The Trust issues and redeems  SPDRs only in specified  large lots of 50,000
SPDRs or multiples  thereof referred to as "Creation  Units." Creation Units are
issued by the Trust to anyone  who,  after  placing a  creation  order with ALPS
Distributors,  Inc.  ("Distributor"),  deposits  with the  Trustee  a  specified
portfolio of Index  Securities and a cash payment  generally  equal to dividends
(net of expenses) accumulated up to the time of deposit.

     Fractional  Creation  Units may be  created  or  redeemed  only in  limited
circumstances.*  Creation  Units  are  redeemable  in  kind  only  and  are  not
redeemable  for cash.  Upon  receipt of one or more  Creation  Units,  the Trust
delivers to the redeeming holder a portfolio of Index  Securities  (based on NAV
of  the  Trust),  together  with  a  cash  payment.  Each  redemption  has to be
accompanied  by a Cash  Redemption  Payment that on any given Business Day is an
amount identical to the Cash Component of a Portfolio Deposit.

     If the Trustee  determines that one or more Index  Securities are likely to
be  unavailable,  or  available in  insufficient  quantity,  for  delivery  upon
creation of Creation Units,  the Trustee may permit the cash equivalent value of
one or more of these Index Securities to be included in the Portfolio Deposit as
a part of the Cash  Component in lieu  thereof.  If a creator is  restricted  by
regulation or otherwise  from  investing or engaging in a transaction  in one or
more Index Securities,  the Trustee may permit the cash equivalent value of such
Index  Securities  to be included in the  Portfolio  Deposit based on the market
value of such  Index  Securities  as of the  Evaluation  Time on the  date  such
creation  order  is  deemed  received  by the  Distributor  as part of the  Cash
Component in lieu of the inclusion of such Index Securities in the stock portion
of the  Portfolio  Deposit.  If the  Trustee  determines  that one or more Index
Securities are likely to be unavailable  or available in  insufficient  quantity
for delivery by the Trust upon the redemption of Creation Units, the Trustee may
deliver  the cash  equivalent  value of one or more of these  Index  Securities,
based on their market value as of the Evaluation Time on the date the redemption
order is deemed received by the Trustee,  as part of the Cash Redemption Payment
in lieu thereof.

------------
*  See the  discussion of termination of the Trust in this Summary and "Dividend
   Reinvestment  Service,"  however,  for a description of the  circumstances in
   which SPDRs may be redeemed or created by the Trustee in less than a Creation
   Unit size aggregation of 50,000 SPDRs.

o    CREATION ORDERS MUST BE PLACED WITH THE DISTRIBUTOR

     All orders to create Creation Units must be placed with the Distributor. To
be  eligible  to  place  these  orders,  an  entity  or  person  must  be  (a) a
"Participating  Party,"  or (b) a DTC  Participant,  and in each  case must have
executed  an  agreement  with  the  Distributor  and the  Trustee  ("Participant
Agreement").  The term  "Participating  Party"  means a  broker-dealer  or other
participant in the SPDR Clearing Process,  through the Continuous Net Settlement
("CNS")  System of the National  Securities  Clearing  Corporation  ("NSCC"),  a
clearing agency registered with the Securities and Exchange  Commission ("SEC").
Payment  for  orders is made by  deposits  with the  Trustee of a  portfolio  of
securities,   substantially  similar  in  composition  and  weighting  to  Index
Securities,  and a cash payment in an amount  equal to the  Dividend  Equivalent
Payment, plus or minus the Balancing Amount. "Dividend Equivalent Payment" is an
amount equal,  on a per Creation  Unit basis,  to the dividends on the Portfolio
(with  ex-dividend  dates within the accumulation  period),  net of expenses and
accrued liabilities for such period (including, without limitation, (i) taxes or
other governmental  charges against the Trust not previously  deducted,  if any,
and (ii) accrued fees of the Trustee and other expenses of the Trust  (including
legal and  auditing  expenses)  and other  expenses  not  previously  deducted),
calculated  as if all of the Portfolio  Securities  had been held for the entire
accumulation  period for such distribution.  The Dividend Equivalent Payment and
the Balancing  Amount  collectively  are referred to as "Cash Component" and the
deposit of a portfolio of securities  and the Cash  Component  collectively  are
referred to as a "Portfolio  Deposit."  Persons placing creation orders with the
Distributor must deposit Portfolio  Deposits either (i) through the CNS clearing
process of NSCC, as such  processes  have been enhanced to effect  creations and
redemptions of Creation  Units,  such processes  referred to herein as the "SPDR
Clearing  Process," or (ii) with the Trustee  outside the SPDR Clearing  Process
(I.E. through the facilities of DTC).

     The  Distributor  acts as  underwriter  of SPDRs on an  agency  basis.  The
Distributor maintains records of the orders placed with it and the confirmations
of  acceptance  and  furnishes  to those  placing such orders  confirmations  of
acceptance of the orders.  The Distributor  also is responsible for delivering a
prospectus to persons creating SPDRs. The Distributor also maintains a record of
the delivery  instructions  in response to orders and may provide  certain other
administrative   services,  such  as  those  related  to  state  securities  law
compliance.  The  Distributor is a corporation  organized  under the laws of the
State of Colorado and is located at 1625 Broadway, Suite 2200, Denver, CO 80202,
toll free  number:1-800-843-2639.  The Distributor is a registered broker-dealer
and a member  of the  National  Association  of  Securities  Dealers,  Inc.  PDR
Services LLC, as Sponsor of the Trust,  pays the  Distributor for its services a
flat annual fee. The Sponsor will not seek  reimbursement  for such payment from
the Trust without obtaining prior exemptive relief from the SEC.

     Future expense  accruals will depend  primarily on the level of the Trust's
net assets and the level of expenses.

--------------
*  Investors do not pay  shareholder  fees directly from their  investment,  but
   purchases and  redemptions of Creation Units are subject to Transaction  Fees
   (described  below in "A Transaction  Fee is Payable For Each Creation and For
   Each Redemption of Creation Units"),  and purchases and sales of SPDRs in the
   secondary  market are subject to ordinary  brokerage  commissions and charges
   (described above in "Brokerage Commissions on SPDRs").

** Until March 9, 2004,  the Trustee has agreed to waive a portion of its fee to
   the extent  operating  expenses exceed 0.1200%.  Thereafter,  the Trustee may
   discontinue  this voluntary waiver policy.  Therefore,  there is no guarantee
   that the Trust's ordinary  operating  expenses will not exceed 0.1200% of the
   Trust's  daily NAV.  Trust  expenses  were  further  reduced  by a  Trustee's
   earnings  credit  of  0.0078%  of the  Portfolio's  daily  NAV as a result of
   uninvested cash balances in the Trust.

o    BAR CHART AND TABLE

     The bar chart below and the table on the next page entitled "Average Annual
Total Returns (for periods  ending  December 31, 2002)"  ("Table")  provide some
indication of the risks of investing in the Trust by showing the  variability of
the Trust's returns based on net assets and comparing the Trust's performance to
the performance of the S&amp;P 500 Index.  Past  performance  (both before and after
tax) is not  necessarily  an  indication  of how the Trust  will  perform in the
future.

     The  after-tax  returns  presented  in the Table are  calculated  using the
highest  historical  individual  federal  marginal  income  tax rates and do not
reflect the impact of state and local taxes.  Your actual after-tax returns will
depend on your  specific  tax  situation  and may differ from those shown below.
After-tax  returns  are  not  relevant  to  investors  who  hold  SPDRs  through
tax-deferred  arrangements,  such  as  401(k)  plans  or  individual  retirement
accounts.  The total  returns in the bar chart  below,  as well as the total and
after-tax  returns  presented  in the Table,  do not  reflect  Transaction  Fees
payable by those persons  purchasing and redeeming Creation Units, nor brokerage
commissions  incurred  by those  persons  purchasing  and  selling  SPDRs in the
secondary market (see footnotes (3) and (4) to the Table).

     This bar chart shows the  performance  of the Trust for each full  calendar
year since its  inception  on January 22,  1993.  During the period  shown above
(January 1, 1994 through  December 31, 2002),  the highest  quarterly return for
the Trust was  21.21%  for the  quarter  ended  12/31/1998,  and the  lowest was
-17.26% for the quarter ended 9/30/2002.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (1) Total return figures are calculated  assuming the reinvested  price for the
     12/20/02 income  distribution is the 12/31/02 NAV. The actual  reinvestment
     price is the 1/31/03 NAV,  which was not available at the time of the above
     calculations.  Actual performance  calculations may or may not differ based
     on this assumption.

 (1) Total return figures are calculated  assuming the reinvested  price for the
     12/20/02 income  distribution is the 12/31/02 NAV. The actual  reinvestment
     price is the 1/31/03 NAV,  which was not available at the time of the above
     calculations.  Actual performance  calculations may or may not differ based
     on this assumption.

     by persons  purchasing and redeeming  Creation Units as discussed  below in
     the section of "Highlights" entitled "A Transaction Fee is Payable For Each
     Creation and For Each Redemption of Creation Units".  If these amounts were
     reflected, returns would be less than those shown.

 (4) Does not include brokerage commissions and charges incurred only by persons
     who make purchases and sales of SPDRs in the secondary  market as discussed
     above in the section of  "Highlights"  entitled  "Brokerage  Commissions on
     SPDRs".  If these amounts were reflected,  returns would be less than those

     Fees, brokerage commissions, or fees of any kind.

o    A TRANSACTION FEE IS PAYABLE FOR EACH CREATION AND  FOR EACH REDEMPTION  OF
     CREATION UNITS

     A transaction  fee payable to the Trustee in connection  with each creation
and  redemption  of  Creation  Units  made  through  the SPDR  Clearing  Process
("Transaction Fee") is non-refundable,  regardless of the NAV of the Trust. This
Transaction  Fee is $3,000 per  Participating  Party per day,  regardless of the
number of Creation  Units  created or redeemed on such day. The $3,000 charge is
subject to a limit not to exceed  10/100 of one percent (10 basis points) of the
value of one Creation Unit at the time of creation ("10 Basis Point Limit").

     For  creations  and  redemptions  outside  the SPDR  Clearing  Process,  an
additional  amount not to exceed three (3) times the  Transaction Fee applicable
for one Creation  Unit is charged per Creation  Unit per day.  Under the current
schedule,  therefore,  the total fee  charged in  connection  with  creation  or
redemption  outside the SPDR Clearing  Process would be $3,000 (the  Transaction
Fee for the  creation or  redemption  of one Creation  Unit) plus an  additional
amount  up to  $9,000  (3 times  $3,000),  for a total  not to  exceed  $12,000.
Creators and redeemers  restricted  from engaging in transactions in one or more
Index  Securities  may  pay  the  Trustee  the  Transaction  Fee  and may pay an
additional  amount  per  Creation  Unit  not  to  exceed  three  (3)  times  the
Transaction Fee applicable for one Creation Unit.

                                       8

o    SPDRS ARE HELD IN BOOK ENTRY FORM ONLY

     The  Depository  Trust  Company  ("DTC")  or its  nominee  is the record or
registered  owner of all  outstanding  SPDRs.  Beneficial  ownership of SPDRs is
shown on the records of DTC or its participants. Individual certificates are not
issued for SPDRs. See "The Trust--Depository; Book-Entry-Only System."

o    SPDRS MAKE PERIODIC DIVIDEND PAYMENTS

     SPDR holders receive on the last Business Day of April,  July,  October and
January an amount  corresponding to the amount of any cash dividends declared on
the Portfolio  Securities during the applicable period, net of fees and expenses
associated  with operation of the Trust,  and taxes,  if applicable.  Because of
such fees and expenses,  the dividend  yield for SPDRs is  ordinarily  less than
that of the S&amp;P 500 Index. Investors should consult their tax advisors regarding
tax consequences  associated with Trust  dividends,  as well as those associated
with SPDR sales or redemptions.

     Quarterly  distributions  based on the  amount of  dividends  payable  with
respect to Portfolio  Securities and other income received by the Trust,  net of
fees  and  expenses,  and  taxes,  if  applicable,  are  made  via  DTC  and its
participants  to Beneficial  Owners on each Dividend  Payment Date.  Any capital
gain income  recognized by the Trust in any taxable year that is not  previously
treated as distributed  during the year ordinarily is to be distributed at least
annually in January of the following taxable year. The Trust may make additional
distributions  shortly  after  the end of the year in order to  satisfy  certain
distribution  requirements  imposed by the  Internal  Revenue  Code of 1986,  as
amended ("Code").  Although all distributions are currently made quarterly,  the
Trustee  may vary the  periodicity  with  which  distributions  are made.  Those
Beneficial Owners  interested in reinvesting  their quarterly  distributions may
participate  through DTC Participants in the DTC Dividend  Reinvestment  Service
("Service")  available  through  certain  brokers.  See "The  Trust--Depository;
Book-Entry-Only System."

o    THE TRUST INTENDS TO QUALIFY AS A REGULATED INVESTMENT COMPANY

     For the fiscal year ended  September 30, 2002,  the Trust  believes that it
qualified for tax treatment as a "regulated investment company" under Subchapter
M of the Code.  The Trust  intends to continue  to so qualify and to  distribute
annually its entire  investment  company  taxable  income and net capital  gain.
Distributions that are taxable as ordinary income to Beneficial Owners generally
are expected to constitute  dividend  income for federal income tax purposes and
to  be  eligible  for  the   dividends-received   deduction  available  to  many
corporations to the extent of qualifying  dividend income received by the Trust.
The  Trust's  regular   quarterly   distributions  are  based  on  the  dividend
performance of the Portfolio  during such quarterly  distribution  period rather
than the  actual  taxable  income of the  Trust.  As a result,  a portion of the
distributions  of the Trust may be  treated  as a return of capital or a capital
gain  dividend  for federal  income tax purposes or the Trust may be required to
make additional  distributions to maintain its status as a regulated  investment
company  or to avoid  imposition  of  income or  excise  taxes on  undistributed
income.

o    TERMINATION OF THE TRUST

     The  Trust  has a  specified  lifetime  term.  The  Trust is  scheduled  to
terminate on the first to occur of (a) January 22, 2118 or (b) the date 20 years
after  the  death of the last  survivor  of  eleven  persons  named in the Trust
Agreement, the oldest of whom was born in 1990 and the youngest of whom was born
in 1993.  Upon  termination,  the Trust may be liquidated and pro rata shares of
the  assets of the Trust,  net of  certain  fees and  expenses,  distributed  to
holders of SPDRs.

o    PURCHASES OF SPDRS BY REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANIES

     Purchases  of SPDRs by  registered  investment  companies  are  subject  to
restrictions  set forth in Section  12(d)(1)  of the  Investment  Company Act of
1940. The Trust itself is also subject to the restrictions of Section  12(d)(1),
meaning (a) the Trust cannot invest in any registered investment company, to the
extent  that the  Trust  would  own more  than 3% of that  regulated  investment
company's  outstanding share position,  (b) the Trust cannot invest more than 5%
of its total assets in the securities of any one registered  investment company,
and (c) the  Trust  cannot  invest  more  than 10% of its  total  assets  in the
securities of registered investment companies in the aggregate.

                                  RISK FACTORS

     Investors can lose money by investing in SPDRs.  Investors should carefully
consider  the risk  factors  described  below  together  with  all of the  other
information included in this Prospectus before deciding to invest in SPDRs.

INVESTMENT  IN THE TRUST  INVOLVES THE RISKS  INHERENT IN AN  INVESTMENT  IN ANY
EQUITY  SECURITY. An investment  in the  Trust is  subject  to the  risks of any
investment in a broadly  based  portfolio of common  stocks,  including the risk
that the general level of stock prices may decline,  thereby adversely affecting
the value of such investment. The value of Portfolio Securities may fluctuate in
accordance  with changes in the financial  condition of the issuers of Portfolio
Securities  (particularly those that are heavily weighted in the S&amp;P 500 Index),
the  value of common  stocks  generally  and other  factors.  The  identity  and
weighting of Index Securities and the Portfolio Securities also change from time
to time.

     The financial  condition of the issuers may become  impaired or the general
condition  of the stock  market  may  deteriorate  (either  of which may cause a
decrease in the value of the Portfolio  and thus in the value of SPDRs).  Common
stocks are  susceptible  to general  stock market  fluctuations  and to volatile
increases and  decreases in value as market  confidence  in and  perceptions  of
their  issuers  change.  These  investor  perceptions  are based on various  and
unpredictable factors including  expectations  regarding  government,  economic,
monetary and fiscal policies,  inflation and interest rates,  economic expansion
or contraction, and global or regional political, economic and banking crises.

     Holders of common  stocks of any given  issuer incur more risk than holders
of preferred  stocks and debt  obligations  of the issuer  because the rights of
common


                                       10
<page>


stockholders,  as owners of the issuer,  generally are inferior to the rights of
creditors of, or holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks issued by, such
issuer.  Further,  unlike debt securities that typically have a stated principal
amount  payable  at  maturity,   or  preferred  stocks  that  typically  have  a
liquidation  preference  and may have stated  optional or  mandatory  redemption
provisions,  common stocks have neither a fixed principal amount nor a maturity.
Common  stock  values are subject to market  fluctuations  as long as the common
stock  remains  outstanding.  The  value of the  Portfolio  may be  expected  to
fluctuate over the entire life of the Trust.

     There can be no assurance that the issuers of Portfolio Securities will pay
dividends.  Distributions  generally depend upon the declaration of dividends by
the  issuers of  Portfolio  Securities  and the  declaration  of such  dividends
generally depends upon various factors, including the financial condition of the
issuers and general economic conditions.

THE  TRUST IS NOT  ACTIVELY  MANAGED. The Trust  is not  actively  "managed"  by
traditional  methods, and therefore the adverse financial condition of an issuer
will not result in the  elimination of its stocks from the Portfolio  unless the
stocks of such issuer are removed from the S&amp;P 500 Index.

A LIQUID TRADING MARKET FOR CERTAIN PORTFOLIO SECURITIES MAY NOT EXIST. Although
most of the Portfolio  Securities are listed on a national securities  exchange,
the principal trading market for some may be in the over-the-counter market. The
existence of a liquid trading market for certain Portfolio Securities may depend
on whether dealers will make a market in such stocks.  There can be no assurance
that a market will be made for any Portfolio Securities, that any market will be
maintained or that any such market will be or remain liquid.  The price at which
Portfolio  Securities  may be  sold  and  the  value  of the  Portfolio  will be
adversely  affected if trading  markets for Portfolio  Securities are limited or
absent.

THE TRUST MAY NOT ALWAYS BE ABLE EXACTLY TO REPLICATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE S&amp;P
500 INDEX. The Trust is not able to replicate exactly the performance of the S&amp;P
500 Index  because the total  return  generated  by the  Portfolio is reduced by
Trust expenses and transaction costs incurred in adjusting the actual balance of
the Portfolio.  It is also possible that, for a short period,  the Trust may not
fully  replicate  the  performance  of the S&amp;P 500  Index  due to the  temporary
unavailability  of certain Index  Securities  in the secondary  market or due to
other extraordinary circumstances.

INVESTMENT  IN THE TRUST MAY HAVE  ADVERSE TAX  CONSEQUENCES.  Investors  in the
Trust should also be aware that there are tax  consequences  associated with the
ownership of SPDRs resulting from the  distribution of Trust dividends and sales
of SPDRs as well as under certain  circumstances the sales of stocks held by the
Trust in connection with redemptions.

NAV MAY NOT ALWAYS CORRESPOND TO MARKET PRICE. The NAV of SPDRs in Creation Unit
size  aggregations  and,   proportionately,   the  NAV  per  SPDR,   changes  as
fluctuations occur in the market value of Portfolio Securities. Investors should
be aware that the aggregate  public  trading market price of 50,000 SPDRs may be
different  from the NAV of a Creation  Unit (i.e.,  50,000  SPDRs may trade at a
premium over, or at a discount to,

                                       11
<page>


the NAV of a Creation  Unit) and similarly the public  trading  market price per
SPDR may be different from the NAV of a Creation Unit on a per SPDR basis.  This
price  difference  may be due, in large part, to the fact that supply and demand
forces at work in the secondary  trading market for SPDRs is closely related to,
but not identical to, the same forces influencing the prices of Index Securities
trading  individually  or in the aggregate at any point in time.  Investors also
should note that the size of the Trust in terms of total  assets held may change
substantially  over time and from time to time as Creation Units are created and
redeemed.

THE  EXCHANGE  MAY HALT  TRADING IN SPDRS.  SPDRs are listed for  trading on the
Exchange  under the  market  symbol  SPY.  Trading in SPDRs may be halted due to
market  conditions  or, in light of Exchange rules and  procedures,  for reasons
that,  in the  view of the  Exchange,  make  trading  in SPDRs  inadvisable.  In
addition,  trading is subject to trading  halts caused by  extraordinary  market
volatility  pursuant to Exchange "circuit breaker" rules that require trading to
be halted for a specified period based on a specified market decline.  There can
be no assurance that the requirements of the Exchange  necessary to maintain the
listing of SPDRs will  continue  to be met or will remain  unchanged.  The Trust
will be terminated if SPDRs are delisted from the Exchange.

SPDRS ARE  SUBJECT TO MARKET  RISKS.  SPDRs are  subject to the risks other than
those inherent in an investment in equity  securities,  discussed above, in that
the selection of the stocks included in the Portfolio,  the expenses  associated
with the Trust, or other factors distinguishing an ownership interest in a trust
from the direct ownership of a portfolio of stocks may affect trading in SPDRs.

THE  REGULAR  SETTLEMENT  PERIOD FOR  CREATION  UNITS MAY BE  REDUCED. Except as
otherwise  specifically noted, the time frames for delivery of stocks,  cash, or
SPDRs in  connection  with  creation  and  redemption  activity  within the SPDR
Clearing Process are based on NSCC's current "regular way" settlement  period of
three (3) days during  which NSCC is open for  business  (each such day an "NSCC
Business  Day").  NSCC may, in the future,  reduce such "regular way" settlement
period,  in which  case there may be a  corresponding  reduction  in  settlement
periods applicable to SPDR creations and redemptions.

CLEARING AND  SETTLEMENT  OF CREATION  UNITS MAY BE DELAYED OR FAIL. The Trustee
delivers a portfolio of stocks for each Creation Unit  delivered for  redemption
substantially  identical in weighting and  composition to the stock portion of a
Portfolio  Deposit as in effect on the date the request for redemption is deemed
received by the Trustee.  If redemption  is processed  through the SPDR Clearing
Process,  the stocks that are not delivered  are covered by NSCC's  guarantee of
the completion of such delivery.  Any stocks not received on settlement date are
marked-to-market  until delivery is completed.  The Trust,  to the extent it has
not already done so,  remains  obligated to deliver the stocks to NSCC,  and the
market risk of any increase in the value of the stocks until delivery is made by
the Trust to NSCC could adversely affect the NAV of the Trust.  Investors should
note that the stocks to be  delivered  to a  redeemer  submitting  a  redemption
request  outside of the SPDR  Clearing  Process  that are not  delivered to such
redeemer are not covered by NSCC's guarantee of completion of delivery.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

TO THE TRUSTEE AND THE UNITHOLDERS OF SPDR TRUST, SERIES 1:

     In our  opinion,  the  accompanying  statement  of assets and  liabilities,
including the schedule of investments,  and the related statements of operations
and of changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material  respects,  the financial position of SPDR Trust Series 1 (the "Trust")
at September 30, 2002, and the results of its operations, the changes in its net
assets and the financial  highlights  for the periods  indicated,  in conformity
with accounting  principles  generally accepted in the United States of America.
These financial  statements and financial  highlights  (hereafter referred to as
"financial  statements") are the responsibility of the Trust's  management;  our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial  statements in accordance
with  auditing  standards  generally  accepted in the United  States of America,
which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance
about whether the financial  statements  are free of material  misstatement.  An
audit includes examining,  on a test basis,  evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial  statements,  assessing the  accounting  principles
used and  significant  estimates made by management,  and evaluating the overall
financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits,  which included
confirmation  of  securities at September  30, 2002 by  correspondence  with the
custodian, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

SPDR TRUST, SERIES 1
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SEPTEMBER 30, 2002

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


NOTE 1--ORGANIZATION

     SPDR Trust Series 1 (the "Trust") is a unit investment  trust created under
the laws of the State of New York and registered  under the  Investment  Company
Act of 1940. The Trust was created to provide  investors with the opportunity to
purchase  a  security  representing  a  proportionate  undivided  interest  in a
portfolio of securities consisting of substantially all of the common stocks, in
substantially  the same  weighting,  which  comprise  the  Standard &amp; Poor's 500
Composite  Stock  Price  Index (the "S&amp;P 500  Index").  Each unit of  fractional
undivided interest in the Trust is referred to as a Standard &amp; Poor's Depositary
Receipt  ("SPDR").  The Trust commenced  operations on January 22, 1993 upon the
initial  issuance of 150,000 SPDRs  (equivalent to three  "Creation  Units"--see
Note 4) in  exchange  for a portfolio  of  securities  assembled  to reflect the
intended portfolio  composition of the Trust.  Effective September 30, 1997, the
fiscal year end of the Trust changed from December 31 to September 30.

NOTE 2--SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     The  preparation  of financial  statements  in accordance  with  accounting
principles   generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  requires
management to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts
and  disclosures in the financial  statements.  Actual results could differ from
these estimates.  The following is a summary of significant  accounting policies
followed by the Trust.

     Security  Valuation--Portfolio  securities  are valued based on the closing
sale price on the exchange  which is deemed to be the  principal  market for the
security. If no closing sale price is available,  then the security is valued at
the  previous  closing  sale  price on the  exchange  which is  deemed to be the
principal market for the security.  If there is no closing sale price available,
valuation  will be  determined  by the Trustee in good faith based on  available
information.

     Investment Transactions--Investment  transactions are recorded on the trade
date.  Realized  gains and losses from the sale or disposition of securities are
recorded  on the  identified  cost  basis.  Dividend  income is  recorded on the
ex-dividend date.

     Distributions to Unitholders--The  Trust declares and distributes dividends
from  net  investment  income  to its  unitholders  quarterly.  The  Trust  will
distribute net realized capital gains, if any, at least annually.

     Federal  Income  Tax--The  Trust has  qualified and intends to qualify as a
"regulated  investment  company" under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as

SPDR TRUST, SERIES 1
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
SEPTEMBER 30, 2002

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

amended. By so qualifying and electing, the Trust will not be subject to federal
income taxes to the extent it distributes its taxable income,  including any net
realized  capital  gains,  for each fiscal year.  In addition,  by  distributing
during each calendar year  substantially  all of its net  investment  income and
capital  gains,  if any,  the Trust will not be subject to federal  excise  tax.
Income and capital gain  distributions  are determined in accordance with income
tax regulations which may differ from generally accepted accounting  principles.
These  differences  are  primarily  due  to  differing   treatments  for  income
equalization,  in-kind  transactions  and losses deferred due to wash sales. Net
investment  income per share  calculations  in the financial  highlights for all

                                    THE TRUST

     The Trust,  an exchange  traded fund or "ETF",  is a registered  investment
company  which both (a)  continuously  issues and redeems  "in-kind" its shares,
known  as  SPDRs,  only in  large  lot  sizes  called  Creation  Units  at their
once-daily  NAV and (b) lists SPDRs  individually  for  trading on the  American
Stock Exchange at prices established  throughout the trading day, like any other
listed equity security trading in the secondary market on the Exchange.

CREATION OF CREATION UNITS

     Portfolio Deposits may be made through the SPDR Clearing Process or outside
the SPDR Clearing Process only by a person who executed a Participant  Agreement
with the  Distributor and the Trustee.  The  Distributor  shall reject any order
that is not submitted in proper form. A creation order is deemed received by the
Distributor on the date on which it is placed  ("Transmittal  Date") if (a) such
order is received  by the  Distributor  not later than the Closing  Time on such
Transmittal  Date and (b) all  other  procedures  set  forth in the  Participant
Agreement are properly  followed.  The Transaction Fee is charged at the time of
creation of a Creation  Unit,  and an additional  amount not to exceed three (3)
times the  Transaction  Fee  applicable  for one  Creation  Unit is charged  for
creations  outside  the SPDR  Clearing  Process,  in part  due to the  increased
expense associated with settlement.

     The Trustee,  at the  direction of the Sponsor,  may  increase*,  reduce or
waive the Transaction  Fee (and/or the additional  amounts charged in connection
with creations and/or redemptions outside the SPDR Clearing Process) for certain
lot-size  creations  and/or  redemptions of Creation Units.  The Sponsor has the
right to vary the  lot-size of Creation  Units  subject to such an  increase,  a
reduction or waiver.  The existence of any such variation  shall be disclosed in
the then current SPDR Prospectus.

     The Trustee makes available to NSCC** before the commencement of trading on
each  Business  Day a list of the  names and  required  number of shares of each
Index  Security  in the current  Portfolio  Deposit as well as the amount of the
Dividend  Equivalent  Payment for the  previous  Business  Day. The identity and
weightings  of the  Index  Securities  to be  delivered  as part of a  Portfolio
Deposit are determined daily,  reflect the relative weighting of the current S&amp;P
500 Index and, together with the Cash Component, have a value equal

---------
*   Such increase is subject to the 10 Basis Point Limit.

**  As of December  31, 2002,  the  Depository  Trust and  Clearing  Corporation
    ("DTCC") owned 100% of the issued and outstanding  shares of common stock of
    NSCC. Also, as of such date, the National Association of Securities Dealers,
    Inc.,  the parent  Company of the Exchange,  owned 3.6372% of the issued and
    outstanding  shares of common  stock of DTCC ("DTCC  Shares"),  the Exchange
    owned  3.6372%  of  DTCC  Shares,   the  American  Stock  Exchange  Clearing
    Corporation LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Exchange, owned 0.0016% of
    DTCC Shares and the Trustee owned 4.59% of DTCC Shares.

                                       28

to the NAV of the Trust on a per Creation Unit basis at the close of business on
the day of the creation  request.  The identity of each Index Security  required
for a Portfolio Deposit, as in effect on September 30, 2002, is set forth in the
above Schedule of Investments.  The Sponsor makes available (a) on each Business
Day,  the  Dividend  Equivalent  Payment  effective  through and  including  the
previous Business Day, per outstanding SPDR, and (b) every 15 seconds throughout
the day at the Exchange a number  representing,  on a per SPDR basis, the sum of
the Dividend  Equivalent  Payment  effective  through and including the previous
Business Day, plus the current value of the stock portion of a Portfolio Deposit
as in effect  on such day  (which  value  occasionally  includes  a cash in lieu
amount to compensate  for the omission of a particular  Index Security from such
Portfolio  Deposit).   This  information  is  calculated  based  upon  the  best
information  available  to the Sponsor and may be  calculated  by other  persons
designated to do so by the Sponsor. The inability of the Sponsor to provide such
information  will not in itself  result in a halt to the trading of SPDRs on the
Exchange.

     Upon receipt of one or more Portfolio  Deposits,  following  placement with
the  Distributor  of an order to create  SPDRs,  the Trustee (a) delivers one or
more  Creation  Units to DTC, (b) removes the SPDR  position from its account at
DTC and allocates it to the account of the DTC  Participant  acting on behalf of
the investor creating Creation Unit(s), (c) increases the aggregate value of the
Portfolio,  and (d) decreases  the  fractional  undivided  interest in the Trust
represented by each SPDR.

     Under  certain  circumstances,  (a) a  portion  of the stock  portion  of a
Portfolio  Deposit may consist of contracts to purchase certain Index Securities
or (b) a portion of the Cash Component may consist of cash in an amount required
to enable the Trustee to purchase such Index  Securities.  If there is a failure
to deliver Index  Securities that are the subject of such contracts to purchase,
the Trustee will acquire such Index Securities in a timely manner. To the extent
the price of any such Index Security  increases or decreases between the time of
creation and the time of its purchase and delivery,  SPDRs will represent  fewer
or more shares of such Index Security.  Therefore, price fluctuations during the
period  from  the  time  the cash is  received  by the  Trustee  to the time the
requisite Index  Securities are purchased and delivered will affect the value of
all SPDRs.

PROCEDURES FOR CREATION OF CREATION UNITS

     All creation  orders must be placed in Creation  Units and must be received
by the  Distributor  by no later than the closing  time of the  regular  trading
session on the New York Stock Exchange,  Inc.  ("Closing Time") (ordinarily 4:00
p.m.  New York  time) in each case on the date such order is placed in order for
creation  to be  effected  based on the NAV of the Trust as  determined  on such
date.  Orders must be  transmitted  by  telephone or other  transmission  method
acceptable to the Distributor and the Trustee,  pursuant to procedures set forth
in the Participant  Agreement and described in this prospectus.  Severe economic
or market disruptions or changes, or telephone or other  communication  failure,
may impede the ability to reach the  Distributor,  the Trustee,  a Participating
Party or a DTC Participant.

                                       29
<page>


     SPDRs may be created  in  advance  of  receipt  by the  Trustee of all or a
portion of the Portfolio Deposit.  In these  circumstances,  the initial deposit
has a value  greater  than the NAV of the  SPDRs on the date the order is placed
provided in proper form, because in addition to available Index Securities, cash
collateral  must be deposited  with the Trustee in an amount equal to the sum of
(a) the Cash  Component,  plus (b) 115% of the market  value of the  undelivered
Index Securities ("Additional Cash Deposit").  The Trustee holds such Additional
Cash Deposit as collateral in an account  separate and apart from the Trust. The
order is deemed received on the Business Day on which the order is placed if the
order is placed in proper form before the Closing Time, on such date and federal
funds in the  appropriate  amount are deposited  with the Trustee by 11:00 a.m.,
New York time,  the next Business Day. If the order is not placed in proper form
by the Closing Time or federal funds in the appropriate  amount are not received
by 11:00 a.m. the next  Business Day, the order may be deemed to be rejected and
the investor shall be liable to the Trust for any losses,  resulting  therefrom.
An  additional  amount  of cash  must be  deposited  with the  Trustee,  pending
delivery of the missing Index Securities to the extent necessary to maintain the
Additional  Cash Deposit with the Trustee in an amount at least equal to 115% of
the daily mark-to-market value of the missing Index Securities. If missing Index
Securities  are not received by 1:00 p.m.,  New York time, on the third Business
Day  following the day on which the purchase  order is deemed  received and if a
mark-to-market   payment  is  not  made  within  one  Business   Day   following
notification by the Distributor that such a payment is required, the Trustee may
use the Additional  Cash Deposit to purchase the missing Index  Securities.  The
Trustee will return any unused portion of the  Additional  Cash Deposit once all
of the missing Index Securities have been properly  received or purchased by the
Trustee and deposited into the Trust.  In addition,  a transaction fee of $4,000
is charged in all cases. The delivery of Creation Units so created will occur no
later than the third  Business Day following the day on which the purchase order
is deemed  received.  The  Participant  Agreement  for any  Participating  Party
intending  to  follow  these   procedures  will  contain  terms  and  conditions
permitting the Trustee to buy the missing portion(s) of the Portfolio Deposit at
any time and will subject the Participating Party to liability for any shortfall
between  the cost to the Trust of  purchasing  such stocks and the value of such
collateral.  The  Participating  Party is  liable  to the  Trust  for the  costs
incurred by the Trust in connection with any such purchases. The Trust will have
no liability for any such shortfall.

     All questions as to the number of shares of each Index Security, the amount
of the Cash Component and the validity,  form,  eligibility  (including  time of
receipt) and acceptance for deposit of any Index  Securities to be delivered are
determined  by the Trustee.  The Trustee may reject a creation  order if (a) the
depositor or group of depositors,  upon  obtaining the SPDRs ordered,  would own
80% or more of the current  outstanding  SPDRs, (b) the Portfolio Deposit is not
in proper form;  (c)  acceptance  of the  Portfolio  Deposit  would have certain
adverse tax consequences;  (d) the acceptance of the Portfolio Deposit would, in
the opinion of counsel, be unlawful; (e) the acceptance of the Portfolio Deposit
would otherwise have an adverse effect on the Trust or the rights of Beneficial

                                       30
<page>


Owners; or (f) circumstances  outside the control of the Trustee make it for all
practical purposes impossible to process creations of SPDRs. The Trustee and the
Sponsor are under no duty to give  notification of any defects or irregularities
in the delivery of Portfolio  Deposits or any  component  thereof and neither of
them shall incur any liability for the failure to give any such notification.

PLACEMENT OF CREATION ORDERS USING SPDR CLEARING PROCESS

     Creation Units created through the SPDR Clearing  Process must be delivered
through a  Participating  Party that has executed a Participant  Agreement.  The
Participant  Agreement  authorizes the Trustee to transmit to the  Participating
Party such trade  instructions  as are  necessary to effect the creation  order.
Pursuant to the trade  instructions  from the Trustee to NSCC, the Participating
Party  agrees to transfer  the  requisite  Index  Securities  (or  contracts  to
purchase  such Index  Securities  that are expected to be delivered  through the
SPDR Clearing  Process in a "regular way" manner by the third NSCC Business Day)
and the Cash Component to the Trustee, together with such additional information
as may be required by the Trustee.

PLACEMENT OF CREATION ORDERS OUTSIDE SPDR CLEARING PROCESS

     Creation Units created outside the SPDR Clearing  Process must be delivered
through a DTC  Participant  that has executed a  Participant  Agreement  and has
stated in its order  that it is not using  the SPDR  Clearing  Process  and that
creation  will  instead be effected  through a transfer of stocks and cash.  The
requisite  number  of Index  Securities  must be  delivered  through  DTC to the
account of the  Trustee by no later than  11:00 a.m.  of the next  Business  Day
immediately  following the  Transmittal  Date. The Trustee,  through the Federal
Reserve Bank wire transfer system, must receive the Cash Component no later than
2:00 p.m. on the next Business Day immediately  following the Transmittal  Date.
If the Trustee does not receive both the requisite Index Securities and the Cash
Component in a timely fashion, the order will be cancelled.  Upon written notice
to the  Distributor,  the  cancelled  order  may be  resubmitted  the  following
Business  Day using a  Portfolio  Deposit as newly  constituted  to reflect  the
current NAV of the Trust.  The  delivery of SPDRs so created will occur no later
than the third (3rd)  Business Day following the day on which the creation order
is deemed received by the Distributor.

SECURITIES DEPOSITORY; BOOK-ENTRY-ONLY SYSTEM

     DTC acts as securities  depository  for SPDRs.  SPDRs are  represented by a
single global security, registered in the name of Cede &amp; Co., as nominee for DTC
and deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC.

     DTC is a  limited-purpose  trust  company  organized  under the laws of the
State  of New  York,  a  member  of the  Federal  Reserve  System,  a  "clearing
corporation"  within the meaning of the New York Uniform  Commercial Code, and a
"clearing  agency"  registered  pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. DTC holds

                                       31
<page>


securities  of its  participants  ("DTC  Participants")  and to  facilitate  the
clearance and settlement of securities  transactions  among the DTC Participants
through electronic book-entry changes in their accounts, thereby eliminating the
need for physical movement of securities certificates.  DTC Participants include
securities brokers and dealers,  banks, trust companies,  clearing corporations,
and certain other organizations, some of whom (and/or their representatives) own
DTC.* Access to DTC system also is available to others, such as banks,  brokers,
dealers  and  trust  companies  that  clear  through  or  maintain  a  custodial
relationship  with a DTC Participant,  either directly or indirectly  ("Indirect
Participants").

     Upon the settlement date of any creation,  transfer or redemption of SPDRs,
DTC credits or debits, on its book-entry  registration and transfer system,  the
amount of SPDRs so  created,  transferred  or  redeemed  to the  accounts of the
appropriate  DTC  Participants.  The  accounts  to be  credited  and charged are
designated  by the  Trustee  to NSCC,  in the case of a creation  or  redemption
through the SPDR Clearing Process, or by the Trustee and the DTC Participant, in
the case of a  creation  or  redemption  outside of the SPDR  Clearing  Process.
Beneficial  ownership  of  SPDRs  is  limited  to  DTC  Participants,   Indirect
Participants and persons holding interests through DTC Participants and Indirect
Participants.  Ownership  of  beneficial  interests  in  SPDRs  (owners  of such
beneficial interests are referred to herein as "Beneficial Owners") is shown on,
and the transfer of ownership is effected  only through,  records  maintained by
DTC (with respect to DTC  Participants)  and on the records of DTC  Participants
(with respect to Indirect  Participants  and Beneficial  Owners that are not DTC
Participants). Beneficial Owners are expected to receive from or through the DTC
Participant a written confirmation relating to their purchase of SPDRs. The laws
of some  jurisdictions  may require that certain  purchasers of securities  take
physical  delivery of such  securities in definitive  form. Such laws may impair
the ability of certain investors to acquire beneficial interests in SPDRs.

     As long as Cede &amp; Co., as nominee of DTC, is the registered owner of SPDRs,
references to the  registered or record owner of SPDRs shall mean Cede &amp; Co. and
shall not mean the Beneficial  Owners of SPDRs.  Beneficial  Owners of SPDRs are
not entitled to have SPDRs  registered  in their  names,  will not receive or be
entitled to receive  physical  delivery of  certificates  in definitive form and
will not be considered the record or registered  holders thereof under the Trust
Agreement.  Accordingly,  each  Beneficial  Owner must rely on the procedures of
DTC,  the DTC  Participant  and any  Indirect  Participant  through  which  such
Beneficial  Owner holds its  interests,  to exercise  any rights under the Trust
Agreement.

     The Trustee recognizes DTC or its nominee as the owner of all SPDRs for all
purposes except as expressly set forth in the Trust  Agreement.  Pursuant to the
agreement between the Trustee and DTC ("Depository Agreement"),  DTC is required
to make available to the Trustee upon request and for a fee to be charged to the
Trust a  listing  of the SPDR  holdings  of each DTC  Participant.  The  Trustee
inquires of each such DTC

--------------
* As of December 31, 2002, DTCC owned 100% of the issued and outstanding  shares
  of the common stock of DTC.

                                       32
<page>


Participant as to the number of Beneficial  Owners  holding  SPDRs,  directly or
indirectly,  through the DTC  Participant.  The Trustee  provides  each such DTC
Participant with copies of such notice, statement or other communication, in the
form, number and at the place as the DTC Participant may reasonably  request, in
order that the notice,  statement or communication may be transmitted by the DTC
Participant,  directly or indirectly, to the Beneficial Owners. In addition, the
Trust  pays to each  such  DTC  Participant  a fair  and  reasonable  amount  as
reimbursement  for the expense  attendant  to such  transmittal,  all subject to
applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.

     Distributions are made to DTC or its nominee, Cede &amp; Co. DTC or Cede &amp; Co.,
upon receipt of any payment of  distributions  in respect of SPDRs,  is required
immediately  to credit  DTC  Participants'  accounts  with  payments  in amounts
proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in SPDRs, as shown on the
records  of  DTC or its  nominee.  Payments  by  DTC  Participants  to  Indirect
Participants  and Beneficial  Owners of SPDRs held through such DTC Participants
will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the
case with  securities  held for the  accounts  of  customers  in bearer  form or
registered  in a  "street  name,"  and  will be the  responsibility  of such DTC
Participants.  Neither  the  Trustee  nor  the  Sponsor  has or  will  have  any
responsibility  or  liability  for any  aspects of the  records  relating  to or
notices  to  Beneficial  Owners,  or  payments  made on  account  of  beneficial
ownership  interests in SPDRs, or for maintaining,  supervising or reviewing any
records relating to such beneficial  ownership interests or for any other aspect
of the  relationship  between DTC and the DTC  Participants or the  relationship
between such DTC  Participants  and the  Indirect  Participants  and  Beneficial
Owners owning through such DTC Participants.

     DTC may discontinue providing its service with respect to SPDRs at any time
by  giving  notice  to  the  Trustee  and  the  Sponsor  and   discharging   its
responsibilities   with  respect  thereto  under   applicable  law.  Under  such
circumstances,  the Trustee and the Sponsor  shall take action  either to find a
replacement  for DTC to perform its functions at a comparable cost or, if such a
replacement is unavailable, to terminate the Trust.

                               REDEMPTION OF SPDRS

     SPDRs are redeemable only in Creation Units.  Creation Units are redeemable
in kind  only  and  are not  redeemable  for  cash  except  as  described  under
"Summary--Highlights--Termination of the Trust."

PROCEDURES FOR REDEMPTION OF CREATION UNITS

     Redemption   orders  must  be  placed  with  a  Participating   Party  (for
redemptions   through  the  SPDR  Clearing  Process)  or  DTC  Participant  (for
redemptions  outside the SPDR  Clearing  Process),  as  applicable,  in the form
required by such Participating Party or DTC Participant. A particular broker may
not have executed a Participant Agreement,  and redemption orders may have to be
placed by the broker through a Participating Party or


                                       33
<page>

a DTC Participant who has executed a Participant  Agreement.  At any given time,
there  may be only a limited  number of  broker-dealers  that  have  executed  a
Participant  Agreement.  Redeemers  should afford  sufficient time to permit (a)
proper  submission of the order by a  Participating  Party or DTC Participant to
the Trustee and (b) the receipt of the SPDRs to be redeemed  and any Excess Cash
Amounts  by the  Trustee in a timely  manner.  Orders  for  redemption  effected
outside the SPDR Clearing  Process are likely to require  transmittal by the DTC
Participant  earlier on the Transmittal Date than orders effected using the SPDR
Clearing Process. These deadlines vary by institution. Persons redeeming outside
the SPDR  Clearing  Process are required to transfer  SPDRs  through DTC and the
Excess Cash  amounts,  if any,  through the Federal  Reserve Bank wire  transfer
system in a timely manner.

     Requests for  redemption may be made on any Business Day to the Trustee and
not to the  Distributor.  In the  case of  redemptions  made  through  the  SPDR
Clearing  Process,  the Transaction Fee is deducted from the amount delivered to
the redeemer.  In the case of redemptions outside the SPDR Clearing Process, the
Transaction  Fee plus an  additional  amount  not to exceed  three (3) times the
Transaction Fee applicable for one Creation Unit per Creation Unit redeemed, and
such amount is deducted from the amount delivered to the redeemer.

     The Trustee  transfers to the  redeeming  Beneficial  Owner via DTC and the
relevant  DTC  Participant(s)  a  portfolio  of stocks  for each  Creation  Unit
delivered, generally identical in weighting and composition to the stock portion
of a Portfolio  Deposit as in effect (a) on the date a request for redemption is
deemed  received  by the  Trustee or (b) in the case of the  termination  of the
Trust,  on the date that notice of the  termination  of the Trust is given.  The
Trustee also  transfers  via the relevant DTC  Participant(s)  to the  redeeming
Beneficial Owner a "Cash Redemption Payment," which on any given Business Day is
an  amount  identical  to the  amount  of the Cash  Component  and is equal to a
proportional amount of the following:  dividends on the Portfolio Securities for
the period through the date of redemption,  net of expenses and  liabilities for
such  period  including,  without  limitation,  (i) taxes or other  governmental
charges against the Trust not previously  deducted if any, and (ii) accrued fees
of the Trustee and other expenses of the Trust,  as if the Portfolio  Securities
had been held for the entire accumulation period for such distribution,  plus or
minus the Balancing Amount.  The redeeming  Beneficial Owner must deliver to the
Trustee any amount by which the amount  payable to the Trust by such  Beneficial
Owner exceeds the amount of the Cash Redemption Payment ("Excess Cash Amounts").
For  redemptions  through  the SPDR  Clearing  Process,  the  Trustee  effects a
transfer of the Cash Redemption  Payment and stocks to the redeeming  Beneficial
Owner by the third (3rd) NSCC  Business Day  following the date on which request
for redemption is deemed  received.  For  redemptions  outside the SPDR Clearing
Process, the Trustee transfers the Cash Redemption Payment and the stocks to the
redeeming Beneficial Owner by the third (3rd) Business Day following the date on
which the request for redemption is deemed received. The Trustee will cancel all
SPDRs delivered upon redemption.

     If  the  Trustee  determines  that  an  Index  Security  is  likely  to  be
unavailable or available in insufficient quantity for delivery by the Trust upon
redemption,  the Trustee may elect to deliver the cash  equivalent  value of any
such Index  Securities,  based on its market value as of the Evaluation  Time on
the date such redemption is deemed received by the Trustee as a part of the Cash
Redemption Payment in lieu thereof.

     If a redeemer is restricted by  regulation or otherwise  from  investing or
engaging in a transaction in one or more Index Securities, the Trustee may elect
to deliver the cash equivalent value based on the market value of any such Index
Securities as of the Evaluation  Time on the date of the redemption as a part of
the Cash Redemption Payment in lieu thereof. In such case, the investor will pay
the Trustee the standard Transaction Fee, and may pay an additional amount equal
to the actual amounts incurred in connection with such transaction(s) but in any
case not to  exceed  three  (3) times the  Transaction  Fee  applicable  for one
Creation Unit.

     The Trustee upon the request of a redeeming  investor,  may elect to redeem
Creation Units in whole or in part by providing such redeemer,  with a portfolio
of stocks differing in exact composition from Index Securities but not differing
in NAV from the then-current  Portfolio Deposit.  Such a redemption is likely to
be made  only if it were  determined  that it would be  appropriate  in order to
maintain the Trust's  correspondence to the composition and weighting of the S&amp;P
500 Index.

     The  Trustee  may sell  Portfolio  Securities  to  obtain  sufficient  cash
proceeds  to deliver  to the  redeeming  Beneficial  Owner.  To the extent  cash
proceeds are received by the Trustee in excess of the required amount, such cash
proceeds  shall  be held by the  Trustee  and  applied  in  accordance  with the
guidelines applicable to Misweighting.

     All  redemption  orders must be  transmitted to the Trustee by telephone or
other transmission  method acceptable to the Trustee so as to be received by the
Trustee not later than the Closing  Time on the  Transmittal  Date,  pursuant to
procedures set forth in the  Participant  Agreement.  Severe  economic or market
disruption or changes, or telephone or other communication  failure,  may impede
the ability to reach the Trustee, a Participating Party, or a DTC Participant.

     The calculation of the value of the stocks and the Cash Redemption  Payment
to be  delivered  to the  redeeming  Beneficial  Owner  is made  by the  Trustee
according to the  procedures set forth under  "Valuation"  and is computed as of
the  Evaluation  Time on the Business Day on which a redemption  order is deemed
received by the  Trustee.  Therefore,  if a  redemption  order in proper form is
submitted to the Trustee by a DTC Participant not later than the Closing Time on
the Transmittal Date, and the requisite SPDRs are delivered to the Trustee prior
to DTC Cut-Off Time on such  Transmittal  Date, then the value of the stocks and
the  Cash  Redemption  Payment  to be  delivered  to  the  Beneficial  Owner  is
determined by the Trustee as of the Evaluation  Time on such  Transmittal  Date.
If, however,  a redemption order is submitted not later than the Closing Time on
a Transmittal  Date but either (a) the requisite  SPDRs are NOT delivered by DTC
Cut-Off Time on the

                                       35
<page>


next  Business  Day  immediately  following  such  Transmittal  Date  or (b) the
redemption  order is not submitted in proper form, then the redemption  order is
not deemed received as of such Transmittal  Date. In such case, the value of the
stocks and the Cash Redemption  Payment to be delivered to the Beneficial  Owner
is computed as of the  Evaluation  Time on the  Business  Day that such order is
deemed  received by the Trustee,  I.E.,  the Business Day on which the SPDRs are
delivered  through DTC to the Trustee by DTC Cut-Off  Time on such  Business Day
pursuant to a properly submitted redemption order.

     The Trustee may suspend the right of  redemption,  or postpone  the date of
payment of the NAV for more than five (5) Business  Days  following  the date on
which the request for  redemption is deemed  received by the Trustee (a) for any
period  during which the New York Stock  Exchange is closed,  (b) for any period
during which an emergency  exists as a result of which disposal or evaluation of
the  Securities is not reasonably  practicable,  (c) or for such other period as
the SEC may by order permit for the protection of Beneficial Owners. Neither the
Sponsor  nor the  Trustee  is liable to any person or in any way for any loss or
damages that may result from any such suspension or postponement.

PLACEMENT OF REDEMPTION ORDERS USING SPDR CLEARING PROCESS

     A  redemption  order  made  through  the SPDR  Clearing  Process  is deemed
received  on the  Transmittal  Date if (a) such order is received by the Trustee
not  later  than the  Closing  Time on such  Transmittal  Date and (b) all other
procedures set forth in the  Participant  Agreement are properly  followed.  The
order  is  effected  based  on the  NAV of the  Trust  as  determined  as of the
Evaluation  Time on the  Transmittal  Date. A redemption  order made through the
SPDR Clearing Process and received by the Trustee after the Closing Time will be
deemed received on the next Business Day  immediately  following the Transmittal
Date. The  Participant  Agreement  authorizes the Trustee to transmit to NSCC on
behalf of the  Participating  Party such trade  instructions as are necessary to
effect  the  Participating  Party's  redemption  order.  Pursuant  to such trade
instructions  from the Trustee to NSCC,  the  Trustee  transfers  the  requisite
stocks (or  contracts to purchase such stocks which are expected to be delivered
in a "regular  way" manner) by the third (3rd) NSCC  Business Day  following the
date on which  the  request  for  redemption  is deemed  received,  and the Cash
Redemption Payment.

PLACEMENT OF REDEMPTION ORDERS OUTSIDE SPDR CLEARING PROCESS

     A DTC  Participant  who wishes to place an order for redemption of SPDRs to
be effected outside the SPDR Clearing Process need not be a Participating Party,
but its order must state that the DTC Participant is not using the SPDR Clearing
Process and that redemption will instead be effected  through  transfer of SPDRs
directly  through  DTC.  An order  is  deemed  received  by the  Trustee  on the
Transmittal Date if (a) such order is received by the Trustee not later than the
Closing Time on such Transmittal Date, (b) such order is preceded or accompanied
by the requisite number of SPDRs specified in such order, which delivery must be
made  through DTC to the  Trustee no later than 11:00 a.m. on the next  Business
Day immediately following such Transmittal Date ("DTC Cut-Off Time")

                                       36
<page>


and (iii) all  other  procedures  set  forth in the  Participant  Agreement  are
properly followed.  Any Excess Cash Amounts owed by the Beneficial Owner must be
delivered no later than 2:00 p.m. on the next Business Day immediately following
the Transmittal Date.

     The Trustee  initiates  procedures  to transfer  the  requisite  stocks (or
contracts to purchase  such  stocks)  that are  expected to be delivered  within
three Business Days and the Cash Redemption Payment to the redeeming  Beneficial
Owner by the third Business Day following the Transmittal Date.

                                  THE PORTFOLIO

     Because the objective of the Trust is to provide  investment  results that,
before expenses,  generally correspond to the price and yield performance of the
S&amp;P 500  Index,  the  Portfolio  at any time  will  consist  of as many of Index
Securities as is practicable.  It is anticipated  that cash or cash items (other
than dividends held for  distribution)  normally would not be a substantial part
of the  Trust's  net  assets.  Although  the  Trust  may at any time fail to own
certain of Index Securities,  the Trust will be substantially  invested in Index
Securities  and the Sponsor  believes  that such  investment  should result in a
close correspondence between the investment performance of the S&amp;P 500 Index and
that derived from ownership of SPDRs.

PORTFOLIO SECURITIES CONFORM TO THE S&amp;P 500 INDEX

     The S&amp;P 500  Index is a  capitalization-weighted  index  of 500  securities
calculated  under the  auspices  of the S&amp;P  Committee  of S&amp;P. At any moment in
time,  the value of the S&amp;P 500 Index equals the  aggregate  market value of the
total  shares  outstanding  in  each  of the  component  500  Index  Securities,
evaluated  at their  respective  last sale  prices on the NYSE,  AMEX or NASDAQ,
divided by a scaling factor  ("divisor") which yields a resulting index value in
the reported magnitude.

     Periodically (typically, several times per quarter), S&amp;P may determine that
total shares  outstanding have changed in one or more component Index Securities
due to secondary offerings, repurchases, conversions or other corporate actions.
Additionally, the S&amp;P Committee may periodically (ordinarily,  several times per
quarter)  replace  one or more  component  securities  in the S&amp;P  Index  due to
mergers,  acquisitions,  bankruptcies,  or other  market  conditions,  or if the
issuers of such component  securities fail to meet the criteria for inclusion in
the S&amp;P 500 Index. In 2002,  there were 25 company changes to the S&amp;P 500 Index.
Ordinarily,  whenever  there is a change in shares  outstanding or a change in a
component  security of the S&amp;P 500 Index, S&amp;P adjusts the divisor to ensure that
there is no discontinuity in the value of the S&amp;P 500 Index.

     The Trust is not managed and therefore the adverse  financial  condition of
an issuer does not require the sale of stocks from the Portfolio. The Trustee on
a non-discretionary basis adjusts the composition of the Portfolio to conform to
changes in the composition  and/or weighting  structure of Index Securities.  To
the extent that the method of determining

                                       37
<page>

the  S&amp;P  500  Index  is  changed  by S&amp;P in a  manner  that  would  affect  the
adjustments  provided for herein,  the Trustee and the Sponsor have the right to
amend the Trust Agreement,  without the consent of DTC or Beneficial  Owners, to
conform  the  adjustments  to such  changes  and to maintain  the  objective  of
tracking the S&amp;P 500 Index.

     The Trustee  aggregates  certain of these  adjustments and makes conforming
changes  to the  Portfolio  at least  monthly.  The  Trustee  directs  its stock
transactions  only to brokers or dealers,  which may include  affiliates  of the
Trustee,  from whom it expects to obtain the most favorable  prices or execution
of  orders.  Adjustments  are made more  frequently  in the case of  significant
changes to the S&amp;P 500 Index.  Specifically,  the  Trustee is required to adjust
the  composition of the Portfolio  whenever there is a change in the identity of
any Index Security  (I.E., a  substitution  of one security for another)  within
three (3) Business Days before or after the day on which the change is scheduled
to take effect.  If the transaction costs incurred by the Trust in adjusting the
Portfolio  would exceed the expected  variation  between the  composition of the
Portfolio  and the  S&amp;P  500  Index  ("Misweighting"),  it may not be  efficient
identically  to  replicate  the share  composition  of the S&amp;P 500 Index.  Minor
Misweighting  generally is permitted  within the guidelines set forth below. The
Trustee is required to adjust the  composition of the Portfolio at any time that
the weighting of any stock in the Portfolio  varies in excess of one hundred and
fifty percent (150%) of a specified  percentage,  which  percentage  varies from
8/100 of 1% to 2/100 of 1%,  depending  on the NAV of the Trust  (in each  case,
"Misweighting  Amount"), from the weighting of the Index Security in the S&amp;P 500
Index.

     The Trustee  examines  each stock in the  Portfolio on each  Business  Day,
comparing its weighting to the weighting of the  corresponding  Index  Security,
based on prices at the close of the  market  on the  preceding  Business  Day (a
"Weighting Analysis").  If there is a Misweighting in any stock in the Portfolio
in excess of one hundred and fifty percent (150%) of the applicable Misweighting
Amount,  the Trustee calculates an adjustment to the Portfolio in order to bring
the Misweighting within the Misweighting Amount, based on prices at the close of
the  market on the day on which such  Misweighting  occurs.  Also,  on a monthly
basis,  the  Trustee  performs  a  Weighting  Analysis  for  each  stock  in the
Portfolio,  and in any case where  there  exists a  Misweighting  exceeding  one
hundred  percent  (100%) of the  applicable  Misweighting  Amount,  the  Trustee
calculates an  adjustment  to the  Portfolio in order to bring the  Misweighting
within the applicable  Misweighting  Amount, based on prices at the close of the
market  on the  day on  which  such  Misweighting  occurs.  In the  case  of any
adjustment to the Portfolio  because of a Misweighting,  the purchase or sale of
stock  necessitated  by the adjustment is made within three (3) Business Days of
the day on which such  Misweighting is determined.  In addition to the foregoing
adjustments,  the Trustee may make additional periodic  adjustments to Portfolio
Securities   that  may  be  misweighted  by  an  amount  within  the  applicable
Misweighting Amount.

     The foregoing  guidelines  with respect to  Misweighting  also apply to any
Index Security that (a) is likely to be unavailable for delivery or available in
insufficient quantity for delivery or (b) cannot be delivered to the Trustee due
to restrictions prohibiting a creator

                                       38
<page>


from engaging in a transaction involving such Index Security. Upon receipt of an
order for a Creation  Unit that  involves  such an Index  Security,  the Trustee
determines  whether  the  substitution  of cash  for  the  stock  would  cause a
Misweighting  in the  Portfolio.  If a  Misweighting  results,  the Trustee will
purchase the required  number of shares of the Index  Security on the opening of
the market on the following  Business Day. If a Misweighting does not result and
the Trustee does not hold cash in excess of the permitted  amounts,  the Trustee
may hold the cash or, if such excess would result, make the required adjustments
to the Portfolio.

     As a result of the  purchase  and sale of stock in  accordance  with  these
requirements,  or the creation of Creation Units, the Trust may hold some amount
of residual  cash (other than cash held  temporarily  due to timing  differences
between  the sale and  purchase  of  stock  or cash  delivered  in lieu of Index
Securities or undistributed income or undistributed  capital gains). This amount
may not  exceed  for more than two (2)  consecutive  Business  Days  5/10th of 1
percent of the value of the  Portfolio.  If the  Trustee  has made all  required
adjustments  and is left with cash in excess of 5/10th of 1 percent of the value
of the Portfolio,  the Trustee will use such cash to purchase  additional  Index
Securities  that  are  under-weighted  in the  Portfolio  as  compared  to their
relative  weightings  in the S&amp;P 500 Index,  although the  Misweighting  of such
Index Securities may not be in excess of the applicable Misweighting Amount.

     All  portfolio  adjustments  are  made  as  described  herein  unless  such
adjustments would cause the Trust to lose its status as a "regulated  investment
company" under Subchapter M of the Code.  Additionally,  the Trustee is required
to adjust the  composition  of the Portfolio at any time to insure the continued
qualification of the Trust as a regulated investment company.

     The  Trustee  relies  on  industry   sources  for  information  as  to  the
composition and weightings of Index Securities. If the Trustee becomes incapable
of obtaining or processing  such  information  or NSCC is unable to receive such
information  from the Trustee on any  Business  Day,  the Trustee  shall use the
composition and weightings of Index  Securities for the most recently  effective
Portfolio  Deposit  for  the  purposes  of all  adjustments  and  determinations
(including,  without  limitation,  determination  of the  stock  portion  of the
Portfolio  Deposit)  until the  earlier of (a) such time as current  information
with  respect to Index  Securities  is  available  or (b) three (3)  consecutive
Business Days have  elapsed.  If such current  information  is not available and
three (3) consecutive Business Days have elapsed, the composition and weightings
of Portfolio  Securities (as opposed to Index  Securities) shall be used for the
purposes of all adjustments and determinations  (including,  without limitation,
determination  of the stock  portion of the  Portfolio  Deposit)  until  current
information with respect to Index Securities is available.

     If the Trust is  terminated,  the  Trustee  shall use the  composition  and
weightings  of Portfolio  Securities  as of such notice date for the purpose and
determination of all redemptions or other required uses of the basket.

                                       39
<page>


     From  time to time S&amp;P may  adjust  the  composition  of the S&amp;P 500  Index
because of a merger or acquisition  involving one or more Index  Securities.  In
such cases,  the Trust,  as  shareholder of an issuer that is the object of such
merger or  acquisition  activity,  may  receive  various  offers  from  would-be
acquirors of the issuer.  The Trustee is not permitted to accept any such offers
until such time as it has been  determined that the stocks of the issuer will be
removed  from the S&amp;P 500 Index.  As stocks of an issuer are often  removed from
the S&amp;P 500 Index only after the consummation of a merger or acquisition of such
issuer,  in selling the securities of such issuer the Trust may receive,  to the
extent that market prices do not provide a more attractive alternative, whatever
consideration  is being offered to the shareholders of such issuer that have not
tendered their shares prior to such time. Any cash received in such transactions
is  reinvested in Index  Securities  in  accordance  with the criteria set forth
above.  Any stocks  received as a part of the  consideration  that are not Index
Securities  are sold as soon as  practicable  and the cash proceeds of such sale
are reinvested in accordance with the criteria set forth above.

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PORTFOLIO DEPOSIT

     On each  Business Day (each such day an  "Adjustment  Day"),  the number of
shares and identity of each Index  Security in a Portfolio  Deposit are adjusted
in  accordance  with the  following  procedure.  At the close of the  market the
Trustee  calculates  the NAV of the  Trust.  The NAV is divided by the number of
outstanding SPDRs multiplied by 50,000 SPDRs in one Creation Unit,  resulting in
an NAV per Creation Unit ("NAV Amount").  The Trustee then calculates the number
of shares  (without  rounding)  of each of the  component  stocks of the S&amp;P 500
Index in a Portfolio Deposit for the following  Business Day ("Request Day"), so
that (a) the market  value at the close of the market on the  Adjustment  Day of
the stocks to be included in the Portfolio Deposit on Request Day, together with
the Dividend  Equivalent  Payment  effective for requests to create or redeem on
the Adjustment  Day, equals the NAV Amount and (b) the identity and weighting of
each of the stocks in a Portfolio Deposit mirrors  proportionately  the identity
and weightings of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 Index,  each as in effect on Request
Day. For each stock,  the number  resulting from such  calculation is rounded to
the  nearest  whole  share,  with a  fraction  of 0.50  being  rounded  up.  The
identities  and  weightings  of the stocks so  calculated  constitute  the stock
portion of the Portfolio  Deposit  effective on Request Day and thereafter until
the next  subsequent  Adjustment  Day,  as well as  Portfolio  Securities  to be
delivered by the Trustee in the event of request for  redemption  on the Request
Day and thereafter until the following Adjustment Day.

     In addition to the foregoing  adjustments,  if a corporate action such as a
stock split,  stock  dividend or reverse  split occurs with respect to any Index
Security that does not result in an adjustment to the S&amp;P 500 Index divisor, the
Portfolio Deposit shall be adjusted to take into account the corporate action in
each case rounded to the nearest whole share.

     On the  Request  Day and on each day that a  request  for the  creation  or
redemption is deemed  received,  the Trustee  calculates the market value of the
stock portion of the

                                       40
<page>


Portfolio  Deposit as in effect on the Request Day as of the close of the market
and adds to that amount the Dividend  Equivalent  Payment effective for requests
to create or redeem on Request Day (such market  value and  Dividend  Equivalent
Payment are collectively referred to herein as "Portfolio Deposit Amount").  The
Trustee then calculates the NAV Amount,  based on the close of the market on the
Request  Day.  The  difference  between  the NAV  Amount so  calculated  and the
Portfolio Deposit Amount is the "Balancing Amount".  The Balancing Amount serves
the  function  of  compensating  for any  differences  between  the value of the
Portfolio  Deposit  Amount and the NAV Amount at the close of trading on Request
Day due to, for example,  (a)  differences in the market value of the securities
in the Portfolio  Deposit and the market value of the  Securities on Request Day
and (b) any variances from the proper composition of the Portfolio Deposit.

     On any Adjustment  Day on which (a) no change in the identity  and/or share
weighting of any Index Security is scheduled to take effect that would cause the
S&amp;P 500 Index  divisor  to be  adjusted  after  the close of the  market on that
Business  Day,* and (b) no stock split,  stock  dividend or reverse  stock split
with  respect to any Index  Security  has been  declared  to take  effect on the
corresponding  Request Day, the Trustee may forego making any  adjustment to the
stock portion of the Portfolio Deposit and to use the composition and weightings
of Index Securities for the most recently  effective  Portfolio  Deposit for the
Request  Day  following  such  Adjustment  Day.  In  addition,  the  Trustee may
calculate  the  adjustment  to the  number  of  shares  and  identity  of  Index
Securities  in  a  Portfolio   Deposit  as  described  above  except  that  such
calculation would be employed two (2) Business Days rather than one (1) Business
Day before the Request Day.

     The Dividend  Equivalent  Payment and the Balancing Amount in effect at the
close of business on the Request Date are  collectively  referred to as the Cash
Component or the Cash Redemption  Payment. If the Balancing Amount is a positive
number (I.E., if the NAV Amount exceeds the Portfolio Deposit Amount) then, with
respect to creation,  the Balancing  Amount  increases the Cash Component of the
then effective Portfolio Deposit transferred to the Trustee by the creator. With
respect to redemptions, the Balancing Amount is added to the cash transferred to
the redeemer by the Trustee. If the Balancing Amount is a negative number (I.E.,
if the NAV Amount is less than the Portfolio  Deposit Amount) then, with respect
to creation,  this amount  decreases  the Cash  Component of the then  effective
Portfolio  Deposit to be  transferred  to the Trustee by the creator or, if such
cash portion is less than the Balancing  Amount,  the difference must be paid by
the Trustee to the creator. With respect to redemptions, the Balancing Amount is
deducted from the cash transferred to the redeemer or, if such cash is less than
the  Balancing  Amount,  the  difference  must be paid  by the  redeemer  to the
Trustee.

------------
*  S&amp;P  publicly  announces  changes in the identity  and/or  weighting of Index
   Securities  up to five  Business  Days in advance of the actual  change.  The
   announcements are made after the close of trading on such day.

                                       41
<page>


     If the Trustee has included the cash equivalent  value of one or more Index
Securities in the Portfolio Deposit because the Trustee has determined that such
Index  Securities  are likely to be  unavailable  or available  in  insufficient
quantity for delivery,  of if a creator or redeemer is restricted from investing
or  engaging  in  transactions  in one or  more of such  Index  Securities,  the
Portfolio  Deposit so  constituted  shall  determine the Index  Securities to be
delivered  in  connection  with the  creation  of SPDRs in  Creation  Unit  size
aggregations  and upon the  redemption of SPDRs until the time the stock portion
of the Portfolio Deposit is subsequently adjusted.

                                THE S&amp;P 500 INDEX

     The S&amp;P 500 Index is  composed  of 500  selected  stocks,  all of which are
listed on the AMEX,  the NYSE or NASDAQ,  and spans over 105  separate  industry
groups. As of December 31, 2002, the five largest industry  segments  comprising
the S&amp;P 500 Index were:  Integrated  Oil &amp; Gas 4.45%,  Industrial  Conglomerates
4.08%,  General  Merchandise  Stores  3.38%,  Soft  Drinks  2.45% and  Household
Products  2.14%.  Since 1968, the S&amp;P 500 Index has been a component of the U.S.
Commerce  Department's list of Leading  Indicators that track key sectors of the
U.S.  economy.  Current  information  regarding  the market value of the S&amp;P 500
Index is  available  from  market  information  services.  The S&amp;P 500  Index is
determined, comprised and calculated without regard to the Trust.

     S&amp;P is not responsible for and does not participate in the creation or sale
of SPDRs or in the  determination  of the timing,  pricing,  or  quantities  and
proportions of purchases or sales of Index  Securities or Portfolio  Securities.
The information in this Prospectus concerning S&amp;P and the S&amp;P 500 Index has been
obtained from sources that the Sponsor believes to be reliable,  but the Sponsor
takes no responsibility for the accuracy of such information.

     The following  table shows the actual  performance of the S&amp;P 500 Index for
the years 1960 through 2002. Stock prices  fluctuated  widely during this period
and were higher at the end than at the  beginning.  The results shown should not
be  considered  representative  of the income yield or capital gain or loss that
may be generated by the S&amp;P 500 Index in the future.  The results  should not be
considered representative of the performance of the Trust.

     The Trust is not sponsored, endorsed, sold or promoted by S&amp;P and S&amp;P makes
no  representation or warranty,  express or implied,  to the Trust, the Trustee,

                                EXCHANGE LISTING

     SPDRs  are  listed on the  Exchange.  The  Trust is not  required  to pay a
listing fee to the Exchange.  Transactions involving SPDRs in the public trading
market are subject to customary brokerage charges and commissions.

     The  Sponsor's  aim in  designing  SPDRs was to  provide  investors  with a
security whose initial  market value would  approximate  one-tenth  (1/10th) the
value of the S&amp;P 500 Index. Of course, the market value of a SPDR is affected by
a variety of factors,  including capital gains  distributions made, and expenses
incurred,  by  the  Trust,  and  therefore,  over  time,  a SPDR  may no  longer
approximate  1/10th the value of the S&amp;P 500 Index.  The market  price of a SPDR
should reflect its share of the dividends  accumulated  on Portfolio  Securities
and may be affected by supply and demand, market volatility, sentiment and other
factors.

     There can be no assurance that SPDRs will always be listed on the Exchange.
The Trust will be terminated  if SPDRs are delisted.  The Exchange will consider
the  suspension of trading in or removal from listing of SPDRs if: (a) the Trust
has more than 60 days remaining  until  termination  and there are fewer than 50
record and/or  beneficial  holders of SPDRs for 30 or more  consecutive  trading
days;  (b) the S&amp;P 500 Index is no longer  calculated or available;  or (c) such
other event occurs or condition  exists  which,  in the opinion of the Exchange,
makes further dealings on the Exchange inadvisable.

     SPDRs also are listed and traded on the  Singapore  Exchange  Ltd.  ("SGX")
pursuant to a joint venture  created by the Exchange and the SGX. In the future,
SPDRs may be listed and traded on other non-U.S.  exchanges  pursuant to similar
arrangements.

                             TAX STATUS OF THE TRUST

     For the fiscal year ended  September 30, 2002,  the Trust  believes that it
qualified for tax treatment as a "regulated investment company" under Subchapter
M of the Code.  The Trust  intends to continue  to so  qualify.  To qualify as a
regulated  investment company, the Trust must, among other things, (a) derive in
each  taxable year at least 90% of its gross  income from  dividends,  interest,
gains  from  the sale or other  disposition  of  stock,  securities  or  foreign
currencies,  or certain other sources, (b) meet certain  diversification  tests,
and (c) distribute in each year at least 90% of its investment  company  taxable
income.  If the Trust qualifies as a regulated  investment  company,  subject to
certain  conditions and  requirements,  the Trust will not be subject to federal
income  tax to the  extent its income is  distributed  in a timely  manner.  Any
undistributed income may be subject to tax, including a four percent (4%) excise
tax  imposed by section  4982 of the Code on certain  undistributed  income of a
regulated  investment  company that does not  distribute  to  shareholders  in a
timely  manner  at  least  ninety-eight  percent  (98%)  of its  taxable  income
(including capital gains).

INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO BENEFICIAL OWNERS

     Dividends  paid by the Trust from its  investment  company  taxable  income
(which  includes  dividends,  interest and the excess of net short-term  capital
gains over net long-term  capital  losses) are taxable to  Beneficial  Owners as
ordinary income. A dividend paid in January is considered for federal income tax
purposes to have been paid by the Trust and received by Beneficial Owners on the
preceding  December 31 if the dividend was  declared in the  preceding  October,
November or December to  Beneficial  Owners of record as shown on the records of
DTC and the DTC Participants on a date in one of those months.

     Distributions  paid by the Trust from the excess of net  long-term  capital
gains  over  net  short-term  capital  losses  are  considered   "capital  gains
dividends"  regardless  of the length of time an investor has owned  SPDRs.  Any
loss on the  sale or  exchange  of a share  held for six  months  or less may be
treated as a long-term  capital loss to the extent of any capital gain dividends
received by the Beneficial  Owner. For corporate  investors,  dividends from net
investment  income  (but not return of  capital  distributions  or capital  gain
dividends) generally qualify for the corporate  dividends-received  deduction to
the extent of qualifying  dividend income received by the Trust,  subject to the
limitations  contained  in the Code.  Investors  should  note  that the  regular
quarterly  dividends  paid by the Trust are not based on the Trust's  investment
company  taxable  income  and net  capital  gain,  but  rather  are based on the
dividends paid with respect to Portfolio  Securities.  As a result, a portion of
the  distributions  of the Trust may be  treated  as a return  of  capital  or a
capital  gain  dividend  for federal  income tax  purposes or the Trust may make
additional  distributions  in  excess  of the  yield  performance  of  Portfolio
Securities in order to distribute all of its investment  company  taxable income
and net capital gain.

     Distributions in excess of the Trust's current or accumulated  earnings and
profits (as specially computed) generally are treated as a return of capital for
federal income tax

                                       46
<page>

purposes and reduce a Beneficial  Owner's tax basis in SPDRs.  Return of capital
distributions may result,  for example,  if a portion of the dividends  declared
represents cash amounts  deposited in connection with Portfolio  Deposits rather
than dividends  actually received by the Trust. Under certain  circumstances,  a
significant  portion of the Trust's regular quarterly dividends could be treated
as return of capital  distributions.  Such  circumstances  may be more likely to
occur in  periods  during  which the  number  of  outstanding  SPDRs  fluctuates
significantly.  Beneficial Owners receive annually notification from the Trustee
through the DTC Participants as to the tax status of the Trust's  distributions.
A distribution paid shortly after a purchase or creation of SPDRs may be taxable
even though in effect it may represent a return of capital.

     Distributions  reinvested  in  additional  SPDRs  through  the means of the
Service are nevertheless  taxable  dividends to Beneficial Owners acquiring such
additional SPDRs to the same extent as if such dividends were received in cash.

     The sale of SPDRs by a Beneficial  Owner is a taxable event, and may result
in a gain or  loss,  which  generally  should  be a  capital  gain  or loss  for
Beneficial Owners that are not dealers in securities.

     Dividend distributions, capital gains distributions, and capital gains from
sales or redemptions may also be subject to state, local and foreign taxes.

     Under the Code,  an  in-kind  redemption  of SPDRs  does not  result in the
recognition  of taxable gain or loss by the Trust but  generally  constitutes  a
taxable event for the redeeming shareholder. Upon redemption, a Beneficial Owner
generally  recognizes  gain or loss  measured by the  difference  on the date of
redemption  between the aggregate  value of the cash and stocks received and its
tax basis in the SPDRs redeemed.  Stocks received upon redemption (which will be
comprised of the stock portion of the Portfolio Deposit in effect on the date of
redemption) generally have an initial tax basis equal to their respective market
values on the date of  redemption.  The  Internal  Revenue  Service  ("IRS") may
assert that any resulting loss may not be deducted by a Beneficial  Owner on the
basis that there has been no material change in such Beneficial Owner's economic
position or that the transaction has no significant economic or business utility
apart  from the  anticipated  tax  consequences.  Beneficial  Owners of SPDRs in
Creation Unit size aggregations  should consult their own tax advisors as to the
consequences to them of the redemption of SPDRs.

     Deposits of a Portfolio  Deposit  with the Trustee in exchange for Creation
Units do not result in the  recognition of taxable gain or loss by the Trust but
generally  constitute  a taxable  event to the investor  under the Code,  and an
investor generally  recognizes gain or loss with respect to each stock deposited
equal to the difference  between the amount realized in respect of the stock and
the investor's tax basis  therein.  The amount  realized with respect to a stock
deposited should be determined by allocating the value on the date of deposit of
the SPDRs received  (less any cash paid to the Trust,  or plus any cash received
from the Trust, in connection with the deposit) among the stocks deposited on

                                       47
<page>


the basis of their  respective  fair  market  values at that  time.  The IRS may
assert that any resulting losses may not be deducted by an investor on the basis
that there has been no material  change in the investor's  economic  position or
that the transaction has no significant  economic or business utility or purpose
apart from the anticipated tax consequences.  Investors should consult their own
tax advisors as to the tax consequences to them of a deposit to the Trust.

     The  Trustee  has the right to reject  the order to create  Creation  Units
transmitted to it by the Distributor if the investor or group of investors, upon
obtaining  the SPDRs  ordered,  would own  eighty  percent  (80%) or more of the
outstanding  SPDRs,  and  if  pursuant  to  section  351  of  the  Code  such  a
circumstance  would result in the Trust  having a basis in the stocks  deposited
different  from the  market  value of such  stocks on the date of  deposit.  The
Trustee has the right to require  information  regarding SPDR ownership pursuant
to the  Participant  Agreement  and from DTC and to rely  thereon  to the extent
necessary to make the foregoing  determination  as a condition to the acceptance
of a Portfolio Deposit.

     Ordinary  income  dividends  received via DTC by Beneficial  Owners who are
non-resident  aliens  are  subject  to a  thirty  percent  (30%)  United  States
withholding tax unless a reduced rate of withholding or a withholding  exemption
is provided  under  applicable tax treaties.  Non-resident  holders of SPDRs are
urged to consult their own tax advisors  concerning the  applicability of United
States withholding tax.

     Backup  withholding  at a rate equal to the fourth  lowest  income tax rate
applicable to  individuals  (which,  under current law, is 30% for 2003, 29% for
2004 and  2005,  28% for 2006  through  2010,  and 31%  thereafter)  applies  to
dividends, capital gain distributions, redemptions and sales of SPDRs unless (a)
the  Beneficial  Owner is a  corporation  or comes within  certain  other exempt
categories  and,  when  required,  demonstrates  this  fact,  or (b)  provides a
taxpayer identification number, certifies as to no loss of exemption from backup
withholding,  and otherwise complies with applicable  requirements of the backup
withholding  rules.  The  amount of any backup  withholding  from a payment to a
Beneficial Owner is allowed as a credit against the holder's U.S. federal income
tax  liability  and may entitle  such holder to a refund from the U.S.  Internal
Revenue Service,  if the required  information is furnished to the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service.

     The tax  discussion  set forth  above is included  for general  information
only. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors concerning the
federal,  state,  local and foreign tax consequences to them of an investment in
the Trust, including the effect of possible legislative changes.

ERISA CONSIDERATIONS

     In considering the  advisability of an investment in SPDRs,  fiduciaries of
pension, profit sharing or other tax-qualified retirement plans (including Keogh
Plans) and  welfare  plans  (collectively,  "Plans")  subject  to the  fiduciary
responsibility  requirements of the Employee  Retirement  Income Security Act of
1974, as amended ("ERISA"), should

                                       48
<page>

consider  whether an  investment  in SPDRs is  permitted  by the  documents  and
instruments  governing  the  Plan  and  whether  the  investment  satisfies  the
exclusive  benefit,   prudence  and   diversification   requirements  of  ERISA.
Individual  retirement account ("IRA") investors should consider that an IRA may
make only such investments as are authorized by its governing instruments.

     The fiduciary  standards and prohibited  transaction rules of ERISA and the
Code will not apply to transactions involving the Trust's assets while SPDRs are
held by a Plan or IRA. Unlike many other  investment  vehicles  offered to Plans
and IRAs,  the Trust's  assets will not be treated as "plan assets" of the Plans
or IRAs which acquire or purchase  SPDRs.  Although ERISA imposes certain duties
on Plan  fiduciaries and ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code prohibit  certain
transactions involving "plan assets" between Plans or IRAs and their fiduciaries
or certain related persons, those rules will not apply to transactions involving
the Trust's  assets  because SPDRs  represent an interest in the Trust,  and the
Trust is registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940.  ERISA,  the  Code  and  U.S.  Department  of  Labor  regulations  contain
unconditional  language exempting the assets of registered  investment companies
from  treatment  as "plan  assets" in  applying  the  fiduciary  and  prohibited
transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code.

     Employee benefit plans that are  governmental  plans (as defined in Section
3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and
foreign plans (as described in Section  4(b)(4) of ERISA) are not subject to the
requirements  of  ERISA  or  Section  4975  of  the  Code.  The  fiduciaries  of
governmental  plans  should,  however,  consider the impact of their  respective
state pension codes on  investments  in SPDRs and the  considerations  discussed
above, to the extent applicable.

                          CONTINUOUS OFFERING OF SPDRS

     Creation Units are offered  continuously to the public by the Trust through
the Distributor.  Persons making Portfolio  Deposits and creating Creation Units
receive no fees,  commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any
kind from the Sponsor or the Distributor,  and no such person has any obligation
or  responsibility to the Sponsor or Distributor to effect any sale or resale of
SPDRs.

     Because  new SPDRs can be created  and issued on an ongoing  basis,  at any
point during the life of the Trust,  a  "distribution",  as such term is used in
the Securities Act of 1933 ("1933 Act"),  may be occurring.  Broker-dealers  and
other persons are cautioned  that some of their  activities  may result in their
being deemed  participants in a distribution in a manner which could render them
statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus-delivery and liability
provisions of the 1933 Act. For example,  a broker-dealer firm or its client may
be deemed a statutory  underwriter  if it takes  Creation  Units after placing a
creation order with the Distributor, breaks them down into the constituent SPDRs
and sells the SPDRs  directly to its  customers;  or if it chooses to couple the
creation of a supply of new SPDRs

                                       49
<page>


with an active selling effort involving  solicitation of secondary market demand
for SPDRs.  A  determination  of whether  one is an  underwriter  must take into
account all the facts and  circumstances  pertaining  to the  activities  of the
broker-dealer or its client in the particular  case, and the examples  mentioned
above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that
could lead to categorization as an underwriter.

     Dealers who are not  "underwriters" but are participating in a distribution
(as contrasted to ordinary  secondary  trading  transactions),  and thus dealing
with SPDRs that are part of an "unsold  allotment" within the meaning of Section
4(3)(C)  of  the  1933  Act,   would  be  unable  to  take   advantage   of  the
prospectus-delivery exemption provided by Section 4(3) of the 1933 Act.

     The Sponsor  intends to qualify SPDRs in states selected by the Sponsor and
through broker-dealers who are members of the National Association of Securities
Dealers,  Inc.  Investors  intending  to  create  or  redeem  Creation  Units in
transactions  not involving a broker-dealer  registered in such investor's state
of domicile or residence should consult their legal advisor regarding applicable
broker-dealer or securities  regulatory  requirements under the state securities

     The Trust  has made the  Service  available  for use by  Beneficial  Owners
through DTC  Participants  for  reinvestment  of their cash  proceeds.  Some DTC
Participants may not elect to utilize the Service; therefore, an interested SPDR
investor  may  wish  to  contact  such   investor's   broker  to  ascertain  the
availability  of the  Service  through  such  broker.  Each  broker may  require
investors  to  adhere  to  specific   procedures  and  timetables  in  order  to
participate in the Service and such investors should ascertain from their broker
such necessary details.

     Distributions  reinvested  in  additional  SPDRs  through  the  Service are
nevertheless  taxable  dividends to  Beneficial  Owners to the same extent as if
received in cash.

     The Trustee generally uses the cash proceeds of dividends received from all
Beneficial  Owners  participating in reinvestment  through the Service to obtain
Index Securities  necessary to create the requisite number of SPDRs at the close
of business on each SPDR distribution date. Any cash balance remaining after the
requisite number of SPDRs has been created is distributed,  on a pro rata basis,
to all Beneficial Owners who participated in the Service. Brokerage commissions,
if any,  incurred in obtaining Index Securities  necessary to create  additional
SPDRs with the cash from the distributions is an expense of the Trust.*

-------------
*  It is difficult to estimate the annual dollar amount of brokerage commissions
   that might be incurred in connection with the Dividend  Reinvestment  Service
   during any fiscal year.  The Trustee  estimates that during fiscal year 2002,
   the  approximate   amount  of  annual  brokerage   commissions   incurred  in
   implementing the Service was less than $0.001 per SPDR.

                              EXPENSES OF THE TRUST

     Ordinary  operating expenses of the Trust currently are being accrued at an
annual rate of 0.1200%.  Future  accruals will depend  primarily on the level of
the Trust's net assets and the level of Trust  expenses.  The Trustee has agreed
to waive a portion of its fee until March 9, 2004.  Thereafter,  the Trustee may
discontinue this voluntary waiver policy. Therefore,  there is no guarantee that
the Trust's ordinary  operating  expenses will not exceed 0.1200% of the Trust's
daily NAV.

     Until further  notice,  the Sponsor has undertaken  that it will not permit
the ordinary operating  expenses of the Trust, as calculated by the Trustee,  to
exceed an amount that is 18.45/100 of 1% (0.1845%) per annum of the daily NAV of
the Trust. To the extent the ordinary  operating expenses of the Trust do exceed
such 0.1845%  amount,  the Sponsor will reimburse the Trust for, or assume,  the
excess.  The Sponsor  retains the ability to be repaid by the Trust for expenses
so reimbursed or assumed to the extent that subsequently  during the fiscal year
expenses  fall below the 0.1845% per annum level on any given day.  For purposes
of this  undertaking,  ordinary  operating  expenses of the Trust do not include
taxes,  brokerage  commissions  and any  extraordinary  non-recurring  expenses,
including the cost of any  litigation to which the Trust or the Trustee may be a
party.  The Sponsor may discontinue this undertaking or renew it for a specified
period of time, or may choose to reimburse or assume  certain Trust  expenses in
later periods to keep Trust  expenses at a level it believes to be attractive to
investors.  In any event,  on any day and during any period over the life of the
Trust, total fees and expenses of the Trust may exceed 0.1845% per annum.

     Subject to any  applicable  cap, the Sponsor may charge the Trust a special
fee for  certain  services  the  Sponsor  may  provide to the Trust  which would
otherwise  be provided by the Trustee in an amount not to exceed the actual cost
of  providing  such  services.  The Sponsor or the Trustee from time to time may
voluntarily  assume some expenses or reimburse the Trust so that total  expenses
of the Trust are reduced. Neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee is obligated to do
so and either one or both parties may discontinue  such voluntary  assumption of
expenses or reimbursement at any time without notice.

     The following  charges are or may be accrued and paid by the Trust: (a) the
Trustee's fee; (b) fees payable to transfer agents for the provision of transfer
agency services;  (c) fees of the Trustee for extraordinary  services  performed
under the Trust Agreement; (d) various governmental charges; (e) any taxes, fees
and charges  payable by the Trustee with  respect to SPDRs  (whether in Creation
Units or  otherwise);  (f) expenses and costs of any action taken by the Trustee
or the Sponsor to protect the Trust and the rights and interests


                                       51
<page>


of Beneficial  Owners of SPDRs  (whether in Creation  Units or  otherwise);  (g)
indemnification  of the Trustee or the Sponsor  for any losses,  liabilities  or
expenses  incurred  by it in the  administration  of  the  Trust;  (h)  expenses
incurred in contacting  Beneficial  Owners of SPDRs during the life of the Trust
and upon termination of the Trust; and (i) other  out-of-pocket  expenses of the
Trust  incurred  pursuant  to  actions  permitted  or  required  under the Trust
Agreement.

     In addition, the following expenses are or may be charged to the Trust: (a)
reimbursement  to the Sponsor of amounts  paid by it to S&amp;P in respect of annual
licensing fees pursuant to the License  Agreement;  (b) federal and state annual
registration  fees for the  issuance of SPDRs;  and (c)  expenses of the Sponsor
relating to the printing and  distribution  of  marketing  materials  describing
SPDRs  and  the  Trust  (including,   but  not  limited  to,  associated  legal,
consulting,  advertising,  and marketing costs and other out-of-pocket  expenses
such as  printing).  Pursuant  to the  provisions  of an  exemptive  order,  the
expenses set forth in this  paragraph may be charged to the Trust by the Trustee
in an amount  equal to the  actual  costs  incurred,  but in no case  shall such
charges exceed 20/100 of 1% (0.20%) per annum of the daily NAV of the Trust.

     If the  income  received  by the Trust in the form of  dividends  and other
distributions  on Portfolio  Securities is insufficient to cover Trust expenses,
the Trustee may make  advances to the Trust to cover such  expenses.  Otherwise,
the Trustee may sell  Portfolio  Securities in an amount  sufficient to pay such
expenses.  The Trustee may  reimburse  itself in the amount of any such advance,
together  with interest  thereon at a percentage  rate equal to the then current
overnight  federal  funds rate,  by  deducting  such  amounts  from (a) dividend
payments  or other  income of the Trust when such  payments  or other  income is
received, (b) the amounts earned or benefits derived by the Trustee on cash held
by the  Trustee  for the  benefit  of the Trust,  and (c) the sale of  Portfolio
Securities.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  if any advance remains outstanding
for more than  forty-five  (45) Business  Days,  the Trustee may sell  Portfolio
Securities  to  reimburse  itself  for such  advance  and any  accrued  interest
thereon.  These advances will be secured by a lien on the assets of the Trust in
favor of the Trustee.  The expenses of the Trust are reflected in the NAV of the
Trust.

     For services performed under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee is paid a fee
at an annual  rate of 6/100 of 1% to 10/100  of 1% of the NAV of the  Trust,  as
shown below,  such percentage  amount to vary depending on the NAV of the Trust,
plus or minus the  Adjustment  Amount.  The  compensation  is  computed  on each
Business Day based on the NAV of the Trust on such day,  and the amount  thereof
is  accrued  daily  and paid  monthly.  To the  extent  that the  amount  of the
Trustee's  compensation,  before any  adjustment  in  respect of the  Adjustment
Amount, is less than specified amounts, the Sponsor has agreed to pay the amount
of any such shortfall. The Trustee also may waive all or a portion of such fee.

* The fee  indicated  applies to that portion of the NAV of the Trust that falls
  in the size category indicated.

     As of September 30, 2002, and as of December 31, 2002, the NAV of the Trust
was $30,698,876,563 and $39,272,502,383, respectively. No representation is made
as to the actual NAV of the Trust on any future date, as it is subject to change
at any time due to  fluctuations  in the market  value of the  Portfolio,  or to
creations or redemptions made in the future.

     The Adjustment  Amount is calculated at the end of each quarter and applied
against the Trustee's fee for the following quarter.  "Adjustment  Amount" is an
amount which is intended, depending upon the circumstances, either to (a) reduce
the Trustee's fee by the amount that the  Transaction  Fees paid on creation and
redemption  exceed  the costs of those  activities,  and by the amount of excess
earnings  on cash  held for the  benefit  of the  Trust**  or (b)  increase  the
Trustee's fee by the amount that the  Transaction Fee (plus  additional  amounts
paid in  connection  with  creations or  redemptions  outside the SPDR  Clearing
Process),  paid on creations or redemptions,  falls short of the actual costs of
these  activities.  If in any  quarter  the  Adjustment  Amount  exceeds the fee
payable to the Trustee as set forth above,  the Trustee uses such excess  amount
to reduce other Trust expenses,  subject to certain federal tax limitations.  To
the extent that the amount of such excess exceeds the Trust's  expenses for such
quarter,  any  remaining  excess  is  retained  by the  Trustee  as  part of its
compensation.   If  in  any  quarter  the  costs  of  processing  creations  and
redemptions exceed the amounts charged as a Transaction Fee (plus the additional
amounts  paid in  connection  with  creations  or  redemptions  outside the SPDR
Clearing  Process)  net of the  excess  earnings,  if any,  on cash held for the
benefit  of the  Trust,  the  Trustee  will  augment  the  Trustee's  fee by the
resulting  Adjustment  Amount.  The net Adjustment Amount is usually a credit to
the Trust.  To make the  expense  ratio of the Trust  comparable  to the expense
ratio of most  other  investment  companies,  it is shown as a "below  the line"
adjustment  to Trust's  expenses.  If the  adjustment  is negative,  it is shown
"above the line."

** The excess earnings on cash amount is currently calculated, and applied, on a
   monthly basis.

                                    VALUATION

     The NAV of the Trust is  computed  as of the  Evaluation  Time shown  under
"Summary--Essential Information" on each Business Day. The NAV of the Trust on a
per SPDR basis is determined by subtracting all liabilities  (including  accrued
expenses and dividends  payable) from the total value of the Portfolio and other
assets and dividing the result by the total number of outstanding SPDRs.

     The value of the  Portfolio is  determined  by the Trustee in good faith in
the following manner. If Portfolio Securities are listed on one or more national
securities  exchanges,  such  evaluation is generally  based on the closing sale
price on that day (unless the Trustee deems such price  inappropriate as a basis
for  evaluation)  on the  exchange  which is deemed to be the  principal  market
therefor  (the New York or  American  Stock  Exchange  if the  stocks are listed
thereon)  or,  if  there  is no such  appropriate  closing  sale  price  on such
exchange,  at  the  last  sale  price  (unless  the  Trustee  deems  such  price
inappropriate as a basis for evaluation). If the stocks are not so listed or, if
so listed and the  principal  market  therefor is other than on such exchange or
there is no such closing sale price  available,  such evaluation shall generally
be  made  by the  Trustee  in good  faith  based  on the  closing  price  on the
over-the-counter  market (unless the Trustee deems such price inappropriate as a
basis for evaluation) or if there is no such  appropriate  closing price, (a) on
current bid prices, (b) if bid prices are not available, on the basis of current
bid prices for comparable stocks,  (c) by the Trustee's  appraising the value of
the  stocks  in  good  faith  on  the  bid  side  of the  market,  or (d) by any
combination thereof.

                           ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRUST

DISTRIBUTIONS TO BENEFICIAL OWNERS

     The regular  quarterly  ex-dividend  date for SPDRs is the third  Friday in
each of March, June,  September and December,  unless such day is not a Business
Day, in which case the ex-dividend  date is the immediately  preceding  Business
Day ("Ex-Dividend Date").  Beneficial Owners reflected on the records of DTC and
the DTC  Participants on the second Business Day following the Ex-Dividend  Date
("Record  Date")  are  entitled  to  receive  an amount  representing  dividends
accumulated on Portfolio  Securities through the quarterly dividend period which
ends on the Business Day preceding such Ex-Dividend Date (including  stocks with
ex-dividend dates falling within such quarterly  dividend  period),  net of fees
and expenses,  accrued  daily for such period.  For the purposes of all dividend
distributions,  dividends  per SPDR  are  calculated  at  least  to the  nearest
1/1000th of $0.01.  The payment of dividends is made on the last Business Day in
the calendar month following each  Ex-Dividend  Date ("Dividend  Payment Date").
Dividend  payments are made through DTC and the DTC  Participants  to Beneficial
Owners then of record with funds received from the Trustee.

                                       54
<page>


     Dividends  payable  to the Trust in  respect of  Portfolio  Securities  are
credited  by the  Trustee to a  non-interest  bearing  account as of the date on
which the Trust receives such dividends. Other moneys received by the Trustee in
respect of the Portfolio,  including but not limited to the Cash Component,  the
Cash  Redemption  Payment,  all moneys  realized by the Trustee from the sale of
options,  warrants or other similar rights received or distributed in respect of
Portfolio  Securities as dividends or distributions  and capital gains resulting
from  the  sale  of  Portfolio  Securities  are  credited  by the  Trustee  to a
non-interest  bearing  account.  All funds collected or received are held by the
Trustee without interest until  distributed in accordance with the provisions of
the Trust Agreement.  To the extent the amounts credited to the account generate
interest income or an equivalent benefit to the Trustee, such interest income or
benefit is used to reduce the Trustee's annual fee.

     Any additional  distributions  the Trust may need to make so as to continue
to qualify as a "regulated  investment company" would consist of (a) an increase
in the  distribution  scheduled  for  January  to  include  any  amount by which
estimated  Trust  investment  company taxable income and net capital gains for a
year exceeds the amount of Trust  taxable  income  previously  distributed  with
respect  to such year or, if  greater,  the  minimum  amount  required  to avoid
imposition of such excise tax, and (b) a  distribution  soon after actual annual
investment  company  taxable income and net capital gains of the Trust have been
computed,  of the  amount,  if any,  by which such  actual  income  exceeds  the
distributions already made. The NAV of the Trust is reduced in direct proportion
to the amount of such additional distributions.  The magnitude of the additional
distributions,  if any, depends upon a number of factors, including the level of
redemption activity experienced by the Trust. Because substantially all proceeds
from the sale of stocks in connection with adjustments to the Portfolio are used
to  purchase  shares  of  Index  Securities,  the  Trust  may  have  no  cash or
insufficient cash with which to pay such additional distributions. In that case,
the Trustee has to sell shares of Portfolio Securities sufficient to produce the
cash required to make such additional distributions.  In selecting the stocks to
be sold to produce cash for such  distributions,  the Trustee  chooses among the
stocks that are  over-weighted in the Portfolio  relative to their weightings in
the S&amp;P 500 Index first and then from among all other stocks in such a manner to
maintain  the   weightings  of  Portfolio   Securities   within  the  applicable
Misweighting Amount.

     The Trustee may declare  special  dividends  if such action is necessary or
advisable to preserve the status of the Trust as a regulated  investment company
or to avoid imposition of income or excise taxes on undistributed income, and to
vary the  frequency  with which  periodic  distributions  are made  (E.G.,  from
quarterly  to monthly) if it is  determined  by the Sponsor and the Trustee that
such a variance would be advisable to facilitate  compliance  with the rules and
regulations  applicable to regulated  investment companies or would otherwise be
advantageous  to the Trust.  In  addition,  the  Trustee  may change the regular
ex-dividend  date for SPDRs to another date within the month or quarter if it is
determined  by the  Sponsor  and  the  Trustee  that  such  a  change  would  be
advantageous  to the  Trust.  Notice of any such  variance  or  change  shall be
provided to Beneficial Owners via DTC and the DTC Participants.

                                       55

     As soon as  practicable  after  notice of  termination  of the  Trust,  the
Trustee will  distribute  via DTC and the DTC  Participants  to each  Beneficial
Owner  redeeming  Creation Units before the  termination  date specified in such
notice a portion of Portfolio Securities and cash as described above. Otherwise,
the Trustee will distribute to each  Beneficial  Owner (whether in Creation Unit
size aggregations or otherwise), as soon as practicable after termination of the
Trust, such Beneficial Owner's pro rata share of the NAV of the Trust.

     All  distributions  are  made  by the  Trustee  through  DTC  and  the  DTC
Participants  to  Beneficial  Owners as recorded on the book entry system of DTC
and the DTC Participants.

     The  settlement  date for the creation of SPDRs or the purchase of SPDRs in
the  secondary  market must occur on or before the Record Date in order for such
creator or  purchaser to receive a  distribution  on the next  Dividend  Payment
Date. If the settlement  date for such creation or a secondary  market  purchase
occurs  after  the  Record  Date,  the  distribution  will be made to the  prior
securityholder or Beneficial Owner as of such Record Date.

     Any Beneficial Owner interested in acquiring additional SPDRs with proceeds
received from  distributions  described  above may elect  dividend  reinvestment
through DTC  Participants by means of the Service,  if such service is available
through the Beneficial Owner's broker.

STATEMENTS TO BENEFICIAL OWNERS; ANNUAL REPORTS

     With  each   distribution,   the  Trustee  furnishes  for  distribution  to
Beneficial  Owners a  statement  setting  forth the  amount  being  distributed,
expressed as a dollar amount per SPDR.

     Promptly  after the end of each fiscal year,  the Trustee  furnishes to the
DTC  Participants  for distribution to each person who was a Beneficial Owner of
SPDRs at the end of such fiscal year, an annual  report of the Trust  containing
financial statements audited by independent accountants of nationally recognized
standing and such other information as may be required by applicable laws, rules
and regulations.

RIGHTS OF BENEFICIAL OWNERS

     Beneficial  Owners  may  sell  SPDRs  in the  secondary  market,  but  must
accumulate  enough SPDRs to  constitute a full  Creation Unit in order to redeem
through the Trust.  The death or  incapacity  of any  Beneficial  Owner does not
operate  to  terminate  the Trust nor  entitle  such  Beneficial  Owner's  legal
representatives  or  heirs  to claim an  accounting  or to take  any  action  or
proceeding in any court for a partition or winding up of the Trust.

     Beneficial  Owners  shall  not (a) have the  right to vote  concerning  the
Trust,  except with respect to termination and as otherwise  expressly set forth
in the Trust  Agreement,  (b) in any manner control the operation and management
of the Trust, or (c) be liable to any other person by reason of any action taken
by the Sponsor or the Trustee. The

                                       56
<page>


     Trustee  has the right to vote all of the voting  stocks in the Trust.  The
Trustee  votes  the  voting  stocks  of each  issuer  in the same  proportionate
relationship  as all other  shares of each such  issuer  are voted to the extent
permissible and, if not permitted, abstains from voting.

AMENDMENTS TO THE TRUST AGREEMENT

     The Trust Agreement may be amended from time to time by the Trustee and the
Sponsor  without the consent of any Beneficial  Owners (a) to cure any ambiguity
or to correct or supplement any provision that may be defective or  inconsistent
or to make such other  provisions as will not adversely  affect the interests of
Beneficial  Owners;  (b) to change any  provision as may be required by the SEC;
(c) to add or change any  provision as may be  necessary  or  advisable  for the
continuing  qualification of the Trust as a "regulated investment company" under
the Code; (d) to add or change any provision as may be necessary or advisable if
NSCC or DTC is unable or unwilling to continue to perform its functions; and (e)
to add or change any provision to conform the  adjustments  to the Portfolio and
the  Portfolio  Deposit  to  changes,  if  any,  made  by S&amp;P in its  method  of
determining  the S&amp;P 500 Index.  The Trust  Agreement may also be amended by the
Sponsor and the Trustee with the consent of the Beneficial  Owners of 51% of the
outstanding  SPDRs to add  provisions  to,  or change  or  eliminate  any of the
provisions of, the Trust Agreement or to modify the rights of Beneficial Owners;
although,  the Trust  Agreement  may not be amended  without  the consent of the
Beneficial  Owners of all  outstanding  SPDRs if such amendment would (a) permit
the  acquisition of any securities  other than those acquired in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the Trust Agreement;  (b) reduce the interest of any
Beneficial Owner in the Trust; or (c) reduce the percentage of Beneficial Owners
required to consent to any such amendment.

     Promptly  after the  execution of an amendment,  the Trustee  receives from
DTC,  pursuant  to the  terms  of the  Depository  Agreement,  a list of all DTC
Participants holding SPDRs. The Trustee inquires of each such DTC Participant as
to the number of Beneficial  Owners for whom such DTC  Participant  holds SPDRs,
and  provides  each such DTC  Participant  with  sufficient  copies of a written
notice of the  substance  of such  amendment  for  transmittal  by each such DTC
Participant to Beneficial Owners.

TERMINATION OF THE TRUST AGREEMENT

     The Trust Agreement  provides that the Sponsor has the discretionary  right
to direct the Trustee to terminate the Trust if at any time the NAV of the Trust
is less than $350,000,000, as such dollar amount shall be adjusted for inflation
in accordance  with the CPI-U.  This  adjustment is to take effect at the end of
the fourth year  following  the  Initial  Date of Deposit and at the end of each
year  thereafter  and to be made so as to reflect  the  percentage  increase  in
consumer  prices as set forth in the CPI-U for the twelve month period ending in
the last month of the preceding fiscal year.

                                       57
<page>


     The Trust may be terminated (a) by the agreement of the  Beneficial  Owners
of 66 2/3% of outstanding  SPDRs;  (b) if DTC is unable or unwilling to continue
to perform its functions as set forth under the Trust Agreement and a comparable
replacement is unavailable;  (c) if NSCC no longer provides  clearance  services
with respect to SPDRs, or if the Trustee is no longer a participant in NSCC; (d)
if S&amp;P ceases  publishing  the S&amp;P 500 Index;  (e) if the License  Agreement  is
terminated;  or (f) if SPDRs are delisted from the Exchange. The Trust will also
terminate by its terms on the Termination Date.

     The Trust will terminate if either the Sponsor or the Trustee resigns or is
removed and a successor is not appointed.  The dissolution of the Sponsor or its
ceasing to exist as a legal entity for any cause whatsoever,  however,  will not
cause the  termination  of the Trust  Agreement  or the Trust unless the Trustee
deems termination to be in the best interests of Beneficial Owners.

     Prior written notice of the termination of the Trust must be given at least
twenty (20) days before  termination of the Trust to all Beneficial  Owners. The
notice must set forth the date on which the Trust will be terminated, the period
during  which  the  assets of the Trust  will be  liquidated,  the date on which
Beneficial  Owners of SPDRs  (whether  in  Creation  Unit size  aggregations  or
otherwise)  will  receive in cash the NAV of the SPDRs  held,  and the date upon
which the books of the Trust shall be closed.  The notice  shall  further  state
that,  as of the  date  thereof  and  thereafter,  neither  requests  to  create
additional  Creation  Units nor  Portfolio  Deposits  will be accepted,  that no
additional  SPDRs  will be  created  for the  purpose  of  reinvesting  dividend
distributions, and that, as of the date thereof and thereafter, the portfolio of
stocks delivered upon redemption shall be identical in composition and weighting
to  Portfolio  Securities  as of such date rather than the stock  portion of the
Portfolio  Deposit as in effect on the date  request  for  redemption  is deemed
received. Beneficial Owners of Creation Units may, in advance of the Termination
Date, redeem in kind directly from the Trust.

     Within a reasonable  period after the Termination  Date, the Trustee shall,
subject to any applicable provisions of law, use its best efforts to sell all of
the Portfolio  Securities not already distributed to redeeming Beneficial Owners
of Creation Units. The Trustee shall not be liable for or responsible in any way
for  depreciation  or loss  incurred  because of any such sale.  The Trustee may
suspend such sales upon the  occurrence of unusual or unforeseen  circumstances,
including but not limited to a suspension in trading of a stock,  the closing or
restriction of trading on a stock exchange, the outbreak of hostilities,  or the
collapse of the economy.  The Trustee shall deduct from the proceeds of sale its
fees and all  other  expenses  and  transmit  the  remaining  amount  to DTC for
distribution,  together with a final statement  setting forth the computation of
the gross amount distributed. SPDRs not redeemed before termination of the Trust
will be redeemed in cash at NAV based on the  proceeds of the sale of  Portfolio
Securities, with no minimum aggregation of SPDRs required.

                                     SPONSOR

     The Sponsor is a Delaware limited liability  company  incorporated on April
6, 1998 with offices c/o the  Exchange,  86 Trinity  Place,  New York,  New York
10006. The Sponsor's Internal Revenue Service Employer  Identification Number is
52-2127241. The Exchange is the sole member of the Sponsor and the Exchange is a
"control person" of the Sponsor as such term is defined in the Securities Act of
1933.

     The Sponsor,  at its own expense,  may from time to time provide additional
promotional  incentives  to  brokers  who sell SPDRs to the  public.  In certain
instances,  these  incentives  may be  provided  only to those  brokers who meet
certain threshold  requirements for participation in a given incentive  program,
such as selling a significant number of SPDRs within a specified period.

     If at any time the  Sponsor  fails  to  undertake  or  perform  or  becomes
incapable of  undertaking  or performing  any of the duties  required  under the
Trust Agreement,  or resigns,  or becomes bankrupt or its affairs are taken over
by public authorities, the Trustee may appoint a successor Sponsor, agree to act
as Sponsor itself, or may terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trust.
Notice of the  resignation  or removal of the Sponsor and the  appointment  of a
successor  shall be mailed by the  Trustee to DTC and the DTC  Participants  for
distribution to Beneficial  Owners.  Upon a successor  Sponsor's  execution of a
written acceptance of appointment as Sponsor of the Trust, the successor Sponsor
becomes  vested with all of the rights,  powers,  duties and  obligations of the
original  Sponsor.  Any successor  Sponsor may be compensated at rates deemed by
the Trustee to be reasonable.

     The  Sponsor  may resign by  executing  and  delivering  to the  Trustee an
instrument of  resignation.  Such  resignation  shall become  effective upon the
appointment  of a successor  Sponsor and the  acceptance of  appointment  by the
successor  Sponsor,  unless  the  Trustee  either  agrees to act as  Sponsor  or
terminates the Trust Agreement and liquidates the Trust.  The dissolution of the
Sponsor or its ceasing to exist as a legal entity for any cause  whatsoever will
not cause the termination of the Trust Agreement or the Trust unless the Trustee
deems termination to be in the best interests of the Beneficial Owners of SPDRs.

     The Trust Agreement provides that the Sponsor is not liable to the Trustee,
the Trust or to the  Beneficial  Owners of SPDRs for taking any  action,  or for
refraining from taking any action, made in good faith or for errors in judgment,
but is liable only for its own gross negligence,  bad faith,  willful misconduct
or  willful  malfeasance  in the  performance  of  its  duties  or its  reckless
disregard of its obligations and duties under the Trust  Agreement.  The Sponsor
is not liable or responsible in any way for depreciation or loss incurred by the
Trust  because  of the sale of any  Portfolio  Securities.  The Trust  Agreement
further provides that the Sponsor and its directors, subsidiaries, shareholders,
officers,  employees, and affiliates under common control with the Sponsor shall
be indemnified  from the assets of the Trust and held harmless against any loss,
liability or expense  incurred  without  gross  negligence,  bad faith,  willful
misconduct  or  willful  malfeasance  on the  part  of  any  such  party  in the
performance of its duties or reckless

                                       59

disregard of its obligations and duties under the Trust Agreement, including the
payment of the costs and expenses of defending against any claim or liability.

                                     TRUSTEE

     The  Trustee is a bank and trust  company  organized  under the laws of the
Commonwealth  of  Massachusetts  with its  principal  place of  business  at 225
Franklin Street,  Boston,  Massachusetts  02110. The Trustee's  Internal Revenue
Service Employer Identification Number is 04-1867445.  The Trustee is subject to
supervision  and  examination  by the  Massachusetts  Division  of Banks and the
Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.

     Information   regarding  Cash  Redemption   Payment   amounts,   number  of
outstanding  SPDRs and Transaction  Fees may be obtained from the Trustee at the
toll-free number:  1-800-545-4189.  Complete copies of the Trust Agreement and a
list of the parties that have executed a  Participant  Agreement may be obtained
from the Trustee's principal office.

     The Trustee may resign and be  discharged of the Trust created by the Trust
Agreement by executing a notice of resignation in writing and filing such notice
with the  Sponsor  and  mailing a copy of the notice of  resignation  to all DTC
Participants reflected on the records of DTC as owning SPDRs for distribution to
Beneficial  Owners as  provided  above not less than sixty (60) days  before the
date such resignation is to take effect. Such resignation becomes effective upon
the appointment of and the acceptance of the Trust by a successor  Trustee.  The
Sponsor, upon receiving notice of such resignation, is obligated to use its best
efforts to appoint a successor  Trustee  promptly.  If no successor is appointed
within sixty (60) days after the date such notice of resignation  is given,  the
Trust shall terminate.

     If the Trustee becomes  incapable of acting as such or is adjudged bankrupt
or is taken over by any public authority,  the Sponsor may discharge the Trustee
and appoint a successor Trustee as provided in the Trust Agreement.  The Sponsor
shall mail notice of such discharge and appointment via the DTC  Participants to
Beneficial Owners.  Upon a successor Trustee's execution of a written acceptance
of an appointment as Trustee for the Trust, the successor Trustee becomes vested
with all the rights,  powers,  duties and obligations of the original Trustee. A
successor  Trustee must be (a) a trust company,  corporation or national banking
association organized, doing business under the laws of the United States or any
state  thereof;  (b)  authorized  under such laws to  exercise  corporate  trust
powers;  and (c) at all times have an aggregate  capital,  surplus and undivided
profit of not less than $50,000,000.

     Beneficial  Owners  of 51% of the then  outstanding  SPDRs  may at any time
remove the  Trustee by written  instrument(s)  delivered  to the Trustee and the
Sponsor. The Sponsor shall thereupon use its best efforts to appoint a successor
Trustee as described above.

     The Trust Agreement limits Trustee's liabilities.  It provides, among other
things,  that the Trustee is not liable for (a) any action  taken in  reasonable
reliance on properly  executed  documents  or for the  disposition  of monies or
stocks or for the evaluations required

                                       60

to be made thereunder,  except by reason of its own gross negligence, bad faith,
willful malfeasance, willful misconduct, or reckless disregard of its duties and
obligations;  (b)  depreciation  or loss  incurred  by reason of the sale by the
Trustee of any Portfolio Securities;  (c) any action the Trustee takes where the
Sponsor fails to act; and (d) any taxes or other  governmental  charges  imposed
upon or in respect of Portfolio  Securities or upon the interest thereon or upon
it as  Trustee  or upon or in  respect  of the Trust  which the  Trustee  may be
required to pay under any present or future law of the United  States of America
or of any other taxing authority having jurisdiction.

     The  Trustee  and  its  directors,  subsidiaries,  shareholders,  officers,
employees,  and  affiliates  under  common  control  with  the  Trustee  will be
indemnified  from the assets of the Trust and held  harmless  against  any loss,
liability or expense  incurred  without  gross  negligence,  bad faith,  willful
misconduct,  willful malfeasance on the part of such party or reckless disregard
of its  duties  and  obligations,  arising  out of,  or in  connection  with its
acceptance  or  administration  of the Trust,  including  the costs and expenses
(including counsel fees) of defending against any claim or liability.

                 INFORMATION AND COMPARISONS RELATING TO TRUST,
              SECONDARY MARKET TRADING, NET ASSET SIZE, PERFORMANCE
                                AND TAX TREATMENT

     Information regarding various aspects of the Trust, including the net asset
size thereof,  as well as the secondary market trading,  the performance and the
tax  treatment of SPDRs,  may be included  from time to time in  advertisements,
sales  literature  and  other  communications  and  in  reports  to  current  or
prospective Beneficial Owners.

     Information  may be provided to  prospective  investors to help them assess
their specific  investment  goals and to aid in their  understanding  of various
financial  strategies.   Such  information  may  present  current  economic  and
political trends and conditions and may describe general principles of investing
such  as  asset  allocation,  diversification  and  risk  tolerance,  as well as
specific  investment  techniques  such as indexing  and  hedging.  In  addition,
information  may be  presented  to  prospective  or  current  Beneficial  Owners
regarding  the  purchase  of  SPDRs  in the  secondary  market,  such as  margin
requirements,  types of orders that may be entered,  and information  concerning
short sales. Similarly,  market data symbols,  trading fractions,  other trading
information  and the CUSIP  number  relating  to SPDRs may be  included  in such
information.  Comparisons with other investment vehicles,  such as mutual funds,
may be made with respect to the application of such requirements;  costs of fund
management  and  administration;  cost and advantages of intraday  trading;  and
rules applicable to short sales.

     Information  regarding  the  Trust's  net  asset  size  may  be  stated  in
communications  to  prospective  or  current  Beneficial  Owners for one or more
periods,  including annual,  year-to-date or daily periods. Such information may
also be expressed in terms of the total number of SPDRs outstanding as of one or
more periods.  Factors  integral to the size of the Trust's net assets,  such as
creation volume and activity,  may also be discussed,  and may be specified from
time to time or with  respect to various  periods of time.  Comparisons  of such
information  during  various  periods may also be made,  and may be expressed by
means of percentages.

     Information may be provided to investors regarding the ability to engage in
short sales of SPDRs,  including reference to the exemption from the "tick test"
provision of the SEC short sale rule (Rule 10a-1 under the  Securities  Exchange
Act of 1934),  to permit short sales on "minus" or "zero-minus"  ticks.  Selling
short refers to the sale of securities  which the seller does not own, but which
the seller arranges to borrow before effecting the sale. Institutional investors
may be advised that lending their SPDRs to short sellers may generate stock loan
credits  that may  supplement  the return  they can earn from an  investment  in
SPDRs. These stock loan credits may provide a useful source of additional income
for certain  institutional  investors  who can arrange to lend SPDRs.  Potential
short  sellers may be advised that a short rebate  (functionally  equivalent  to
partial  use of  proceeds  of the short  sale) may reduce  their cost of selling
short.

     Information   may  be  provided  to  investors   regarding   capital  gains
distributions by the Trust,  including  historical  information relating to such
distributions.  Comparisons between the Trust and other investment vehicles such
as mutual funds may be made regarding such capital gains distributions,  as well
as  relative  tax  efficiencies  between  the  Trust and such  other  investment
vehicles (E.G.,  realization of capital gains or losses to the Trust and to such
other  investment  vehicles in connection  with  redemption of their  respective
securities).  Based on  projected  differences  between  SPDRs and  conventional
mutual funds with regard to capital gains distributions, projections may be made
regarding  comparative  capital  gains  distributions  and tax rates for taxable
investors  holding  SPDRs over a long  period of time.  Comparisons  may also be
provided  regarding the probable tax impact  resulting  from  rebalancing of the
Trust  portfolio  and  adjustments  to  the  portfolio  of an  actively  managed
investment vehicle.

     Specifically,  information  may  be  provided  to  prospective  or  current
investors  comparing and contrasting the tax efficiencies of conventional mutual
funds with SPDRs. Both  conventional  mutual funds and the Trust may be required
to  recognize  capital  gains  incurred  as  a  result  of  adjustments  to  the
composition of the S&amp;P 500 Index and therefore to their  respective  portfolios.
From a tax perspective, however, a significant difference between a conventional
mutual fund and the Trust is the process by which their shares are redeemed.  In
cases where a  conventional  mutual fund  experiences  redemptions  in excess of
subscriptions  ("net  redemptions")  and has insufficient cash available to fund
such net redemptions, such fund may have to sell stocks held in its portfolio to
raise and pay cash to  redeeming  shareholders.  A mutual  fund  will  generally
experience a taxable gain or loss when it sells such  portfolio  stocks in order
to pay  cash  to  redeeming  fund  shareholders.  In  contrast,  the  redemption
mechanism for SPDRs does not involve selling the portfolio stocks.  Instead, the
Trust  delivers  the actual  portfolio  of stocks in an in-kind  exchange to any
person  redeeming  SPDRs shares in Creation Unit size  aggregations.  While this
in-kind  exchange is a taxable  transaction to the redeeming  entity  (usually a
broker/dealer)  making the exchange,  it generally does not constitute a taxable
transaction  at the Trust level and,  consequently,  there is no  realization of
taxable gain or loss by the Trust with respect to such in-kind  exchanges.  In a
period  of  market  appreciation  of  the  S&amp;P  500  Index  and,   consequently,
appreciation of the portfolio stocks held in the Trust, this in-kind  redemption
mechanism has the effect of eliminating  the  recognition  and  distribution  of
those net  unrealized  gains at the Trust level.  Although the same result would
obtain for conventional mutual funds utilizing an in-kind redemption  mechanism,
the  opportunities to redeem fund shares by delivering  portfolio stocks in-kind
are limited in most mutual funds.

     Investors may be informed that, while no unequivocal  statement can be made
as to the net tax  impact  on a  conventional  mutual  fund  resulting  from the
purchases and sales of its portfolio stocks over a period of time,  conventional
funds  that have  accumulated  substantial  unrealized  capital  gains,  if they
experience net  redemptions  and do not have  sufficient  available cash, may be
required to make  taxable  capital  gains  distributions  that are  generated by
changes in such fund's portfolio.  In contrast, the in-kind redemption mechanism
of SPDRs may make them more tax efficient  investments under most  circumstances
than comparable conventional mutual fund shares. As discussed above, this

                                       63
<page>


in-kind redemption feature tends to lower the amount of annual net capital gains
distributions  to SPDRs  holders as compared to their  conventional  mutual fund
counterparts.  Since  shareholders  are generally  required to pay income tax on
capital gains distributions,  the smaller the amount of such distributions,  the
less  taxes that are  payable  currently.  To the  extent  that the Trust is not
required to recognize  capital  gains,  the SPDRs holder is able, in effect,  to
defer tax on such gains until he sells or otherwise  disposes of his shares,  or
the Trust terminates.  If such holder retains his shares until his death,  under
current  law the tax basis of such  shares  would be adjusted to their then fair
market value.

     Information  regarding the secondary  market trading activity of SPDRs also
may be presented over one or more stated  periods,  such as for daily,  monthly,
quarterly or annual periods.  Secondary market trading volume information may be
compared  with  similar  information  relating  to other  issues  trading on the
Exchange  during the same  reporting  period.  Average  daily  secondary  market
trading  volume of SPDRs may also be reported from time to time.  Comparisons of
such  information  during various periods may also be made, and may be expressed
by means of percentages.

     Information may also be provided in communications to prospective investors
or current  Beneficial Owners comparing and contrasting the relative  advantages
of investing in SPDRs as compared to other investment  vehicles,  such as mutual
funds, both on an individual and a group basis (E.G., stock index mutual funds).
Such information may include comparisons of costs and expense ratios,  expressed
either  in  dollars  or  basis  points,  stock  lending  activities,   permitted
investments  and  hedging  activities  (E.G.,  engaging  in  options  or futures
transactions),  and  portfolio  turnover data and  analyses.  In addition,  such
information may quote,  reprint or include  portions of financial,  scholarly or
business  publications or periodicals,  including model allocation  schedules or
portfolios,  as the  foregoing  relate  to the  comparison  of  SPDRs  to  other
investment  vehicles,  current  economic,  financial and  political  conditions,
investment philosophy or techniques, or the desirability of owning SPDRs.

     In addition,  information  on the  performance of SPDRs based on changes in
price  per  SPDR  with  or  without   reinvesting   all  dividends   and/or  any
distributions  of capital in additional  SPDRs may be included from time to time
in such  information.  Total return measures the percentage  growth in the total
dollar  value  of an  investment  in SPDRs  (reflecting  dividends  and  capital
appreciation  but  without  provision  for any income  taxes  payable).  Average
annualized  performance will be stated for various periods. Total return figures
may also be stated for a period  from the  Initial  Date of  Deposit,  a date at
least  twelve  months  prior to the end of the  reporting  period or for  annual
periods for the life of the Trust. Information on the S&amp;P 500 Index contained in
this Prospectus, as updated from time to time, may also be included from time to
time in such material. Information on performance of SPDRs also may be presented
on an after tax basis,  using methods of calculation that are in accordance with
the SEC's rules and  regulations.  The  performance of the Trust, of the S&amp;P 500
Index  (provided  information is also given  reflecting  the  performance of the
Trust in comparison to that S&amp;P 500 Index) or both may also be

                                       64
<page>

compared to the performance of money managers as reported in market surveys such
as SEI Fund  Evaluation  Survey (a  leading  data base of  tax-exempt  funds) or
mutual funds such as those reported by Lipper  Analytical  Services Inc.,  Money
Magazine Fund Watch,  Wiesenberger  Investment  Companies  Service,  Morningstar
Incorporated  and  Value  Line  Investment   Survey,   each  of  which  measures
performance following their own specific and well-defined  calculation measures,
or of the New York Stock Exchange  Composite  Index, the American Stock Exchange
Index  (indices of stocks traded on the New York and American  Stock  Exchanges,
respectively),  the Dow Jones  Industrial  Average (an index of 30 widely traded
common  stocks)  or  the  NASDAQ   Composite   Index  (an  unmanaged   index  of
over-the-counter stocks) or similar measurement standards during the same period
of  time.  In  addition  to  all  other  sources  of  comparative   information,
comparative  performance  figures published by other funds or money managers may
be included from time to time.  Information  may also be included  regarding the
aggregate  amount of assets  committed to index  investing  generally by various
types of  investors,  such as pension funds and other  institutional  investors,
which currently exceeds $300 billion.

     Information on the relative price performance of SPDRs in relation to other
securities  and/or  indices  may be  represented  in the form of  "correlation."
Correlation is a standard  measure of the degree of linear  association  between
two price  series,  and ranges from minus one  hundred  percent  (-100%)  (I.E.,
perfect  negative  linear  association)  to positive one hundred  percent (100%)
(I.E., perfect linear association).

     One important  difference between SPDRs and conventional mutual fund shares
is that SPDRs are  available  for  purchase or sale on an intraday  basis on the
American Stock  Exchange.  An investor who buys shares in a conventional  mutual
fund will buy or sell  shares at a price at or  related to the  closing  NAV per
share,  as  determined  by the fund.  In  contrast,  SPDRs are not  offered  for
purchase or redeemed for cash at a fixed relationship to closing NAV. The tables
below  illustrate the  distribution  relationship of SPDRs closing prices to NAV
for the  period  1/29/93  (the first  trading  date of the SPDR  Trust)  through
12/31/02,  the  distribution  relationships of high, low and closing prices over
the same period,  and  distribution  of bid/asked  spreads for 2002.  This table
should help investors evaluate some of the advantages and disadvantages of SPDRs
relative  to  funds  sold  and  redeemed  at  prices  related  to  closing  NAV.
Specifically, the table illustrates in an approximate way the risks of buying or
selling SPDRs at prices less  favorable  than closing NAV and,  correspondingly,
the opportunities to buy or sell at prices more favorable than closing NAV.

     The  investor  may wish to evaluate  the  opportunity  to buy or sell on an
intraday  basis versus the assurance of a  transaction  at or related to closing
NAV. To assist  investors in making this comparison,  the table  illustrates the
distribution  of percentage  ranges  between the high and the low price each day
and between  each  extreme  daily value and the closing NAV for all trading days
from 1/29/93  through  12/31/02.  The investor may wish to compare  these ranges
with the average bid/asked spread on SPDRs and add any commissions  charged by a
broker.  The trading  ranges for this period will not  necessarily be typical of
trading ranges in future years and the bid/asked spread on SPDRs may vary

                                       65
<page>

materially  over time and may be  significantly  greater at times in the future.
There is some  evidence,  for example,  that the bid/asked  spread will widen in
markets  that are more  volatile  and narrow  when  markets  are less  volatile.
Consequently,   the  investor  should  expect  wider  bid/asked  spreads  to  be
associated with wider daily spread ranges.

     Information  relating to the  relative  price  performance  of SPDRs may be
compared  against a wide variety of  investment  categories  and asset  classes,
including common stocks, small capitalization stocks, long and intermediate term
corporate and government  bonds,  Treasury  bills,  the rate of inflation in the
United States (based on the Consumer  Price Index ("CPI")) and  combinations  of
various capital markets.  Historical  returns of these and other capital markets
in the United  States may be provided  by  independent  statistical  studies and
sources, such as those provided by Ibbotson Associates of Chicago, Illinois. The
performance  of these  capital  markets  is based on the  returns  of  different
indices.  Information  may be presented using the performance of these and other
capital markets to demonstrate general investment  strategies.  So, for example,
performance  of SPDRs may be  compared  to the  performance  of  selected  asset
classes such as short-term U.S.  Treasury bills,  long-term U.S. Treasury bonds,
long-term corporate bonds,  mid-capitalization  stocks, foreign stocks and small
capitalization  stocks and may also be measured against the rate of inflation as
set forth in well-known indices (such as the CPI).  Performance  comparisons may
also  include the value of a  hypothetical  investment  in any of these  capital
markets.  Performance  of SPDRs may also be compared to that of other indices or
compilations that may be developed and made available to the investing public in
the future.  Of course,  such  comparisons will only reflect past performance of
SPDRs and the  investment  categories,  indices  or  compilations  chosen and no
guarantees  can be made of future  results  regarding the  performance of either
SPDRs or the asset classes chosen for such comparisons.
